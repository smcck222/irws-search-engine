FT  31 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Madrid tries to stem flow of
foreign funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MADRID bourse is considering ways of introducing marketmaking into the
Spanish equity market in an effort to stop a slow draining of foreign
investment towards more liquid European markets.
Mr Antonio Zoido, president of the Madrid Stock Exchange, has said the
possibility of creating marketmakers in Spain has already been put,
informally, to the national stock market commission (CNMV).
The introduction of marketmaking into Madrid would require a potentially
lengthy change of stock market law or it could be achieved more rapidly
through a royal decree.
Spain's stock markets have already been through a gruelling reform process
in the past four years, but this has concentrated mostly on offering greater
transparency and security to investors.
The Madrid market, the fourth largest in Europe in terms of capitalisation,
still suffers from liquidity problems, however.
Large foreign institutional investors tend to buy in a narrow range of
Spanish stocks, mainly banks and utilities, which guarantee them a quick
exit should it be necessary.
Spain's brokers, who fight low key wars to undercut each other on
commissions, are also victims of investor concentration on a limited number
of liquid stocks.
Brokers have in the past tried to create business for themselves by
occasionally buying large stakes in companies with a view to turning them
round and selling them on the markets. But these schemes, as well as a rash
of flotations in recent years, have delivered disappointing results, with
many new entrants to the market now trading well below their launch prices.
Foreign investors, either brokers or final clients, have quickly seen the
ease with which Spanish brokers can be squeezed.
'Whether marketmaking is good or bad is not the point,' said Mr Frederick
Artesani, chief of equity research and sales with Benito y Monjardin in
Madrid.
'The point is that marketmaking is inevitable.'
With the Madrid market well down on the year, some larger Madrid brokers
have already begun to provide unofficial marketmaking services to big
foreign clients in an effort to hold on to business.

FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Cerus to bail out banking
subsidiary

<TEXT>
CERUS, the French investment company linked to Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the
troubled Italian industrialist, has been forced to bail out Banque Dumenil
Leble, its banking arm, as part of a FFr430m (Dollars 96.5m) rescue package.
Dumenil has been in trouble for some time. It has suffered, like other
French banks, from the problems of the property sector. It has also been
affected by internal problems which resulted in the closure of its Swiss
operation.
Cerus, which recently reported a first-half loss of FFr377m, has already
been forced to provide extra capital for Dumenil. The bank lost FFr492m in
the first half after making provisions of FFr540m for its property losses
and the Swiss closure.
However Dumenil now needs additional capital of FFr430m to avoid breaching
its banking ratios. Cerus, which directly holds 25.6 per cent of Dumenil and
holds the rest through Societe Financiere de Geneve - a Swiss-based bank it
controls - is providing FFr221m. The rest is coming from Societe Financiere
de Geneve.
The reorganisation of the Lagardere family interests was finalised yesterday
when shareholders of MMB, the French family's master company, approved plans
to change the share structure and to change the name to the Lagardere group.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Kenya in crisis as opposition threatens to quit poll process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KENYA WAS thrown into a political crisis last night as two opposition
parties, alleging foul play by the government, threatened to pull out of the
electoral process and international observers prepared to criticise strongly
the conduct of the polls.
Mr Mwai Kibaki, leader of the Democratic party, and Mr Jaramogi Oginga
Odinga, leader of Ford-Kenya, were meeting last night to consider calling
the election null and void after what they alleged were 'widespread
irregularities and vote-rigging' which they said were 'fast pushing the
nation to war'.
Both parties demanded, as a minimum, the suspension of counting and a re-run
of what they said were spoiled polls in many constituencies.
Mr Lee Kanyaro, spokesman for the DP, said the two parties had a list of
demands to be met within 48 hours or they would withdraw from the electoral
process. 'We do not believe in the results being released. It is a
fraudulent election.'
The 38-member Commonwealth observers' group was last night in emergency
session considering whether the electoral abuses they had witnessed were
sufficient grounds for declaring the polls neither free nor fair.
Such a decision would weigh heavily with donor countries, which a year ago
froze aid to Kenya pending political and economic reform. A continuing
freeze of aid, which has so far cost Kenya Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m
(Pounds 230m-Pounds 263m), would have a severe impact on an economy already
hamstrung by a foreign exchange shortage.
The moves came as it became apparent from provisional returns from 51 of 188
constituencies that President Daniel arap Moi and his Kanu party were
heading for a victory.
The prospect of a formal opposition protest, in effect endorsed by
international observers, is certain to raise tensions in an already fraught
political climate.
Violence has marred the election campaign and the opposition parties have
consistently warned that Mr Moi risked provoking violence if he manipulated
the elections. At least two people have been killed and several injured in
the past two days.
A delay in releasing results from opposition strongholds such as Nairobi and
several incidences where additional ballot papers appeared to have been
slipped into bundles during counting underlined observer and opposition
suspicions that officials were tampering with the result.
Ford-Kenya alleged malpractices across the country while the DP said in a
statement that it 'wants to put to question the integrity of Moi, the
presiding and returning officers and indeed the validity and motivation of
holding any elections at all. It is apparent that Moi is fast pushing this
nation to war'.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Divided opposition hands victory to Moi: Whole tribes come
out against ruling party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY returns from Kenya's elections showed yesterday the country had voted
on divisive tribal lines with President Daniel arap Moi heading for victory
on a minority of the vote because of a split among opposition supporters
among three main challengers.
For the first time in Kenya's history, however, yesterday's provisional
results revealed the extent of the unpopularity of the ruling party Kanu and
the solid opposition of several provinces and tribes to the continued rule
of Mr Moi.
The results also showed that the opposition would have swept to power if it
had agreed an electoral pact and united behind one presidential candidate
instead of fragmenting into different parties based on tribalism and
personal greed for power.
Political observers said last night that Mr Moi faced a considerable
challenge in trying to rule a divided Kenya.
With results in the presidential race announced in 51 of 188 constituencies
by last night Mr Moi had won 600,377 (48 per cent) out of 1.2m votes
counted.
Mr Moi's lead was artificially inflated by the early declaration of many
results from his power base of Rift Valley province. Mr Kenneth Matiba, the
presidential candidate of Ford-Asili, was leading the race for second place
with 359,345 votes (29 per cent), well ahead of seven other contenders.
In the eight constituencies of the Rift Valley, a Kanu heartland and home to
Mr Moi's Kalenjin people and other pastoralist minority tribes, which had
declared results by last night Mr Moi had won more than 93 per cent of the
presidential vote.
He was also drawing strong support from Coast province and from Northeastern
province, which has been closed off to opposition activity by the
government.
In Western province Mr Moi was in second place behind Mr Matiba with four
results declared.
In the Coast, however, the first results from the provincial capital of
Mombasa town in Changamwe constituency showed a large vote for Jaramogi
Oginga Odinga, Presidential candidate of Ford-Kenya, reflecting the
influence of the banned Islamic Party of Kenya which did an electoral pact
with Ford-Kenya. The IPK was expected to continue to have a favourable
impact on votes for Ford-Kenya in Kwale and Mombasa districts of Coast
province as more results are announced.
Ford Kenya was last night sweeping three of the four districts of Nyanza
province, the homeland of Mr Odinga's Luo tribe. Other opposition parties,
led by Mr Matiba, were also hammering Mr Moi and Kanu in Central and Nairobi
provinces, homeland of the powerful and disenchanted Kikuyu tribe.
In the five of 30 constituencies which had declared presidential results by
last night Mr Moi had won a mere 3 per cent. Mr Matiba led the presidential
race in Nairobi and Central provinces led with nearly 75 per cent of the
vote.
'Moi is going to face a crisis of governability after the elections because
it is impossible to rule Kenya without the Kikuyu and the Kikuyu have now
declared forcefully they are completely in opposition to Moi,' said Mr David
Throup, a Kenya specialist at Keele University who observed the elections.

FT  31 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Confidence checked in higher volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market yesterday displayed a mirror image of its previous
session, sliding lower in modest trading as the outlook on both the domestic
and US economies appeared less dramatic. Trading volume increased as the
equity market gave ground, while stock index futures played a less
aggressive role in the underlying stock market.
The UK market was disappointed by Wall Street's fall overnight, as the rise
in US consumer confidence and an initial dip in London stocks found no
succour this time from stock index futures. Share prices were soon on the
drift and the FT-SE was 18.5 off at the day's low.
Although there was little encouragement either from stock index futures or
from Wall Street, a mere 6 Dow points up in London hours, following less
decisive pointers from the November index of leading US economic indicators,
the Footsie staged a modest rally.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,832.5, a fall of 15.3 on the
day. Similar fortunes were suffered by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, down 4.9 at
2,856.4, and the FT-SE-A 350, which was 6.4 off at 1,382.5.
The immediate reasons behind yesterday's fall were not difficult to
identify. Weakness in the New York market was one, but a significant factor
was the disclosure of further tensions in Britain's high streets, after J.
Sainsbury, a leading food supermarket group, said it was slashing prices by
25-50 per cent.
The news threw a cloud over this week's reports of increased spending in
post-Christmas store sales, but most analysts maintained that Sainsbury's
move should be seen merely in terms of competition in the domestic market.
But some analysts pointed to the downturn in food retailers and to the rise
in Seaq-reported volume to 494.9m shares from the 287.1m of the previous
session; equity business on Tuesday was worth only Pounds 636.1m, around
half of recent daily average totals.
The fall in the UK equity market yesterday increased nervousness ahead of
the return to full trading at the beginning of next week. Many analysts fear
that the present run in share prices could be severely tested by rights
issues in the new year.

FT  31 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Price war fears hit Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD retail shares fell sharply, pulling the market down in their wake,
after supermarket group Sainsbury said it would launch an aggressive package
of price cuts in the New Year. The announcement immediately raised fears
that a damaging food price war could follow and dent prospects in the food
retail sector. Tesco, the rival food supermarket group, is expected to
announce its response to the Sainsbury move either today, or early next
week.
Although rounds of price promotions are expected at this time of year to
compensate for flat new year trading, yesterday's move by Sainsbury was
viewed in the market as putting further pressure on Tesco, which has used
improved margins to offset lower sales growth and enhance earnings.
Mr Nick Bubb at Morgan Stanley said that with the food retail sector at a
five-year relative high against the stock market, some investors were
already looking for an excuse to take profits. He added: 'This is a clever
pre-emptive strike by Sainsbury, which can afford to take risks, and Tesco
margins will be put under more pressure.' He believes that the price war
talk will continue to affect sentiment and is advising clients to go
underweight in the sector, with shares likely to come off a further 5-10 per
cent.
At Henderson Crosthwaite, Mr Bill Myers said that short-term weakness would
be counterbalanced by selective buying at the discounted levels, with
Sainsbury and Argyll prices likely to be restored prior to yesterday's
levels. Argyll closed at 398p, a fall of 22, Kwik Save at 784p, down by the
same amount, Sainsbury at 561p, off 16, and Tesco the same at 251p.
Pentos setback
A profits warning from Pentos, the high street retailer which owns the
Rymans and Athena chains, sent the shares crashing and, along with the
Sainsbury announcement, took the shine off the gains made among retail
stocks on Tuesday. Pentos said that pre-tax profits for the year ending
December 1992 would be 'significantly below market expectations.' It blamed
disappointing trading at Athena and its Pentos Office Furniture outlets, as
well as reorganisation costs. The shares closed 16 down at 56p.
Analysts quickly moved to chop forecasts. County NatWest moved from Pounds
17m to Pounds 6m, while Kleinwort Benson expected to change from Pounds
13.5m to Pounds 5m. Mr John Richards at County said that the bad news was
probably all in the share price now, but that any recovery would take some
time. He also said that hints that books may be included in changes to VAT
in the Budget in March could also cast a cloud over the shares. There were
also criticisms from analysts over the company's accounting policy.
The Pentos warning was behind the fall in WH Smith, even though Pentos said
its Dillons chain was trading 'satisfactorily'. Smith 'A' shares retreated
10 to 500p. J Menzies fell 4 to 457p, although Pentos said Rymans was also
performing as expected.
Marks and Spencer lost 4 to 328p on the back of the Sainsbury announcement.
Food sales are an increasingly larger part of the company's revenues.
Acquisition talk once again circled Kingfisher, helping the shares rise 6 to
589p.
Sainsbury also helped drag food manufacturers down as analysts predicted a
tough first quarter, the sector being squeezed between higher raw material
costs and price cutting retailers. Cadbury-Schweppes tumbled 9 to 439p,
Northern Foods 8 to 265p and United Biscuits 11 to 352p.
The recovery in British Aerospace continued with renewed hints that a new
Hawk aircraft order could be in the offing from the Indonesian government.
The shares lifted 6 to 167p. Elsewhere, motor industry groups were strong,
sentiment lifted by bullish statements from Vauxhall. Component manufacturer
GKN rose 4 to 448p, while distributors Evans Halshaw added 3 to 205p and
Pendragon 3 to 236p.
Buoyant holiday bookings again lifted Airtours, shares in the tour operator
ahead 15 at 300p. Sentiment was also helped by rumours that some
institutional shareholders at Airtours rival Owners Abroad are unhappy about
the latter's tie-up with German travel group LTU and may vote against it at
the EGM on 8 January. If true, this could encourage renewed interest from
Airtours, which is thought to have held exploratory talks with Owners in the
summer. Owners shares raced forward 7 to 94p.
Old talk that Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, was eyeing the smaller
Mount Charlotte concern gave some investors the excuse to take profits and
the shares fell 2 to 45p.
House builders at last took some comfort from the recovery talk and made
gains. Among them, Bellway added 13 to 311p, Henry Boot 5 to 230p, and
Countryside Properties 3 to 93p.
Trading in derivatives remained slack yesterday, and traders stressed that
increased business in the March stock index future contract still left the
total well below average levels. The contract closed at a premium of around
12 points above its fair value reading of 12 above cash, allowing for the
dividend and financing flows imposed on holders of the underlying blue chip
stocks.
Traders said that most of the business came from speculative sources,
including such few locals, or independent traders, as were still to be found
in the City of London ahead of the new year break. The big institutions have
largely completed their activities for this year, and the securities houses
are no longer interested in taking positions ahead of the extended holiday
weekend.
Turnover in traded options rose to 21,718 contracts from the 10,619 of the
previous session, with the FT-SE contract recording 8,801 against 3,288.
Among individual contracts, Asda recorded 3,684, reflecting unease in the
food retail sector. Grand Metropolitan followed with 2,209 and Lonrho
recorded 738 contracts.

FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finishes flat after
morning rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITY prices finished nearly flat yesterday afternoon after a brief
morning rally ebbed in dull pre-holiday trading, with traders disregarding
the day's economic statistics in favor of year-end portfolio adjustments,
writes Laurie Morse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 10.27 at
3,321.11 on volume of 185m shares. Advancing issues led decliners by 1,049
to 763. The Dow took some support from gains in IBM and Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing, two blue chip stocks which recovered slightly after being
battered early in the week.
IBM closed  3/8 igher at 50 1/8 and 3M was up  1/4 at 100 3/8 . IBM was the
second most active stock of the day, rallying on news it had won a Dollars
3bn 10-year contract to provide information services to defense contractor
McDonnell Douglas. On Tuesday the Dow had closed down 22.42 points at
3,310.84. Among broader market measures, the Standard and Poors 500 index
rose 0.83 to 438.81, the American Stock Exchange composite rose 1.92 to
395.75 and the Nasdaq composite was up 2.84 to close at a record 671.85.
News that the Chicago Purchasing Managers' survey of US economic conditions
rose to an adjusted 59.8 in December, from 54 in November, forshadowed a
bullish national report next week, and underscored traders expectations for
a gradually improving US economy. The survey is used as a barometer of
business confidence, and any reading above 50 generally indicates an
expanding economy. 'This is all very good news, so long as it doesn't get
too good,' said Mr. Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential
Securities. 'If it gets too good, it will make bond yields go up, and that
will make stock prices go down.'
The US November index of leading economic indicators underscored the
slow-but-steady growth scenario for the stock market. The index rose 0.8 of
a percentage point in the month, a slightly stronger gain than forecast.
Glaxo Holdings American depositary receipts was the most active issue on the
New York Stock Exchange, with investors scurrying to buy the shares
following news Tuesday that it had received approval to market its new
anti-migrane drug in the US. The stock finished up  5/8 8 at 23 7/8 . Merck,
another pharmaceutical company that received approval for its Taxol
cancer-fighting drug, failed to take support from the news Tuesday and was
down  1/8 at 44 in active trading. Citicorp was up  7/8 at 21 5/8 in active
trading. Canada
TORONTO STOCKS ended up in sluggish dealings ahead of the New Year,
bolstered by gains on Wall Street.
Traders said activity may remain lackluster until next week. Junior miner
Sikamen Gold, buoyed by a recent Canadian diamond find in Central Africa,
led actives.
The TSE-300 composite index rose 12 points or 0.36 per cent to 3,326.8 on
volume of 30m shares valued at CDollars 190 million, compared to 41m shares
on Tuesday. Advancing issues led declines 315 to 239 with 262 unchanged.
Other actives included Laidlaw's class B shares which rose  3/8 to 11 7/8 ,
bolstering the TSE's transportation group.

FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent winds down for the
New Year holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY was limited, with most bourses seeing the last trading day before
the new year, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT investors continued to close their books for 1992, with distinct
contrasts in some sectors as professionals decided what the closing price of
the year should be, and manipulated the final deals accordingly.
As the DAX index ended 2.82 higher at 1,545.05, a couple of percentage
points down on the year, the main talking points included a drop in Daimler
just before the closing bell, leaving it just 50 pfg higher at DM537. Its
own Mercedes subsidiary closed DM6.50 higher at DM408.50. In retailing,
Karstadt went the other way with a sudden closing gain of DM15 to DM500.
Turnover rose from DM2.9bn to DM3.8bn, and there was some reaction to news.
In insurers, AMB fell DM20 to DM750 on Fondiaria's opposition to moves
affecting its AMB stake; and while Commerzbank hardly moved on its upcoming
rights issue, Deutsche Bank fell DM6.50 to DM647 on the thought that it,
too, might have some fundraising in the pipeline.
PARIS eased in dull activity and the CAC-40 index closed 11.51 lower at
1,858.77, just off the day's low of 1,856.71. Turnover was FFr1.4bn after
Tuesday's FFr2bn.
There remained some interest in Hachette after Tuesday's approval of the
merdia group's merger with Matra, the electronics concern. Hachette was
FFr2.80 stronger at FFr89.50 while Matra was unchanged at FFr194.
Financials weakened, with SocGen down FFr4 to FFr611 and Paribas losing
FFr6.9 to FFr359.0. Elsewhere, Eurotunnel lost FFr1 to FFr28.20 and BSN shed
FFr21 to FFr943.
AMSTERDAM entered the long weekend slightly weaker although there was good
activity in Begemann, up Fl 4 to Fl 84, on news that the industrial group
had sold its pipe coating division for Fl 360m. The CBS Tendency index
closed 0.2 lower at 106.3 after a day's high of 106.6 and a low of 105.9.
Ahold lost 50 cents to Fl 87.80 after announcing that it had signed a letter
of intent to purchase a Dutch confectionery chain from Goudsmit, up Fl 8.50
to Fl 30.50.
MILAN lost earlier gains as Sip, the telecommunications company, slipped L15
to L1,500 in late trading. The telecommunications company had traded earlier
as high as L1,573, and its fall came after Italy's Pricing Committee agreed
to a tariff restructuring for the telephone business - but not until 1994.
Other shares in the telecommunications sector also lost ground, affecting
the mood of the whole market as the Comit index closed only 2.15 higher at
451.18. Fiat rose 4.9 per cent to settle at L4,145, but then fell to L4,040
on the kerb.
MADRID was helped by some institutional buying in thin trading and the
general index gained 0.20 to 215.12. Santander recovered some of its earlier
loses with a rise of Pta145 to Pta4,300.
VIENNA weakened as Lenzig retreated a further Sch29 or 4.6 per cent to
Sch595 on Tuesday's news that it would cut the 1992 dividend. The ATX index
eased 1.73 to 747.70.
STOCKHOLM ended little changed after late profit-taking eroded early gains.
The Affarsvarlden index lost 1.1 to 912.6 in turnover of SKr401m.
Astra continued to decline with the A shares losing SKr5 to SKr735 and the B
shares slipping SKr7 to SKr723.

OSLO was firmer with Elkem free shares rising NKr5 to NKr28 as the all-share
index gained 2.11 to 372.12 in turnover of NKr221.3m.
ISTANBUL was encouraged by news that agreement had been reached in the
private metal sector between unions and employers over a pay claim, thereby
averting a threatened strike. The 75-share index closed up 38.91 at
3,955.53, in turnover of TL168bn. Among the actives Akal, the textile group,
rose TL150 to TL3,550.

FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines
by 2.1 per cent
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO fell back sharply in the final session of the year, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
The 225-share Nikkei average closed down 360.69, or 2.1 per cent at
16,924.95 on index-linked selling after a day's high of 17,254.04 and a
day's low of 16,891.94. The market will remain closed until January 4.
Turnover was about 90m shares traded compared to 130m on Tuesday.
Declining issues outpaced advancing by seven to two, with 698 lower, 193
higher and 187 unchanged in volume of some 90m shares.
The broader first section Topix index lost 18.72 or 1.4 per cent to 1,307.66
and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.01 to 1,066.65.
The market opened at its morning high, succumbing immediately to
futures-linked selling. Disappointment that a hoped-for year-end rally had
failed to materialise, combined with overnight losses on Wall Street, also
weighed on sentiment, brokers said.
'Some people clung to the hope that US pension fund money might kick in
during the morning, and when this didn't happen they just gave up,' one
broker commented.
High technology issues were mostly lower with NEC falling Y6 to Y681,
Fujitsu Y9 to Y550 and Pioneer Y100 to Y2,670.
In the banking sector Daiichi slipped Y80 to Y1,670, Sakura Y60 to Y1,200,
Sumitomo Y40 to Y1,810 and Fuji Y70 to Y1,800.
Isuzu bucked the trend, extending recent gains to end up Y14 at Y332. Large
capital issues were down on profit-taking: Nippon Steel shed Y2 to Y292 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Y15 to Y530.
The second section index advanced 3.23 to 1,730.65, with 2.4m shares traded.
Roundup
THE region was generally dull yesterday with both Seoul and Taiwan closed
until January 4.
HONG KONG was featureless in slow trade. The Hang Seng index gained 23.76 to
5,467.89 in low turnover of HKDollars 1.3bn.
Investors concentrated on banks and utilities with HSBC Holdings gaining 50
cents to HKDollars 55, Hang Seng Bank rising HKDollars 1.00 to HK52.50 and
Bank of East Asia firming 25 cents to HKDollars 34.
AUSTRALIA lost ground slightly, although news earlier in the week that BHP
had signed a contract to develop an oilfield off the south coast of Vietnam
helped to lift sentiment. The All Ordinaries index slipped 0.8 to 1,538.2 in
turnover of ADollars 138.8m.
BHP rose 4 cents to ADollars 13.28.
In the banking sector ANZ put on 5 cents to ADollars 3.01, National
Australia advanced 1 cent to ADollars 7.52 and Commonwealth improved 3 cents
to ADollars 6.04. Westpac added 2 cents to ADollars 3.24 on news that it had
completed the sale of the Network Ten television group to a consortium led
by CanWest Global Communications of Canada.
NEW ZEALAND rose with strong interest in Brierley Investments which gained 1
cent to NZDollars 1.04 in volume of 2m shares. The NZSE-40 index advanced
6.53 to 1,564.04, but off the day's high of 1,570.38, in turnover of some
NZDollars 18m.
Fletcher Challenge went against the trend losing 5 cents to NZDollars 2.47
while Telecom rose 4 cents to NZDollars 2.45 and Carter Holt 1 cent to
NZDollars 2.75.
MANILA was lifted by another good overnight performance from Philippine Long
Distance Telephone in New York. The composite index firmed 15.21 to 1,256.22
in combined turnover of 408m pesos.
PLDT rose 25 pesos to 870 pesos while Philippine National Bank closed 5
pesos higher at 230 pesos.
SINGAPORE was firmer on blue chips and good economic data. The Straits Times
Industrial Index rose 6.46 to 1,512.46 in volume of 53.5m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR saw light trading continuing as the composite index dipped 0.29
to 642.66 in turnover of some MDollars 118m.
BANGKOK's SET index gained 5.22 to 893.42 in turnover of Bt7.5bn.

FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Belgian cyclicals wait for economic
recovery - Currency strength has helped Brussels produce a respectable
performance in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts of the Belgian stock market have been prophesying the end of the
downturn for a long time, and forecasting that when the European economy
lifts itself out of the doldrums the Brussels bourse, with its heavy
emphasis on cyclical, industrial stocks, will be one of the main
beneficiaries.
Certainly, the cyclicals have suffered over the past three years. A recent
study from the National Bank of Belgium indicated that profits at the
largest Belgian companies slumped in 1991 to their lowest level since 1987.
Industrial manufacturing has been the worst-hit sector over the last two
years.
Under the circumstances, the Belgian stock market has not performed badly
during 1992. The Bel-20 weighted index of the 20 largest stocks began the
year at 1,092.72 amid hopes of German interest rate cuts and of a slow
revival of industrial profitability. Neither hope was realised and the
market registered a 1992 low of 1,046.07 at the beginning of September.
But the Bel-20 has surprised the pessimists. By last night it was marginally
up on January at 1,127.02. In absolute terms, and by comparison with other
small European stock markets, that is pretty respectable.
Brokers say that investors have gone for the defensive attractions of the
Belgian market during 1992. Since September, Brussels has benefited from the
stability of the Belgian franc, while other European currencies have lost
their way in the exchange rate mechanism, or dropped out altogether.
In addition, once the prospect of widespread cuts in interest rates
evaporated, buyers have sought out the stocks which benefit from continued
tight monetary policy, such as Electrabel, the high-yielding Belgian utility
which is one of the country's largest companies, and the three big banks.
In the first quarter, the market's three main retailers - GIB Group, Colruyt
and Delhaize 'Le Lion' - also had their attractions.
The stocks were spurred on by optimistic company announcements and the
potential, particularly in GIB's case, for further modernisation of its
chain of supermarkets. Since then, gloom has set in, especially at Delhaize
which has been at the receiving end of a particularly vociferous campaign by
unions in the US, prompted by allegations that the group's Food Lion
subsidiary conducts an 'anti-union' policy.
Some analysts believe that investors have overdone the caution - cutting the
price of Delhaize shares from BFr1,940 in April to BFr1,288 yesterday - but
the slide in one of the bourse's most heavily traded stocks has taken the
shine off the market's performance.
The other principal disappointment of 1992 has been Petrofina, the oil and
gas company, which seemed impervious to criticism until recently.
This year, however, the Petrofina 'sacred cow' was slaughtered when the
group announced poor figures. Earlier this month, for example, Petrofina
forecast poor full-year figures and a halving of its dividend, the first cut
for more than 20 years.
In addition, uncertainty about the future of the Norwegian Ekofisk field, in
which the group has a 30 per cent stake, has cast a cloud over the shares.
They have dropped from a peak of BFr11,750 in May to today's level of
BFr,7,510
Next year, the full effect of 1992 will be seen in Belgian company results
over the first six months. In addition, Ms Alison Kirk, Belgian equities
analyst with Williams de Broe in London, points out that the economic and
corporate forecasts from Germany, on which Belgium relies increasingly for
both trade and interest-rate policy, are almost uniformly gloomy; that is
bound to be reflected in Belgium.
As if predicting another year of retrenchment, the exchange has just
reshuffled the components of the Bel-20 index for the first time since its
launch in March 1991.
The intention is partly to prepare for the introduction of Bel-20
derivatives on Belfox, the fledgling futures and options market, in the New
Year, but the result is to give the index a more defensive feel. For
example, in come two of the big banks, Banque Bruxelles Lambert and
Kredietbank, and out go two chemicals stocks, Recticel and Tessenderlo.
But although caution looks like being the watchword of the Brussels bourse
in 1993, some analysts believe that the most prudent industrial companies,
which have taken advantage of the downturn to restructure, may be poised for
a small recovery.
"We'll certainly suffer from the weakness of the German economy. But if you
look to the Brussels stock exchange we also have a few industrial companies
which are well-linked to the dollar and could benefit from a recovery next
year,' says Mr Marc Janssens of Petercam, the Brussels broker.
Barco, the electronics group, Union Miniere, the metals company, Delhaize
and Bekaert, the steel wire producer, are all possible beneficiaries of a
transatlantic upturn.
As for the exchange itself, the bourse authorities and its members are
preparing for a further shake-up following the 1990 reforms. They intend to
bring in a British-style market-making system by 1996, in line with EC
securities legislation. That may help some of the volume and liquidity
problems which have dogged the bourse, but, as one analyst puts it:
'(Brussels) is always going to be small and illiquid, because it's a small
country with very few multinationals. To me, it's a question of trying to
make the best of what it's got.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling futures yesterday continued the rally of recent days as
dealers expected another cut in UK base rates by the spring, writes James
Blitz.
Despite increasing signs of an upturn in the UK economy, the market
continues to think that the British government will be forced to ease
monetary policy again.
On Tuesday, the Institute of Directors found that the proportion of business
leaders who were more optimistic about the economy compared with six months
ago increased to 38 per cent last month from 10 per cent in October.
However the IoD carefully added that the chancellor should announce a
further cut in interest rates to help improve the situation.
Two other factors added to bullish sentiment yesterday. First, was growing
speculation of a rise in taxes or other imposts at the time of the March
budget, which would be offset by a cut in interest rates.
The Bank of England also issued a further Pounds 1bn of 7 1/4 per cent
Treasury stock due in 1998. Dealers have traditionally seen the issue of
short-dated gilts as a precursor to a base rate cut.
However, analysts who follow the Bank of England warned yesterday that the
authorities had only issued this new tranche for technical reasons, notably
that existing stock was well bid and in short supply.
These factors helped to push the March short sterling contract up 13 basis
points to a high of 93.55, although it later fell back to close at 93.52. At
this level, it prices 3-month money at 6.48 per cent in the spring of next
year.
As ever, cash rates failed to reflect the excitement of futures. The 3-month
rate closed unchanged at 7 1/16 per cent. The overnight rate was as high as
9 per cent in the afternoon, mainly because the Bank of England revised its
forecast shortage upwards from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.6bn in the
afternoon. Late assistance was Pounds 430m.
German call money was quoted at around 8.80 per cent yesterday, although
there were reports of wild swings in rates to as much as 9.50 per cent. The
fluctuations were attributed to last-minute position taking before the end
of the year.
Euromark futures were slightly weaker. The March contract closed at 92.23
after peaking earlier in the day at 92.32.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Growing worries on Irish punt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR failed to make new headway against the D-Mark and sterling
yesterday, although the underlying tone for the US currency remains bullish
into the new year, writes James Blitz.
After peaking at DM1.6235 in Tuesday's trading, the dollar yesterday closed
unchanged on the day at DM1.6140. Sterling also managed to gain some lost
ground against the dollar, peaking at around Dollars 1.5150 in European
trading. But it later fell back to close slightly weaker on the day at
Dollars 1.5125.
With the approach of new year, the dollar was never likely to make much more
headway because of thin trading in markets. Many European centres, including
Germany, Belgium and Denmark, are closed today for the traditional holiday.
Thin trading was also cited as a reason why the dollar failed to gain
yesterday from another good set of US indicators. The currency was
unaffected by the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, which rose to 59.75
per cent in December from 54.2 per cent the previous month. US leading
indicators also rose by 0.8 per cent in November after a revised 0.5 per
cent gain in October.
The end of the dollar rally partly explains the D-Mark's firmer performance
inside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism yesterday. The German currency
was helped by comments on Tuesday night from Mr Lothar Muller, a member of
the Bundesbank council, who said that short-term German rates were unlikely
to come down until the country's performance on inflation allowed them to do
so.
The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.410
from a previous FFr3.404. Operators continue to believe that there will be
active speculation against the French franc early in 1993 unless German
monetary policy eases significantly. The French bank, Societe Generale, was
quoted as saying that the franc would be fragile in the first quarter of
1993.
The Irish punt continued to languish at the bottom of the ERM grid. It
remained weak against the Belgian franc, at BFr54.10, compared to a floor of
BFr54.025.
There was speculation in markets yesterday that the Irish authorities may
abandon plans to abolish exchange controls today in line with the European
Community's Single Market programme. However, an official at the Central
Bank of Ireland confirmed yesterday that the move would be removed. Mr Steve
Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes there could be
heavy speculation against the Irish punt from Monday, and that a devaluation
as early as the following weekend cannot be ruled out.
However, Mr Nick Hunt, head of foreign exchange at the Bank of Ireland in
Dublin, said the currency would not fall victim to huge selling because the
Irish punt market remains fairly illiquid.

FT  31 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas and new year holidays inevitably keep the market at a virtual
standstill. There are no wool sales and most textile producers are closed in
the UK till next week. A subdued close to the wool selling season in
Australia provided no incentive to trade buyers at the manufacturing end of
the industry, though early reports do indicate encouraging consumer demand
for clothing over the important Christmas season. Currency markets are not
fully tested but further strength in the US dollar is already a feature and
enhances wool costs in many wool-using countries.

COFFEE futures came under heavy pressure at the London Futures and Options
Exchange yesterday in to continued speculative and investment fund
liquidation in New York. The March delivery position ended Dollars 25 down
at Dollars 1,010 a tonne and dealers said there might be scope for further
losses in the short term. But they thought the market's constructive
fundamentals would prompt a recovery in the new year. COCOA prices were also
lower but the market remained near the upper end of its recent trading
range. As the March futures price closed Pounds 5 lower at Pounds 693 a
tonne dealers said that it continued to run into upside resistance in the
Pounds 700 area, while key support remained at Pounds 657. Trading remained
routine at the London Metal Exchange. NICKEL recovered Tuesday's slippage
but was unable to erode resistance above Dollars 5,900 a tonne for three
months metal. LEAD lacked follow through to Tuesday's advance and the three
months price fell Pounds 5.25 to Pounds 300.75 a tonne.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally eases as Bank plans issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied further yesterday as the cash market rose by up
to half a point and caught up with the gains made by gilts futures on
Tuesday.
However, news that the Bank of England is issuing a further Pounds 1bn of
stock helped erode some of the gains later in the day.
The Bank is issuing a Pounds 1bn tranche of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock
due 1998, with a further Pounds 100m of the bonds issued to the National
Debt Commissioners. This will increase the total size of the issue to Pounds
2.1bn. The bonds, which are partly paid, are being offered at 25 29/32 .
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as professional traders took profits
after Tuesday's advance and were light buyers of shorter-term securities. In
the last full trading session of 1992 many dealers were on the sidelines,
with traders willing to wait until the new year to set new positions.
At mid-afternoon the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  1/4 lower at
102 29/32 , yielding 7.377 per cent. Among shorter-dated maturities, the
two-year note rose  3/32 to yield 4.526 per cent. The Federal funds rate
dipped to 2 1/2 per cent, with the Fed refraining from market intervention.
Two-year notes took mild support from news that US new home sales in
November fell 8.3 per cent. The weakness in the housing sector was
unexpected, and was contrary to forecasts of a 0.4 per cent advance.
SPANISH government bonds ended lower after the Treasury allocated a
larger-than-expected amount of paper at yesterday's bond auction. Yields on
three, five and 10-year paper were slightly higher than those last set at
the October 29 auction.
The October auction was the first for medium and long-term paper at which
bids had been accepted since last May due to the turmoil caused by Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht Treaty.
GERMAN government bonds drifted lower in thin trade with most attention
focusing on yesterday's auction of Federal bonds. The DTB March future on
long bunds slipped to 92.00 by late afternoon against Tuesday's close of
92.12.
Dealers were surprised by the large amount raised at the auction. A total of
DM12bn of bonds was issued, whereas dealers had expected only DM10bn. Bids
of 99.71 and above were accepted at the auction.
Elsewhere in Europe, French government bonds fell due to the weakness of the
franc against the D-Mark.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied strongly yesterday, prompted by a sharp
fall in the Tokyo stock market which reignited hopes that the Bank of Japan
would lower interest rates.
The futures contract rose to a high of 108.39 before ending the half-day of
trading at 108.35.

FT  31 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Spain may see short-term debt
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLAN to invest the Bank of Spain with greater autonomy and put an end to
the Treasury's ability to borrow from the central bank in order to meet
short-term funding needs is likely to encourage the issuance of short-term
debt in preference to longer-dated bonds in the immediate future, according
to European bond analysts.
In the past, the government would borrow from the central bank and then
spread its debt issuance over the year. In theory it can still do so in 1993
as the autonomy statute announced on Tuesday - and therefore the ban on
borrowing from the Bank of Spain - does not come into effect until January 1
1994.
However, the government is likely to start implementing the new rules in
1993. 'The government is going to make every effort not to go to the Bank of
Spain, although it is still able to do so, so as to lessen the possible
traumatic effects on 1994 when it will no longer be able to do so,' said Mr
Juan Cueto, chief executive of Madrid securities house Gestemar.
The government plans to invest the Bank of Spain with a 'Bundesbank-style'
autonomy just when it is likely to need the type of short-term emergency
borrowing from the central bank that it used in the past.
Traditionally, Spain has relied heavily on issuing short-term paper,
resulting in a large refinancing need in the first months of the year. The
need is particularly big at present. Total debt issuance amounted to
Pta12,840bn (Dollars 112bn) in 1992, and is expected to be Pta11,534bn in
1993.
The government spent heavily - for example on the Barcelona Olympics, and
Seville's Expo '92 - but after the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty in
June, it became much more expensive for the government to issue debt.
Instead, the government stopped issuing paper and borrowed over Pta1,000bn
between June and September from the central bank (some estimates put the
bank borrowing at Pta1,400bn), which it then repaid by issuing three and
six-month paper between September and December.
Altogether about Pta3,500bn was raised in the last quarter. This now has to
be rolled over and it is estimated that Pta4,000bn has to be refinanced in
the first quarter of 1993, of which about Pta2,500bn has to be raised in
January alone.
While Spanish interest rates remain relatively high, the government is
unlikely to want to issue long-term debt, and so is expected to concentrate
on issuing short-dated paper.
Spanish interest rates are unlikely to fall much until the Bundesbank starts
to ease German rates, although dealers point out that lower inflation
figures and more reasonable wage settlements in Spain would help to push
bond yields down.
Longer-term, the decision to give the Bank of Spain more autonomy is likely
to result in more regular use of the bond markets.
When Spanish yields rose dramatically in the wake of the Danish vote against
Maastricht, the Treasury was reluctant to hold auctions of long-dated debt
because it did not want to issue new paper at a rate reflecting the high
yields in the secondary market.

BUSTER Brown Apparel, the Tennessee-based clothing group which has clad
American schoolchildren for decades, is letting go of its parent's hand and
stepping out alone.
Gerber, the large US baby food company which has owned Buster Brown since
the early-1980s, announced yesterday it was selling the company to
management, backed by Chemical Venture Partners and Apollo Advisers.
Chemical Venture, with around Dollars 1.5bn under management, is the venture
capital arm of Chemical Banking Corporation, while Apollo Advisers is part
of the investment business run by Mr Leon Black, previously a senior
investment banker with the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Buster Brown has annual sales of about Dollars 165m. But profitability is
understood to have waned in the current financial year to end-March.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMES Department Stores, the troubled general merchandise retailer based in
Connecticut, has emerged from bankruptcy.
The company, which filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the US Bankruptcy Code in April 1990, had a reorganisation plan approved
by the courts earlier this month, and its formal emergence from corporate
purgatory means Ames shares will trade once more - this time, on the NASDAQ
over-the-counter market.
Ames problems stemmed mainly from its ambitious Dollars 800m purchase of the
Zayre discount stores in 1988. These stores made significant losses and Ames
was unable to make payments on the debt assumed to buy the Zayre business.
While operating under Chapter 11, Ames reduced its stores network to around
370, from 678. But it was still making losses when it reported third-quarter
results this month.

FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Damart to close mail order
business in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slowdown in the Spanish economy has prompted Damart, the French clothing
company best known for its thermal underwear, to close its mail order
business in Spain at a cost of up to FFr60m (Dollars 11m).
Damart said the 'general deterioration' in the Spanish market, which has
worsened in the second half of this year, had forced it to rationalise its
operations there. The company will maintain a presence in Spain through its
18-strong chain of shops which will be unaffected by the cuts, but will
withdraw from mail order.
The closure of the Spanish mail order business is expected to cost Damart
between FFr50m and FFr60m, which will be expressed in full as a provision in
its 1992 accounts.
Damart, in common with its competitors in the European textile industry, has
been rationalising its activities for several years in an attempt to improve
productivity. Although Damart, as a specialist company with a strong market
position, has been more resilient than other, less focused, companies, it
has been forced to cut its workforce by over 20 per cent since 1990.
This productivity initiative was one of the main reasons for the increase in
Damart's net profits last year from FFr110m in 1990 to FFr222m in 1991 when
sales rose by 6.5 per cent to FFr3.7bn. However, its 1991 profits were lower
than the FFr297m made in 1989.

FT  31 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: KIO faces further battle to
pull out of Spain - The complications surrounding the Kuwaitis'
shareholdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The messy withdrawal from Spain of the Kuwait Investment Office and its
Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, is being threatened with further
complications as suspicions mount that the Kuwaitis may own much more of two
key Torras affiliates than they have previously reported.
The Spanish stock market commission (CNMV) is studying claims by the former
KIO agent in Spain, Mr Javier de la Rosa - whom the current KIO management
says is responsible for the collapse of its Dollars 4.4bn Spanish empire -
that Torras owns up to 70 per cent of the Prima property group and not the
34 per cent it reports.
Mr de la Rosa has also claimed the Kuwaitis own more than half of the failed
chemicals group, Ercros. The KIO claims Torras has just 39 per cent of
Ercros.
In both cases, the claims concern old share support schemes in which Prima
and Ercros shares were parked with Torras associates. Mr de la Rosa and some
Madrid bankers claim these share packets were put back to Torras this year.
Under Spanish takeover law, a company which holds more than 25 per cent of a
subsidiary has to make a bid for the subsidiary if it increases its stake by
more than 6 per cent in one year. Failure to mount the bid is illegal and is
regarded as a 'serious' offence.
CNMV officials are searching documents to recreate the rise of the KIO's
Spanish empire since 1986 and its collapse of the past six months. Mainly,
though, they are looking at Prima, which followed Torras into receivership
this month.
The KIO used to own most of Prima, separately from Torras. In 1990, when it
decided to delist Torras from the Madrid stockmarket, shareholders were paid
a mixture of cash and expensive Prima stock. But Torras was already
borrowing against Prima and it was important to keep share values strong.
So, to prevent them flowing back to the market, Torras set up a share
support operation.
On February 15 and 23 and on March 2 1990, Hammarstone, a company newly
registered in the Netherlands and the Antilles, bought 1,226,325 Prima
shares - about 12.45 per cent of the company. This was financed by a loan of
Pta10.2bn (Dollars 89m) from Banque Paribas (Suisse), agreed on February 15.
The shares, plus a cash deposit of Dollars 14m, guaranteed the loan.
Grupo Torras also signed a 'put and call' contract with Paribas (Suisse),
guaranteeing Paribas the right to sell to Torras at any time the Prima
shares for the value of the loan to Hammarstone, plus Paribas' financing
costs.
The question is who owns Hammarstone. Mr Fouad Jaffar, general manager of
the KIO in early 1990, says he was asked to act as a proxy head of
Hammarstone. He says the company was set up, and is owned by, the KIO and
Torras.
In May of this year, the management of the KIO and Torras changed. Before
this, though, two things had happened to the Hammarstone loan: it had been
split between Paribas and Banco Santander and, shortly before the new
management arrived at Torras their predecessors - possibly under bank
pressure - supplemented the put and call agreements with direct Torras loan
guarantees.
In the rowing that has followed the change of management at Torras, most of
the KIO's Spanish empire has collapsed. Certainly, fears that the KIO would
stop supporting Prima destroyed any chance the KIO had of recouping its
investment in the company. Prima stock dropped like a stone in June,
prompting the banks to call in their loans to Hammarstone.
Mr de la Rosa claims the KIO is leaving because it fears having to bid for
more of Prima and Ercros, or face charges for not making a bid. New managers
at the KIO deny this as they deny owning the Hammarstone stock.
Nevertheless, on July 8 this year Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, the new Torras chief
executive, wrote letters to Hammarstone in the Netherlands and the Antilles.
He said Torras had been told Hammarstone had defaulted on repayment of its
loans and that as guarantor it, Torras, had paid Santander Dollars 17.4m.
On July 13, Mr al-Nouri wrote to Paribas (Suisse) in Geneva, acknowledging
both the put and call option and an additional, direct, Torras guarantee of
the Hammarstone loan, granted on May 22 this year and which Paribas executed
on July 7. Mr Al-Nouri paid Paribas DM64.4m (Dollars 39.9m), according to
his letter.
As the guarantee had been paid, he said Torras regarded the put and call
option as dead, but he then appears to have instructed Paribas what to do
with the Prima stock. 'We hereby request and require you, as pledgee, until
further notice, to hold the shares . . . strictly to our order.'
Mr al-Nouri and the KIO were clearly in a most tricky position. They were
keeping their distance from Hammarstone's asset (the Prima stock) by not
openly acknowledging ownership - arguing they had merely acted as a
guarantor - but appear to have been exercising control over the shares.
Anyway, asks one Madrid banker: 'Why would anyone pay millions of dollars
for something they do not own?'
In its defence, Torras could challenge the legality of the original share
support operation or argue that contracts with Hammarstone do not legally
tie it to Torras. Also, it might argue it was controlling the shares to
pursue a claim against Hammarstone. The latter might be hard to do with a
straight face, though, as Hammarstone could only pay Torras back (for paying
off the banks) with its Prima stock.
Neither Mr al-Nouri nor his advisers were available to comment yesterday,
but the financial community in Madrid is eagerly anticipating the fight
Torras and KIO may have to put up to prove they are not the owners of
Hammarstone and its Prima shares.
Mr de la Rosa is at risk, too, if the authorities decide the original share
support operations infringed market regulations. The CNMV is a short-staffed
and rather ponderous young institution but is likely take an aggressive
stance.

AHOLD, the Dutch retail and supermarket group, said yesterday it plans to
acquire Jamin, a chain of Dutch confectionery shops, before the end of
March.
The company did not disclose how much it would pay Jamin's owner, Goudsmit,
a Dutch holding company with varied interests in the retail sector, for the
chain of 261 shops, including 114 franchise operations.
Jamin had sales of Fl 150m (Dollars 82m) in 1991. It will become part of
Ahold's specialty stores division, which generates around Fl 1bn of the
group's annual sales of Fl 21bn. Ahold's main businesses are its Albert
Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and four supermarket chains in
the eastern US.

AS THE dissolution of the Czechoslovak federation at midnight tonight
approaches, the government and financial institutions are making final
efforts to achieve as much agreement as possible on an equitable division of
its assets and liabilities.
One of the most difficult issues to resolve is the question of the
federation's external debt. While there is agreement in principle, several
issues have not been resolved.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia agreed this year on the division of assets
and liabilities in the ratio of two to one, based on the population of the
two republics. This principle also applies to the division of the external
debt.
According to the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, the federation's total
external debt stood at Dollars 10.36bn in June 1992, of which Dollars 9.78bn
was denominated in convertible currencies and Dollars 585m in
non-convertible currencies owed to its old Comecon trading partners.
Just over Dollars 7.5bn of the convertible debt was owed to overseas banks,
the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 24 industrialised
countries.
An estimated Dollars 7bn of the external debt was owed by Czech and Slovak
enterprises, which are responsible for repayment. Just over Dollars 2bn of
this was borrowed by the Czechoslovak Trade Bank acting unofficially on
behalf of the state. The Czech Republic and Slovakia have accepted
responsibility for the proportion of these debts owed by enterprises located
in each republic.
The Czechoslovak state's share of the debt was just under Dollars 1bn,
borrowed since 1991 from the European Community, the World Bank and G24. It
is expected this debt will be split in the two to one ratio.
The state bank has borrowed Dollars 1.5bn from the IMF under special drawing
rights since 1991. Controversy has arisen over the splitting of these rights
between the two governments, with the IMF having suggested the division in
the ratio of 2.29 to one. But Slovakia claims such a division would give the
Czech Republic greater access to future IMF funds. The IMF is expected to
make a decision on the ratio today.

<TEXT>
BUSTER Brown Apparel, the Tennessee-based clothing group which has clad
American schoolchildren for decades, is letting go of its parent's hand and
stepping out alone.
Gerber, the large US baby food company which has owned Buster Brown since
the early-1980s, announced yesterday it was selling the company to
management, backed by Chemical Venture Partners and Apollo Advisers.
Chemical Venture, with around Dollars 1.5bn under management, is the venture
capital arm of Chemical Banking Corporation, while Apollo Advisers is part
of the investment business run by Mr Leon Black, previously a senior
investment banker with the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Gerber, which is caught up in a price-war in its baby foods business, has
been trying to sell the Buster Brown business since early summer. Analysts
had suggested it might fetch around Dollars 160m, although neither buyer nor
seller would disclose the acquisition price yesterday.
Buster Brown, which was founded in 1904, has annual sales of about Dollars
165m. Profitability, however, is understood to have waned in the current
financial year to end-March.

subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CERUS, the French investment company linked to Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the
troubled Italian industrialist, has been forced to bail out Banque Dumenil
Leble, its banking arm, as part of a FFr430m (Dollars 96.5m) rescue package.
This is the latest in a series of gloomy announcements from the French
banking industry, which has been badly hit by the the economic slowdown.
Dumenil has been in trouble for some time. It has suffered, like other
French banks, from the problems of the property sector. It has also been
affected by internal problems which resulted in the closure of its Swiss
operation.
Cerus, which recently reported a first-half loss of FFr377m, has already
been forced to provide extra capital for Dumenil. The bank lost FFr492m in
the first half after making provisions of FFr540m for its property losses
and the Swiss closure.
However Dumenil now needs additional capital of FFr430m to avoid breaching
its banking ratios. Cerus, which directly holds 25.6 per cent of Dumenil and
holds the rest through Societe Financiere de Geneve - a Swiss-based bank it
controls - is providing FFr221m. The rest is coming from Societe Financiere
de Geneve.
The news of Dumenil's refinancing follows the announcement this week that
this year's losses from Olivetti, the Italian electronics group chaired by
Mr de Benedetti, would be worse than expected at between L300bn and L350bn.
The reorganisation of the Lagardere family interests was finalised yesterday
when shareholders of MMB, the French family's master company, approved plans
to change the share structure and to change the name to the Lagardere group.
The changes were triggered when Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman, announced
plans to merge Matra, the defence electronics concern, with the Hachette
media group.

FT  31 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Alternative to City &amp; Commercial
liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY &amp; COMMERCIAL, a split capital investment trust which is set to be wound
up in February, has put forward alternative reconstruction proposals.
They offer investors the choice of holdings in a new investment trust or in
one of two unit trusts managed by Abtrust Unit Trust Managers. They will
need to be approved by 75 per cent of shareholders at a meeting on January
15.
City &amp; Commercial, which has assets of around Pounds 62m and is managed by
Invesco MIM, has two classes of shares - capital and income. The latter get
all the income and are entitled to repayment at par value; capital shares
are entitled to all the assets once the income shares are repaid. Had the
trust been wound up, capital shareholders would have been repaid Pounds
15.50 per share.
Under the new proposals, capital holders will be offered shares and warrants
in a new investment trust, New City and Commercial, and/or holdings in
Abtrust's UK growth unit trust. Since unit trusts trade at asset value, this
option will allow holders to realise investments for cash.
Income holders will be offered holdings in Abtrust's gilt fund, which can
either be realised for cash, or held as a high yielding (9.17 per cent as of
yesterday) investment.
The new investment trust will have an equal number of ordinary shares (with
warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis) and debenture stock linked to the RPI.
SG Warburg and Panmure Gordon have underwritten up to Pounds 40m of the
stock, which will have a yield around 1.5 percentage points above
index-linked gilts. The debentures are also available via an open offer at
99p per 100p nominal.
Creating a new investment trust will allow shareholders to roll over their
investments without incurring an immediate capital gains tax liability.

FT  31 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sale Tilney shares suspended at own request
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALE TILNEY, the loss-making mini-conglomerate which had its banking
facilities extended at the beginning of December, has applied for its shares
to be suspended - at 4 1/2 p - 'pending clarification of the company's
financial position'.
The group, which has interests in food, industrial products, insurance and
financial services and has borrowings of about Pounds 24.5m, would not talk
to the press yesterday, though it is thought that the current discussions
with its banks concerning a financial restructuring have not yet been
concluded, or indeed resolved.
The restructuring, as mooted at the beginning of the month, was believed to
involve a debt-for-equity swap, which would dilute existing shareholdings.
The facility agreed in January 1991 with its banks, led by National
Westminster, expired on November 30.
In May, when announcing a cut in pre-tax losses to Pounds 4.45m (Pounds
9.62m) and a reduction of group debt to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 27.1m) for the
year to November 29 1991, Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said: 'The
group's solvency and the seriousness of the group's financial position are
the main issue for the board,' adding that the order books in the industrial
companies gave 'cause for concern'.
Since then Sale Tilney reported pre-tax losses further reduced to Pounds
2.53m (Pounds 3.68m) for the half-year to May 27. However, Mr Coppel said
that trading had been disappointing and that net liabilities had risen to
Pounds 11.6m. At the previous November year-end they stood at Pounds 9.76m.

FT  31 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Groundwork done and ready to move - The
management buy-out from the Massey Ferguson Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement was hardly the sort of thing to set City pulses racing:
Manchester-based construction equipment company reports significant success
with sophisticated new electronic control system for its backhoe loaders.
But the news was of more than average interest to a number of organisations
not noted for their devotion to the minutiae of earthmoving technology, such
as Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance, Granville Development Capital and the
Mars pension fund.
Three weeks earlier, on September 8, the Manchester-based company MF
Industrial had ended months of speculation by announcing a Pounds 12m
management buy-out from the Massey Ferguson Group, arranged or backed by the
three City groups.
And it is innovations such as the Servotronic system, introduced earlier
this year after two years' development work, that give Mr Richard Robson, MF
Industrial's managing director, confidence that the company can make the
buy-out work at a very difficult time for the European construction
equipment industry.
The deal was completed last month, finally dispelling uncertainty over the
future ownership of Europe's third largest producer of backhoe loaders - MF
Industrial also makes light industrial tractor loaders and skid steer
loaders - and creating an independent UK-owned company with some Pounds 65m
of annual sales and 430 employees.
That makes MF Industrial much smaller than companies such as JC Bamford
Excavators, by far the largest UK-owned construction equipment company and
MF Industrial's biggest rival in backhoe loaders. Instead, MF falls firmly
in the ranks of Europe's medium-sized players, which know they need a clear
product and marketing strategy in the 1990s to avoid being squeezed between
the global multinationals such as Caterpillar and Komatsu, and the niche
players.
Mr Robson has spent almost as much time discussing and negotiating the
buy-out as his colleagues spent developing the new control system.
The new company has been painstakingly put together this year from
operations in the UK, France and Germany. Called Fermec Holdings, its
products will continue to carry the MF Industrial badge.
Long-term component supply deals have been negotiated with Varity,
Massey-Ferguson's US parent company.
Mr Robson brought in Arthur Andersen to arrange equity and loan financing
for the deal as well as working capital requirements. In a period when many
venture capital companies have been concentrating on rescue work, 'they knew
who was investing', he said. Eventually, an international equity syndicate
led by Granville was put together to support the management team, which has
a 20 per cent stake.
But, with the construction equipment industry still deep in recession and
European market prospects uncertain at best, does the deal make sense?
It certainly looks logical for Varity, which had quit the big league of
construction equipment manufacturers in the late-1970s with the disposal of
Hanomag of Germany (now controlled by Komatsu), and now sees its future in
diesel engines, agricultural equipment and automotive parts.
Apart from components, therefore, there was little remaining synergy between
Varity and MF Industrial in manufacturing or distribution, according to the
Corporate Intelligence Group, which advised the equity syndicate.
For MF Industrial, Mr Robson believes there are several reasons why the
buy-out should work. First, he says, an 'awful lot of pain has already been
taken' shrinking the company from a workforce of about 1,000 at the height
of the 1988/89 boom to about 430. Another redundancy programme is under way,
involving 50 to 60 employees.
But with the reduction in size has come a dramatic transformation in
manufacturing methods and attitudes at MF's Stretford plant. Mr Robson, who
joined MF Industrial in 1977 from Varity in Toronto, managed to persuade the
parent company of the need to keep investing in the operation, whatever it
decided to do with it eventually.
After Pounds 6m of investment in new machine tools and robots, a paint booth
and a reorganised manufacturing flow, what Mr Robson calls 'a backside of a
factory' with 22 levels of piecework has been turned, he says, into one of
the best in Europe with total flexibility of employment.
The new company has also taken a potentially significant decision to spend a
further Pounds 1m on its own-self-contained parts operation at Stretford, in
a move linked to a new emphasis on 'aftercare' for customers.
Finally, Mr Robson has been careful to begin with a strong balance sheet and
the ability to expand. Bank borrowings and loans of Pounds 4.4m are backed
by shareholders' equity of Pounds 15.6m, and a further Pounds 7.5m borrowing
facility has been agreed.
Along with almost all construction equipment companies, MF Industrial lost
money last year. But it has been trading profitably since the buy-out, says
Mr Robson.
According to Corporate Intelligence Group, there is 'every indication that
this relatively small, specialist manufacturer can prosper independently of
its multinational, diversified parent'.
But MF Industrial will need to draw on all its recent changes to achieve its
next target - becoming Europe's second largest backhoe loader maker by the
end of 1994. Its market share has hovered around 12 per cent for the past
five years, but Mr Robson hopes a new outgoing approach to marketing will
help it take share from rivals.
And with the single market in prospect, Mr Robson is looking to Germany in
particular to reach the target. Unlike the plant-hire dominated UK market,
the German owner-operator or small contractor is much more likely to pay
more for special features, he says.
The company may also deepen its involvement in skid-steer loaders, a growth
sector in Europe, taking on more customisation and final assembly work of
products which it currently markets.
Whatever happens, though, it plans to stick by its new motto: 'Large enough
to serve, small enough to care.'

Estates &amp; Agency Holdings, which owns property investments in the UK, is
delaying a recommendation on its final dividend for the year ended June 30
1992 until the position regarding a planned development is clarified.
The company said the unusual step has been taken primarily to retain funds,
and meanwhile has declared a second interim of 0.5p, absorbing Pounds
30,000, to make 3p to date; total for the previous 18 months was 7.5p
costing Pounds 450,000.
Results for the year showed gross rental income at Pounds 5.05m, and pre-tax
profit of Pounds 787,000, against Pounds 7.14m and Pounds 1.08m respectively
for the 18 months. Earnings per share came to 11.57p, compared with 14.24p.
Net asset value at June 30 fell to 393p per share, against 430p in 1991.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Pentos shares fall 20% after profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Pentos, the specialist UK retailing group which owns Dillons
bookshops, Ryman, Athena and Wilding, fell 20 per cent yesterday after the
group warned that pre-tax profits this year will be 'significantly below'
market expectations, and said the final dividend was under review.
After the surprise profit warning, analysts cut their pre-tax profits
estimates for the year ending today to about Pounds 5m, down from Pounds
15.2m last year. The stock, which was trading around the 140p level earlier
this year, dropped 14p to 56p yesterday, reducing the group's market
capitalisation by more than Pounds 20m.
Pentos, which has expanded rapidly under its outspoken chairman, Mr Terry
Maher, said the level of the final dividend 'will be considered in the light
of trading at the time of the preliminary announcement in March'. Last year
the group paid a final dividend of 2.05p, making a total for the year of
2.75p.
Pentos blamed 'weaker than anticipated' trading during the final quarter in
its office furniture manufacturing operations and the Athena poster and
print business. At Athena, Christmas trading failed to match up to
expectations. Sales for the full year will be about 3 per cent lower than in
1991 and profits are expected to fall by about Pounds 3m to break-even.
'Spending amongst Athena's mainly young target market remains depressed,'
said Pentos.
The core bookshop and office equipment businesses have continued to perform
satisfactorily, with sales at Dillons up by about 4 per cent year-on-year.
The group said Dillons' pre-Christmas 'cut-price' book offensive, an effort
to undermine the price controls of the Net Book Agreement, had been a
success.
The office furniture business saw a sharp decline in orders from
mid-September, and two large orders worth about Pounds 1m were delayed until
1993. As a result, these operations will post a small loss this year,
compared with a trading profit of Pounds 3.7m in 1991. Steps have been taken
to cut overheads by Pounds 2m in 1993.
Mr Clive Gregory, who recently returned to Pentos as finance director, said
reorganisation expenses, together with other non-recurring costs related to
the acquisition of Hatchards in 1990, will be treated as exceptional items
reducing pre-tax profits by a further Pounds 3.5m.
Pentos expects to be well placed to improve profitability when consumer
spending rises again. Cost reduction programmes would improve underlying
performance in 1993, it said.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Winterthur to put further Pounds 11m into motor insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTERTHUR, one of Switzerland's biggest insurers, is to pump a further
Pounds 11m of capital into its Churchill Insurance subsidiary, paving the
way for further expansion by the rapidly growing motor insurance company.
Churchill is the second biggest 'direct writer' in the UK, behind Direct
Line, the highly success-ful Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, which
earlier this year reported annual profits of Pounds 15.1m in the 12 months
to September 30.
'Direct writers' which sell motor insurance through a combination of mass
media marketing and telephone sales are poised to win a growing share of the
Pounds 4bn-a-year motor insurance market.
Churchill has grown rapidly since its launch in 1989. Premium income
increased by more than 100 per cent during 1992 to Pounds 79.7m. Mr Martin
Long, chief executive, is planning further expansion in 1993, when he aims
to boost premium income to Pounds 135m.
'The more premium you get in the more capital you need to fund it,' said Mr
Long, who says Winterthur is keen to take advantage of rising premium rates
in motor business.
Mr Long said that while the frequency of claims was falling, premiums were
rising and the increases were sticking. Although Churchill expects to incur
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2m (before tax recoveries) in 1992, Mr Long says it
has been trading profitably since April.
Of the Pounds 11m of new capital approved by Winterthur, some Pounds 5m will
be in the form of new paid-up capital, boosting paid-up capital to Pounds
49m - compared with the Pounds 30m originally invested by Winterthur. The
remaining Pounds 6m has been earmarked to take advantage of further
opportunities next year.
Churchill wrote 230,000 new policies in 1992 and is aiming to win 320,000
new customers in 1993, a market share of between 3 and 4 per cent, according
to Mr Long. To date it has sold more than 480,000 policies.
So far Churchill has focused on motor insurance but next year could move
into the household insurance market. Two of Churchill's direct writing
competitors - Direct Line and GA 121, a subsidiary of Perth-based General
Accident - already underwrite household insurance.
Another continental European company, France's Groupe des Assurances
Nationales, is also poised to launch a new direct writing operation next
year.

FT  31 DEC 92 / AMB sale of BfG Bank approved by shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, one of Germany's
largest insurers, yesterday voted overwhelmingly to approve the sale of a 25
per cent stake in the BfG Bank, to Credit Lyonnais, giving the French bank
control of Germany's sixth largest bank.
The shareholders also agreed - by more than nine to one - to register a 25
per cent stake in AMB by Assurances Generales de France, the French
state-controlled insurer which helped engineer the bank deal.
AGF, now AMB's biggest single shareholder, is expected to exercise
increasing influence over the German group's direction.
Shareholders approved by 96.24 per cent of the vote for AMB to give up its
BfG stake and by 92.96 per cent to back registration of AGF's shares. The
votes represented a defeat of efforts by Fondiaria, the Italian insurer that
owns 20 per cent of AMB, to block the sale. Fondiaria was stopped from
voting at the meeting because its shares had not been registered in time.
The Fondiaria shares had been considered the largest interest block against
the proposals.
Yesterday's vote follows an agreement reached in July whereby AGF promised
to work to get its ally, Credit Lyonnais, to take a majority stake in the
troubled BfG. The French bank plans to inject DM1.2bn (Pounds 491m) into the
acquisition.
The deal throws doubt on the development of co-operation between AMB,
Fondiaria and Royal Insurance who agreed to develop jointly their European
businesses in 1991.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Banks aim for stability and a level playing field: Capital
adequacy ratios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The playing field for international banks is now fairly level, although
there are still bumps and potholes. However, most players are too exhausted
to chase the ball.
That is how one senior banker described the implementation of the Basle
accord on bank capital ratios, which was intended to strengthen banks'
balance sheets and remove competitive disadvantages between banks from
different countries. Agreed by central bankers from the Group of Ten
countries in December 1987, the Basle accord on bank capital takes effect
tomorrow.
The field is still not completely flat, because regulators from different
countries have interpreted the Basle rules differently. French banks, for
example, can incorporate provisions for third world debt in their capital.
Even the implementation timetable is not the same everywhere. For Japanese
banks, the guidelines take effect at the end of their financial year in
March.
However, implementation comes when competitive distortions are less of a
concern to banks than for many years - because so many banks have been
forced by recession and losses in overseas markets to concentrate on
domestic businesses and shy away from international competition.
The origin of the accord was an informal chat in the summer of 1986 between
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Paul
Volcker, then chairman of the US Federal Reserve. They felt the
internationalisation of banking created a need for common capital standards
for two reasons:
The collapse of one bank could infect banks across the world. If all banks
had strong balance sheets and a sound capital base, the risk of serious
damage to the worldwide banking system would be reduced.
Capital is a scarce and expensive resource. Any banks permitted by their
regulators to operate with relatively little capital therefore had a
competitive advantage, which was seen in some countries as unfair. UK and US
banks resented the ability of French and Japanese banks to operate with low
minimum capital ratios, since these were taking an increasing share of the
international loan market.
Mr Volcker and Mr Leigh-Pemberton felt there was a need for a common method
for measuring bank capital and an agreement that all banks should maintain a
minimum 8 per cent ratio of capital to assets.
By early 1987 the Japanese authorities joined the discussions, being steered
by a former Bank of England associate director, Mr Peter Cooke, under the
auspices of the Basle Committee on banking supervision. Pretty soon all the
G10 countries were involved and the guidelines adopted have since been taken
up by many banking regulators around the world.
'There is nothing legally binding about the accord,' said a central banker.
'We rely on peer pressure among central bankers to make sure that all
regulators implement the standards.' But harmonisation has been impressive.
The Basle agreement had a rapid and profound effect on the psychology of
senior bankers. Being at or close to the minimum ratio was regarded as a
sign of weakness. 'Anyone who wanted to hold themselves out as a serious
international bank had to show they were there (long before tomorrow's
deadline),' said a Bank of England official.
Indeed, most big international banks attempt to maintain far more than the
minimum ratios. Those close to the minimum, such as Citicorp of the US and
some big Japanese banks, are making strenuous efforts to raise their ratios.
Even so, the biggest complaints from banks today about the playing field is
that regulators in some countries, such as the US and the UK, are insisting
banks have ratios far higher than the minimum - so US and UK banks feel they
are still at something of a disadvantage.
Under the accord, there are two broad definitions of capital, called tier 1
or core capital and tier 2 (see illustration). Banks must maintain a tier 1
ratio of at least 4 per cent.
However, the definition of capital does vary from country to country. Under
a derogation included in the accord, Japanese banks alone can count 45 per
cent of their hidden reserves (principally unrealised gains on
shareholdings) towards tier two capital. When the Tokyo stock market was
riding high, this accounted for a substantial proportion of their capital -
although with the Nikkei average at its current level, several Japanese City
banks are close to the 8 per cent minimum.
There have also been differences of interpretation over the types of
financial instrument that banks can count towards capital. The definition of
tier one capital was extended at the outset to include certain types of
preference share, a concession to US banks which had been heavy issuers of
such paper. Preference stock has since become a mainstay of bank financing
in many financial centres.
Legal restrictions, however, prevent banks in France, Spain and Japan from
issuing such shares. Banks from the first two countries at least have got
around the problem by issuing stock through subsidiaries located abroad -
which has drawn protests from UK and US institutions.
Under the accord, a bank's assets are weighted according to riskiness. Thus
if a bank makes a loan to an OECD government - normally by buying government
bonds - it need carry no capital in respect of that loan, since these loans
are not seen as risky.
If, on the other hand, it makes a commercial loan, then it must have capital
equal to 8 per cent of the value of that loan. When lending to other banks,
the bank need have only a fifth of the capital required for a commercial
loan.
The implementation of these weightings has had a significant effect on
banks' behaviour. US banks, for example, have been using more of their
resources to buy government bonds and have cut back on corporate lending.
Critics of the accord, such as Mr Richard Breeden, the chairman of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, complain it has distorted the US
economy, by stifling the willingness of banks to lend to businesses.
Some bankers have also complained that the weightings make no distinction
between a loan to a blue-chip company and one to a vulnerable small
business. So in theory banks might be encouraged to make riskier loans to
small businesses, since the interest rate on these loans is higher. However
regulators say there is no evidence that the accord is encouraging
risk-taking.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Merchant bankers feel pinch as public takeovers dwindle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY FIVE merchant banks advised on UK public takeovers worth more than
Pounds 1bn in 1992, underlining the slump in the industry, according to
figures released by Acquisitions Monthly.
This compares with nine financial advisers last year and 17 in 1989,
regarded as the vintage year for takeovers.
A further five advisers in 1992 worked on deals worth less than Pounds 100m
and still made the top 20 ranked by value of transactions. Albert E Sharp,
which was placed at number 20 in the table, worked on two deals together
worth only Pounds 18m. Last year's number 20, Hambros Bank, worked on five
deals, valued at Pounds 167m.
For the first time in eight years no US bank made the top 20. Last year
Goldman Sachs came third, with two other US banks represented.
SG Warburg finished top financial adviser, followed by Schroders, Samuel
Montagu, Morgan Grenfell and NM Rothschild.
The value of public bids completed in 1992 fell to Pounds 7.5bn, compared
with Pounds 10bn in 1991 and a record Pounds 55bn in 1989.
Mr Philip Healey, Acquisitions Monthly editor, estimates that around 200
corporate financiers lost their jobs. 'It is very cold out there for
unemployed bankers,' he said.
Most companies were unable to launch bids if they could not afford to
finance them from cash. There were, however, notable exceptions, such as the
Tomkins' recommended Pounds 935m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling,
baking and grocery group.
Mr Healey believes banks can no longer rely on clients to remain
automatically loyal to financial advisers.
T Cowie, the motor group, replaced its merchant bank, Noble Grossart, in
favour of NM Rothschild earlier this month, following its failed Pounds 32m
bid for the Henlys Group.
However, most heads of corporate finance believe the second half of 1993
will pick up with more mergers and acquisitions.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Customs keeps up defences as EC's trade barriers fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS may not notice customs checks after the single European market
begins life at midnight tonight, but officials will still be keeping a close
watch on them.
Hundreds of uniformed officers and administrative staff at borders
throughout the European Community will be replaced by more discreet
surveillance and intelligence-gathering.
'The question is not what you see at the borders after January 1, but what
you don't see,' said one British Customs and Excise official. Its planners
estimate that while some 400 of the 3,500 UK border staff will be affected
by the abolition of EC customs controls, only about 12 will lose their jobs.
The authorities are confident that by reallocating staff, they will be able
to curtail the efforts of smugglers and terrorists at least as well as now.
They stress that all important drug seizures in recent years were based on
intelligence operations, not random border searches.
Some staff no longer required in person at the borders will still be needed
in a more discreet role monitoring the flows of traffic and people. Similar
changes to customs services are taking place in other EC countries, although
many - particularly the southern European states - have routinely relied
more on intelligence and internal controls than on border checks.
Customs controls between the UK and Ireland have long been working in the
way being adopted elsewhere, because fixed posts are too vulnerable to
terrorist attack.
Customs officials will no longer have the power to stop and search at random
those travelling from other EC countries, but they will be able to
interrogate any who match their 'profiles' of suspicious characters.
Many staff are being reassigned inland as investigators in London and the 22
customs collection divisions around the country, where they will gather
intelligence on the movements of suspected smugglers and value added tax
fraudsters. They are coy about explaining how this will work, but it will
include gathering tip-offs and assembling profiles of likely suspects to be
pursued. Publicans in Dover have been approached for help in alerting
officials to anyone they consider suspicious.
Other employees will become excise verification officers. They have powers
to search suspect vehicles anywhere in the UK and can inspect shops to check
if supplies are coming from registered traders. Further staff are being
moved to other customs duties, such as dealing with the new statistical and
VAT procedures introduced from tomorrow.
Many uniformed customs officers will still be needed at UK borders. They
will cope with EC and non-EC citizens arriving from outside the Community,
who will still pass through a green channel and stop at a 'red spot' if they
have goods to declare. Travellers, of whatever nationality, arriving from
elsewhere in the EC will pass through a new blue channel.
Most of the job changes required will be complete by the end of 1993.

</HEADLINE>

Life must indeed be tough if you find it difficult to sell cards at
Christmas. Yet judging by yesterday's profits warning, Pentos' Athena chain
is struggling to find a replacement for its wilting teenage market. That
might not matter so much if the company's office furniture operation was not
also having a miserable time. Despite ratio-nalisation neither is likely to
help the main books business much next year.
Which is a pity, because Dillons is unlikely to find bookselling much
easier. Both Dillons and Waterstones have invested heavily in upmarket
stores, soaking up cash. Yet there remain worries about the likely return on
capital employed. With Waterstones backed by WH Smith, and Pentos' gearing
rising, there can be little doubt who has the deeper pockets to fight a
protracted battle. If the Pentos chairman gets his dearest wish and the net
book agreement is abolished, he may just live to regret it.

FT  31 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's consumers are not alone in suffering from the absurd distortions
created by the Common Agricultural Policy. Many of Europe's big food
manufacturers must reckon they have lost out too. The theory is that
artificially high commodity prices have shielded small producers from their
bigger rivals. An inefficient market for many processed foods has resulted.
Imperfect though the comparison may be, it is interesting to contrast the
share price performance of the food manufacturing sectors on either side of
the Atlantic. In the UK, the sector has been flat when set against the main
market over the past decade. In the US, it has outperformed by a factor
approaching three. The differing structure of the industries and the
relative power of retailers have clearly played their part. But a freer
market for agricultural commodities in the US may also have helped the
industry's profitability.
With CAP reform and finalisation of the Gatt talks in prospect, European
investors must be wondering whether to stock up on food company shares to
benefit from the industry's seemingly imminent rationalisation. But they
can, perhaps, afford to wait a while. There is not going to be a sudden
revolution. Apart from commodity items, raw material prices now constitute a
small proportion of a product's total cost. Marketing and packaging expenses
are often far more significant for those manufacturers higher up the added
value chain.
Nevertheless, food price reform should hasten the long-term trends shaping
the industry. For vulnerable food companies, there are already enough
threats to make their executives wake up screaming in the small hours. The
accelerating concentration of the industry in response to the single
European market has resulted in the emergence of powerful pan-European
operators such as Nestle, BSN and Unilever. The growing strength of retail
buying groups - as well as cross-border retailers - will also add to the
rationalisation squeeze. Local companies serving local needs may yet evade
such pressures. To be small may still be beautiful; to be middling will be
ugly.

The good news in the latest Dun &amp; Bradstreet business failures figures is
that they tend to confirm that the recession is easing. The total is growing
more slowly and the focus is shifting towards smaller companies, as it did
after 1980-81. The bad news is that companies remain under intense pressure.
Bad debts continue to plague 80 per cent of them and many larger companies
are surviving only because of rigorous cost cutting, deferred investment and
delayed payments to suppliers - hardly a propitious background for investing
in recovery.
After the last recession business failures continued rising until 1984,
which suggests there may be a couple more years of increase to come this
time. The difference is that, at 62,767, failures this year are already some
three times the peak in 1984. So it is legitimate to ask when and how
quickly banks' loan loss provisions can drop. The rate will be the principal
factor behind any earnings recovery.
With provisions running at over 3 per cent of their loan book, the main
clearing banks are better protected than they were at the end of the last
recession. Property prices may stabilise in the wake of lower interest
rates, obviating the need for additions to existing provisions as the value
of collateral falls. Still, it is hard to escape the conclusion that any
decline in provisions will be tortuously slow. Less so, perhaps, for a bank
such as Midland which provided early in the cycle and trimmed its lending.
More so, for Barclays, which not only provided late but is also deeply
involved in small business lending.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With margins the envy of food retailers worldwide, it is perhaps not
surprising that investors fret about the prospect of a UK food fight
breaking out. Hence the sharp drop in food retailing share prices which
greeted J Sainsbury's announcement of its January price promotion. Given the
billions being poured into new stores, any protracted battle would indeed be
serious. Yet despite the suitably robust replies from Sainsbury's principal
competitors, Safeway and Tesco, the overwhelming impression is of Sainsbury
tightening its grip on the market.
Indeed, one of the most interesting parts of Sainsbury's statement was that
it had beaten its own demanding sales budgets in the run up to Christmas.
The increased profits thus generated provide ammunition for the company to
cut prices selectively and expand its market share. It may even be
politically desirable for Sainsbury to plough back profits into sales growth
rather than see its margins rise even further.
Not that margins are being cast to one side. The campaign has been cleverly
hyped to extract the maximum publicity and increase in volumes from
carefully chosen price concessions, and suppliers will bear some of the
price cuts in the hope of higher sales. Tesco confronts Sainsbury most
directly, yet its slower growth record limits its room for response. The
valuation gap which has opened up between the two this year is unlikely to
narrow. And Tesco's recent foray into France may even hint that the company
is finding the domestic kitchen a little warm.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Sonic, stamps and Sex: FT writers pick their top products of
1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year of recession took its toll. From the US to Japan consumers were
watching their purses and manufacturers were wary. Innovative products were
thin on the ground.
Amid a disheartening lack of exciting consumer electronics products, the one
bright spot was the launch of Philips's Digital Compact Cassette (DCC).
But optimism was short-lived, as consumers realised they could face another
battle over industry standards comparable to the VHS and Betamax video wars
of the 1980s.
Like Philips's DCC, Sony's MiniDisc attempts to replace the ageing cassette
tape with a digital product that will deliver the crisp sound of CDs. But
with incompatible formats, Philips and Sony are now vying for the allegiance
of leading record companies to ensure sufficient recorded music.
Elsewhere it was a question of improving on the tried and tested. This was
the year VCR manufacturers finally realised that 80 per cent of owners are
clueless about how to record programmes.
The answer was VCR Plus - an idiot-proof system aimed at techno-illiterate
adults. Instead of fumbling with endless codes, users set their machines by
punching in one set of numbers. Each programme has an assigned code, found
in TV listings, which switches the VCR on, sets the channel, starts
recording and stops automatically.
The year underscored the selling power of rock stars, dead or alive, with
Madonna selling Sex and Elvis selling stamps. A million Americans took part
in a summer poll to decide which image of Elvis should be used on a
commemorative stamp. The new stamp, available next month, is expected to be
the hottest-selling stamp in US history. The initial printing of 300m stamps
is twice the normal run for a commemorative issue, and it is still not
expected to meet demand.
Madonna moved on to the bestseller list in October with her book, Sex,
featuring nude photographs of the Material Girl in poses more
publicity-minded than pornographic. The book was censored in Japan and
almost banned in Canada, although critics dubbed it a bore.
But it was neither Madonna nor Elvis who stole children's hearts.
Un-doubtedly the cult figure of the year was the improbable Sonic, a
hyperactive, steel-blue hedgehog.
Sonic is not your typical hero. But the spiky mammal enabled its maker,
Sega, the Japanese games company, to perform the unthinkable feat of
challenging Nintendo's dominance in the video games market.
Elsewhere in Japan, Seibu, the stylish Tokyo department stores, opened a
recycled kimono corner, a move reflecting consumers' new, frugal approach to
shopping. While a new kimono costs more than Y500,000 (Pounds 2,645), used
ones cost about Y40,000. About 200 second-hand ones are sold every month,
though there has been a rush of customers this month to Seibu eager to buy a
traditional kimono before the new-year festivities.
While Japanese women look to the past, an invention by a Japanese textile
scientist is helping the fashion world claw its way forward in the teeth of
recession. Today, no self-respecting fashion retailer would be without
clothes made of microfibres - microscopically thin filaments of polyester or
nylon. Microfibres make quality hosiery and can be mixed with wool or linen
to create silk-like blends.
In the pharmaceuticals industry, nicotine patches, which look like large
sticking plasters and curb cigarette cravings by steadily delivering
nicotine into the bloodstream, hit the US market early in the year.
Demand soon outpaced supply in spite of FDA criticism of patch advertising,
and patch sales for the year are estimated at Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m).
With a six-month success rate of about 25 per cent, the patches do not
qualify as a miracle cure.
Sometimes, however, a drug can just be too successful. Imigran, Glaxo's
breakthrough migraine treatment, known in the US as Imitrex, relieves
migraine symptoms in 77 per cent of patients within four hours.
But the drug has certainly proved a headache for health ministries, worried
it could blow a hole in their budgets. The British Medical Journal
calculated that, if it achieved 100 per cent market penetration at Pounds 20
per treated attack, it could cost Britain's National Health Service Pounds
1.344bn a year. The annual NHS drugs bill is Pounds 3.2bn.
Over the summer months minds were temporarily diverted from money matters by
the Olympic Games. The hit product of Barcelona was undoubtedly Olympic
champion Chris Boardman's racing bike.
Its black finish and enigmatic, faintly menacing shape suggested more
Spanish Inquisition than Spanish Olympics. Developed by Lotus Engineering,
part of the sports cars subsidiary of General Motors, the ultra-lightweight
LotusSport pursuit cycle combined advanced composite materials and unique
aerodynamics. Cheap it was not. Replicas of Boardman's bike would cost about
Pounds 5,000.
Come the autumn and British minds again returned to finances. The 3
percentage point fall in base rates which followed Britain's departure from
the European exchange rate mechanism left mortgage rates at their lowest
level for 15 years. Homeowners took advantage of the lower rates by
subscribing to fixed-rate offers. Many were so popular they were snapped up
immediately.
But in a year of doom and depression, Chanel, the Paris fashion house, could
be relied on to come up with something really frivolous - Y-fronts for
women, dry clean only, at Pounds 100 a pair.
Chanel is coy about how many pairs it has sold. It probably does not care.
In the 1990s, the amount of publicity a new design produces is the often the
key to the turnover it generates.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: No cut-price gas deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C H BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, British Gas is not offering special discounts to power stations to keep
out competition ('British Gas offers connection discount to power stations',
December 29). The last British Gas contract to supply gas to a power station
was agreed in October 1991 and we are not at present actively negotiating
with other potential generators. Around 70 per cent of the gas contracted
for power stations is being supplied by competitors of British Gas, which
does not suggest anti-competitive practices.
The connection charges for power stations have been based on the same
principles as those for all our other industrial and commercial contract
customers. These arrangements have been in place for the past 25 years to
the benefit of thousands of British businesses.
Suggestions that these benefits should be removed do not support
expectations that enforced competition will lead to lower prices.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: America's corporate Who's Who also at Clinton
conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN LOVE KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's account of President-elect Clinton's economic
conference ('Little Rock conference sees much talk, fewer policies',
December 15) left the impression this had been a gathering of secondary
representatives of America's business.
Only one of the 300 attendees was mentioned by name - Ms Kathleen Piper from
South Dakota. In fact, this innovative conference was attended by the Who's
Who of America's corporate world.
Distinguished individuals who are the chair and/or the chief executive
officer of their respective corporations included: John Sculley, Apple
Computer; John Reid, Citicorp; David Glass, Wal-Mart; Harold Poling, Ford;
Paul Allaire, Xerox; Edwin Artzi, Procter &amp; Gamble; Drew Lewis, Union
Pacific; Robert Grandall, American Airlines; Robert Goizueta, Coca-Cola;
Richard Jenrette, Equitable; Frank Popoff, Dow Chemical; P Roy Vagelos,
Merck; John Young, Hewlett-Packard.
These individuals do not fit the reported description of '. . .only
Democrats - or people known to sympathise with his (Clinton's) views . . .'.
They were invited to express their views and present possible solutions on
how to correct America's crippled economy.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: Unlikely to avoid tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN F YEO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The refund of pension surplus to Courtaulds Textiles may be justifiable
on a number of grounds, but avoiding the payment of unnecessary tax (Lex,
December 22) is unlikely to be one of them. A refund is subject to a
free-standing tax charge of 40 per cent. It is not absolutely clear what tax
treatment applies to a pension fund which chooses not to pay a refund, but
tax at 25 per cent is likely on the proportion of income and capital gains
which relates to the surplus. Tax only continues while the fund shows a
surplus.
As Lex says, very few pension schemes can be certain to remain in surplus
for long while the investment outlook is so uncertain. A fund which retains
a surplus, therefore, has a good chance of paying less tax than one which
refunds one. That said, it is true that the assumptions for determining
whether a surplus exists are cautious and Lex may well be correct in saying
that benefits are unlikely to have been put at risk.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Triumphs in the face of adversity: FT writers assess the few
world leaders who tasted success in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nineteen ninety-two will go down as the year most of the world's heads of
government would rather forget.
For the leaders of the industrial democracies, from Mitterrand to Mulroney,
it was a year of economic disappointment and political disenchantment. Those
who faced the verdict of the voters, either on their performance (George
Bush in America or Albert Reynolds in Ireland) or their policies (Poul
Schluter and Francois Mitterrand in the Danish and French Maastricht
referendums), found themselves subject to harsh, sometimes terminal, rebuke.
Even for those who survived the test (Britain's John Major or Japan's Kiichi
Miyazawa), electoral victory was only a prelude to deepening domestic
difficulty.
Yet the encircling clouds were not completely bereft of silver linings.
Surprising as it may seem, a number of presidents and prime ministers may
well be looking back on this year with something resembling . . . not
affection, perhaps, but quiet satisfaction. To recognise this fact and
provide some seasonal consolation, the FT has decided to create a new set of
awards, which shall be known, faute de mieux, as the Plastic Spoon Prizes
for Political Achievement.
The PSPPA are fragile and readily disposable. To qualify you need to be a
serving head of government (various definitions accepted) with at least
three months in office (preferably much, much more); you have to have
achieved a significant turnround in your own, your party's or your country's
poll ratings/public image/international reputation/economic performance; and
you should have a reasonable prospect of political survival beyond the next
four weeks.
First prize this year - the Alchemist's Award - goes to the unlikely and
diminutive figure of Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. In six months as
prime minister, this 54-year-old Socialist law professor has performed an
extraordinary feat of alchemy, turning political dross into gold. The dross
he inherited was the weakest of the 51 postwar coalitions foisted on the
much abused Italian electorate, taking office amid an exploding financial
crisis.
Most commentators wrote him off at the start as an ineffectual caretaker in
hock to the vested interests of the ruling Christian Democrats and
Socialists. But not only has Prof Amato survived; he has done more to reform
the state in less time than any of his predecessors, and clawed back some of
Italy's lost credibility abroad.
The secret of his alchemy has been clever exploitation of his weakness.
Amato's political career was that of a technician in the shadow of Bettino
Craxi, the Socialist leader. He was only chosen when Craxi was forced to
forego his ambitions for the premiership as a result of a corruption scandal
in Milan. More importantly, his coalition has depended on four parties
discredited by a slide in votes at the April general election and a mere
16-seat majority in parliament.
All these negative elements he turned to his advantage. He has emerged
untainted by the scandals surrounding Craxi; the party is in fact desperate
he should take over. The coalition has been held together because he has let
the parties squabble among themselves while he has got on with governing.
His main tactical weapon has consisted in continually invoking the dire
state of Italy's finances. He once described the budget as a Christmas tree
from which everyone takes something. There are no more presents. The urgent
need to tackle the public sector deficit has enabled him to push through an
emergency budget for 1992 and a tough austerity package for 1993, to reform
the health service, pensions, the civil service and local administration,
and to begin privatisation. In each case he has presented a blunt
alternative: if the measures are not adopted, the government falls and worse
will follow.
With a relaxed public style and quick wit, his popularity ratings are high.
Arguably he has become indispensable to guide Italy through a delicate
transition period while the parties agree on a new electoral system and
Italy's public finances are put in order.
We have three runners-up in the political metamorphosis category. First, a
souffle spoon to Paul Keating, who as Australia's Labor prime minister has
spent much of this year successfully disproving his favourite maxim that a
souffle never rises twice. Keating frequently uses the souffle test to
dismiss political opponents. But it could equally have applied to the
demoralised Labor government he inherited from Bob Hawke last December. When
Keating moved into The Lodge, the modest Canberra residence of Australian
prime ministers, Labor was trailing the conservative opposition coalition by
up to 18 points in the opinion polls.
A year later, Labor MPs are almost unable to contain their surprise at the
prospect of a historic fifth consecutive victory in the next election, which
must be held by June. The latest poll, by Newspoll for The Australian, has
Labor 12 points ahead of the conservatives, compared with a deficit of 12
points at the end of October.
That turnround amounts to a dramatic political success for Keating, and a
stunning rejection of John Hewson, leader of the conservative coalition.
Keating has gradually diverted public attention from Labor's record by
attacking the opposition's taxation and social policies, assassinating the
character of Hewson, now widely known by the Keating nickname of 'feral
abacus', suggesting an out of control computer, and exploiting Australian
nationalism.
His achievement is all the more extraordinary against a background of weak
economic recovery which has raised unemployment to a postwar record of 11.4
per cent and twice forced the government to reduce its growth forecasts.
However, the volatility of the opinion polls suggests that the electorate
has been signalling its dislike of opposition policies as much as approval
for the government. And the opposition has just modified its most
contentious policies in a radical overhaul of its election manifesto - a
fact which could deflate the Keating souffle as fast as it rose.
Second runner-up: Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. When 1992 began, Rabin's Labour
party was in opposition, and he was not even leader of it. Twelve months
later he is firmly esconced as prime minister, leading a government which
believes it has the chance to deliver unprecedented peace with Israel's Arab
neighbours and prosperity at home - although doubts as to his prospects of
doing so in 1993 have increased following the crisis over Israel's expulsion
of 415 Palestinians this month.
Rabin's remarkable political resurrection - he was previously prime minister
in the mid-1970s - was launched in February when he unseated Shimon Peres as
Labour leader in a ballot of party members. The June general election had
already been called and Labour was desperate to avoid a fifth election
failure under Peres.
As army chief of staff when Israel won its victory in the 1967 Six Day War,
Rabin had the credentials to reassure an electorate always nervous about
security issues - and especially about Labour's commitment to trade at least
some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for peace with the
Palestinians. The result was banishment into opposition of the Likud party
for the first time in 15 years and Rabin's triumphant return at the head of
a Labour-led, centre-left coalition.
After six months in office, the breakthrough in the Middle East peace talks
in which Rabin has invested so much political capital has yet to materialise
 -indeed, the current controversy has thrown a dark shadow over the peace
process. But relations with the US and Europe, which fractured under the
Likud, are restored and the peace talks may yet yield agreements in 1993
with the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
Third runner-up, and winner of the John Major Award for emergence from
obscurity, is Hanna Suchocka, who was appointed prime minister of Poland
last summer and has since presided over an impressive, though still fragile,
improvement in her country's economic and political fortunes.
In the first half of this year, Poland was in such a state of government
crisis and economic slump that it risked becoming branded the sick man of
central Europe. The surprise appointment of Suchocka, a tough-minded
46-year-old lawyer from the backbenches, provided a much-needed jolt.
Unsullied by the infighting which has tarnished the Solidarity movement and
the parties it spawned, she rapidly took hold of her ill-matched,
seven-party coalition. Her brisk, no-nonsense manner appealed naturally to a
population weary of factional struggles. Just as important, she managed to
establish a modus vivendi with Lech Walesa, Poland's politically restless
president who was in conflict with most of her predecessors.
Suchocka's arrival happily coincided with the first signs of export-led
growth in the economy. But the advent of the new government also seemed to
engender a new sense of confidence in the country at large, bringing her a
crop of unusually high poll ratings. Buoyed by this support, she was able to
ride out a wave of strikes in the early autumn, after which her government
moved to arrange an 'enterprise pact' with the unions and negotiated a new
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
All these achievements remain tentative. The enterprise pact has still to be
signed, and trade union unrest is growing. Moreover, in the new year the
going may get tougher. Suchocka's popularity is slipping and her backing for
a controversial ban on abortion has cost her support among women. If these
trends continue, the worry is that Poles will again begin to lose faith in
their future, and the will to persevere with free-market reforms will fade
once more.
Finally, three awards for unlikely achievement.
Sub-Saharan Africa has sunk to such a debilitated and impoverished state
that a leader emerging from 1992 with any credit whatsoever has pulled off a
considerable political achievement. One such is Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings,
the 45-year-old Ghanaian who in November managed the transition from
long-serving military leader to civilian president, in an election which was
effectively a referendum on Ghana's structural adjustment programme.
A mixture of fiery radical and hard-headed pragmatist, Rawlings fulminates
against the shortcomings of the west. But he was one of Africa's first
leaders to bite the bullet of economic reform. Since 1983 he has been
implementing a World Bank recovery programme. He made no pretence of
mastering the intricacies of measures he once described as 'economic blah
blah blah'. But he saw no alternative cure for an economy ruined first by
Kwame Nkrumah's autocratic socialism and then hit by the slump in cocoa
prices.
A combination of devaluations, trade liberalisation, reductions in the
budget deficit and cuts in the overstaffed civil service has brought
results. When he went to the polls last month, he could boast an average
real growth rate of 5 per cent a year and an inflation rate down from 123
per cent in 1983 to less than 20 per cent.
However, Ghana has yet to show that it can maintain growth without the
substantial external assistance - more than Dollars 5bn - it has received
since 1983. President Rawlings's toughest test may be yet to come: when aid
falls, will the era of growth come to an end?
In Latin America, some of the bloom came off the continent's better known
recent success stories this year. The leader who made most waves and came
out, surprisingly, in a strengthened position, was Peru's President Alberto
Fujimori, who wins the special award for Most Effective Japanese Leader of
1992. Fujimori's success was relative; after the disasters that have
afflicted Peru in recent years, 1992 could hardly have been worse. None of
the country's problems has gone away, and the economy is again in recession.
The president's behaviour - in suspending the constitution and congress in
April (his autogolpe or self-coup) - was also highly controversial.
Nevertheless, by the end of the year he had manoeuvred himself into a much
more favourable position than at the start. He has regained international
financial support for his economic programme. This involved some
backtracking and the holding of elections, but he was left with a
significantly more pliable Congress. His security forces also dealt a savage
blow to Sendero Luminoso, the fanatical left-wing guerrilla group which has
been posing a growing threat to the Peruvian state, by capturing its
mysterious leader, Abimael Guzman, and parading him - balding, with
middle-aged spread - on television.
The unlikeliest achievement of all in 1992 has to be that of the Kurds of
northern Iraq. Against all the odds, they have remained free and united, in
spite of being victims both of Saddam Hussein's regime and of the UN
sanctions against it, as well as intermittent blockade by Iran, attacks by
fellow Kurds from Turkey, and invasion by Turkish government forces. In May
they elected their own parliament, and they have begun to rebuild their
homes, farms and factories under their own autonomous administration.
Much of the credit for all this is due to their two leaders, Massoud Barzani
and Jalal Talabani, who have overcome decades of rivalry to forge an
effective partnership, symbolised by this year's elections. The result,
certified free and fair by Britain's Electoral Reform Society, was a dead
heat. Each man's party won 50 parliamentary seats, and in the presidential
contest neither won an overall majority. Anywhere else in the third world
this would surely have led to fighting. Instead, the two leaders formed a
coalition and have indefinitely postponed the run-off ballot which should
have decided between them. They have shown statesmanship, too, in ruling out
both independence (which most of their supporters want) and any new talks
with Saddam. Instead they used their enhanced credibility to unite the Iraqi
opposition on a democratic platform with western backing.
Hardest of all, they have been prepared to fight Turkey's Kurdish
separatists (PKK) in order to keep the vital support of the Turkish
government - a policy which paid off in November when the PKK agreed to stop
sabotaging their supplies and to move its forces away from the Turkish
border.
In some places, mere survival is achievement enough to warrant a Plastic
Spoon Prize.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: Where coal presents an environmentally unacceptable
face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A CAWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although David Lascelles addressed a number of major issues on global
pollution in his article, 'The grimy face of coal' (December 29), he failed
to mention the very environmentally unacceptable face of coal which greatly
affects local communities where coal is mined and used in the production of
electricity.
The Selby coalfield, 'the jewel in the crown' of British Coal, was granted
planning permission in 1976. At that time it was stated that the 10m tonnes
output of pure low sulphur coal would go straight to Aire Valley power
stations without any visible coal stacks locally and no colliery waste would
be produced. In reality, we now have a coal mountain of around 0.75m tonnes
and a waste problem which could easily reach 3m tonnes per year, much of
which may have to be disposed of locally.
A planning application is expected early in the New Year to develop 400
acres of prime agricultural land adjacent to the one at South Kilford as a
colliery waste disposal site. According to present estimates, this will only
meet the needs of the Selby coal field for about 12 years. The planning
application may be determined by the county council as Selby is not a
unitary authority and local residents have real fears, as your article
predicts, that environmental considerations will be secondary to the
national energy policy and the privatisation the coal industry.
The introduction of the Uniform Business Rate removes any financial
advantage from coal mining to the local community which accrued under the
old rating system. Selby then faces the environmental problem without any
recompense flowing from the grant mechanism.
No doubt your writer is correct when he states that, 'a balanced answer to
the coal dilemma would have to include measures to make coal more
environmentally acceptable'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If, when your son reached nine, you discovered that he had been swapped at
birth, would you want to keep the boy you had brought up or exchange him for
your whiter-skinned biological son? This may have been one of the most
momentous years in Brazilian history, climaxing in the world's first
impeachment trial of an elected president, but the real dilemma exercising
the nation concerns the plot of the top soap opera.
Even more than football and samba, soap operas or novelas as they are known,
are a national obsession, drawing audiences of up to 80m each day. On TV
Globo, the main channel and home of the best novelas, more than three of the
four peak-time hours from 6pm to 10pm are devoted to soaps, and seven out of
10 TV sets tune in nightly.
As each six-month serial reaches its close, restaurants empty at viewing
time and, whether on the bus or in boardrooms, people talk of little else.
Executives' lunches start with heated discussions on who should keep which
son before progressing to minor matters such as 1,500 per cent inflation or
the president's impeachment.
For Brazil, 1992 has been the year of the soap opera - in real life as much
as on the television screen. In classic novela behaviour, the president's
jealous younger brother denounced him for corruption, sparking off a filial
feud which sent their mother into a coma. Young Pedro Collor's motivation
was apparently a past attempt to seduce his wife by Fernando, the glamorous
head of state who loves dangerous sports.
Moreover, the street campaign which ultimately brought Collor down was
fuelled by a mini-novela. Anos rebeldes (Rebel Years), about protests in the
1960s against military repression, encouraged students to take to the
streets singing its theme song.
That a novela could, however unwittingly, help topple an elected president
shows their influence. Rio psychoanalyst Alberto Goldein explains: 'They not
only provide escapism from economic and psychological problems but also have
enormous impact on the behaviour of people, particularly given the general
lack of education.'
This can range from simply copying an actor's hairstyle to far more radical
effects. After the heroine in De Corpo e Alma (Body and Soul), the melodrama
currently gripping the nation, almost died from heart disease and was saved
by a transplant, the number of donors increased rapidly. The high incidence
of children mixed up at birth exposed by the novela has forced hospitals to
introduce DNA testing. In a challenge to the nation's machismo, De Corpo e
Alma has introduced the concept of the 'male-object', inspiring male strip
clubs to spring up all over Brazil, attracting middle-class women.
Gloria Perez, writer of De Corpo e Alma and an old novela hand, believes,
'novelas have a social function in putting themes into discussion and
confronting taboos as well as fulfilling an important educational role
compensating for the inadequacy of institutions'.
For instance, characters always wash their hands before eating and practise
safe sex. A pre-Christmas episode, showing characters taking gifts to a
children's hospital, inspired a flood of donations.
Brazilian novelas are highly topical. All through the Collorgate scandal the
most popular novela was Deus Nos Acuda (God Help Us), a satire on corruption
which showed the characters drowning in a symbolic sea of mud as the opening
shot. It told of a wayward angel, appointed as guardian of Brazil, who falls
foul of the divine authorities because of the moral and economic turpitude
into which the country descends. Throughout the run-up to impeachment,
scenes were being written and aired within two days to keep up with the
latest twists in the real-life scandal.
It is not just their topicality that makes novelas such a success. Daily
polls are carried out to monitor audience reaction and storylines or
characters are altered accordingly so that in effect the viewers almost
write their own script. Perez employs a researcher to queue in shops and
banks, sit on buses and chat to unsuspecting strangers about novelas.
Ironically the idea of airing novelas at peak viewing time was an accident.
In 1969, Walter Clark, then director of TV Globo, had a programme scheduled
for 9.30pm kept off the air by the censors. He was left with no option but
to screen an imported novela. It was a huge success and in the 1970s Globo
started making its own soaps, moving from traditional tearjerkers to topical
themes. It began filming on location rather than on sets and attracting top
actors, gradually building up an industry which made Brazil one of the
world's top exporters of TV programme.
Brazilian Novelas can be seen from Bulgaria to Canada, Cuba to the United
States and Malaysia to South Africa. Jorge Adib, head of novela marketing at
Globo, claims 'we permanently have one of our novelas showing in practically
every country'. Only the English have proved resistant.
The climax of the Collor novela came on Tuesday when the disgraced former
President resigned just before impeachment hearings. Although his younger
brother is now writing a grand expose, this year's events are not likely to
end up on screen. 'It's just too unbelievable,' says Perez.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Do not adjust your sets: As Britain's new television
companies prepare to switch on, Raymond Snoddy assesses their potential
impact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The staff of Thames Television will put on their best clothes tonight to go
out in style. By the time the last bong of Big Ben greets the new year, the
largest ITV company will have handed over to Carlton Television and become
Britain's largest independent producer.
For many viewers, the opening of A Carlton New Year with Chris Tarrant, Paul
McCartney and London pop maestros Squeeze, not to mention 'the crazy antics
of Canadian funny man Marty Putz', will be the first outward sign of three
years of turmoil and government intervention in ITV. For some, it turned out
to be an opportunity, for others a nightmare.
Away from the screen, not much will be different. A pre-programmed computer
at the Post Office Tower will simply make the switch from one company to the
other, but the moment will still mark the start of the long-awaited
revolution in commercial television - Mrs Thatcher's revolution.
As a result of the government's insistence on competitive tenders for ITV
licences which were up for renewal in 1991, four companies lost their
franchises, more money is going to the Treasury from ITV than ever before,
and more than 1,000 jobs have been lost as winning companies axed costs to
try to stay in profit. From tomorrow Channel 4 will also be competing rather
than collaborating with ITV in advertising sales.
Just after midnight Carlton will be joined by two other new kids on the ITV
block - Meridian in the south and south-east of England, and Westcountry
Television. At 6am, Good Morning Television will take over the breakfast
franchise from TV-am.
The broadcasting world is already dividing into two camps on the subject of
ITV. There are those who believe that the network has been taken over by
accountants and will in future be unremittingly populist and ratings-driven.
On the other hand, many feel that in the face of increasing competition from
satellite and cable television the move to more cost-effective television
was inevitable - and anyway the changes will not be all that great.
'The continuity will be huge,' insists Peter Ibbotson, director of
communications at Carlton and a former deputy managing director of BBC
Television.
Apart from the new year variety show the first flavour of a Carlton
programme will come at 4.15pm on new year's day with Surprise Party. A
celebrity will be confronted by a host of friends and colleagues who will
tell stories of his or her life, favourite things and songs. The show will
include secretly filmed footage. A taxi-driver who is not really a
taxi-driver will try to provoke the celebrity into revealing something of
themselves.
The programme will undoubtedly be a surprise to the celebrity involved, but
hardly to the viewer. Not only will it be presented by Michael Parkinson,
one of the most familiar faces on British television, but nobody is
attempting to disguise the fact that this is a reworked version of one of
the oldest programmes on British television, This Is Your Life, which will
still pop up on Wednesday evenings, made by Thames, the independent
producer.
'It's not a rip-off. It's just another way of doing it. We have to look at
potential replacements for long-running formats,' says Paul Jackson,
director of programmes at Carlton.
Another programme with a familiar face will be Carlton's Good Getaways,
which it hopes could be a potential replacement for Wish You Were Here, the
holiday programme with an average audience of 13m also made by Thames.
'Some of the good, but oldest, shows just happen to be Thames shows,' says
Jackson innocently, sitting in his pink office with five television sets,
four to keep an eye on what is happening on the four national channels and
the other for London News Network.
Not every show is based on a tried and tested formula, however. Carlton's
100 hours of new network programmes for the first 35 weeks of 1993 range
from from Head Over Heels, a rock and roll drama set in the 1950s, to The
Good Sex Guide.
At Carlton's headquarters London's West End theatreland, the changes
transforming ITV can barely be seen. Carlton's office are just - well -
offices. They could just as well be occupied by an insurance company. There
are no studios, and no programmes are being made. Carlton is a publisher
broadcaster - essentially a commissioning house - directly employing about
300, compared with the 1,500 staff Thames had until recently for making its
own programmes.
It is at LNN where the new face of independent television can best be seen.
Carlton and London Weekend Television have together invested Pounds 14m to
create a computerised transmission and broadcasting centre. The network, run
by Mr Clive Jones, a refugee from TVS, which lost its franchise to Meridian,
will give Londoners an integrated seven-day television news operation on ITV
for the first time.
The newcomers are all increasing regional news output. Meridian is adding a
third news centre in Newbury to cover the Thames Valley, and Westcountry
will have no fewer than seven local news studios.
The main purpose of LNN is to bring national network news standards to bear
on London Tonight, a 6pm-7pm, weekday news magazine for the region. But the
news complex in LWT's London headquarters will also transmit all the output
of Carlton, LWT and GMTV, the first time there has been such co-operation in
London between ITV companies. Such co-operation is the shape of the future
in a federal ITV system, where once there were 15 sets of everything - one
for each company.
Some observers still think the companies which bid high to win their
franchises will fail before 1993 is out as the recession continues to bite
into advertising revenues. But the signs are that this will not happen
unless the recession deepens: HTV believes it is out of the woods after
taking Pounds 12m a year out of its costs; nearly 300 jobs have been shed
following the merger between Yorkshire and Tyne Tees; GMTV has booked more
than Pounds 50m in advertising before it goes on air - enough to cover its
bid of Pounds 34.6m a year and the 15 per cent of its revenue it must pay to
the Treasury.
Carlton, which bid Pounds 43.2m, is under budget. Its cash requirement will
peak at Pounds 80m in the summer of 1993 at Pounds 20m lower than expected.
At ITV's central commissioning centre in London - another big innovation for
the network - Andrew Quinn, chief executive of ITV, is becoming more
optimistic. His big worry, that some of the high bidders would be too short
of cash to sign up for their share of the Pounds 515m-a-year network budget,
has not been realised. The sum is less than the Independent Television
Commission, the commercial television regulator, suggested, but it is the
same as last year's figure increased for inflation.
Quinn believes that Pounds 515m is enough to capitalise on ITV's unique
selling point: its prime-time schedule, which has been taking a 42 per cent
share of viewing figures and routinely trouncing the BBC in the ratings. ITV
executives admit the network is going to be more populist, more determined
to produce ratings winners and more responsive in a more competitive
broadcasting market to the clients who pay for it all - the advertisers.
ITV has been publishing prospective ratings figures on new programmes for
advertisers, and executives from the new franchise holders have been
explaining their objectives to advertising agencies.
So far, however, controversial programme casualties are few. The Sunday
night 'God slot' - reserved for religious topics - moves out of prime time
to make way for a film, while This Week, the award-winning Thames Television
current affairs programme is replaced by Carlton's Storyline. In what some
see as a suicidal manoeuvre, Storyline moves from 8.30pm to play against
EastEnders, the BBC's most popular programme.
'It's been given a protected slot,' says Andrew Quinn. As a result, it will
not be expected to deliver the 8m or so expected from Granada's World in
Action. ITV is still required under its licence terms to show current
affairs but pressure may increase to move them from prime time if audiences
drop.
Three years ago Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, hoped he could save
80 per cent of ITV's existing range and quality of programmes in the face of
growing competition and the government's policy of competitive tenders which
he did not approve of. 'I think the 80 per cent should hold,' says Sir
George, though largely through an improved regional service balancing the
popular programmes on offer during prime time.
'We have the job of making sure that what they offer is diverse and we will
be chasing that all the time,' Sir George promises.
Apart from the growth of regionalism, the ITC chairman believes 'an
unusually challenging mix' is emerging, which should keep ITV strong by
broadening its programme sources. As well as the two new commissioning
houses, Carlton and Meridian, there are the continuing 12 ITV companies,
many of whom will still make a substantial number of programmes in-house,
and Thames Television, offering both old and new programmes to the network
centre.
For Sir George there are still two important items of unfinished business.
One is the ITV appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission against the
Office of Fair Trading's rejection of its central networking arrangements
with independent producers. The OFT claimed that the terms under which the
network buys programmes from independent producers are anti-competitive. The
second item is the question of ownership of ITV companies. From January 1
1994, ITV companies can be taken over by European Community companies, yet
in the UK the nine largest cannot acquire each other. Though some industry
insiders believe ultimate ownership is irrelevant to carrying out regional
broadcasting obligations, Sir George will be raising the issue with the
government.
Tonight, as A Carlton New Year opens, European broadcasters may be starting
to look towards takeovers in the UK. For Nigel Walmsley, managing director
of Carlton Television, it will be the culmination of more than two years'
hard work. For both Carlton, and the other ITV companies, it is unlikely to
be the end of change.
'Market forces, different government policies and technology will keep
broadcasting in a state of semi-permanent revolution,' Mr Walmsley predicts.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Thorp in trouble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels must fear that its Thorp plant at Sellafield is a
Christmas present it will never unwrap. The Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant
for reprocessing nuclear fuel has taken nearly 10 years and about Pounds
2.8bn to build, but the government is now seriously considering whether it
should be allowed to start up.
The Inspectorate of Pollution is near the end of the formal process of
authorisation, but the government has rightly judged that there are large
economic, industrial and foreign policy issues at stake and commenced wider
consultations.
The arguments for reprocessing have changed since Thorp was given the
go-ahead by the 1977 Windscale enquiry. Re-processing splits out reusable
uranium and plutonium from 'spent' fuel, leaving a residue of
highly-radioactive waste. However uranium is still plentiful and cheap,
contrary to fears a decade ago, and the suspension of research into
fast-breeder nuclear reactors by the UK and France has removed much of the
civil demand for plutonium. Meanwhile international concern that countries
will acquire it for military uses has increased. Given the high costs of
reprocessing, storage looks an increasingly attractive alternative.
Those changes cast doubt on the economic case for Thorp. BNFL argues that
all of Thorp's capacity is booked for the next decade and 40 per cent for
the decade after. On the basis of a report by consultants Touche Ross, it
claims that the contracts are worth at least Pounds 900m in future cashflow
at today's prices, after accounting for operating and decommissioning costs.
However it is unclear how much weight should be placed on those projections.
Decommissioning costs for Thorp arise the moment the first load of fuel
enters the plant, making much of the quarter-mile-long structure
radioactive. BNFL suggests these costs could run to Pounds 1.2bn, but has
declined to say how long a life it assumes Thorp will have, and so over what
period these costs should be spread.
Moreover, two thirds of BNFL's contracts are with overseas customers, whose
commitment may have begun to weaken. Thorp's German orders arose from a law
which may be changed next year and Japan intended to feed the plutonium from
its reprocessed waste into now delayed fast-breeder reactors. If customers
pulled out, BNFL would receive compensation, but Thorp's prospects would be
badly damaged. But the option of abandoning Thorp is in turn complicated by
the fact that its construction has been financed almost entirely by
prepayments from customers.
It is premature to judge Thorp's future, but it is clear a new set of
environmental and economic objections must be addressed by an open and lucid
analysis of the facts. Early publication of the Touche Ross report would be
a start.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush, who made the phrase 'new world order' fashionable in
the autumn of 1990, quietly dropped it one year later, presumably because it
had raised unrealistically high expectations. Indeed, in 1992 the phrase has
come to ring uncomfortably hollow, especially in Europe. In an article in
yesterday's Daily Telegraph the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd,
referred aptly enough to 'the new world disorder', a phrase popularised
earlier in the year by the French strategic analyst, Pierre Lellouche.
To Mr Hurd has fallen the task of managing the foreign policy of one of the
five permanent members of the UN Security Council. He has thus found himself
at the heart of such inchoate world order as there is. ' 'Something must be
done.' That is,' - he said in a speech last September - 'an impulse which we
all feel, and we should realise where that impulse leads us. It leads to the
repainting of parts of the map of the world in new colours - but this time
the blue of the UN rather than the red of England or the green of France or
Russia.' The concept of 'benevolent international interventionism' might, he
conceded, be attractive, 'but we should not wander down the new road without
serious thought.' It would involve a restructuring of armed forces and a
massive increase in the funds required from member states by the UN and its
humanitarian agencies.
Clearly he was, and remains, uncertain how big a burden of this type public
opinion in Britain, or in other countries, would be willing to shoulder. His
instinct is to fall back on diplomacy; to emphasise (as he did in
yesterday's article) that 'war cannot be the eventual arbiter between Serb,
Croat, Moslem or Albanian any more than it can between Israel and the
Arabs'.
Yet the article also revealed a foreign secretary painfully aware of his own
argument's inadequacy. The trouble is, of course, that in the past war has
all too often been 'the eventual arbiter' between parties in conflict, and
the Serbs clearly believe that it can be so in Bosnia. Up to now the war has
gone mainly their way, with horrific consequences for the Bosnia Moslems;
and unless the balance of force is changed by outside intervention, the
'peace process' Mr Hurd favours can only ratify, or at best minimally
adjust, the results of the war process.
So Mr Hurd finds himself playing 'soft cop' to the 'hard cop' of his
American colleague, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger. He does not quite tell the
Serbs he is on their side, but he dilates at length on his own dislike of
military intervention, only to conclude by warning the Serbs that their
conduct has 'brought even those of us who hold that view to the point where
we can imagine armed action against them'. If this convinces the Serb
leadership that the threat of such action is real and that they must retreat
quickly in order to avoid it, well and good. But the constant display of
doubt, by one of the main powers that will be called on to take armed action
if it happens, has helped ensure that previous threats were not taken
seriously, and may have that effect again.
Mr Hurd's anxieties about the use of force are legitimate. But he should be
aware that the public airing of such doubts is not the best way to instil
respect. Those whose task it is to enforce world order need to speak with
greater self-confidence and firmness - in a word, with greater authority.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRACY HAS lost in Kenya's first multi-party poll for 26 years. Should
the government of President Daniel arap Moi retain power, its claim to
legitimacy will be based on an election process that was not free and fair.
The consequences for Kenya are unpredictable, but include a grave threat of
instability. The failure of democracy in Kenya, once a role model for
Africa, will have serious implications for stability in the region and for
other transitions to democracy across the continent.
At best Kenya's angry opposition might settle for a strong parliamentary
opposition which the country did not have before. But the millions of voters
who queued so patiently deserve better. The west could have done more to
ensure that they got it; and in doing so, it would have given greater
credibility to 'conditionality' - the policy that links aid to democracy and
accountability in recipient states. Just over a year ago, Kenya's leading
donors froze aid, calling for economic and political reform. Within a month
President Moi lifted the ban on opposition parties.
Had those governments followed up their concerns by combining practical
assistance with insistence that the election machinery be taken out of the
hands of the ruling party, Kanu, the electoral abuses that were to follow
could have been avoided.
In the run-up to the election more than 40 opposition candidates were
prevented from presenting nomination papers, leaving the ruling party
unopposed in 15 constituencies in the 188 member parliament. Then followed
the suspicious 'defection' of more than 40 candidates to Kanu. Civil
servants acted as party apparatchiks. State-controlled radio and television
fell well short of impartiality. Opposition allegations that state funds had
been diverted to Kanu are unproven but certainly warrant investigation.
Kenya thus presents the Commonwealth, which is monitoring the election, with
a critical test of the declaration made at its 1991 summit in Harare,
Zimbabwe. This reaffirmed shared values of democracy and promised action in
their support.
Monitoring the elections of member governments is a valuable way of putting
the declaration into effect. If in its report on the election, the
Commonwealth group fudges its conclusion and fails to make clear that the
conduct of the election has been unacceptable, it will not only have done a
disservice to Kenya. The Harare declaration and the new Commonwealth will
have failed its first real test.

A FEW GOOD MEN (15)
Rob Reiner
THE BODYGUARD (15)
Mick Jackson
When American freedom and democracy are in peril, the red telephone rings in
Hollywood. National Security gets straight through to Central Casting and
ensures that the right man gets the right job. But this has been the holiday
season - no one at the right desks - and for a while it looked dicey for two
rival crises. These were the Guantanamo Bay Murder Enquiry and the Save
Whitney Houston Project.
Regarding the first: Who shall we get to confront the suspected villain in
Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men? He is Colonel Jack Nicholson and he might have
ordered the covert murder of a young Marine who was privy to a border
shooting incident in America's Cuban base. Now the murderers are on trial,
the Colonel is involved and we need a handsome, Galahadish lawyer to expose
him.
Sounds like a job for Kevin Costner, last seen pleading for Western
democracy and fresh supplies of glycerine in JFK. But then Costner could be
saved for the title job in Mick Jackson's The Bodyguard. Lean, macho,
all-American, with that Mogadon whine of a midwest voice, Costner is an
ideal co-star for glamorous black singer-turned-actress Whitney Houston,
here stretching herself in her first straight role to play a glamorous black
singer-turned-actress.
Rachel Marron (Houston) is under threat from an assassin who sends hate
mail. She will only make it to the climactic Oscar ceremony if a brave man
protects her all the way. National Security's first casting thought was Tom
Cruise - but this might have meant Nicole Kidman in blackface as the singer.
So why not give Cruise the courtroom brief in A Few Good Men (no romance)
and Costner the mission to control Houston? Twenty minutes of red telephone
work and Washington is satisfied.
Whether filmgoers will be is something else. These two movies are high-style
pulp from a writer (Lawrence Kasdan on Bodyguard) and a director (Rob Reiner
on A Few Good Men) who should know better. Reiner for a while seems to know
better. Adapting a play by Aaron Sorkin that ran for so long on Broadway
that everyone forgot how close it was to The Caine Mutiny, he freshens it
with fleet-footed staging and star acting.
Cruise is in fifth gear from the start as the Navy lawyer hero, a
playboy-cynic who plea-bargains his way through courts and into female
colleagues' beds. Only Lt Commander Demi Moore declines to recline. She
wants him to wake up, grow up and take on the case she is investigating
about a Marine base shooting. Meanwhile, out there in Cuba, Jack Nicholson's
teeth and medals are flashing as if he were the Devil dancing in the pale
moonlight.
A Few Good Men is potholed with predictability. Are we meant to doubt that
Cruise will come good? Or that Cruise and Moore, though they never clinch,
will exchange starry-eyed looks at the close? Or that Nicholson, the man
with chips on his shoulders to go with the scrambled egg, will be the Fiend
Behind It All?
Somehow the film still rattles along, taking us with it like onlookers whose
coat-tails are caught in the tread of a tank. Cruise and Nicholson perform
their pre-fabricated roles as if they thought they were fresh off the
drawing-board: the youngster all face-cracking eagerness and wisecracking
zeal, the oldster dipping his grins in sulphur and his rage in saltpetre. As
for director Rob Reiner, he still has enough loose-change humanism from
earlier (better) films like When Harry Met Sally to give this juggernaut the
occasional jingle of wit, charm and spontaneity.
The Bodyguard is in more serious trouble. For forty minutes it is sleek as a
Chandler thriller. Into that existential beyond called Beverly Hills comes
ex-White House protection agent Frank Farmer (Costner). Yes, he admits he
failed to save Reagan from near-assassination back in 1980-whatever. But he
was off-duty at the time and anyway a pop star is not a President. So
Costner and Houston meet, put up the barred gates and video cameras and then
 -still 90 minutes to go - fall in love.
As anyone knows who has been a bodyguard, you cannot guard someone and fall
in love. Your eyes will melt into theirs; you will use your samurai sword
romantically to slice in two their blue silk scarf as it flutters from the
ceiling; you will make passionate love: you will not, in short, be on the
qui vive. So the difficulties accumulate. Costner and Houston try to escape
being shot by going North to stay with his Dad. But Houston's sister is
shot. They escape South to the Oscars, but Debbie Reynolds is nearly shot.
Finally it is time for Costner to hurl himself across Houston's body as
bullets ping and to perform (almost) the ultimate sacrifice.
British director Mick Jackson (LA Story) treats the twenty-year-old
screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Body Heat) as a
licence to print funny money. The Bank of Hollywood currency is here in
full, fearlessly counterfeit circulation. The glutinous close-ups of
multi-million-dollar stars; the richly twaddlesome supporting roles sketched
in by Gary Kemp (PR person), Thomas Arana (suspect psycho) and Michele Lamar
Richards (shot sister); and the satyriastic crane shots that plunge and soar
all over the heroine's pink-washed, super-rich mansion.
But like A Few Good Men the film is never unwatchable: whenever credibility
flags incredulity takes over. These are movies to start the year happily.
Things can only get more sensible, but who begrudges a few hours of holiday
mood before they do?

Television has never quite mastered New Year's Eve. Having abandoned that
ghastly Scotch trifle that they used to serve up, they have found nothing
obviously suitable to take its place, though Clive James does his best.
Tonight those without an invitation to the sought-after Krichevski New
Year's Eve party will no doubt end up watching Clive James On 1992 (10.20
BBC1). Jokes are promised about Ross Perot, Madonna, Norman Lamont, and
Antonia de Sancha. Well, you could always try reviving the hand-bell
tradition ..
Earlier ITV shows Murder At The Farm (7.00), a programme about the Carl
Bridgewater case, written and presented by Paul Foot. Bridgewater was the
paper boy murdered in 1978; Foot (like Ludovic Kennedy) has spent large
parts of his life investigating what seem to him to be miscarriages of
justice. BBC2 tells the story of Kurt Weill in the US in
I'm A Stranger Here Myself (8.00). Weill went to the US in 1935 and had to
adapt his style, somewhat anyway, to the demands of Broadway.
Best offer of the night is Monty Python And The Holy Grail (BBC2, 10.00)
with Cleese, Palin, Idle etc.
Kurt Weill enthusiasts will be pleased on New Year's day to find BBC2
devoting two and a half hours to Street Scene (6.00), the ENO production of
his 1946 'American opera' with Janice Cairns and Lesley Garrett as Anna and
Rose Maurant. The rest of us, who find some of Weill's early German material
just about tolerable and his American work tedious, can leave the set
switched off until 8.30 when C4's arts and culture series, Without Walls,
promises to lay bare the truth about Sid James, sidekick to Tony Hancock and
one of the chief stalwarts of the 'Carry On' series.
A Cry In The Dark is a feature film about the 'dingo baby case': the
extraordinary business which rocked Australia in 1980 when a mother claimed
her child had been taken by a wild dog. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep play the
parents who were tried for murder.
BBC1 begins another batch of the successful drama series Love Hurts (9.00)
in which Adam Faith plays the successful plumber turned businessman and Zoe
Wanamaker is the high powered charity executive who tries to withstand his
attention. Funniest programme of the night promises to be 60 minutes of Rory
Bremner (10.00 C4).

FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: Ashton's indestructible 'Cinderella' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be no better Christmas fare in London than Frederick Ashton's
romantic, funny, dreaming, brilliant 1948 three-act ballet Cinderella.
Charming on first encounter, it rewards multiple viewings. Despite the
celebrity of its earliest interpreters (Ashton and Robert Helpmann continued
as the Ugly Sisters until 1976), it succeeds with several casts at each
revival. Even if the comedy flounders, even if Cinders and her Prince fail
to convince as love's young dream, the ballet still offers endlessly
absorbing choreography.
The scene that best repays repeated viewing is Act Two - the ballroom. This
is a strangely intense realm, mysteriously sophisticated. Steps ricochet
around in beguiling theme-and-variations patterns as if this were a hall of
dance mirrors. Why are the Prince's four gentleman dancing steps that we saw
the Season fairies dance in Act One? Who are these courtiers, endlessly
echoing the steps and characteristics of the Jester, or the Prince and his
friends, or Cinderella and her fairy retinue?
How come Cinderella - who in the kitchen was the beating heart of the whole
ballet - is now the most mysterious and elevated person in the whole
ballroom? Why is the choreography often turned around, so that we keep
seeing the dancers' backs instead of their faces? Through all this
shimmering neoclassic construction blunder the vain, hapless Ugly Sisters,
in desperate pursuit of all remotely eligible members of the male sex.
Everything - including the peculiar staccato emphasis of the steps - keeps
accumulating. Till midnight: when the most thrilling, most terrifying
episode of the whole ballet occurs. Time catches up with Cinderella; and
hems her in. Fairies, courtiers, jester, prince all bar her way, trap her,
keep hammering down steps into the floor and into the music's twelve
midnight strokes of doom.
As danced today, the roles of the Ugly Sisters are weary collections of
stale business. In this season's first two casts, only Derek Rencher is
tolerable - a credible gorgon, looking like the Duchess in Alice - though he
has no real wit. But David Bintley's funny walk is unfunny; and Steven Wicks
and Oliver Symons are worse. These sisters have been conceived without
affection, or coherent detail. Facial mugging abounds; the steps are
under-danced. The clue to these characters lies in their choreography. (If
you want to see how the Oompah Trot should look, watch Gracie Allen in the
1937 Astaire movie A Damsel in Distress.)
Cinderella, however, remains a beautiful role - and challenging. Viviana
Durante (first cast) shows dance detail of ravishing clarity and liquidity.
This performance, in terms of three-act stamina and musical timing, marks a
new high in her career. So what do I miss amid all her accomplishments? A
certain through-the-body decisiveness - and sheer heart. Cinderella, like
all Ashton characters, has a real nervous system: which only entered Durante
as she recalled the ball in Act Three. Her Prince, Bruce Sansom, could not
have been more pretty or correct or Charming; but as a romantic hero he is
all too Phillip Schofield.
The Bolshoi guest artist Nina Ananiashvili, though coping much less
perfectly with the role's footwork and musical timing, is one of nature's
Cinderellas - forlorn in the kitchen, blithe in the ballroom, tender and
generous. I love her natural expansiveness, the elegant mobility of her
torso, and her sweet good manners. Stuart Cassidy - always a model of virile
charm, though slightly too solemn and with no particular brilliance -
partnered her beautifully. No prince in this ballet has been so believable
since David Wall.
Though Cinderella is among the most indestructible ballets Ashton made, the
omens for its future are not cheering. As in The Dream this winter, there
are few dancers amid the Royal's current corps or soloists who have the
fleet, neat footwork or vigorous torso called for by Ashton choreography.
Rarest of all is the knack of coordinating upper and lower body to rich and
intricate effect; and without strain. As the Jester, Tetsuya Kumakawa - in
no way an Ashton stylist - spins like a top, jumps like a gnat, grins like a
chimp and is wholly unbearable. No texture, and no humanity.
The most elusive dance in the whole ballet is the Fairy Godmother's solo,
because its musical phrasing (fast, to a slow melody) picks out a
near-inaudible beat; Nicola Tranah is miscast in speed so delicate. Among
the four season fairies, Karen Paisey (Spring) is pert and wispy, Genesia
Rosato glamorous but insecure. Darcey Bussell dances with grand sweep, but
with (her only serious flaw) a tight upper torso. The most exemplary dancing
in the whole ballet came from Nicola Roberts (Autumn). Clean, light attack;
youthful verve; natural harmony; musical incisiveness. Unless more people
start to dance her way, Ashton's ballets at Covent Garden will die in our
time.
In repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, until February 3

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Western is dead: long live Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. The heyday of
the animated feature was 40 years ago: enter Beauty And The Beast. Woody
Allen stopped making side-splitting self-portraits with Annie Hall and
Manhattan: welcome, Husbands And Wives.
Cinema is exhilarating because you can never out-guess it. The art that
earns its living by defying the laws of time - by re-enacting the past as an
animated present - defies the clock in other ways. Just when you think a
genre is 20 years past its resuscitate-by date (the Western), it jumps out
from the morgue with six-guns firing. And just when you thought the Golden
Age of feature cartoons was buried with Mr Walt Disney, Mr D's heirs perform
a piece of necromancy that would have Walt himself applauding in wonder.
If Unforgiven and Beauty And The Beast are top films in the Ghosts of Genres
Past event, Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives proves the truth of a
well-known Andrews proverb: Truth is stranger than fiction until fiction is
given a proper chance to prove itself. Allen's comedy of splintering
relationships is more cogent, more enthralling, more surprising, more
merciless and (goodness knows) more funny than any of the real events
relating to this year's most famous showbiz furore.
'Real,' of course, usually means as reported by the newspapers. And how real
is that? Even I, unsaved by fact-checkers, once referred in an article to
Woody's almost-fosterdaughter - she with whom he has been romantically
involved - as Sun-Li. Should have been Soon-Yi. But there we go: facts turn
to factoids with no malice aforethought. Which brings us to a second notable
feature of 1992 in the cinema. What was historically real and what was not,
and should we care?
Christopher Columbus, a bisexual Italian Jew (not many of those
characteristics got into the movies), bestrode the Atlantic in three
different films. He was Gerard Depardieu, George Coraface and Jim Dale; and
his story was celebrated for no better reason than that the sun had risen
1,825,000 times, not counting leap years, since the original Columbus
crossed the Ocean in 1492.
That was a trip that would lead ultimately to the discovery of Hollywood.
And therein, doubtless, lay the film world's infatuation with this explorer.
Columbus beached his landing boat in October 1492: the shudder in the sand
engendering there Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the Walk
Of Fame, Francis The Talking Mule, Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin . . .
And let us stop there again. Of the two CCs who became raw feed for the
year's bio-pic bonanza Chaplin could be called the real messiah of the
American Dream, working for 40 years inside its very factory, and Columbus
his several-centuries-before John the Baptist. The Columbus film-makers were
clearly frustrated that they could not get their hero to California. So in
the case of the best film, Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest Of Paradise, they
did the Hollywoodish next-best thing. They 'put on the show right there.'
Part two of Scott's film was a wonderful visual extravaganza: a knees-up of
the imagination that saw Columbus as a battered eco-hero before his time, at
bay against savages noble and ignoble. The 'facts' wilted before the
onslaught of thrillingly choreographed half-facts.
No such luck or licence with Chaplin. The dominion of the checkable fact
spreads across his whole life. So all Sir Richard Attenborough could do,
apart from casting a charismatic curly-top from America as Charlie, was to
have a framing device that nibbled at the edges of biographical record.
(Anthony Hopkins played the hovering editor.)
This raised an important question. If the cinema cannot play fast and loose
with history, should it bother to play with it at all? Since the average
bio-pic based on a recent-times subject cannot present any warts in its hero
 -only Lux-clear complexions, it seems, will keep most filmgoers in their
seats - perhaps we should insist that the form eschew subjects less than 100
years old. At that point the films usually feel free to demonise or
mythologise, or at least to do justice to their subject's faults. If Chaplin
felt inhibited by the freshness of history or the propinquity of Chaplin's
surviving family, perhaps it should have waited until it did not.
Not that 100-year rulings are needed with all films. Look at the strength
that freedom with truth gave to some truth-based films: Bugsy, The Long Day
Closes, Swoon, The Best Intentions, Husbands And Wives. Though none 'lied',
all pushed, pounded and poeticised the facts until they turned to art. Bugsy
was a dazzling free-form fresco of gangster life in Lotusland. Terence
Davies's Liverpool auto-biopic, haunted by music and the movies, presented a
childhood made mythic by memory. Tom Kallin's Swoon saw the Leopold-Loeb
murder case through a shivered glass of new perspectives. And in The Best
Intentions screenwriter Ingmar Bergman turned his parents' courtship and
marriage into an epic of glowing Strindbergian power.
Fidelity, whether to biographical truth or to literary text, is a pedant's
virtue. At best, in adaptation movies like Howard's End and Glengarry Glen
Ross, one admires the skill with which a film-maker holds the horses steady
while a series of distinguished actors jump on their backs. Sometimes, too,
fidelity is shocked into life by a blast-of-the-real as a story leaves
printed page for great outdoors: as in Bruce Beresford's spectacular film of
Brian Moore's Black Robe.
But the year's best films have been those where framing constraints are so
boldly breached that we feel, Columbus-like, that we are sailing to the edge
of known aesthetic world. Husbands And Wives threw away the recent Allen
style of join-the-dots psychodrama for a searingly funny cine-verite
rampage. Unforgiven went far, and then went further, in unmasking the Old
West as an place of barbarism. And Beauty And The Beast startled Disney
observers by stretching the cartoon form to include not just
state-of-the-art computer imaging but a strong-willed heroine for our
feminist times. Disney has gone even further in its new Aladdin, just opened
in the US, where the princess resembles some gangbusting female executive
from Century City.
Meanwhile from Europe three films - Rivette's portrait of an artist La Belle
Noiseuse, Kieslowski's schizophrenic love story The Double Life Of Veronique
and Lars Von Trier's neo-Gothic Euro-fable Europa - also took us on strange
trips. The films resembled those unnerving taxi journeys where you know that
you are being led the long way round but are soon mesmerised by seeing all
the things you never saw before.
Ten years ago we were all assailed with stories of the cinema's decrepitude.
It was given six months to live by some, six hours by others. It still has
ailments that should be cured: not least a self-referential fin de siecle
narcissism already noted in these pages. But that the cinema will survive
into the new millennium now seems beyond doubt. Here are ten good reasons
why.
Unforgiven, Beauty And The Beast, Husbands And Wives, La Belle Noiseuse, The
Rapture, The Long Day Closes, Europa, The Double Life Of Veronique, Raise
The Red Lantern, Black Robe.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: Either foreign, classic - or both - Best of the
theatre in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year that started with Tony Kushner's epic Angels in America at the
National and ended with Adrian Noble's production of Hamlet at the Barbican
can hardly have been a bad one for theatre in Britain. Angels had an
intellectual spread in the writing and an artistic depth in the performance
rarely to be found in tandem. The same can be said of Hamlet, though Noble
had a better text to start with.
There were at least 10 other productions that will remain indelibly in the
memory. I list them in the order in which they appeared.
Gregory Hersov's production of Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange,
Manchester, where there was a strikingly wild Romeo played by Michael Sheen,
probably the first to enter drinking from a bottle of Jack Daniels.
Uncle Vanya at the National's Cottesloe Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias
with Sir Ian McKellen as Vanya and the entire cast playing to a perfection
you will seldom see again. The pity was that there were so few performances.
Dejavu by John Osborne at the Comedy Theatre where the Jimmy Porter of Look
Back in Anger reappeared in middle age and was as articulate as ever.
Six Degrees of Separation by John Guare at the Royal Court, which showed the
American talent for fast, witty and socially nuanced dialogue and had a
wonderful performance by Stockard Channing, a woman who acts as well as she
looks.
The Winter's Tale directed by Adrian Noble at the Royal Shakespeare
Company's home in Stratford. There, one now realises, was the foretaste of
the mastery of an entire text that was to come in this month's production of
Hamlet.
The Voysey Inheritance and The Madras House, both by Harley Granville
Barker, at the Edinburgh Festival. Here was a reminder of how strong the
European theatre was in the early years of this century: educated plays for
an educated audience. The Madras House had a new twist: the daughters
doubled with the mannequins.
Le Baruffe Chiozzotte by Carlo Goldoni, which made a brief appearance at the
National in a production by Giorgio Strehler's Piccolo Teatro of Milan. The
dialect may have been hard to follow even for Italians, but it was a lesson
in staging from which even the National can learn.
Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, which also passed
through the National in a production by Franco Zeffirelli. I singled out the
playing of Benedetta Buccellato as the step-daughter, but it was a team
performance par excellence.
The Tempest, directed by Yukio Ninagawa on a visit to the Barbican. Once
again here was an indication that however good our home ensembles have
become, outsiders still have something to teach in the way of technical
perfection and elements that go beyond the words.
There were, of course, other incidental pleasures in the course of the year.
It was bold of the National to revive the original Pygmalion, and you would
have to be dull of soul not to enjoy Maria Aitken and her supporting cast in
Noel Coward's Hay Fever. Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a
Field had a new outing at the Royal Court and showed that it is still
possible to be both contemporary and witty. The fringe continued to please,
led by The Gate with its European season and The Bush with its performance
of Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy. Those two pub theatres, in Notting Hill
and Shepherds Bush respectively, have become an essential part of the
theatre scene, often heavily oversubscribed.
Yet if you look at the list above, several facts stand out. Most of the
plays are either foreign or classics or both. The two best modern plays were
American: Angels in America and Six Degrees of Separation. Shakespeare,
whether native or imported, accounts for four of the 12 entries. Two of the
Shakespeare productions - Hamlet and The Winter's Tale - are by the same
director: Adrian Noble. Much of the best work has taken place on the stages
of the two big subsidised theatres,the National and the RSC, especially if
one includes the imports. The Granville Barker plays do not fit into any
particular pattern; they are revived periodically.
That leaves only one new British play in the top 12 productions of 1992:
Dejavu. And while I admired it a great deal, I have to admit that it
flopped. Some people reminded us that they had never liked Look Back in
Anger in the first place and did not want to revisit it. A younger
generation knew little about the original excitement and therefore had no
interest in Jimmy Porter 35 years on. Osborne has suggested that he will not
write for the theatre again, but the conclusion is sadder than that: there
is now no school of British dramatists writing about the present in the way
of Osborne and his fellows in the 1950s and 1960s.
Perhaps we should not be too surprised. Great waves of new new theatrical
writing do not come very often. There was the Elizabethan/Jacobean explosion
matched, as the Gate has been showing us, by a similar golden age in Spain
with such playwrights as Tirso de Molina. Then there was the more
intellectual departure around the beginning of this century not only with
Granville Barker and Shaw in Britain, but Ibsen and Chekhov abroad.
The apparent new take-off in the mid-1950s does not look nearly so
revolutionary with hindsight. As the revival of Billy Liar at the National
demonstrated, what seemed like youthful, northern rebellion in 1960 now
appears old hat. In the end, the rebellion was tame. Fresh fields for
protest have not yet emerged. Indeed there is a preference for nostalgia, as
in Jim Cartwright's The Rise and Fall of Little Voice where the young
heroine specialises in singing the songs of Judy Garland and Gracie Fields.
Meanwhile we can take pleasure in re-exploring the old, and in imports - a
not uncommon British phenomenon. The theatre has been extremely good at it.
There is also the musical, which had an interesting year. The best of the
new was Stephen Sondheim's Assassins at the refurbished Donmar Warehouse. It
flopped in America possibly because its launch coincided with the opening of
the Gulf War. Here it showed that by choosing new themes, the musical still
has plenty of room for development. Cameron Mackintosh had a shot at new
frontiers in Moby Dick, which I enjoyed more than most of my colleagues.
Old musicals came back: notably Annie Get Your Gun with a dynamic Kim
Criswell as Annie at the Prince of Wales, and Carousel at the National where
one can admire the performance while bridling at the sentiment. I suspect
that there are many good musicals still to be written and look forward to
seeing them.
A final point: the theatre in Britain remains remarkably efficient compared
with many other institutions. There is a great deal of hard, professional
work, the curtain goes up roughly on time and you should compare the price
of a ticket to that of other products before complaining that theatre is too
expensive. What is needed most of all is a regular audience.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): US brewer moves
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When James Koch asked distributors eight years ago to carry beer from a
brewery he had just started up in Boston, Massachusetts, none took him
seriously.
'They thought it was a joke,' Koch said. 'We couldn't get a single
distributor to take our brand.' But they are not laughing any more. Koch's
creation, the Boston Beer Company, whose flagship is the Sam Adams brand, is
now the 13th largest brewer in the US, with 1992 sales up more than 60 per
cent on 1991.
The beer is sold in nearly all parts of the US and has made inroads into
Europe. In Sweden, for instance, Sam Adams is among the top 12 imported
beers. 'Having a good product is the best marketing strategy in the world,'
Koch said.
Koch's success is even more impressive considering the market he competes
in. Sam Adams has a distinctive taste, a far cry from the mild variety
Americans are used to drinking.
Starting out with no advertising budget and no distributor, Koch tried some
novel marketing routes. He entered, and continues to enter, his beer in as
many taste contests as possible.
Winning awards for the best overall American beer four years in a row at the
American Brewers' Association tasting contest brought Koch free publicity.
The company jealously guards the beer's quality. To make sure the taste is
never compromised, the company prints expiry dates on its labels.
Koch recalls with humour the first days of Boston Beer Company's existence.
'I had nothing but what was in the bottles,' he explained. 'Because no
distributor would take on the brand, I had to go around to Boston bars
myself, asking them to offer it to their customers.'
Koch is uncertain how much the company will expand. 'This is a
strong-tasting beer which will probably only appeal to, say, 2 per cent of
Americans. But 2 per cent of the US is a large market. And then there's the
export market into Europe.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cracking the China
syndrome - Foreign companies are discovering consumer affluence in a fast
growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China has been a beguiling business opportunity for almost 200 years. In the
19th century it was the Manchester cotton spinners' dream to put a shirt on
the back of every Chinese.
Today the dream remains the same, it is just the product that has changed.
Nestle, the Swiss food company, is making a concerted push to expand its
business in China. It recently bought the China assets of Dairy Farm, the
Jardine Matheson-controlled Hong Kong-based dairy products manufacturer, to
add to its existing interests in baby food products.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has entrenched itself in
Guangdong, China's fastest growing province, while its detergent
advertisements can be viewed on television in Beijing.
Seven-Eleven, the mini-mart franchise chain owned by Dairy Farm, has
established itself in Shenzhen, a special economic zone to the north of Hong
Kong; Dickson Concepts, a Hong Kong retailer of luxury goods and owner of
London's Harvey Nichols department store, is planning to manufacture and
retail a line of luxury items specifically targeted at the Chinese consumer.
The increasing corporate interest in China's consumer market is linked to
the growing affluence of an increasing minority of China's 1.2bn people.
But a recent study by McKinsey*, the US multinational consultancy, shows
that companies wishing to tap the market should direct their efforts at the
sizeable and growing pockets of wealth in China.
The study estimates that there are currently 60m Chinese consumers earning
at least Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 657) a year, a level at which substantial
consumerism becomes apparent, according to McKinsey.
Today 'consumers in the more affluent areas of China may well be as rich as,
or richer than, the average Malaysian, Thai or Indonesian consumer'.
China's 60m-strong consumer market compares with 15m-20m for Malaysia, 25m
for Taiwan and more than 40m in Korea.
By the end of the century the number of affluent consumers could rise more
than three-fold to 200m when China will have a market for consumer durables
that is, in terms of purchasing power and population, larger than most of
the east and south-east Asian markets today.
The affluent consumers, however, are not concentrated in one area. The main
markets are in southern China - Shenzhen and Guangzhou (Canton) - Shanghai
and, in the north, Beijing and the nearby industrial city of Tianjin.
McKinsey reckons that by 2000, 11 other cities and provinces will reach an
average per capita income level of Dollars 1,000.
Nor is the market unified. China is a country of regions, many of which have
been encouraged by past government policy to aim for self-sufficiency.
One of the goals of China's economic reforms is to achieve a unified
domestic market by improving internal distribution.
For the foreign manager, as McKinsey points out: 'In a country with a
notoriously overburdened transportation and telecommunications
infrastructure, carefully planned and effectively executed distribution and
sales activities will inevitably prove key factors for success.'
There are signs that China is relaxing the rules and allowing private
companies to operate their own distribution networks.
In electronics, foreign joint ventures can now establish proprietary
distribution and sales networks that allow direct access to consumers. This
enables companies to bypass the state-controlled wholesale system.
Another beneficial change for foreign companies is that they now have
greater freedom to recruit managers directly from universities, government
ministries and state-owned industry.
Foreign companies offer not only higher levels of pay but also a work
environment that many Chinese professionals find more appealing than
traditional state industry.
One Hong Kong computer and telecommunications equipment manufacturer, for
example, had little trouble recently in recruiting more than 70 graduates in
engineering from Beijing's best universities to work for it in Guangdong.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Texaco adopts can-do
approach to design - Gary Mead explains why the oil group is revamping its
packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advent of the European single market has encouraged more companies to
reflect the shift towards trans-nationality in their products. The most
immediate way to tell customers - and staff - that you are a multinational
is through product and graphic design.
Texaco is one company which is going through a design revamp, turning a
design hotch-potch of oil products aimed at the domestic purchaser into a
single, unified look.
But the Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) which Texaco has ploughed into
redesigning its domestic-user oil range since 1989 is prompted by more than
a wish for cosmetic change.
According to Rudy De Pauw, general manager for lubricants and technology of
Texaco Services Europe: 'The European forecourt market (for motor oils and
related products) is declining at 5 per cent a year.'
Yet although the Dollars 250m European forecourt market for oil and oil
derivatives is in such a parlous state - thanks to both the increased
efficiency of cars and a decline in the number of people doing home
maintainance - it is still worth Dollars 25m a year to Texaco, one of the
five big suppliers.
De Pauw hopes that the re-design of Texaco's domestic oil packaging will
shift Texaco's share from 10 per cent to 10.5 per cent annually, worth an
additional Dollars 1.25m.
De Pauw also believes that another design change will not be necessary for
five years; if his calculations are right, Texaco is thus looking forward to
a total Dollars 6.25m return on its redesign investment.
He says: 'What we are trying to do is get better brand recognition across
Europe, to have throughout Europe a uniform recognition.
'We felt that not only was the previous packaging looking a bit tired and
dated, but also we had a different type of packaging in every European
country, and different styles of packaging even within the same countries.
We discovered through our customer research that people felt our product
ranges had a chaotic look.'
Texaco employed the London design agency Seibert Head to come up with a
design that would tap into a common pan-European feel for colours.
They discovered that black is accepted everywhere as a colour associated
with diesel oils; silver for premium oil products; anthracite for multigrade
oils and light grey for ancillary products.
Certain packaging designs were rejected as not suitable. One plastic carton
shape - rounded at the edges - was considered but thrown out when consumer
research suggested that customers associated the shape more with household
detergents than motor oils.
And the new packaging is not just about looks; part of Seibert Head's brief
was to come up with plastic bottles which pour smoothly and don't glug
unpleasantly over customers' hands and feet.
'What we now have is a range of products designed to look as though they
belong to a family, which we know makes people more attracted to them than
before,' says De Pauw. Furthermore, having a coherent packaging design
reduces the cost of Texaco's other promotional activities.
De Pauw suggests that Texaco will make savings of between Dollars 300,000
and Dollars 500,000 annually, since having the same package designs
throughout Europe means the company will be able to produce pan-European
advertisements with the same look and message for all countries in which it
operates.
In 1993 Texaco plans to return to television advertising across Europe; it
is currently in the process of reviewing its advertising agency account and
options.
De Pauw says that while packaging redesign can perhaps lubricate Texaco's
image, 'it cannot reverse the decline of sales to the home buyer. It's about
getting an extra edge on market share.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / Mirror switches site for Scottish printing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR GROUP Newspapers has cancelled plans to build a printing plant at its
Anderston Quay headquarters in central Glasgow. Work on the Pounds 70m
construction project stopped on Christmas Eve and will not resume.
Instead staff of the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail will be told
today that the plan is to build on a greenfield site close to Glasgow city
centre.
Talks have started with local authorities on a new site to install modern
colour presses which are stored in crates in Glasgow.
Mr David Montgomery, the recently appointed chief executive of MGN, asked
the board of the Scottish papers to carry out a review of the project.
Apart from the decision on the location of the presses, the review found
that no provision had been made for the latest electronic page make-up
systems or for equipment to insert previously printed material at the same
pace as the presses roll.
The overall cost of the Anderston Quay project was to be Pounds 114m
including the presses. Following the review the savings could be as high as
Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m in spite of adding the extra equipment. 'We will
get more for less,' Mr Montgomery said last night.
The existing Glasgow presses can produce only 48-page papers and as a result
the company has had to turn away advertising.
Interim measures to produce larger newspapers on the existing presses are to
be introduced until the new plant can be built.
Larger newspapers will mean fewer copies can be printed. To cover the
temporary shortfall MGN's plant at Oldham, Manchester, will produce copies
for the south of Scotland.
Mr Montgomery has told staff that flexible working without extra payments is
now a necessity for the Mirror group, which has to make good the ravages to
its pension fund by Robert Maxwell.
A review is under way on whether the editorial staff of the Scottish titles
should stay at Anderston Quay.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Bank of England signals fraud crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is likely to be more aggressive in closing down or
limiting the activities of banks suspected of fraud or ineptitude, according
to Mr Ian Watt, who was recently appointed to head the Bank's new special
investigations unit.
His unit was set up after criticism of the Bank's role as supervisor of the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed last
year.
Mr Watt, a former partner at accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'The
shift (in the Bank's supervision policy) may be from 'well, one can't act
(against a bank) unless it's absolutely certain that one's fears are
justified' to being prepared to act quickly in the interests of depositors
when the evidence suggests that there is something seriously wrong.
'We want to detect the fraudsters at an early stage and strangle those,
string them up as quickly as possible, but in the course of detecting them
we must not provide such a blanket approach as to hang any innocents.'
Mr Watt made his remarks in an article in the Old Lady, the Bank's staff
magazine, which also contained an interview with Mr Peter Peddie, a former
partner of the solicitors Freshfields. Mr Peddie, who heads the Bank's new
legal unit, said bank supervisors across the EC must employ agreed standards
in their approach to banks suspected of corruption.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Mixed feelings over the single market: Andrew Jack looks at
why some companies are grumbling about EC changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise officials have been gathering in an ageing tower block at
Southend in the past few months to prepare the statistical systems needed
for the single European market.
Meanwhile, in a newly built office in Newry, Northern Ireland, staff
re-allocated from the border with the republic are starting work on the
administration of the value added tax procedures which will be required from
tomorrow.
In the 22 VAT collection regions around the country investigations officers
have been added to strengthen controls against smuggling, fraud and tax
evasion.
In spite of all these preparations the single market - and Customs as its
frontline representative - has been the subject of significant grumbling by
a number of companies.
Many appear unaware, even now, of the changes which will be required. Others
have received blank stares or conflicting advice from trade associations and
consultants. Still more have been waiting for details to be announced.
From tomorrow border controls for traders with other EC countries will be
abolished. The old statistical document with 54 questions which had to be
presented at each frontier will be no more.
In its place businesses will have to complete two new boxes on their VAT
returns, giving the value of imports or exports to other EC states. Those
for which either figure exceeds Pounds 35,000 for the year will be required
to file monthly statistical forms and regular sales-listing forms to
Customs.
Those likely to find the transition most painful are the businesses just
above this threshold - too large to escape the extra requirements, too small
to have dedicated staff to deal with them.
Many see the new burdens without appreciating the benefits of increased
speed at border crossings because they used to delegate this administration
to customs agents.
Meanwhile, the lack of detail has stalled final preparations. The commodity
code directories required to complete the new statistical forms and the
final document listing new procedures for businesses were distributed in the
past few weeks.
Customs has taken the blame for the slow progress of its political masters.
It was only in mid-December that EC finance ministers drew up agreements
dealing with the treatment of antiques and yachts, for example.
At that time they initialled a simplification directive on the subject of
'triangulation' by which a company in one EC country supplies a customer in
a second state through a sub-contractor in a third. Some accountants argue
that its interpretation remains unclear.
Privately, Customs officials express despair at the attitude of many
businesses - accusing them of being far more eager to criticise the changes
than to embrace the opportunities of the single market.
They also say that there has been some self-interested scaremongering by
consultants and computer suppliers hoping to generate extra business. They
argue that businesses have managed to cope with substantial changes to the
tax system before now.
They stress that the UK has fought with other member states to reduce the
burdens on business. The number of questions on the new statistical form has
been kept to a minimum, and the proportion of companies required to file
them has been cut to far lower levels than in other EC states.
Customs has completed personal visits to almost all the 30,000 traders
affected by the new procedures, in addition to an extensive programme over
many months of distributing publicity material and hosting presentations.
That compares favourably with the position elsewhere. Mr Peter Wilmott, head
of the EC Commission's indirect tax and customs directorate, admits that
there has been a significant 'information gap' in some member states. 'It
has been difficult to get firms to listen, but many member states have not
made enough effort,' he says.
In the past few weeks countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece
have redoubled their efforts to notify businesses of the changes required.
'Nobody believes we will have all the rules and that firms will know what
they are meant to be doing on January 1,' he says. 'Until you test it, you
can't be sure.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / Sharp drop in executives' pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 15 per cent of private-sector employers froze the pay of their
executives while average pay awards for executives fell sharply in the third
quarter of this year, according to IDS, the independent pay research group.
Pay awards for executives averaged 4 per cent in the three months to October
compared with 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter, the group says in its
survey of more than 105 organisations. Pay awards for all staff in the
private sector averaged 4 per cent in October and November.
In its survey IDS says: 'Economic uncertainty and the recession have had a
dramatic impact, leading to a sharp fall in the general level of salary
increases.' The survey adds to the evidence that a recent spate of very
large pay rises for executives runs counter to the norm.
The survey, by the IDS Top Pay Unit, shows that executives continue to win
pay rises above the rate of inflation.
The Treasury forecast in the Autumn Statement that underlying inflation,
measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage-interest payments,
would be at 3.75 per cent by the end of this year and would rise at the same
average rate next year.
At a large employer which awarded the highest rise among the companies in
the survey, junior and middle managers received a salary increase of 4.5 per
cent, as well as individual merit increases averaging 2.5 per cent.
Leadership is only the fifth most important characteristic of a good top
manager, a survey suggested yesterday.
Most important was ability to manage change, said the report on more than
1,000 private-sector and public-sector bodies questioned by management
consultancy Kinsley Lord. Next was enabling staff to make best use of their
skills and improve performance.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Satellite dish total estimated below 2m

<TEXT>
SATELLITE DISH ownership in Britain was below 2m at the end of October,
according to estimates by GfK Marketing Services, the market research group.
This compares with the 2.61m total produced by Continental Research, which
conducts monthly research for the FT Satellite Monitor.
GfK says its figures are consistent with those produced by Barb, which
produces official ratings for the BBC and ITV. GfK Marketing Services, a
subsidiary of German market research group GfK Holding, plans to produce a
monthly satellite monitor sponsored by the ITV Association.
The company says that between June and October the net total for new
satellite dishes was about 187,000. Its figures are derived from a sample of
10,000 homes in June, updated by monitoring new installations through
electrical multiples, electricity boards, rental specialists, department
stores and mail-order groups.
Continental's research is based on interviews with more than 4,000 adults
each month integrated with retail figures.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Lloyd's brokers resources are being stretched to the limit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S brokers are 'finding their resources stretched to the limit' by the
upheavals in the London insurance market, according to a study by De Lisle
Jessup Scott, the insurance consultancy.
Capacity shortages caused by heavy insurance losses are at the heart of the
problem. The failure or withdrawal from the market of many small and
medium-sized companies means that brokers are having more difficulty finding
insurance for their clients.
Extra expenses and declining volume are offsetting the benefit of recent
increases in premiums and brokerage commissions.
Brokers specialising in the retrocession market (the reinsurance of
reinsurance), which has been hit hard by a string of big catastrophe losses,
face the toughest problems.
Falls in interests rates have depressed investment income while pressures on
cashflow have resulted from the growing market tendency to settle claims
automatically.

alternative location for their careers.
A group of 300 aged 13 to 17 were first interviewed in the spring about
their expectations after the Conservative election victory. This month a

affect their family or friends. In 10 per cent of cases their fathers had

FT  31 DEC 92 / Bottomley stresses need for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S deter-mination to continue with controversial changes to
healthcare provision in London was reiterated yesterday by Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, Alan Pike writes.
Mrs Bottomley says in a newsletter distributed to all National Health
Service staff in the capital that change can no longer be postponed.
She says in the publication that London's problems have been discussed for
years and too little has happened.
Mrs Bottomley is due to make decisions next month on Sir Bernard Tomlinson's
report into healthcare provision in London. This recommends reducing the
number of hospital beds, closing or amalgamating famous hospitals and
shifting resources to family doctors and community services.
Mrs Bottomley is facing intense opposition to some of the proposed closures.
The report's recommendations include closing St Bartholomew's in the City;
amalgamating Guy's and St Thomas' on a single site; merging the Middlesex
and University College on the latter's site and moving the Royal Brompton
and Royal Marsden specialist hospitals to the Charing Cross site in west
London.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Life insurers win delay on tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN DORRELL, the financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday
announced a year's postponement in levying a new tax charge on life
insurance companies' unit trust holdings.
The decision follows long discussions with the Association of British
Insurers and is likely to be welcomed by life insurers and unit trust
companies.
Mr Dorrell said the delay was introduced because the measure, announced in
the Budget of March 1990 and due to be introduced for companies from
accounting periods beginning last January, could 'produce a higher tax
charge than was intended'. It will now be introduced for accounting years
beginning from tomorrow.
Authorised unit trusts and certain offshore funds do not have to pay capital
gains tax on transactions within the fund. The tax is only payable when the
trust itself is sold.
The funds of many life companies used large holdings in unit trusts as a
method of rolling over or deferring capital gains tax. This gave life funds
a more favourable tax position than the government wanted. The government's
original proposal had been to tax life companies on the assumption that
their holdings of unit trusts were sold and immediately repurchased at
market value at the end of each accounting period.
According to the insurers the tax charge could have led to an uneven tax
burden on unit-linked insurance policies which invested solely in unit
trusts, and those which invested in a life company's own unit-linked fund.
They were also anxious that this could lead to sudden heavy disposals of
unit trusts, with a distorting effect on the market. There were also a
number of technical difficulties.
Legislation will be introduced as part of the 1993 Finance Bill to
counteract the distortion, and to introduce transitional arrangements.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Newspaper distribution attacked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VG DISTRIBUTORS, the independent high-street grocery chain, has renewed its
attack on newspaper wholesalers with a second submission to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
It has told the MMC inquiry into newspaper wholesaling and retailing that
the market is 'rigged' and the fixed newspaper distribution territories
should be dismantled.
The group says it is campaigning on behalf of more than 40,000 convenience
stores which cannot get supplies of newspapers to sell although newsagents
are increasingly entering the grocery sector by selling such items as milk,
bread and baked beans.
It rejects the arguments of wholesalers that the product is unique because
of its short shelf life. It says there are many short-life retail products
such as chilled foods and sandwiches, and adds that newspaper wholesalers
have started supplying superstores.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Business failures up 31% to new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS failures in Britain rose 31 per cent to a record 62,767 this year,
with small companies hit particularly hard, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business
information group, reported yesterday.
The sharpest increase in overall business failures took place in south-east
England outside London, with a 46 per cent rise, followed by Scotland and
south-west England with increases of 36 per cent and 35 per cent
respectively. Many of these failures are thought to have been companies
founded in the late-1980s boom.
More than a third of failures - 37 per cent - took place in London and the
south-east. These two regions also saw the largest concentration of failures
among bigger companies, with 52 per cent of liquidations of limited
companies in Britain.
Business failures reached a new quarterly high of 16,222 in the final
quarter of this year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet noted, however, that the rate of
increase in business failures slowed in 1992 compared with 1991, when the
total increased by 65 per cent to 47,777 from 28,935 in 1990.
Liquidations of limited companies increased by 11 per cent to 22,938 in 1992
while bankruptcies, which generally apply to small non-corporate businesses,
sole traders and partnerships, increased by 47 per cent to 39,829. The
statistics do not cover Northern Ireland.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said that the slower
failure rate among larger companies was reflected in the increased problems
of small companies. Bigger companies had stayed in business by cutting
costs, postponing investment plans and 'in many cases delaying payments'.
He said: 'All of these factors rebounded on to the smaller firms, which in
addition have been weighed down with the crippling burden of bad debts.'
A separate Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey of about 1,500 managing directors this
month found that nearly one in five companies is writing off at least Pounds
100 for every Pounds 1,000 of sales as bad debt, while one in eight is
writing off more than 15 per cent of sales as unrecoverable payments.
In a joint statement Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, and Ms
Harriet Harman, his deputy, called on the government to take immediate
action 'to remedy Britain's dwindling industrial capacity'. They said that
otherwise 'thousands of companies' would close in 1993 on top of the weekly
toll of 1,200 business failures shown in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet figures.
But the Treasury said that business failure statistics lagged behind the
cycle of economic activity and that prospects had improved.
The Treasury said that not only did Britain have low inflation, a more
competitive pound and the lowest interest rates in Europe, but recent
consumer and business confidence surveys together with anecdotal evidence
such as the strong start to the winter sales were encouraging.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Reinsurance rates trigger tough talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES TO impose swingeing increases in reinsurance rates in the wake of
record losses have lead to unusually protracted bargaining in London as
insurance companies seek to renew annual contracts.
Rates for all property reinsurances have risen but North American insurers
have been asked for rises on average of up to 80 per cent compared with two
years ago.
Mr Jonathan Marland, broker with Lloyd Thompson, said: 'It's the toughest
market in living memory.' He added that a series of catastrophe losses since
1987 had eaten into the reinsurance market's capacity to help direct
insurers offset their exposures to heavy losses.
The latest of these disasters - Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and
Louisiana in August - underlined the industry's growing exposure to
catastrophe losses. Claims of more than Dollars 13bn made Andrew one of the
world's most expensive hurricanes, nearly three times as big as Hurricane
Hugo in 1989.
Hurricane Andrew had a direct impact on the US insurance and reinsurance
markets, driving some smaller companies out of business and reducing the
capacity of US reinsurers to undercut their rivals. This strengthened the
arm of underwriters at Lloyd's syndicates and London companies seeking to
obtain rate increases.
As a result US companies have been asked to pay up to 50 per cent more for
their reinsurance than last year, according to brokers CT Bowring, which
buys reinsurance in London for four out of 10 US insurance companies.
Buyers have also been paying more for less protection. Underwriters are
making only between Dollars 100m and Dollars 200m of cover for each customer
compared with Dollars 300m two years ago.
UK insurers have been asked 25 per cent more on average. One London broker
said: 'People are underwriting risk in a way they haven't done in years.'
The willingness of Lloyd's underwriters to take a tough bargaining position
has been reinforced by the knowledge that a bad result in 1993 could put
them on the dole queue. More than 150 syndicates have folded in the past two
years and several companies have withdrawn from the reinsurance market.
Names - the individuals whose assets back the Lloyd's market - who were
members of specialist reinsurance syndicates bore the brunt of the market's
losses in 1989, when Lloyd's reported results for that year last June, in
line with its three-year accounting system.
In the wake of that experience members' agencies - who funnel Names into
syndicates - are already running shy of those specialising in catastrophe
business, preferring to place members on syndicates specialising in less
risky business such as motor insurance.
Inevitably, the increases are leading to prolonged haggling between brokers
and underwriters. This week Many insurers have still not obtained
reinsurance cover. Mr Peter Grove, a Lloyd's underwriter for nearly 20
years, said: 'The market is very, very late. The renewal season will go on
well into January.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / Italy fails to agree market revival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S cabinet yesterday failed to agree a package of measures to boost
popular share ownership and revive the stock market after a stormy 10-hour
meeting which revealed continuing differences between ministers over the
government's ambitious privatisation programme.
Ministers formally approved the privatisation plan, passed by parliament
earlier this month. They gave the go-ahead for measures to bring Italy's
indirect taxes into line with European Community rules from January 1,
raising an estimated L1,500bn (Dollars 1.09bn) in additional revenue next
year.
The government also approved a L1,650bn spending package for the year ahead
to counter rising unemployment and help job creation. In addition, it
unfroze L10,000bn in payments overdue to construction companies for public
work contracts. Disbursing these had been delayed by corruption inquiries.
Heading the long list of assets to be sold are state holdings in banking,
foods, insurance, engineering and energy.
The sales are planned to raise L27,000bn over the next three years for the
Treasury, which will use the money to reduce Italy's vast budget deficit. A
further L24,000bn will come from disposals of companies within the IRI state
holding company. IRI will use the money to cut its own vertiginous
borrowings, now over L60,000bn.
Ministers are believed to have clashed over the extent of asset sales,
meaning that details of the proposed ministerial committee to supervise the
privatisation programme were left unresolved.
The extended debate meant that approval for widely leaked measures expected
to boost the stock market was postponed until the next cabinet meeting,
early in the new year.
Brokers had welcomed the leaked proposals to boost the bourse, which bear
traces of both the personal equity plans of the UK and the individual
retirement accounts common in the US.
The Comit equity index continued a strong week by rising 2.15 points to
451.18 yesterday, although share prices are still below their levels at the
beginning of the year.
If the proposals go through, investors would be offered substantial tax
breaks over the next four years to buy shares in companies going public. A
new type of retirement savings account would also be introduced, with tax
advantages if at least half the funds are put into equities and held for a
number of years.
Further features include tax incentives for companies to go public and for
investors buying into newly-quoted concerns. The measures would also propose
extra funding to reinforce Consob, the stock market and companies watchdog.
The steps should encourage popular share ownership and prepare for one of
Europe's most ambitious privatisation programmes. Italy's relatively
illiquid equity market is inadequate to absorb the vast amount of equity
that could be issued once privatisations start in earnest.
Critics of state disposals may be appeased by a proposed 'golden share'
formula, first used in the UK, to prevent important public sector companies
slipping entirely out of state control.
The latest proposals would replace earlier plans in August dismissed as
inadequate by bankers. The government subsequently went some way to meet
brokers' demands by suspending the unpopular capital gains tax on shares
until September next year.
Only Credito Italiano, the country's sixth-largest bank, and Nuovo Pignone,
the ENI turbines subsidiary have made substantial advances towards
privatisation.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Tokyo stock market down 26.4% on year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE IS a symbolic, cyclical number in Japan, and thus it was appropriate
that the Tokyo stock average should tumble again yesterday to mark three
years of falling prices, declining turnover, and fading investor confidence.
When traders and Tokyo exchange officials closed 1992 with rhythmic
clapping, stock prices were down 26.4 per cent on the year and 2.1 per cent
on the day, leaving the Nikkei average at 16,924.95 and Japanese brokers
nervous about the omens for next year.
Taking the common standards of superstition as a guide, 1993 will either
mark the beginning of a new cycle of goodness, and rapidly rising stock
prices, or the fourth year of a five-year cycle of collapse, decay and
ever-larger losses.
Portents aside, the hard statistics add up to a particularly bleak trading
year. The daily average volume on the exchange's first section was 264.9m
shares, the lowest since 1977, and a quarter that of the 'bubble' year of
1988.
The trading value for the year was Y58,881bn (Pounds 84.3bn), about one
sixth of the record set in 1989, and the lowest level since 1984.
Brokers were starved of commissions, individual investors shunned the
market, and a long queue of eager sellers formed each time share prices
appeared to gain strength.
At the close yesterday, the Nikkei average was down 56.5 per cent from the
record high of 38,915.87 on December 29, 1989, while the three years of
consecutive decline are a record.
To emphasise things may get worse before they get better, trading volume on
Monday, at 100m shares, was the lowest since 1982.
A Tokyo exchange official, after clapping out the year, said: 'We have
already forgotten 1992.' Foreign brokers are generally forecasting the
Nikkei will trade between 16,000 and 20,000 next year, while Japanese houses
are telling customers that 25,000.
The third year of the cycle was particularly tough on stocks favoured by the
few remaining speculators last year.
Godo Shusei, a maker of sake and plum wine, was the big loser, down 79.3 per
cent, followed by Daito Boshoku, a wool spinner, which lost 79.2 per cent of
its value.
Japanese business magazines, only half-jokingly, have suggested the
three-five-seven cycle means that manufacturers will take three years to
recover from falling sales and asset values, the brokers will need five
years, and the banks seven years.
More pessimistic soothsayers predict that all three sectors will need seven
years.

China's economy racked up one of the world's fastest growth rates in 1992

Gross domestic product increased by 12 per cent in 1992 after adjustment for

Officials at the Central Bank of Ireland confirmed yesterday that Ireland
will go ahead with the removal of exchange controls this weekend, as part of
the European Community's single market programme, writes James Blitz.
There had been speculation that Ireland might be forced to postpone its
pledge because of pressure on the Irish punt inside the ERM.

INDIAN Moslem leaders left India's capital for Ayodhya yesterday to offer
prayers at the site where an ancient mosque stood until it was destroyed by
Hindu militants on December 6, Shiraz Sidhva writes from New Delhi.
The government, which has informally tried to stop the Moslem leaders from
offering prayers at the site of the Babri mosque where there has been no
Moslem worship since 1949, fears the visit could spark off more communal
violence.
The destruction of the 400-year mosque prompted countrywide riots which left
more than 1,200 dead. The Moslem leaders are expected to be arrested before
they reach Ayodhya.
Recently the Faizabad district administration allowed Hindu pilgrims to
worship at a makeshift temple built on the site.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Franco 'to uphold' foreign accords: Collor found guilty by
Brazilian Senate
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN president Itamar Franco yesterday promised to maintain accords
with international creditors and to work with Congress to approve fiscal
reform and intellectual property legislation.
In his first speech to the nation, he emphasised the need to combat Brazil's
social crises.
Elected vice-president in 1989, Mr Franco will serve the final two years of
the term of Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned on Tuesday. Mr Franco
had been interim president since Mr Collor was suspended three months ago to
face impeachment on corruption charges.
Mr Franco said the recently suspended privatisation programme would be
resumed with unspecified new guidelines that 'do not prejudice the nation.'
Unnamed 'strategic' companies will not be sold. He offered no outline on
trade liberalisation but stressed that 'we cannot allow ourselves to be
fooled into thinking that we can construct a modern country by raising
economic barriers.'
He also said: 'We will guarantee the stability of economic rules and will
assure that no arbitrary decisions will be taken,' thereby ruling out shock
plans as a means of curing economic woes. Brazil has suffered six economic
plans, usually including price freezes, since 1986.
Planning minister Paulo Haddad said he will provide details of economic
policy at a press conference today
Senator Albano Franco, head of the National Confederation of Industry, said
that the business community would be reassured by the new president's pledge
to avoid price freezes and to support structural reform.
The Sao Paulo stock exchange Bobespa Index reacted favourably and increased
by 3 per cent.
Mr Franco criticised what he called Mr Collor's 'false modernisation'
programme, noting its recessionary effects. He recalled that this year
Brazil's gross domestic product will be 3.9 per cent lower and per capita
income 10 per cent lower than in 1989. He said modernisation and
anti-inflation policy could not be based on maintaining high interest rates.
The Franco administration hopes to work closely with Congress and leading
political parties, reversing Mr Collor's combative approach.
The Brazilian Senate found former President Fernando Collor de Mello guilty
of crimes of responsibility and prohibited him from holding office for eight
years despite his resignation on Tuesday morning.
A marathon session, which started on Tuesday and ended early yesterday,
resulted in a 76 to three vote in favour of conviction.
Mr Collor also faces possible criminal charges for his involvement in an
alleged influence-peddling scheme and for having benefited from a
multi-million-dollar slush fund run by his former campaign treasurer.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Collor said he would appeal against the Senate
conviction.
'I resist in the name of democratic institutions,' he said, adding that he
was 'a president whose only crime was his unswerving dedication to his
duty.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / US sees sharpest rise in indicators for a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US index of leading indicators - a guide to future economic trends -
last month registered its sharpest increase for nearly a year.
Propelled by a steep increase in consumer confidence, the index rose 0.8 per
cent, following a 0.5 per cent increase in October.
Optimism, however, was muted by unexpectedly poor figures for new home
sales, which fell 8.3 per cent between October and November to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 565,000.
This followed a fall of similar magnitude in the previous month. The 8.3 per
cent decline was the biggest drop since March when sales fell 11.5 per cent.
The figures for new home sales were a marked contrast to Tuesday's report of
a 5.4 per cent rise in sales of existing homes, a significant gain for the
second month running.
Figures for new home sales, however, are often heavily revised, usually
upwards. The reported declines since October may thus overstate any loss of
momentum in this sector of the housing market.
Sales of new homes for the first 11 months of this year were 19 per cent
higher than in the same period last year.
The leading index was lifted by increases in eight of its ll component
indicators, including gains in consumer confidence, a fall in weekly claims
for unemployment insurance, a rise in share prices and faster growth of the
money supply.
The consumer expectations component rose far more sharply than other
components and accounted for half of the total increase in the leading
index.
The index is intended to predict changes in economic activity several months
in advance. However in the recent past it has failed to give warning of
slowdowns, such as the dip in industrial production last summer.
The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current state of the
economy, rose modestly in November for the second month running.
President-elect Bill Clinton welcomed the latest figures, saying they showed
there is hope and optimism that the economy is improving. He was quoted by a
spokesman as saying that it showed there was 'hope and optimism that things
are going to get better.'
The spokesman added that Mr Clinton said, 'what we've got to do is to keep
interest rates down and get growth going.'

The consortium - one of nine which tendered for the contract last year  - is
led by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), the Australian resources group, and
Petronas Carigali Overseas, a subsidiary of Petronas, the Malaysian state
oil company.
BHP said a detailed production sharing contract was being negotiated with
PetroVietnam, the state oil company, and Vietsovpetro, a Vietnamese/Russian
joint venture which carried out the initial development of Dai Hung.
Mr Peter Willcox, chief executive of BHP's petroleum division, said the
group expected to hold a 43.75 per cent stake in the field,. Petronas
Carigali 20 per cent and PetroVietnam 15 per cent. The remaining 21.25 per
cent shareholding has been reserved for a further international oil company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S unpopular Socialist government yesterday faced a stream of gloomy
economic news as surveys appeared showing an increase in unemployment last
month and further falls in confidence among both industrialists and
consumers.
The number of people out of work in France rose 1 per cent in November to
2.97m, according to figures from Insee, the state statistics institute. This
raised the annualised rate of unemployment to 10.5 per cent from 10.4 per
cent in October.
The news of November's job losses comes at a critical time for the French
government, only three months away from a general election in late March. It
is also a setback to the government's hopes of presenting a positive picture
of France's economic prospects to the financial markets during a period of
fierce pressure on the French franc.
Unemployment is one of the main drags on the French economy as fears of
joblessness have depressed consumer confidence. A new BVA study for
Paris-Match magazine suggests confidence is still deteriorating with 71 per
cent of the French claiming to be 'pessimistic' about France's prospects in
1993, compared with 64 per cent this time last year.
This pessimism is mirrored in the corporate sector. The level of confidence
among French industrialists has also declined in recent weeks, according to
the latest Insee monthly study of 3,300 senior executives. Industrialists
expressed concern about the sluggish domestic market and rising stocks. They
also reported continuing pressure on exports, which have been affected by
the strength of the French franc since this autumn's currency crisis.
The government has ruled out abandoning its rigid fiscal policy in favour of
reflating the economy before the French go to the polls.

<TEXT>
A United Nations envoy attempting to resolve the plight of 415 Palestinians
expelled to Lebanon by Israel ended visits to both countries yesterday
without persuading Israel to take them back. He also failed to secure food
and medical supplies for them or to meet the deportees.
It remained unclear how the issue, which Palestinian leaders say is
threatening the future of Middle East peace talks, might be defused. Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, suggested after his second
meeting with Mr James Jonah, a UN undersecretary general, that a third
country should take the Palestinians, but this appeared to have little
chance of acceptance.
A Security Council resolution passed unanimously after the deportations
almost two weeks ago demanded that the men, all said by Israel to be Islamic
fundamentalist militants, be returned to their homes in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Dr Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, a leader of the deportees,
said from their snow-bound camp in south Lebanon they would not accept
anything less.
Mr Jonah is due to report back to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary
general. During the envoy's visit, Mr Rabin refused to reverse the
deportations and the Lebanese government rejected an Israeli proposal that
humanitarian supplies be delivered to the camp from both sides.
Yesterday, Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, said after a meeting with Mr Boutros-Ghali in Geneva that the
deportations were a 'war crime' and a 'form of ethnic cleansing.' He urged
the UN chief to do all he could to force Israel to take back the deportees.
France yesterday proposed that the Palestinians be placed provisionally
under the responsibility of United Nations Forces in Lebanon (Unifil).
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said he had made the suggestion to Mr
Boutros-Ghali during talks in Geneva on a range of world issues.

   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY intervention by western forces in the former Yugoslavia would meet
fierce resistance from the Yugoslav army, Gen Zivota Panic, the Yugoslav
army's chief of staff, said in Belgrade yesterday.
'If intervention comes, we will defend our freedom, independence and
territory with all means at our disposal,' he declared. 'Our forecasts show
that the danger of military intervention has objectively increased in recent
days. 'We must inform the world that this is a new genocide and we will not
allow it.'
Gen Panic's warning came as Britain moved a step closer towards backing
military intervention against Serbia. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
said in a newspaper article published yesterday that he could now 'imagine
armed action against them to prevent a general Balkan war'.
The Foreign Office emphasised Britain was losing patience with the Serbs,
although the government still saw direct military involvement as far from
inevitable. It stressed Mr Hurd had also said in the Daily Telegraph article
that, 'democratic opinion would not support us in military occupation over
years, with the inevitable costs and casualties.'
General Panic, who commanded the Serbian operation last year that left the
Croatian city of Vukovar a pile of rubble, asserted the West had conspired
to break up Yugoslavia, but his forces could grow from a peacetime level of
120,000 to 600,000 in wartime. It was possible to mobilise up to 2m
reservists, he said.
The UN mediator Lord David Owen was in Belgrade yesterday in preparation for
talks on the Yugoslav crisis this weekend in Geneva.
Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday also condemned the
threat of military intervention. 'The politicians will sit out military
intervention secure in their bunkers,' he said. Speaking in Belgrade, he
rejected as unconstitutional a parliamentary vote on Tuesday night naming a
vice-premier to lead the Government until a newly-elected parliament is
installed early next year.
'I will not run away,' Mr Panic said, dismissing as 'lunacy' calls by
ultra-nationalists for his arrest. 'This is how fascism started in Nazi
Germany. We have to stop this in our country.' Mr Panic, a Serbian-American
millionaire returned to Yugoslavia in July to take up the premiership.
Mr Panic lost presidential elections to the Serb leader Mr Slobodon
Milosevic on December 20, but he has charged that the polls were unfair.

Boland tests opinions of independence in the town of Cadca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE A hundred other towns in Slovakia tonight, Cadca is holding a party to
celebrate independence. There will be a ceremonial hoisting of the Slovak
flag, bells will toll at midnight, the new national anthem will be sung and
there will be fireworks in the town for the first time in 40 years.
The rockets and catharine wheels have been bought with some of the 25m
kopecs (Pounds 600,000) made available to the nation by the government in
Bratislava to celebrate the event. But the 25,000 people of this run-down,
polluted town in northern Slovakia are divided on independence.
Around 7,000 of Cadca's inhabitants board trains every morning to travel to
work at the steel mills in Ostrava, 90km away in the Czech republic. Their
journey tomorrow will take them across the world's newest frontier.
Ask the travellers if they will feel any difference and they shrug. Ask if
they fear any consequences and they remain silent. Then one man says yes, he
is 'afraid'. He is not quite able to say why. He gives a little embarrassed
laugh.
But there are signs pointing to potential areas of mutual misunderstanding.
Mr Ivan Krivcik, a young waiter, says he has visited Prague just twice in
his lifetime, but has been to Vienna, a short distance up the Danube from
Bratislava, five times. The break with the Czech republic will not mean a
lot to him. 'I have friends in Austria, Germany, even Britain, but I have no
friends in the Czech republic,' he says.
Ms Katarina Genzorova, who teaches at the technical school at Cadca, sees it
differently. She lived in Bohemia, the western province of the Czech
republic, for six years and has many friends there. 'It is sad and
unnecessary and it has upset me a lot,' she says.
Mr Miroslav Golis, director of the town's library, sums up what must be a
widespread feeling throughout Czechoslovakia today. 'We Slovaks will miss
the Czechs more than they will miss us,' he says wistfully. Mr Peter
Glasnak, mayor of Cadca and master of ceremonies tonight, has a theory to
explain the apparent indifference. 'In our society we always highlight the
mistakes, never the successes. That is our eternal science.'
He supports Mr Vladimir Meciar, the volatile, nationalist prime minister of
Slovakia, and the man who will enter the history books as the father of
Slovak independence. 'People like his personality. He tells them what they
want to hear,' he says without irony.
Telling people what they want to hear is Mr Meciar's most potent political
weapon. But if he wants an idea of the problems he will have to solve after
independence, he could do worse than visit Cadca. It is a town blighted by
years of impoverishment. It has no industries and a 20 per cent unemployment
rate, Mr Glasnak says. That is why over a quarter of its inhabitants take
the train to Ostrava every morning.
Not even the snow can hide the blight, which is made worse by clouds of
smoke and soot from the plant providing the town with central heating.
It is not a place for illusions. 'Tonight there will be a party,' Mr Glasnak
says. 'But in the morning we must wake up and realise there is a lot of work
to be done.'
Three years ago the Velvet Revolution came and went leaving little trace.
Now Year Zero for independent Slovakia begins at midnight and Cadca is
holding its breath.

FT  31 DEC 92 / King Milosevic rises from the ashes of Yugoslavia: Laura
Silber finds ultra-nationalism on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE re-election of Mr Slobodan Milosevic as president of Serbia, followed by
the vote of no confidence against Mr Milan Panic, the prime minister,
reaffirms Mr Milosevic as the most powerful politician in what remains of
Yugoslavia.
Mr Milosevic's grip on Serbian politics has tightened partly because his
defiance of the West has increased his support. Top echelons of the Yugoslav
army, which previously supported the Yugoslav federation under Mr Panic and
President Dobrica Cosic, now support Mr Milosevic - seen as the single
person most responsible for the war in Bosnia.
At the same time, the Serbian political scene has become polarised between
ultra-nationalists, on one side, and the weak democratic opposition, on the
other. The extremist Serbian Radical Party, under Mr Vojislav Seselj, is
expected to form a ruling coalition with the Socialists (the renamed
Communists). DEPOS, the opposition coalition, won a few seats in Serbia's
parliament.
Mr Seselj, commander of a private militia and named by the US as a suspected
war criminal, has indicated he is vying for a key ministerial position. It
is unlikely Mr Milosevic will hand over the interior or information
ministries, his two pillars of power. Mr Seselj, for his part, has called
for the arrest of Mr Panic, a Belgrade-born California millionaire, for
betraying Serbia.
The victory of Serbian ultra-nationalists also marked the eclipse of hope
for democratic reform among liberal Yugoslavs. Foreign election observers,
who left before the count was finished a week later, said the vote was
riddled with irregularities. Opposition leaders point to the discrepancy
between the parliamentary and local election races, where opposition parties
made a stronger showing.
The opposition in Belgrade, a stronghold for the democratic movement, now
talk about fleeing the republic. Shocked by the surge of ultra-nationalism,
many speak of the danger of civil war in Serbia itself. This could involve
the ethnic minorities, which comprise one third of Serbia's 9.8m population.
But the ethnic minorities are divided. Pro-independence Albanians from the
southern Serbian province of Kosovo, and most Moslems from Sandzak, which
straddles Serbia and its ally Montenegro, boycotted the general elections.
The re-election of Mr Milosevic appears to raise their chances of
independence from Serbia, boosted by a letter last week from US President
George Bush to Mr Milosevic in which he warned that the US would intervene
if violence were to spread to Kosovo.
The 300,000-strong ethnic Hungarian community in Vojvodina, the northern
Serbian province, voted, but for ethnic Hungarian parties.
Smaller ethnic groups in Serbia, such as Slovaks and Croats, now believe the
election results will lead to ethnic cleansing in Serbia itself.
The elections signalled the end of Mr Cosic - a well-known writer - as a
political force in Serbia. His plea for compromise, was rejected by most
voters. His future as president is unclear. If Mr Cosic stays as leader of
the reconstituted but unrecognised Yugoslavia, his role as a negotiator in
Geneva on the former Yugoslavia comes into question because he appears to
lack the influence to assert his will over Serbian leaders.
Mr Cosic, regarded as the spiritual father of all Serbs, had appealed for Mr
Milosevic to step down. But in his address to the nation at the weekend, a
self-confident Mr Milosevic appeared firmly in control. Remaining defiant of
the West, he declared Serbia will never bow to the will of the international
community.

<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister and vice-chancellor, is
cutting short a holiday this week to return and face demands for his
resignation, or at least for a proper explanation, over the use of his
signature to promote a product manufactured by a family relation.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl lent his weight yesterday to a growing clamour
calling for clarification by the normally loquacious Mr Mollemann, demanding
that he explain what had happened 'immediately and comprehensively'.
The affair is a further embarrassing sign of disarray in the Bonn coalition
government, and it could destroy the chances of Mr Mollemann taking over
next year as the next leader of his Free Democratic party, junior partner in
the coalition headed by Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats.
Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the retiring party leader, has called an emergency
meeting of its national executive for next Monday, to hear the economics
minister's version of events.
On Tuesday, the economics committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament, has been summoned for its own extraordinary hearing into the
so-called 'letter-head affair', at which Mr Mollemann is expected to give
evidence. The opposition Social Democrats, who oppose his free market
policies, are calling for his resignation.
It all amounts to the most serious challenge to the minister's position in
recent years, only months before he was due to present himself as the
natural successor to Mr Lambsdorff, when the latter retires in mid-year.
The whole affair concerns the use of ministerial notepaper, from Mr
Mollemann's personal office, to promote a safety device for supermarket
trolleys, manufactured by a cousin of his wife, Carola.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday praised his countrymen for resisting calls
to rebel against painful economic reforms and urged them to rely on their
own wits to survive more hardship to come.
'I express my deep gratitude, respected citizens of Russia, for showing such
surprising endurance. . . and for not following those who called you to the
barricades, urged you to strike. You did not follow those who once called on
Russia to take up the axe,' Mr Yeltsin said in a televised New Year's
address in which he referred to bloody popular uprisings which have been a
feature of past Russian history.
But urging Russians to play a more active role in the reforms, he said the
appearance of 17m private entrepreneurs, farmers and providers of services
showed that 'success. . . is accessible to anyone who does not wait for a
gift from heaven but works for himself'.
He also jeered at his political opponents, who had in vain predicted
'hunger, cold, full destruction, and millions of unemployed' when radical
reforms started off with price liberalisation a year ago.
Although he failed to promise - as he has in the past - that things would
improve quickly, he claimed the first signs of stabilisation had already
appeared. Industrial production, for instance, had stopped falling.
He said nobody would be able to knock Russia off its reform course. Earlier
he revealed that he and his family would invest their privatisation vouchers
in one of the new investment funds now being set up as part of Russia's mass
sell-off of state-owned enterprises.
Mr Yeltsin, whose personal authority has been necessary to protect reformers
in the past, said that he now wanted to leave economic matters to the
recently-reshuffled reformist cabinet. He said he planned to focus on
protecting the poorest members of society and would launch a campaign
against the corruption and crime which plague everyday life in addition to
the high inflation and chaos wrought by the economic reforms.
'The painful period of destroying the old order is coming to an end: we now
have to clear the wreckage and build a new home,' said Mr Yeltsin, himself a
former construction engineer.
Finally, the president publicly thanked Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister
whom he failed to save from the Congress of People's Deputies's wrath, for
'teaching market economics' to the government and the people, and for
courageously taking most of the blame for the reforms.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Foreign investment in former communist states tripled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investment in the former communist states of eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union tripled in the year to end-September with 719 acquisitions,
joint ventures and green field projects worth Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18.4bn),
according to East European Investment magazine, a New York-based
publication, writes Anthony Robinson.
Joint ventures account for 351 of the 719 projects while 72 per cent of all
deals were signed with only five host countries - Russia, Hungary, Poland,
former east Germany and the Czech Republic.
US companies emerge as the biggest investors in the 28 countries of the
former Soviet bloc with 219 acquisitions, joint ventures and greenfield
investments amounting to commitments of nearly Dollars 8bn. Russia, Poland
and Hungary were the principal targets for US investment with over 40 per
cent of US investment, or Dollars 3.2bn, pledged to Russia alone.
European and Arab oil companies have also been active in the oil and energy
sector, particularly in former Soviet republics like Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan
and Turkmenistan.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Supermarkets begin fierce price-cut battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J SAINSBURY, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, prompted an aggressive
round of price-cutting by grocery retailers yesterday as it pledged to
reduce prices on 750 lines from Sunday, including savings of 50 per cent on
some items.
Competitors Tesco and Safeway quickly unveiled details of their own January
promotions, raising the prospect of a full-scale price war, but most
industry analysts dismissed this possibility.
'It's not the start of a price war, but it is a significant step up in the
level of promotional skirmishing,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst at
Morgan Stanley.
In the stock market, food retailers' shares were heavily marked down.
Analysts said the price-cutting had been seen as an excuse for shareholders
to take profits in the sector.
They added that Sainsbury's move was a carefully planned campaign to bolster
its market position. The supermarket group said its sales over Christmas
were ahead of budget. Its campaign was likely to put most pressure on Tesco,
on smaller chains such as Gateway and Co-op, and on some independent
retailers.
Tesco and Safeway said their promotions had been planned some time ago, and
dismissed Sainsbury's announcement as a marketing gimmick, a repeat of last
year's January promotion which they claimed had promised much but delivered
little.
'It's very surprising that Sainsbury should repeat the same exercise as last
year, when the reality was far different from customers' perceptions, and it
had no impact on our business,' Tesco said.
Mr Robin Whitbread, marketing director at Sainsbury, countered that the
promotion involved reductions on 750 items, compared with 500 last year. It
would also include substantial reductions of 25 per cent or more on about
100 items, compared with fewer than 30 last year, and would cover a wider
range of goods.
The campaign, moreover, was not limited to January but would continue for an
unspecified period, with discounted items being rotated regularly.
Tesco said it would launch its January promotion on Monday, involving more
than 1,000 lines. This would include at least a third off more than 100
items, with many at half price.
Safeway said it already had 1,000 special offers and would launch a new year
promotion on Monday including 50 per cent savings on some basic items.

Dempsey hears the people of central Europe ask: who am I, where is my home
and who is my neighbour?

THE DEAD PIG had been hanging in the cellar for five days. It was time to
take it down and divide it among the families. The six men - Slovak
peasants, foresters and a local government inspector - were in a good mood.
After a round of vodkas, they set to work.
One of them had brought a sausage-making machine into which he fed chunks of
meat. He turned the wooden handle. Sausages slowly poured out and dropped
into a plastic bucket. The European Community would never approve.
'It's warmer upstairs. You can talk to the womenfolk,' said one of the men
in rubber boots.
Outside, a thick blanket of snow covered the small Slovak hamlet of Lednicke
Rovne, a few miles from Europe's newest international frontier.
***
Earlier that day, the middle-aged porter at the small hotel tucked behind
Prague's Wenceslas Square had been far from sentimental about the break-up
of his country.
'Tell the Slovaks good riddance from us Czechs. We have had enough of their
whingeing. We are better off with our own Czech Republic.' He paused.
'I still think it's the fault of the Germans. They wanted this split-up so
that they can set up another Reich, here in the Czech Lands.' The cashier
sighed, and rolled her eyes, as if to say, Here he goes again.
'And wait until the new year,' the porter continued. 'There will be more
price rises. And then we will be importing food - from the Germans - which
will be dumped on us. They will soon colonise us - just like the second
world war. Pah]'
***
In Lednicke Rovne, it was indeed much warmer upstairs, high above the
cellar. The large, parquet-floored living room was filled with mothers,
children, toys and a Christmas tree.
Marta Rusanakova, who works in one of the forestries across the border in
Moravia, one of the Czech Lands, dipped a large ladle into a barrel full of
sauerkraut and filled my plate, already laden with pork.
'The truth is that those Czechs have been exploiting us since 1918. They
stole everything from us,' she argued.
'I thought the Czechs had built up Slovak industry after 1945,' I said.
'For themselves. Everything was ruled by Prague.'
'Was the relationship that unequal? Slovaks could lobby for your interests
in Prague. Your language and culture were not threatened.'
'The Czechs held the purse strings. They looked down on us as if we were
second-class citizens. Now we are free. Life will be much better. We will
become part of Europe. Slovakia will be for the Slovaks.'
'The 600,000 Hungarians living here will want to feel secure in an
independent Slovakia.'
'The Hungarians have all the rights they deserve. They are always
complaining. What more rights should they have when our Slovaks in Hungary
do not have many rights?'
Ewa, the sister-in-law, interrupted. 'I worry about the break-up. I also
work in the forestry in Moravia. Anton, my husband, who works for the
federal army, has Czech relatives. He will have to choose his ethnic
background once we take out separate citizenship papers. I don't know if I
can keep my job once we become separate countries. It's all right now. But
you never know about the future. We will be commuting to a foreign country.'
Marta said the Slovaks would cope very well without the Czechs. 'They are
even now discrediting our new republic. Prague, and all those intellectuals
who keep travelling abroad, are spreading lies about how we collaborated
with the Germans during the War. You know, the Germans were not that bad.
After all they paid their bills on time.'
'Do you want more sauerkraut?' asked Ewa.
***
The elderly lady wanted some bread. The small shop in Dzienkowice in
southern Poland was still open, even though it was Sunday evening.
She asked for it in Polish, then broke into German. Her request was drowned
by the man behind the counter who was shouting in German.
'Why are you stirring up trouble in Dzienkowice? You journalists are all the
same. Why don't you go to Germany and write about how all those foreigners
and refugees are ruining the country. Get out of here]' he said.
I thought about the brightly-coloured shield, sited near the church in the
centre of the village: 'Frauenfeld O/S Grusst Alle Gaste' (Frauenfeld - the
German for Dzienkowice - Upper Silesia, welcomes all visitors).
'Why did the German National Offensive (a neo-Nazi group from Germany) come
here and try to organise a cell?'
'None of your business,' said the man, storming out of the shop into the
dimly-lit street.
The lady with the bread began to speak. 'Ignore him. He's a bit tense.
Dzienkowice is like a ghetto. There are only 1,600 of us ethnic Germans in
the village. We are confused. Everything has changed since the Wall came
down. The Poles never allowed us to read, learn, or speak German since 1945.
Now we are free again to be German, in Poland. The Poles are upset because
they think we want to be part of Germany again. Everybody is afraid of
history'.
She explained that she saw nothing wrong with the locals of Dzienkowice
putting up war memorials for those German soldiers who had died during the
First and Second World Wars.
'The Poles are getting upset about it. Our sons died too.' She walked out
into the dark evening. 'Be careful driving to Opole. There's a thaw. But
there's black ice.'
Janusz didn't care about the weather, the Poles, history, or the Germans.
'Thieves. That's the problem now,' he complained.
Janusz is the night watchman for the guests' cars at the main hotel in
Opole, one of the main cities in Upper Silesia, which was part of Germany
before 1945.
Each evening, he sets up guard from a tiny caravan which is parked on front
of the hotel.
He unlocked a heavy, U-shaped metal security device, parked my car between
the pavement and the contraption, and locked it again. '10,000 zlotys (about
ten cents) please'.
A Polish businessman, clearly acquainted with the east European attraction
to expensive cars, had taken no chances. He had brought his own yellow steel
clamp for his brand new BMW.
'All the politics is down the road and across the bridge in the Vojvod
(provincial) headquarters,' said Janusz, in a mixture of Polish and German.
The drab, former communist party building had some redeeming qualities. The
paternoster - an open lift like a dumbwaiter in continuous motion - was
still functioning, even if it creaked.
Stanislaw Skakuj, a former member of the Solidarity independent trade union,
now head of the Vojvod's Department for Problems of Citizenship, said:
'Officially, there are no problems with the ethnic Germans. They just have
to stick to the law. They did not ask if they could put up memorials to the
second world war. It's a very sensitive issue'.
'Why did you decide to expel Gunther Boschutz, the neo-Nazi, last week, and
not a year ago, when he first came to Dzienkowice?'
'It was Warsaw which made the decision, not us'.
'Are you afraid about the growing German influence in Poland?'
'Officially, no'.
'What will happen now? Do you think the ethnic Germans will seek, or should
have more autonomy, especially if some of the 180,000 ethnic Germans in
Opole represent a majority in some of the villages."
'Autonomy? Do you know what that word means? It means separatism. Then where
would we be? Look at Yugoslavia. Look at Czechoslovakia. Look at Russia.
Countries all around us are breaking up.'
Henyrk Kroll, the 43-year-old head of the ethnic Germans in Opole, was
standing outside Skakuj's office, engulfed in cigarette smoke.
'The problem, if one exists, is both simple and complex. It is about Poles
coming to terms with the ethnic Germans rediscovering their culture. After
the war, all our rights were taken away,' he explained, chain-smoking his
way through the history of identity.
'Our language and culture practically disappeared,' he explained in
excellent German. 'We are Germans, but Polish citizens. We don't want to
emigrate to Germany. Our home is here, in Upper Silesia. It would be good if
those Germans who emigrated after 1945 came back. We need them to invest. We
need new schools. More teachers. For our identity.'
***
'When I was much younger, my parents never questioned our identity. We never
spoke about the past. We never observed the Sabbath'.
Tamas Lozsy stood outside the Sasz Chevra Orthodox Synagogue on Wesselenyi
street in Budapest. It was a damp and cold Saturday morning. Aged 22, he is
a teacher in a Jewish school. 'The sense of being different started when I
was 14. I wanted to know: What does it mean to be a Jew in Hungary today'.
'Do your parents feel assimilated?"
'If I say they are assimilated to the extent that they think and act like
Hungarians, then they are assimilated. But they are not assimilated from
this point of view; they are afraid.'
'Why are they afraid? Do they worry about the far-right who are grouped
around Istvan Csurka (who recently wrote that Hungary was being taken over
by foreign Jewish financiers)?"
'In the 1920s and 1930s, when the name of Hitler was mentioned in elegant
homes, everyone laughed madly. They said he was a stupid guy. A house
painter. And you know what happened? I hope that history will not repeat
itself. I hope that it will not happen with Csurka.'
Sandor Haraszti interrupted his prayers. 'My parents never spoke about the
past. They wanted to assimilate because of the war. In any case, the system
did not allow us to be Jewish, and not be afraid,' he said.
'I am 17 years old. When I was much younger, I wanted to discover what I
was. I began to read the Talmud. Today, I am insulted on the streets. I
ignore it. I have not yet been attacked, yet. Excuse me. I must go back
inside'.
Young and old Ashkenazi Jews in traditional orthodox dress prayed with the
cantor. Outside, a solitary police car kept watch.
***
They remained silent from Wittenberg Platzto Stadtmitte. They emerged from
the underground into the bitter Berlin air, carrying all they owned in a few
plastic bags.
'We arrived two days ago. From Bosnia,' said Jelena, the mother of four
small children. 'Our country no longer exists.'
***
The guards at the White House, home of Russia's parliament, didn't bother to
check if I had an appointment, even though I had no pass. The name of
Vladimir Isakov carried enough weight to admit me.
As one of the leaders of the National Salvation Front, a loose but
influential parliamentary caucus which groups former communists,
nationalists, and 'national patriots', Isakov vows to defend what he
believes Boris Yeltsin has destroyed.
'Ideals? We have none left. Communism was an ideal to which the people
related. When it evaporated, society disintegrated. We are relying too much
on foreign influences. All your advisers want to shape our government and
legislature. There are no results. No order. No discipline. No authority.'
'Do you want Russia to be integrated with Europe?"
'Western values cannot be transplanted to Russia. Foreign intelligence
services are destroying our industrial base. I want Russia to defend its
interests'.
'What are those interests?'
'Many things. The defence of our Russian minorities living outside Russia.
Especially in the Baltic States. Yeltsin is not defending them. The West is
promoting ethnically-based national states, and new borders, right here, in
the former Soviet Union. We cannot create one hundred nation states in
Russia. Look at what has happened in Yugoslavia. In Czechoslovakia. All this
disintegration is madness. We must protect the Russian soul.'
'How'?
'By relying on our own traditions.'
***
It had started to snow. The onion-shaped dome of St Basil's was barely
visible. The icy, white snow flakes tumbled silently down on Red Square. An
old lady trudged across the slippery cobblestones.
'Where are you going?"
'I want to go home."
'Where is your home?"
'Now, it is with my son, and his family in Moscow.'
'Where was your home?"
'Near Baku. In Azerbaijan. But the fighting never stops. I can't go home. I
have no home.'

FT  31 DEC 92 / Upbeat signal from business organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF Britain's leading business organisations have ended 1992 on a
guardedly upbeat note in spite of statistics yesterday showing company
failures at a record this year.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said
the prospects for recovery during 1993 were good provided industry's
improved competitiveness was not eroded by higher inflation.
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce,
said business 'should be able to look forward to a healthier 1993'. He
forecast that the economy would be in a better state at the end of next year
than at the beginning.
Their comments came as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group,
disclosed a 31 per cent increase in business failures in Britain to nearly
63,000 this year. South-east England, Scotland and Greater London suffered
the biggest concentration of failed businesses, together accounting for 54
per cent of all bankruptcies and liquidations.
However, Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said there
were signs that the increase in company failures was slowing down.
Although a record 16,222 companies failed in the fourth quarter of the year,
the total was only 2.5 per cent higher than in the third quarter. Between
the third and fourth quarters of 1991, by contrast, the number of business
failures increased by 37 per cent to 14,245.
In his new year message to CBI members, Sir Michael said British companies
were starting to benefit from the pound's lower exchange rate, lower
interest rates and lower inflation, while opportunities were being created
by the European Community's single market, US recovery and growth in the Far
East and Pacific regions.
He warned, however, that UK manufacturers would be able to increase market
share only if they kept a firm control of costs, including pay.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in an interview with The Times published
this morning, appeared to rule out further cuts in interest rates unless
monetary demand and growth were 'manifestly' below the government's targets.
However, he was bullish about the economic prospects for next year.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Yeltsin and Bush to seal arms treaty at weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin yesterday approved the
far-reaching nuclear missiles reduction treaty agreed on Tuesday by their
foreign ministers, and are to meet in the Black Sea resort of Sochi this
weekend to seal the Start 2 treaty.
US and Russian experts in Geneva are completing drafting work on the treaty,
which will reduce both sides' nuclear arsenals by around two-thirds. Mr Bush
described the treaty as 'historic' and said he was confident the US Senate
and Russian Congress would ratify the text.
'In my view, this treaty is good for all mankind,' he said yesterday before
flying to Somalia, where he will spend the new year with US troops.
To reach the final compromise, both sides gave ground on three sticking
points:
The US let Russia keep 90 of its 154 silos protecting its massive SS-18
missiles, which are to be eliminated. The silos will be modified to house
other smaller missiles, sparing Russia the expense of destroying one set of
silos and building another.
Russia may also convert 105 of its 170 multiple-warhead SS-19s to single
warhead missiles. The US will itself be keeping Minuteman III missiles
downloaded to only one warhead. Again, this agreement saves Russia the
expense of destroying its SS-19s and having to develop a new missile system,
since its only other single warhead, silo-based missiles are the elderly
SS-11s and SS-13s. The US will be allowed to maintain its B-1 aircraft as
conventional bombers, to be converted to carry nuclear weapons when its
B-52s, built in the 1960s but still going strong, wear out some time in the
next century.
The talks involved broad principles of parity, security and cost, masked in
intricate details of how much concrete to pour into a silo and what parts of
a bomber could be shrouded during an inspection.
Russia accepted stiff cuts in land-based missiles, where it was strongest.
The US similarly gave ground on its submarine arsenal, leaving the US with
an advantage in airborne nuclear missiles - especially acute if Ukraine and
Kazakhstan insist on keeping the Bear and Blackjack bombers based on their
territory.
Ukraine is now the focus of US nuclear diplomacy, as President Leonid
Kravchuk has so far failed to follow through his promise to make his country
a non-nuclear state.
Start 2 builds on the framework of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
signed in 1991. It allows the US and Russia to deploy no more than 3,000 to
3,500 strategic nuclear warheads by the year 2003, with a separate limit of
1,750 warheads deployed on submarine-launched missiles and a ban on the use
of multiple warheads, known as Mirvs, on land-based missiles.
Apart from the rushed timing, before Mr Bush steps down as president, the
summit is unusual for its location. Sochi, Russia's most prized Black Sea
resort, is next to some of the fiercest war zones in the former Soviet
Union. Less than 60 miles south along the Black Sea coast, for example, is
Georgia's Abhazia region, where separatists are fighting the troops of Mr
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader who as Soviet foreign minister was
the architect of previous important arms treaties with the US.

FT  31 DEC 92 / Women to the fore in new honours list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN have a higher-than-usual profile in the New Year Honours list
published today.
Six dames are created and two of the weightier political honours go to Mrs
Shirley Williams, the former Labour cabinet minister and a founder-member of
the Social Democratic party, and Baroness Blatch, the education minister.
Mrs Williams is the only life peer created this time.
In other respects, the list - the last before Mr John Major's review of the
honours system takes effect - is traditional in its mix of politicians and
people from business, the arts and sport. However, the prime minister is
said to have put particular emphasis on charity work as well as other
achievements.
Mr Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Health Service management
executive, and Mr Robert Balchin, chairman of the grant-maintained schools
foundation, become knights in recognition of their contribution to the
government's reforms in health and education.
Among the business figures honoured are five knights: Mr John Keswick,
chairman of Hambros bank; Mr Robert Clarke, chairman of United Biscuits; Mr
Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive of TI group, the
aerospace, seals and tubes group; Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief
executive of Kingfisher, the retail group; and Mr Paul Nicholson, chairman

In the diplomatic honours list, Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC
Holdings, parent of Hongkong Bank and Midland, becomes a knight for public
and commercial services in Hong Kong.
Baroness Blatch is the only member of the government to become a privy
counsellor, although three senior Tory backbenchers are similarly honoured.
They include Sir Peter Hordern, seen by many at Westminster as the most able
Tory MP never to have been a minister, and Sir John Wheeler, formerly
chairman of the cross-party home affairs committee.
Mr Cranley Onslow, who lost the chairmanship of the 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers, is knighted, as is Mr Terence Higgins, formerly chairman of
the cross-party Treasury committee. Mr Roger Moate and Mr Jerry Wiggin,
long-serving but not invariably loyal Tory backbenchers, also become
knights.
Mr David Frost, the broadcaster, becomes a knight and, in the arts world, so
do Mr Malcolm Arnold, the composer, and Mr Anthony Hopkins, the actor.
Novelist Catherine Cookson becomes a dame and the writer Sir Victor
Pritchett becomes a companion of honour.
Mr Jimmy Young, Mrs Thatcher's favourite interviewer, whose radio programme
celebrates 20 years next year, becomes a CBE, as does Mr Frank Barlow,
managing director of Pearson, which owns the Financial Times.

FT  30 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fresh optimism takes FT-SE to peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY expectations of a quiet move towards the end of the trading year in the
London stock market seemed unfounded yesterday when the FT-SE Index rose to
a new peak. The stock market was encouraged by fresh signs of economic
optimism on both sides of the Atlantic. Although equity turnover was thin
and share prices often led from the stock index futures sector, the UK
market responded vigorously to reports of successful post-Christmas trading
at the London stores and then to a sharp rise in the US Consumer Confidence
Index.
The FT-SE Index closed at a new high of 2,847.8, a shade below the day's
best but showing a gain of 20.3 on the session. The advance came in two
parts. Early trading saw the Index jump 15.4 to a whisker above the previous
closing high of 2,842; this gain was quickly lost but the advance was
resumed when the Dow Average gained 12 points in UK trading hours, reversing
its fall of 6 as it took aboard the unexpected rise in the US Consumer
Index.
Once again, there was demand for the second line issues, which brought a
gain of a further 12.4 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index for a close of
2,861.3, also at a new high, as was the FT-SE-A 350 at 1,388.9.
However, traders warned that, with institutional activity at a low ebb until
January 4 when the City returns to full activity, yesterday's gains often
reflected thin turnover.
Seaq volume of 287m shares, although finally a respectable total for what is
effectively a holiday week in the stock market, rated well below an average
session, and even more so by comparison with the volume levels of the past
three months. Seaq volume for the half session on Christmas Eve was a mere
173.6m shares, worth only Pounds 422.1m in retail business, compared with
daily retail totals of more than Pounds 1bn since sterling quit the ERM
network.
Reports of the busy opening to the winter sales season at the big UK store
groups brought widespread gains in leading names in the sector. The final
upswing, however, owed more to the recovery in selected blue chip
internationals, as the dollar and Wall Street gained ground.

FT  30 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Imigran boost for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT Glaxo had received formal approval from the US authorities for the
marketing there of Imigran, its anti-migraine drug, reversed an initial
decline in the share price, sending it swiftly forward. The shares closed 20
up at 768p having earlier been 12 adrift on US switching into cyclical
stocks.
Earlier this month, the US authorities had hinted that approval for Imigran
would probably be forthcoming and many market observers had pencilled in a
probable announcement for some time during the first quarter of 1993. Glaxo
said yesterday that it expects to launch the drug in the US in March, still
in line with most analysts' expectations.
However, Glaxo's confirmation came only just before the London market closed
last night, too late to restrain buying in London in anticipation of an
earlier US launch date. Mr Andrew Porter, pharmaceuticals analyst at Nikko
Europe, predicts that Imigran will generate sales of Dollars 1bn a year by
1995 from the US.
Food manufacturing stocks were among the worst performers in the market on
the back of a pessimistic survey on the outlook for the sector. A quarter of
the food, drink and consumer manufacturers and suppliers interviewed said
they did not expect any improvement in business until 1994. Fewer than half
had detected any improvement in current demand. Among those to suffer falls,
Booker lost 6 to 377p, Cadbury-Schweppes 5 to 483p, Northern Foods 4 to
273p, Unigate 5 to 299p and United Biscuits 5 to 363p.
A line of stock overhung Argyll most of the day, the block of 1m finally
going through at 419p. The shares closed 3 lighter at 420p. A rumour that
Christmas trading at Kwik Save had been disapointing left the shares 9
adrift at 806p.
Recovery talk and the much-publicised sales boom lifted stores stocks. Among
those benefiting, Boots rose 9 to 550p, Dixons 9 to 268p, Kingfisher 11 to
583p and Storehouse 6 to 207p.
A flurry of slightly more optimistic reports on the housing market failed to
inspire any of the related sectors. One analyst said that such forecasts had
been repeatedly bullish and wrong in the past and that the market was taking
its cue from the continuingly weak industry statistics, such as last week's
dull new construction orders for October. Among construction stocks
yesterday, Wimpey managed to shine, the shares gaining 3 to 119p.
Old takeover target Tarmac was the subject of renewed speculation, but this
time seen as a possible predator with Ibstock Johnsen believed to be its
likely prey. Tarmac shares retreated 5 to 101p, with Ibstock a penny better
at 40p.
US investor moves out of defensive and into cyclical stocks hit SmithKline
Beecham, off 17 1/2 at 487 1/2 p and Wellcome, down 4 to 975p. Fisons edged
forward helped by press reports that it may sell its horticultural business
to management. The shares gained 2 to 235p.
Among chemicals stocks, Courtaulds, BOC Group and ICI all benefitted from
the switch to recovery plays. Courtaulds added 8 to 595p, BOC 5 to 768p and
ICI 29 to 1051p.
Shares in BT rose on the back of its recent round of cost-cutting and its
poll position as one of the key recovery hopes. The fully-paid gained 7 to
404p, the part-paid 7 to 300p.
Firmness on Wall Street and in the US dollar helped leading oil shares, the
best performance coming from Shell which added 8 to 559p. BP added 4 at
245p. BP shares were again restrained by background worries in the stock
market over the possibility of a rights issues in the new year. Traders
commented that worries over impending fund-raising moves, both in equities
and in government bonds, represented one of the chief causes for doubts over
the market's dramatic advance in the approach to Christmas.
Reports of strong bookings for 1993 holidays helped the listed tour
operators. Airtours, Britain's third biggest group, added 7 to 285p, while
the second-placed Owners Abroad rose 2 to 87p. Euro Disney surged 22 to
785p.
Consumer recovery hopes spilled over into the automotive sector, with Kwik
Fit the prime beneficiary, the shares up 9 at 126p. BBA Group, ahead 2 at
157p and T&amp;N (Turner and Newall), 5 1/2 better at 173 1/2 p, also gained
from the exposure.
In derivatives, further progress by the March contract on the FT-SE Index
provided the chief feature in thinly-traded futures instruments. The renewed
gain in the stock index future, bringing the March contract to within 10
points of 2,900, provided a strong spur for the underlying stock market, but
futures traders warned that dealing in their sector had been extremely
light.
Throughout the session, March held on to the strong premiums against the
cash market which has been a feature of the latest advance in the Footsie
Index. However, with many of the Footsie constituents, in particular the
pharmaceutical leaders, out of favour at first, the influence of the stock
index future was not displayed in early trading.
But the traditional power of the stock index future strengthened
significantly in the latter half of the session when Wall Street's strong
opening supported sharp gains in Glaxo and ICI. At the official close, March
at 2,890, showed a premium of 41 against the underlying cash market, of
which only 20 points was ascribed to fair value.
In traded options, where only 9,928 contracts traded compared with 6,375 in
the Christmas Eve half-session, Glaxo headed the actives list with 885
contracts, followed by Marks and Spencer at 607.

FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Computer-driven sales lowers
Dow sharply
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A LATE ROUND of computer-driven sell programmes pushed US equity prices
sharply lower on a day in which the market had largely held its own in spite
of an erosion in IBM''s share price, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.42 lower at 3,310.84 after
gaining more than 18 points in the afternoon. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 1.17 to 437.98, while the Amex composite was down
0.35 at 393.83. The Nasdaq composite, however, climbed 2.76 to 669.01.
Trading volume on the New York SE was more than 215m shares, and rises
outnumbered declines by 988 to 825.
On Monday, the Dow had closed 7.02 higher at 3,33.26 on thin volume.
Wall Street's morning buoyancy was the result of several factors including
better-than-expected existing home sales for November, a strong consumer
confidence index and end-of-year window dressing by money managers.
The consumer confidence index for December rose to 78.3 from 65.6 in
November, while the National Association of Realtors said existing home
sales rose 5.8 per cent in November. In addition, the last week of the year
is traditionally a strong period for the stock market. IBM fell Dollars 2 to
Dollars 49 3/4 in active trading after Merrill Lynch cut its long-term
investment rating on the stock to 'above average' from 'buy'.
The Dow also came under pressure from heavy selling in Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing, attributed to profit taking. The issue closed Dollars 2 3/4
lower at Dollars 100 1/8
Among other active blue chips, AT&amp;T added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 , a
52-week high. Philip Morris lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 and Disney
fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/8 .
Shares in Tiffany, the up-market US jeweller, soared Dollars 3 5/8 to
Dollars 33 1/8 on news that several analysts had upgraded investment
ratings. On Monday, Tiffany reported an 8 per cent rise in sales for the
eight week holiday period.
Shares in Cordis, a company which makes specialised medical devices, climbed
Dollars  5/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 36 3/8 . The Food &amp; Drug
Administration approved US marketing of the company's Sleuth XT and PTCA
Dilation Catheters.
News that the FDA had approved the marketing of taxol, a promising new
cancer drug derived from the Pacific yew tree, helped shares in
Bristol-Myers advance Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 68 1/2 . Bristol-Myers has
received permission to market taxol to women with ovarian cancer who have
failed to respond to chemotherapy.
Canada
TORONTO ended little changed in active trading boosted by a large block
trade in International Verifact Inc. shares.
Based on preliminary data, the 300 composite index was down 5.04 points, or
0.15 per cent, to 3,314.87, with advances leading declines 316 to 223.
Volume rose to 40.83m shares compared with 16,01m at Thursday's half-day
session. Canadian markets were closed Friday and Monday for the Christmas
and Boxing Day holidays.

FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses vary as holiday hiatus
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was little news to drive continental markets higher in the countdown
to the new year, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT flattened out in another thin session, the DAX index closing 2.38
lower at 1,542.23 and the more extreme share price variations making little
sense in terms of news, rumour or fundamentals. Turnover rose to DM2.9bn
from DM2.6bn.
Carmakers, once again, raised eyebrows as BMW and Daimler rose by another
DM3.80 to DM488.80, and DM2.50 to DM536.50 respectively. Their suppliers
reflected the industry's prospects more accurately with Continental, the
tyremaker, down DM5.30 to DM193.20 and Varta, the battery manufacturer, DM6
lower at DM269.
Other notable gains included Viag, DM6.30 higher at DM339.80 and Thyssen, up
DM2.80 at DM166, but Mr Thomas Nolten at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that
some fund managers were still polishing up one or two prices for their
year-end display.
PARIS was boosted by arbitrage-related activity as domestic and foreign
institutions continued to remain inactive due to the holiday period. The
CAC-40 index closed at 1,870.28, up 12.75 and just below the day's best
level of 1,874.20. Turnover remained modest at just under FFr2bn.
There was little news on the corporate front, apart from the approval by
shareholders of the industrial group, Matra, of the merger with the media
company, Hachette. Hachette shareholders were to be asked to vote on the
merger later in the day. Hachette jumped FFr3.50, or 4.2 per cent to
FFr86.70 while Matra put on FFr4 to FFr194.
The day's most active stock was SocGen which added FFr18 to FFr615. Pernod
fell FFr9 or 2.4 per cent to FFr363.
AMSTERDAM finished weaker but off the day's lows thanks to share prices
reaching record levels in London. The CBS Tendency index closed at 106.5,
down 0.6.
KLM fell 80 cents to Fl 24.50 on fears of a European air fare war after
Lufthansa's announcement that it will cut tariffs on some of its European
flights from January 1.
Daf dropped Fl 1.30 to Fl 8.90 after the company said that it will halve its
working week for six weeks from next month.
ZURICH consolidated, the SMI index easing 3.7 to 2,089.4. According to the
FT-Actuaries World Indices, the Swiss equity market is leading Europe
comfortably in local currency terms and is the only European bourse with a
sizeable gain in dollar terms.
Swiss Volksbank continued to echo earlier takeover hopes with the shares up
another SFr13 to SFr755.
MILAN rose 2.4 per cent on hopes that the government was about announce a
series of measures to boost investment in the stock market. The Comit index
added 10.55 to 449.03 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's L101.3bn.
Credito Italiano, whose privatisation was announced in September, added L124
or 4.2 per cent to L3,059, while Banca Commerciale Italiana put on L160 or
3.5 per cent to L4,735.
The insurance sector remained strong, with Generali gaining L550 to L29,000.
MADRID featured a further fall in Santander, down Pta125 to Pta4,155, but
the broad market regained its equilibrium. After a fall of over 1 per cent
early in the session, the general index recovered to close only but 0.15
lower at 214.92.
Acerinox and Asturiana de Zinc rose Pta110 to Pta6,340 and Pta25 to Pta1,795
after big block trades in each by Banesto on Monday.
BRUSSELS saw another drop in Delhaize which took the Bel-20 index down by
4.81 to 1,128.18. Volume doubled from Monday's low level to BFr964m.
Delhaize fell BFr46 or 3.4 per cent to BFr1,322 on continued worries about
its US subsidiary Food Lion's expansion plans. STOCKHOLM was led lower by
the pharmaceutical sector which ran into profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden
general index ended 4.10 lower at 913.7 in thin turnover of SKr426m after
SKr368m.
Astra's B share eased SKr7 to SKr730 while the A share fell SKr7 to SKr740.
VIENNA dipped in line with Frankfurt, the ATX index ending 3.43 lower at
749.43. The fibre producer, Lenzing, fell Sch28 or 4.3 per cent to Sch624,
recovering from a session low of Sch611 after warning that it will cut its
dividend for 1992. The paper maker, Leykam, shed Sch14 to Sch252.
ATHENS continued to dissipate the recovery it had achieved in the month to
mid-December. The Athens general index, which stood at 560.11 on November 18
and at 711.88 or 27 per cent better a month later, fell 17.30 to 659.89.

FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Technical rebound lifts
Nikkei in thin trading
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO stocks closed moderately higher in a technical rebound following
Monday's drop, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Public pension fund buying and index-linked buy programs gave prices an
upward twist, but volume remained thin with most investors away on holiday.
The 225-share Nikkei average closed up 97.02 at 17,285.64, after a low of
17,146.48 and a high of 17,312.13 in the late afternoon, helped by short
covering from the futures market. Advances led declines by three to two,
with 533 higher, 354 lower and 182 unchanged and volume was estimated at
about 130m shares. The broader first section Topix index was up 4.54 at
1,326.38, and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.50 to 1,081.07.
'This is not a market for attempting any bold moves,' said Mr Masahiko
Tsuyuzaki of Tachibana Securities. 'We're stuck in a box range in the
absence of any hard news. But public pension funds seem to be coming in and
soaking up selling pressure.'
The market opened higher on bargain-hunting by dealers and some
institutional investors. But the rebound proved short-lived and the Nikkei
succumbed to arbitrage selling and profit-taking ahead of the New Year
holiday.
The day's key gainers were the railway/bus, warehouse, service, gas,
brokerage, precision instrument, communications, automobile, machinery and
airline sectors.
The fishery, credit/lease, food, electric power, non-life insurance and
rolling stock sectors were the decliners.
Most heavily traded, Isuzu rose Y10 to Y318 on the restructuring theme. Some
cheaper large capital issues continued to attract buying interest. Nippon
Steel was up Y4 to Y294 and Hitachi Zosen Y2 to Y497.
Toshiba rose Y6 to Y640, helped by reports that it had won an order to build
a space satellite. Canon ended unchanged at Y1,380 in relatively brisk
trade.
The second section index was down 0.36 to 1,727.42, with 2.95m shares
traded.
Roundup
SOME markets in the region traded for the last time this year. Seoul was
already closed and will reopen on January 4.
HONG KONG closed sharply lower on profit-taking but trading was still very
thin. The Hang Seng index finished 87.52 lower at 5,444.13 with HKDollars
1.48bn changing hands, compared with Monday's HKDollars 2.27bn.
Trading focused on blue chips, with property stocks meeting the most
pressure. Cheung Kong fell 70 cents to HKDollars 18.70, Sun Hung Kai
Properties 70 cents to HKDollars 27.60 and Henderson Land 30 cents to
HKDollars 14.60.
Hang Seng Bank, supported by selective buying in the morning, closed 50
cents lower at HKDollars 51.50. Hutchison Whampoa lost 60 cents to HKDollars
15.
TAIWAN was pulled up by a technical rebound on the last trading day of this
year, but brokers said confidence remained weak and political worries would
continue to hurt the market when it reopens on January 5. The weighted index
ended 49.39 or 1.5 per cent up at 3,377.06 in turnover of TDollars 9.6bn
against Monday's TDollars 10bn.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly ahead despite efforts by some brokers to sell some
stock down to depress the index. The market climbed 8 points in the first 30
minutes but suddenly fell again before noon. The All Ordinaries finished up
2.8 at 1,539.0 in low turnover of ADollars 116.1m.
Among stocks apparently targeted were CRA, down 28 cents to ADollars 13.22,
and Comalco, down 15 cents to ADollars 3.10.
BHP jumped 14 cents to ADollars 13.24 following news that BHP Petroleum has
signed an agreement jointly to explore the Dai Hung oilfield off Vietnam.
The cement maker Adelaide Brighton, down 1 cent to ADollars 1.71, topped
turnover in industrials after South Australia's State Government Insurance
Commission sold 6m shares - half its stake - at Dollars A1.70 each.
NEW ZEALAND was lifted by end-of-year overseas buying of leading shares and
the NZSE 40 capital index closed 15.2 higher at 1,557.52, its first foray
above 1,550 since August 6. Turnover was thin at NZDollars 10.2m.
Brierley rose 1 cent to NZDollars 1.03 while Fletcher Challenge rose 6 cents
to Dollars 2.50.
MANILA closed higher on the last trading day of the year, fuelled by
Philippine Long Distance Telephone's strong performance in New York, and by
window-dressing. The composite index firmed 15.21 to 1,256.22. The market
will reopen on Monday. PLDT rose 25 pesos to 870 while Philippine National
Bank closed 5 pesos higher at 230. Combined turnover eased to 408.74m pesos
from 1.05bn.
SINGAPORE closed firmer in thin trading as the Straits Times Industrial
index rose 2.32 to 1,506 in volume of 52.2m shares against 53.1m.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted to a lower close in thin trading as investors remained
sidelined ahead of the New Year holiday. The composite index fell 2.08 to
642.95 in volume of 51.5m shares against 80.5m.

FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Summit plan leaves Copenhagen flat -
Danish shares are still the worst performers in Europe this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There had been hopes that the solution to Denmark's Maastricht treaty
problem, at the Edinburgh summit a little over a fortnight ago, would lift
the Copenhagen bond and equities markets out of the doldrums in which they
have wallowed since last the treaty went down to defeat in the Danish
referendum last June.
But the Edinburgh deal has failed to impress the financial markets, which
are operating under the influence of several important negative influences.
The continued currency unrest and very high short-term interest rates are a
drag on the markets.
The medium-term outlook is adversely affected by currency depreciation in
several of Denmark's most important export markets, especially Sweden and
the UK, and by the prospect of stagnation in the German market which
accounts for 20 per cent of Denmark's merchandise exports.
Several of the large industrial companies have adjusted their profit
forecasts for 1992 downwards, including FLS Industries, Danisco and
Lauritzen, while Carlsberg warned that earnings growth may not be as strong
in 1992-93 as last year.
Novo Nordisk's share price, meanwhile, has fallen in recent days following a
statement by the group that it will not be able to introduce nasal sprays
for insulin before the turn of the century.
The all-share index has fallen by nearly 25 per cent since the beginning of
1992, making Copenhagen the worst performer in Europe. The shares to suffer
most were the banks, down by 30 per cent, insurance, down 39 per cent, and
investment companies, down 38 per cent. In each case the performance
reflects the dismal state of the property and the equity markets.
Although no major Danish bank has run into terminal trouble (in marked
contrast to the banks in Denmark's Nordic neighbours), the banks continue to
report very large loss provisions.
Hafnia Holding, controlling the Hafnia insurance business, suspended
payments in the autumn following unwise investments in Sweden's Skandia and
Denmark's Baltica, while Baltica expects to see its equity capital halved as
a result of 1992 losses.
Until both long- and short-term interest rates come down, and bond and share
prices recover, companies in the financial sector will continue to face
extremely difficult conditions.
While market conditions have been unsatisfactory in 1992, the Copenhagen
Stock Exchange (CSE), the Guarantee Fund for Future and Options and the
Securities Registrations Centre, the institutional trio which operate the
Copenhagen market, are feeling pleased by a number of innovations which they
say have helped to make the Copenhagen market more attractive.
The Guarantee Fund reduced its fees to market-makers three times in 1992,
finally abolishing fees, which were made per contract, for registered
market-makers with effect from the first trading day of 1993.
The Copenhagen futures and options market has noted an increase in contracts
concluded of about 50 per cent in 1992, says Mr Tyge Vorstrup Rasmussen, the
fund's chief executive, and he expects that there will be a similar increase
again in 1993.
Options on three new shares will be introduced from January 1: Carlsberg B,
Sophus Berendsen B and ISS B. Options trading exists already for Danske
Bank, Unidanmark, Novo Nordisk, Danisco and East Asiatic.
Another important innovation was the establishment in the autumn of
Copenhagen Stock Exchange International (COSI) for trading in international
securities which are not listed on the CSE.
The COSI list includes leading German and Scandinavian shares and Swedish
government bonds. 'Turnover in some of the Nordic shares, such as Norsk
Hydro, Volvo and Ericsson, in the COSI system is 20 to 70 per cent of the
turnover in the shares' domestic markets,' says Mr Vorstrup Rasmussen.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Futures rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were sharp rises in currency futures across Europe yesterday, as
dealers continued to take the view that interest rates in Germany could come
down earlier than expected, writes James Blitz.
In sterling markets, dealers ignored the signs of economic recovery in the
high street, and continued to believe that the government would introduce
another cut in base rates before March.
Trading in all markets continued to be thin because of the holiday season,
but there was an upbeat tone everywhere.
On the German cash market, call money was little changed at 8.80-8.85 per
cent, despite the Bundesbank's unexpected decision to drain DM8.8bn from the
money market in its weekly securities repurchase operation. The draining ran
counter to forecasts of an allocation to match the DM57.1bn in expiring
funds, but dealers said that the lower injection had not upset the market.
Short-dated Euromark futures continued the upward progress that
characterised the approach to Christmas. The March contract rose 5 basis
points to close at 92.24, while the June contract was up 7 basis points to a
close of 93.01.
At these levels, the market assumes that 3-month D-Marks will be some 180
points cheaper over the next 6 months. However, some dealers continue to
take an extremely pessimistic view of the possibility of German policy being
eased, at least before March.
French futures reflected the calmer atmosphere. The March contract closed up
11 basis points at 91.89 and the June contract up 10 basis points at 91.95.
In the sterling market, dealers might have been expected to take a more
bearish view, following reports that there had been a surge of high street
shopping shortly before Christmas.
However, the futures market continued to think there would be another 50
basis point cut in base rates before the spring. The March short sterling
contract rose 10 basis points to close at 93.42, a level which assumes that
3 month money will be at 6.58 per cent within 3 months.
Dealing in the cash market was not as bullish. Three month money closed
slightly softer yesterday at 7 1/16 per cent from about 7 1/8 per cent. The
1 year rate was also  1/16 per cent softer at about 6 7/8 per cent.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong dollar rally continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US DOLLAR yesterday rose to its highest level against the D-Mark since
the autumn currency crisis, following a remarkable surge in consumer
confidence data in the US, writes James Blitz.
The dollar's mini-rally continued to dominate the light trading of the
holiday period. But dealers think that there may be currency tension in the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism in the New Year, and a weak performance by
the Irish punt yesterday added to concerns.
On Monday, the dollar rose more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing
in New York at DM1.6205. Analysts explained the surge in the dollar/D-Mark
rate by the increasing tension in the Middle East and speculation that
German interest rates will be cut in the near term.
The surge continued to a high of DM1.6235 yesterday after the US consumer
confidence index rose to 78.3 per cent after a revised 65.6 per cent in
November. Forecasts for the December figure had been for a more modest 70.1
per cent.
US housing data were also strong, with existing home sales jumping 5.0 per
cent in November to an unadjusted annual rate of 3.85 million, the highest
sales level since November 1986.
The dollar lost ground in late European trading as the DM1.6240 level proved
increasingly difficult to overcome. It later closed in London at DM1.6140,
more than a pfennig up on the day.
The US currency remained particularly strong against sterling. The pound
fell below the Dollars 1.50 level for the first time this year to a low of
Dollars 1.4988. Sterling last saw this level in January 1987.
The pound later closed at Dollars 1.5135, down nearly two cents on the day.
Sterling was significantly weaker on the Bank of England's trade weighted
index, which measures the pound against a basket of other currencies. The
pound closed at 79.0 on the index, having finished on Monday at 79.5.
In thin markets, small orders can make a big difference to exchange rates,
and dealers reported that dollar trading remained light.
However, some analysts believe the dollar is set for a significant rally in
the New Year. According to IDEA, the financial market analysts, strong
consumer confidence figures should be the main factor behind a strong rise
in the November leading indicator today.
The French franc ended at a three-week high, as dollar strength lured funds
out of the D-Mark. The franc closed at FFr3.404, up more than a centime on
the day. However, the Irish punt alternated with the French franc throughout
the day at the bottom of the ERM grid.
Dealers are waiting to see whether the Dublin government will go ahead with
its plan to lift exchange controls by the end of the year.

Activity in most LME base metals was subdued in the post-Christmas/pre-New
Year holiday hiatus. Business will be slow to pick up until next week,
dealers predicted. COPPER prices consolidated around earlier highs in the
afternoon, with interest dwindling after Chinese buying in the morning.
Sterling's weakness assisted the upward movement in the LEAD market, where
prices were supported by influential commission house buying. London's
robusta COFFEE dipped sharply in late trading and finished with losses of up
to Dollars 22 on key nearby positions. Conditions were nervous with the
market having entered a more volatile phase after its recent steady advance.
GOLD eased on the London bullion market, under pressure from a strong dollar
and light producer selling in a thin market. Dealers noted gold was up
around R1,018 a troy ounce compared to only R1,004 last week and in
Australian dollars it was holding above the key ADollars 480 level.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Sumitomo Metal in Y30bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Metal Industries had the international bond markets all to itself
yesterday for a Y30bn Euroyen issue through Yamaichi International (Europe).
The bonds have the short first coupon indicative of bonds targetted for a
rapid return to Japan. They are due to mature in April 2000 and carry a
coupon of 5.3 per cent.
Chartered WestLB said it has completed the private placement of fixed-rate
medium-term notes for Alto Parana in Argentina, a private sector company
described as the country's largest producer of softwood pulp. The paper has
a maturity of two years with a put option at 18 months, and is priced to
yield 12 1/2 per cent.
The bank won the mandate to arrange a borrowing for up to Dollars 50m
several months ago, and news of the terms and claims of a successful
placement surprised bankers who specialise in the sector.
The yield looks too high, they say. The company would be better off issuing
commercial paper. 'We placed over 80 per cent with institutional and retail
investors, mostly offshore,' said Bill Hayes, a managing director of
Chartered WestLB in New York.

US Treasury prices firmed yesterday in spite of further signs that US
consumer confidence is growing.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at
103 3/32 yielding 7.361 per cent.
At the short end of the mar ket, the two-year note was up  3/32 to yield
4.592 per cent.
Price movements were mag nified by thin volume.
The Federal Reserve added liquidity to the banking system by arranging
Dollars 2bn in customer repurchase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at
3 3/16 per cent. In late trading, Fed Funds were quoted at 2 1/2 per cent.
The economic news of the morning included an unexpect edly strong consumer
confi dence index for December, which climbed to 78.3 from 65.6 in November.
In addition, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales
rose 5.8 per cent.
Although both numbers were stronger than expected, they were consistent with
an economy which is growing slowly.
UK government bond futures climbed more than half a point yesterday in thin
trading, encouraged by a relatively strong US Treasury bond market and some
meagre year-end buying.
Dealers pointed out that the thin market - only about 7,000 gilt futures
contracts were traded - accentuated the gains yesterday.
The market opened on a weak note, which dealers attributed to the morning's
reports of a big turn-out at the post-Christmas sales.
A strong surge in consumer spending could be disappointing for the gilt
market as it would reduce the chance of another cut in the base rate.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 100.17 at the opening to break
through the 101.00 level and traded up to around 101.05 by late afternoon.
Activity in the cash market was subdued, with the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due
1997 edging up to 111 1/32 , compared with a closing price of 110 31/32 on
Christmas Eve.
The Bank of England announced yesterday afternoon that a Pounds 350m
tranchette of 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012 had been exhausted.
GERMAN government bonds edged lower with the market absorbing the new
Federal bund issue launched yesterday.
The Federal bond consortium issued DM3bn of 7 1/8 per cent bunds due
December 2002, and a further DM7bn is expected to be issued today.
Dealers said the 2002 bund, which will become the new benchmark next month,
was issued at 100.40 and was quoted at well above its book price.
In the futures markets, Liffe's March Bund futures contract ended at around
92.52, down 0.07 point from the previous close.
JAPANESE government bond prices ended little changed on the day with dealers
noting some profit taking.
The March futures contract, which broke through the important 108.00
resistance level on Christmas Day trading following the release of
disappointing economic data, ended at around 108.24 in London trading
yesterday.
In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark 145 moved between 4.525-4.545
per cent, ending at 4.535 per cent compared with its Monday close of 4.525
per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARREFOUR, one of France's largest food retailing and hypermarket groups,
has sold its catering division, Eris Restauration, to Phenix Richelieu, an
investment company.
The disposal, for an undisclosed sum, comes as Carrefour's retailing
activities are under pressure due to the economic slowdown in France.
Consumer spending has been hit by concern about rising unemployment and the
impact of high real interest rates.
Mr Michel Bon this autumn resigned as Carrefour's chairman after reporting a
sharp fall in interim profits. Earlier Mr Jacques Fournier, his successor,
said November sales had been 'the worst in the company's history'.
He also warned that Carrefour's chances of meeting its forecast of a 10 per
cent profit growth this year - from FFr1.21bn (Dollars 224m) on sales of
FFr100.38bn in 1991 - would be entirely dependent on the pattern of December
trading.
The disposal of Eris will provide capital for Carrefour and enable the
management team to concentrate on its core retail interests. Eris, which
owns France's fourth largest chain of cafeterias and four fast food outlets,
is expected to record sales of FFr400m this year.
Phenix Richelieu is linked to Banque du Phenix, part of the Assurances
Generales de France insurance group, and the Societe Marseillaise de Credit
bank.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Groupe Bull 'dumbfounded' by
loss of Dollars 740m US contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a less than happy Christmas for Groupe Bull, the French state-owned
computer manufacturer. Its senior management learned on December 24 it had
lost a prize - a Dollars 740m personal computer contract for US Air Force -
it had believed was securely in the bag.
'We are dumbfounded,' a company spokesman said yesterday. The contract,
known as Desktop IV and involving the supply of some 300,000 computers over
three years, was awarded to Zenith Data Systems, Bull's US-based PC arm, in
the late summer.
As late as a week ago Bull executives believed appeals against the award
mounted by unsuccessful bidders for the contract would be turned down.
Last week, however, administrative judge Catherine Hyatt ruled that the
appeals, by a group of computer companies including CompuAdd Computer, Apple
Computer, Electronic Data Systems and Government Technology Services, should
stand.
The arguments behind the 53-page ruling will not be made public until
January 4, apparently for reasons of commercial confidentiality, leaving the
participants in some confusion.
There was no clear indication yesterday of whether Desktop IV would be
rebid, or whether the government would move directly to Desktop V.
Some argue the contract has now become an embarrassment for the Pentagon
because it was the first to be awarded under a new fast-track bidding
process, designed to give the armed forces speedy access to the most
advanced technology.
It is also a serious blow for Bull, under its new chairman Mr Bernard Pache.
It is struggling back to profitability and credibility after three years of
losses. The contract was not the be and end all of the company 'but it does
not do our image much good' said a spokesman, who went on to point out
projected revenues and profits from Desktop IV had not been included in the
company's budget figures for the coming year.
Bull had anticipated, however, that Desktop IV would boost its revenues
perhaps by as much as 20 per cent a year, while providing much needed
manufacturing volume to keep prices down.
The contract would also have been a strong endorsement of the quality of the
company's products and an indication that its French ownership was no bar to
doing business with the US government.
Bull said yesterday, however, that any suggestion that its ownership was a
reason for the judge's decision was far off the mark, pointing out that Bull
already sells more than Dollars 100m worth of computer equipment annually to
the US government.

<TEXT>
BANCA Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank, has forecast improved 1992
operating earnings in spite of the need for higher provisions and write
downs.
Last year, BCI, one of the country's main privatisation candidates, reported
gross operating profits of L1,139bn (Dollars 825.9m) and net earnings of
L317.5bn.
BCI said its latest results indicated a second-half upturn compared with
trading conditions in the first six months, when it reported operating
profits of L594bn.
But it warned of heavier write-downs this year on securities and problem
loans, while expenses had risen on account of its branch opening plans,
which saw an increase in its total network to almost 700 units.
Internationale Nederlanden, the big Dutch banking and insurance group, has
bought the remaining 40 per cent in Sviluppo, the Milan-based financial
services group, it did not own.
The deal represents a change of tack for Mr Francesco Micheli, the financier
whose quoted Finarte group controlled Sviluppo.
Meanwhile, Mr Micheli is to stay on as chairman of Sviluppo.

YAMATANE Securities, an ailing second-tier Japanese broker, appears to have

Sakura is planning to send an executive to take control of Yamatane, which
reported a net loss of Y25.4bn (Dollars 205m) last fiscal year and is likely
to report another large loss this year due to the continuing weakness of
stock prices and trading volume on the Tokyo market.
But the fate of the broker's former chairman, Mr Tomiji Yamazaki, remains
unclear. As part of the reform plan, he has promised to resign next June as
a board member, though his family has controlled Yamatane since its founding
in 1933 and is likely to continue to exercise influence over the management.
The difficulties of returning Yamatane to profit were highlighted on Monday
when the trading volume on the Tokyo market was a meagre 117m shares, the
lowest level for 10 years, and particularly damaging for second-tier brokers
which are more reliant on stock commissions than the big four brokers.
Negotiating the reform plan was complicated by a disagreement between Mr
Tomiji Yamazaki and his brother, Seizo, who runs Yamatane Corporation, a
warehouse operator and food distributor with a 6.2 per cent stake in the
broker.
Tomiji had appealed to Seizo for assistance, but the latter was dismayed by
the controversy that the broker has drawn to the Yamatane name over the past
two years.
Yamatane was investigated by the finance ministry for its role in a
'tobashi' scandal, in which brokers shuffled stocks around client accounts
to avoid booking losses. But some of those clients discovered they were left
holding the losing stocks, leading to legal actions against Yamatane.
Overseeing the reform of Yamatane will add to Sakura's expertise in the
securities industry, though the deregulation of Japan's financial system has
slowed, and the bank may have to wait several years before it can establish
a subsidiary to deal in stocks.
'Since we are the main bank of Yamatane, it is natural that we would give
them assistance. We have been occasionally helping them and we are studying
a request for us to send them a new president,' Sakura Bank said yesterday.
Yamatane said three creditor banks, Asahi, Mitsubishi Trust and Nippon
Credit Bank, will be satisfied by the increased authority given to Sakura.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica plan to merge units
welcomed

INVESTORS have welcomed the plan by Finmeccanica, the holding company
controlling most of Italy's state-owned aerospace and engineering
activities, to merge its listed subsidiaries into a single quoted group.
The combined unit would bring together under Finmeccanica, which gained a
stock market listing in October, its Alenia aerospace business and
Elsag-Bailey precision engineering arm.
Brokers compare the agglomeration, to be approved by shareholders' meetings
in February, with international engineering conglomerates.
Finmeccanica said the merged unit will be Italy's second biggest quoted
engineering group behind Fiat, with a market capitalisation of about
L2,100bn (Dollars 1.4bn). Net earnings should be 'at least' on a par with
the L186.8bn made in 1991 before the exceptional repayment of L719bn in aid
and interest to IRI, the state holding company which controls Finmeccanica.
Should all minorities approve the share swap, IRI's stake in Finmeccanica's
ordinary shares will drop to 86.6 per cent from 96.4 per cent in what could
be the first stage in a bigger dilution of the Italian government's stake
given under its privatisation plans. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury
minister, recently forecast capital increases for Finmeccanica and Stet,
IRI's telecommunications holding company. The state could eventually hold
less than 50 per cent of the shares in a recapitalised Finmeccanica, he
indicated.
The timing may partly depend on the financial state of IRI. The transaction
which gave Finmeccanica a stock market listing via the reverse takeover of
its quoted Sifa subsidiary, was to have been the prelude to a multi-stage
capital increase. Finmeccanica would have raised L1,700bn via a cash
injection from IRI, bank credits and convertible bonds for private
investors. However, IRI's financial difficulties and the poor state of the
bourse forced it to shelve immediate cash-raising plans.

DONOHUE, the forest products unit of Quebecor, North America's second
biggest commercial printer, is considering buying two newsprint mills from
Domtar, a struggling pulp and paper group controlled indirectly by the
Quebec government.
The two mills in the Quebec city area are worth several hundred million
dollars.
Domtar has modernised them, but wants to concentrate its resources on its
other mills in eastern Canada making business and copying papers, fine
papers and other products.
It is also North America's third largest producer of gypsum wallboard - a
business it would like to sell when construction markets recover.
'Nothing is settled until talks are completed,' said Mr Michel Page,
president of Donohue and a former senior Quebec cabinet minister. His
company is one of North America's lowest-cost producers of newsprint, market
pulp and timber products.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: New issues at record levels
in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CORPORATE issues of debt and equity securities surged to record levels
in 1992, as companies took advantage of low US interest rates and a solid
stock market and put their balance sheets into better shape.
According to provisional figures from Securities Data, the financial
information group, companies have raised more than Dollars 1,000bn through
underwritten debt and equity offering worldwide during the past 12 months.
Of this, over Dollars 838bn was raised in the US - a 42 per cent increase on
the previous record amount of Dollars 590bn raised in 1991. Over Dollars
282m is estimated to have been raised outside the US, with volumes picking
up towards the year-end, as interest rates in a number of European countries
fell.
The sizzling US activity has meant Wall Street investment banks have enjoyed
record fees from underwriting new issues - a fact reflected in employee
bonus payments.
Securities Data suggests the underwriters will have earned over Dollars
6.7bn in 1992, up by almost 45 per cent from the Dollars 4.7bn which they
netted in 1991, the previous all-time high.
The biggest winner is reckoned to be Merrill Lynch, earning around Dollars
1.4bn. Goldman Sachs fell into second place with Dollars 909m and Lehman
Brothers came in third, with Dollars 631m. Morgan Stanley took fourth place
(Dollars 611m), followed by First Boston (Dollars 477m).
The surge in corporate issues was spread across debt and equity markets.
Domestic debt offerings, excluding mortgage and asset-backed securities,
totalled over Dollars 301bn - almost as much as companies raised in this
fashion in 1991 and 1992 combined.
Helping to boost this figure was the revival of the 'junk bond', or
high-yield security; offerings of 'junk bonds' raised around Dollars 38bn,
surpassing the previous annual record of Dollars 31bn set in 1986.
On the equity front, common stock (or ordinary share) issues raised Dollars
72.4bn, a 29 per cent increase over the previous record figure of Dollars
56bn seen last year.
The volume of initial public offerings - or flotations - soared to Dollars
38bn, well in excess of the record Dollars 26.8bn raised in 1986. During the
year, more than 600 new corporate listings were established, although the
pace at which companies were coming to the stock market did ease in the
second half of the year as investors appeared to have reached saturation
point.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Soeryadjayas lose majority stake
in Astra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SOERYADJAYA family yesterday lost their majority stake in Astra
International, Indonesia's dominant automotive company, when they sold 26.5m
shares for Rp265bn (Dollars 129m).
The buyer of the stake, 10.9 per cent of the company, has not been revealed,
but brokers say it is the pension fund of state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia.
Astra has been engulfed by an ownership crisis following the mid-November
suspension of Bank Summa, privately owned by the Soeryadjaya family, with
outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn. On December 14, the central bank
ordered Bank Summa's liquidation.
Yesterday's sale leaves the Soeryadjaya family holding about 111m Astra
shares, or a 46 per cent stake, most of which is pledged to banks against
loans on which the family is currently in default.
'The sale shows the government is committed to supporting Astra and should
provide comfort to Toyota and banks with exposure to Astra', explained one
foreign broker.
Toyota vehicles accounted for about half Astra's Rp4,933bn turnover in 1991
and the company is considering the purchase of 20m shares offered by
Soeryadjayas. Astra has more than Dollars 900m in outstanding loans from
foreign banks.
Brokers said yesterday's transaction involved shares pledged to Bank
Universal, which is 51 per cent owned by Astra International.
Business colleagues of the Soeryadjayas said the shares were pledged against
loans of about Rp250bn, equivalent to 30 per cent of the bank's total loans
as of last December.
Astra officials have denied details of the loans.
To cover Bank Summa's obligations, the Soeryadjayas have also been
negotiating the sale of at least 100m shares to a consortium led by Mr
Prajogo Pangestu, a timber tycoon. An agreement was signed last week but was
then blocked by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, chairman of Astra, who has since
resigned his post.
Talks with the consortium are continuing, although Mr Pangestu said at the
weekend he valued Astra at Rp7,000 a share, against the Rp10,000 price of
yesterday's deal.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Study urges review of accounting
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LISTED and unlisted companies in Europe should be subject to different
accounting requirements, an analysis from the Federation of European
Accountants suggests.
'Profound' differences in accounting policies exist as much between listed
and unlisted companies as they do between different European countries, it
concludes.
The survey also provides a hint that companies can expect the European
Commission to pay greater attention to the treatment of intangible assets
and lease contracts in the coming months.
Writing in a preface, Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, EC commissioner for financial
institutions and company law, said the EC-sponsored Accounting Advisory
Forum will be considering these two issues.
The 1992 survey of published accounts from Federation des Experts Comptables
Europeens (FEE)which represents accountancy bodies across Europe, is based
on a study of the accounts of 441 small and medium-sized companies in 11 EC
countries, and four EFTA countries.
Companies traded on secondary markets are treated as unlisted. It found that
listed companies are more likely to provide information than unlisted
companies, although they offer less on off-balance sheet financing.
Different practices between the two categories were most pronounced in
topics such as availability of financial statements, provision of additional
statements, changes in valuation policies, off-balance sheet information and
use of current values.
The study found listed companies tend to change accounting policies more
frequently, but they are no more likely to use accounting policies which
flatter profits than unlisted companies. It recommends greater accounting
guidance on the treatment of long-term contracts.

FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: AMB shrugs off legal move to
halt BfG deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LAST-minute legal bid to stall a three-way deal designed to give France's
Credit Lyonnais control of Germany's troubled BfG bank, will fail, according
to Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs.
AMB, the insurance group controlling BfG, insisted yesterday that today's
extraordinary general meeting would go ahead as planned, despite court
action by one shareholder.
The meeting will be asked to approve the takeover and also grant Assurances
Generales de France (AGF) full voting rights on its 25 per cent stake in
AMB. An individual shareholder 'obviously' acting on behalf of a third party
had asked an Aachen court on Christmas Eve for a temporary injunction
postponing the meeting, AMB said.
The plaintiff, Mr Wilm Lurken, a lawyer holding one AMB share, had also
demanded that if the meeting went ahead, any decisions taken should not be
allowed to take effect.
AMB said it expected the application to be dismissed as groundless at a
court hearing scheduled for January 12.
No details were available of the contents of Mr Lurken's application nor of
shareholders he might represent. However, most speculation focuses on La
Fondiaria, an Italian insurance group with a 20 per cent holding in AMB. A
handful of small shareholders has also been agitating against part of the
deal.
Registration of the state-owned French insurer's effective blocking stake
will markedly dilute La Fondiaria's influence at AMB. The extent to which
AMB's present shareholders will be required to guarantee outstanding BfG
loans after the takeover is also believed to be a further source of
friction.
The bank, part-owned by a German trade union holding company, is heavily
exposed in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, small shareholders say the state-owned French insurer AGF, which
engineered the deal with Credit Lyonnais in return for assurances that its
shares would be registered, should be obliged to make a full bid for AMB.
Contracts on the sale of 50 per cent plus one share in BfG to the
state-owned Credit Lyonnais were signed on December 23. The French bank,
which recently announced a FFr1.79bn capital increase, plans to inject
DM1.2bn into its acquisition.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Confidence is the key to recovery - Andrew
Baxter continues the FT's occasional survey of six companies in the
engineering sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HOLY grail of British industry
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
confidence - is making a faint but detectable reappearance in the
engineering sector as a nightmare year in the battle against recession draws
to a close.
The signals remain mixed, but the six companies in the FT's occasional
survey of the engineering sector are beginning to sound a little cheerier
about prospects for 1993.
Confidence among the six companies and their customers is not exactly
flowing back, but is at least trickling back in most cases. Where it is not
there are growing expectations that it will do over the next few months.
The autumn has brought considerable upheaval for the FT Six and British
industry at large. Interest rates have come down by 3 percentage points,
Black Wednesday has transformed terms of trade for both exporters and
importers, and Chancellor Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement gave industry at
least part of what it wanted on infrastructure spending and support for
manufacturing investment.
All this activity has encouraged the FT Six, but the results at the front
line - selling to customers - show that restoring something nebulous and
unquantifiable such as confidence needs more than can be achieved simply by
moving the financial parameters. Above all, it needs time.
Current conditions vary among the six companies, which operate in diverse
sectors including machine tools and vehicle parts, gears and construction
equipment.
In some there has been a very sharp rise in inquiry levels over the past
three months, and evidence of more confidence, although not yet converted
into orders.
Other companies see no signs of a change in UK market sentiment yet, but at
least expressed 'confidence about confidence'.
Exporters are encouraged by a brighter outlook in US markets, which they are
now better able to exploit because of the pound's devaluation. In Europe
too, exporters such as Bloxwich are discovering new sales opportunities
where doors were previously closed. But there is concern about continental
European market conditions, which look to be worsening in some sectors.
As with their assessment of the current market, there is some divergence too
on the scope or need for further cuts in interest rates.
Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group, believes a cut in interest
rates of 2 percentage points would have a dramatic effect on confidence.
'There are still people who think that it would not take too much before the
Treasury hikes interest rates up - after, all, they did it by 3 per cent in
one day,' he says.
On the other hand, Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman of JCB, says: 'You
could keep cutting interest rates for ever, but it's just going to take time
for confidence to return.' And Mr Peter Barker, chairman of Fenner, believes
that, with the stabilisation of sterling, 'the opportunity is there for a 1
point cut early in the new year. This would be another very firm indication
that things are on the move'.
This is how the six companies have fared over the autumn and their outlook
for the next few months:
JCB: The biggest British-owned construction equipment group is now producing
at about one-third the rate of four years ago, and has reduced its workforce
at its Rocester, Staffs, base by about 100 in the past three months.
However, the privately-owned company is still making a profit, says Mr
Johnston. He sees no sign yet of any change in sentiment in the UK market,
but says: 'It must come through, of that we're confident.'
Mr Johnston says sterling's devaluation had increased JCB's profit per unit
sold in continental Europe, but there had been no real opportunity to
increase volume sales.
The success of the Edinburgh summit should alleviate the recession on the
continent. 'To us, that is probably the biggest problem.'
*****
At Senior Engineering Group, Mr John Bell, chief executive of the tubing,
boilers and ductwork group, says: 'I do think there is more confidence
around in the UK, although there is not too much evidence of this in
orders.' But things are beginning to look up in the US market, where Senior
is expanding its presence.
Devaluation of sterling, meanwhile, has been a two-edged sword, and the
current rate against the D-Mark is too low. 'It's this question of balancing
the higher cost of imported materials against the benefits from exporting
products,' he says.
The group is trying to sell its mining equipment business and is closing its
large turnkey power generation project side, with the loss of 90 jobs,
because of the contraction of the UK coal industry.
*****
Fenner, the Hull-based power transmission and industrial conveyor belts
group, has also been reshaping its mining equipment business over the past
two years, and Mr Peter Barker, chairman, says the size and timescale of the
Government's original pit closure plan was breathtaking.
Fenner is world leader in conveyor belting used in mines, about half of
which goes for export. Mr Barker is now adopting a 'wait and see' attitude
while the coal industry's future is being reconsidered.
Elsewhere, Mr Barker sees some very faint signs of increased confidence, but
cautions that it is too early to see substantial benefits from the interest
rate cuts and Autumn Statement initiatives.
Devaluation of sterling has produced distinct advantages in markets with
dollar-related currencies, although again these do not happen overnight.
*****
At Bloxwich Engineering, one of the UK's biggest independent producers of
car and truck parts, devaluation has also brought benefits.
'We've seen a lot of interest in our products, particularly from Germany,'
says Mr Peter Burton, chief execu-tive.
'They appreciate that Britain ought to be able to supply cheaper than
Germany - the difficulty in the past was the price.'
Overall, Mr Burton is optimistic. Recent government initiatives have been
good for the UK motor industry, he says, and November/December sales,
normally flat, have been better than expected.
'We believe there will be an uplift in the new year,' he says - there could
even be a marginal increase in emp-loyment next year from the current 400.
Mr Burton is particularly pleased by a big development order from Van
Technology, the holding company for Renault and Daf's new generation of
commercial vehicles.
*****
At Posiva, the UK subsidiary of the German gears and drives company, inquiry
levels in the last three months were 58 per cent higher than in the previous
quarter, says Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director.
Orders are up 2 per cent compared with this time last year, despite
intensifying competition, and output is down 3 per cent.
Devaluation has been a mixed blessing. A lot of the inquiries concern export
work, and Posiva has in any case been benefiting from a rise in orders as
British manufacturers specify German components to win European export
contracts.
The UK company imports all its products, however, and Mr Bricknell is now
looking at sourcing components such as bearings and castings in the UK on
behalf of its parent company, to make the whole product package more
competitive. It could even acquire a UK gear manufacturer if one became
available.
*****
Business is still very slow in the UK, says Mr Gaskell at 600 Group, the big
manufacturer and importer of machine tools and materials handling equipment.
'We are just starting to see people nibbling at some of the larger
machines,' he says.
'They are inquiring more, but they don't really have the confidence to place
big orders.'
Mr Gaskell says the government 'has got to say something about its long-term
strategy on interest rates to help restore customers' confid-ence.
Employment has been reduced by another 100 over recent months, and will be
down to about 1,550 by the end of the year - compared with 2,700 two years
ago when Mr Gaskell joined the company.
Meanwhile, he sees signs of improvement in the US and in Australia, and
believes the devaluation of sterling will help the company sell its
equipment in Germany.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Whinney Mackay stays in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIFFICULT trading conditions experienced in the second half of last year
by Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architectural practice, continued in
the opening half of the 1992/93 year.
As a result the company finished the six months to end-October Pounds
353,000 in loss at the pre-tax level compared with previous profits of
Pounds 119,000. For the 1991/92 year as a whole Whinney incurred a loss of
Pounds 435,000, after an exceptional provision of Pounds 163,000.
First half turnover tumbled from Pounds 3.29m to Pounds 1.97m and led to an
operating deficit of Pounds 109,000, against a profit of Pounds 375,000.
Mr Jeremy Mackay-Lewis, chairman, said it had not been possible 'to keep
pace with the decline in turnover for London-based operations', in spite of
continued cost cutting in line with falling new commissions and 'tight fee
margins'.
London developers were reluctant to go ahead with projects which were not
pre-let. However, the refurbishment market was improving and the group
recently received a number of valuable contracts.
In central London the group won planning approval for Basinghall House, for
Wates City of London Properties, and Wellington House, for Trafalgar House.
Hoggett Lock-Necrews, the subsidiary, was busy with food retailing
superstores and a food distribution centre near the Severn Bridge.
The group's Welsh and international operations secured new business but
margins were under pressure.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Counteracting a parent's tarnished image -
Maggie Urry describes how Westminster Health Care is preparing for its
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER Health Care, a leading nursing home operator, had always traded
fairly autonomously from its US parent, National Medical Enterprises. So
when it was working on a flotation in the autumn, it was shocked to discover
that litigation in which NME was embroiled would overwhelm the process.
After many transatlantic phone calls and flights, the flotation process was
postponed until next spring, when the UK management hopes that NME will have
more time to spend on the offer, expected to value WHC at more than Pounds
100m.
NME's difficulties - which led to its own share price diving - stemmed from
two separate, but related, legal contests.
In September 1991, the state of Texas sued NME, alleging that its
psychiatric hospitals in the state were admitting patients unnecessarily. By
June this year NME had come to a settlement with Texas, without admitting
wrongdoing. WHC thought the issue would fade away.
Then in July NME sued three insurance companies saying that bills for
psychiatric care had not been fully paid by the patients' insurers. Within
days, the three companies and another five, had responded with a lawsuit
alleging over-charging. This litigation continues.
These cases not only distracted NME's management, but also cast a cloud over
the WHC flotation. Could investors be asked to put money into a company
which, however distantly, was connected with allegations of fraud? Was there
the chance that WHC would one day be faced with costly litigation in the UK?
In its 1992 accounts NME took a Dollars 218m (Pounds 145m) pre-tax charge to
cover the cost of reorganising its psychiatric division and a Dollars 24m
after-tax charge for the Texas settlement and legal costs.
Mr Pat Carter, managing director of WHC, argues that the UK end has always
been run distinctly from its US parent. It does not operate psychiatric
hospitals or treat acute psychiatric patients.
To ensure standards of quality are maintained, a drive to gain BS 5750
approval for the homes has started. Mr Carter says that staff bonuses are
only paid if both financial and quality targets are met.
Ultimately, he says, people will not come into the group's homes unless they
are convinced of the quality of care. A bad reputation would quickly spread
since the homes are generally sited within communities. Staff live locally,
relatives visit, and each home has a resident's council where complaints can
be aired without fear of reprisals from staff. Spot checks are also made.
But for the shadow cast by NME's problems, WHC would have had been able to
tell a story any public relations executive would be proud to peddle. It
would have started with Mr Carter arriving early one day for an appointment
with a lawyer, thumbing through a copy of Business Week while he waited, and
spotting an article about nursing homes.
Mr Carter, who had spent 10 years working for MAI, the financial services
and advertising group, instantly realised nursing homes offered a business
opportunity. He bought one which confirmed his view, and decided to expand
to a chain of homes.
While travelling in the US he found himself in Seattle and on the off chance
rang a local nursing home operator and arranged to meet for a chat. That
conversation led to NME giving financial backing to Mr Carter's plan to
build a UK chain.
NME owns 90 per cent of WHC's shares, the rest held by Mr Carter and a
colleague, but it owns smaller proportions in its other non-US operations.
However, the decision to float WHC was not motivated by a need by NME to
raise cash. Although its stake will be cut below 50 per cent, the shares
sold will be new, with the money going to repay WHC's debt of about Pounds
60m, and to fund further expansion.
WHC's business has grown rapidly in the seven years since it was started,
and the prospect is of continued rising demand for homes for elderly people
who need round-the-clock nursing care.
It now owns or operates 36 homes, of which 14 were opened during the
financial year to end May 1992. Pre-tax profits have risen from Pounds
66,000 in 1988 to Pounds 1.7m in 1992. However, interest charges in the
latest year were high at Pounds 3.6m, showing WHC's need for an equity
injection to continue expansion.
After the flotation, WHC believes it would have reached a size where it
would be able to fund continued expansion largely from internal resources
rather than needing further equity. Smaller nursing home operators have
needed to call on shareholders repeatedly for capital to grow.
WHC's formula of running purpose built homes, mainly offering single rooms
with en-suite bathrooms, gives it an edge over some older homes where people
often sleep three or more to a room.
Standards required of nursing homes are rising, and many older ones are
expected to close. Further, as the population ages, and people live longer,
demand for nursing homes is increasing.
The government's aim is for more elderly people to be looked after at home,
a plan enshrined in the National Health Service and Community Care Act which
comes into force in April.
But, Mr Carter says that the cost of providing constant nursing care in
somebody's own home is higher than in a nursing home and 'the higher
dependency end of the market will continue to expand'. WHC means to grow
with it.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tough times ahead for the fund raisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES are expected to face some of their toughest challenges of the
recession in 1993 as they seek to finance recovery, according to Robert
Fleming, the merchant bank.
In its review of 1992, published yesterday, Flemings Corporate Finance
warned that the government's need to fund its growing deficit would absorb
an increasing proportion of institutional funds.
'Until this changes,' the report states, 'institutional cash flow will
remain under pressure, companies will be strapped for cash and banks
reluctant to lend.'
Seekers of equity finance raised just Pounds 4bn in 1992, less than 40 per
cent of the record level in 1991. However, Flemings expected 'substantial
cash raisings' in 1993 as stronger companies sought development finance.
'Recent issues provide grounds for optimism that the market may be willing
to provide funding for acquisition and development, although it is equally
clear that such capital is less easily available,' the report states.
The scarcity of equity finance, combined with lower interest rates, might
well promote an increased interest in debt financing, according to Ms Liz
Holt of Flemings Corporate Finance. The decline in interest rates had
already made debt much more competitive in comparison with the costs of
servicing equity - ie, the amount paid in dividends. Again, however,
companies would have to compete for scarcer loan funds as banks are
increasingly reluctant to lend.
Flemings said the most vulnerable would be smaller companies. 'Smaller
companies continue to find life disproportionately more difficult than their
larger counterparts.'
Sectors that have fallen out of favour, such as heavy capital goods, will
emerge from the recession hungry for funding. However, the markets may be
unwilling or unable to meet their needs.
Responding to the report's findings, Mr Robert Cooper, chief executive of
Flemings Corporate Finance, suggested that a more creative approach to
equity finance could ease the financing burden. Flemings was architect of
the Pounds 2.16bn sale of 270m Wellcome shares last summer, which was
achieved by a book-building method unusual in the UK.
Mr Cooper urged the Stock Exchange to promote the liberalisation of domestic
capital markets, thus making 'more unusual forms of equity raising available
to a broader spread of companies'.
The report also suggested that merger and acquisition activity continued to
decline because of the increasing focus on better utilisation of existing
resources rather than diversification.
Over the last 12 months, the report found that corporate profitability had
continued to decline, activity was low and industrial confidence further
eroded. Cash generation, however, had begun to improve.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Billiton seeks buyer for TDF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BILLITON, the metals and mining subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell group,
hopes to find a buyer for TDF Tiofine, its loss-making Netherlands-based
producer of titanium dioxide pigment, within the next few months.
Mr Heinz Klaar, general manager at TDF Tiofine, said several international
companies had expressed an interest in buying the company, but he declined
to name them or to give the probable purchase price.
He said the process of finding a buyer would not be affected by TDF
Tiofine's filing for a moratorium on payments to creditors on December 24.
Billiton wants to sell TDF Tiofine as a going concern to a larger producer
of titanium dioxide in order to provide it with a secure future.
The Dutch titanium dioxide company, which opened a new production plant in
the Botlek area of the port of Rotterdam less than three years ago, has
annual capacity of 45,000 tonnes, making it a relatively small producer with
annual turnover of about Fl 100m (Pounds 36.5m).
TDF Tiofine has incurred cumulative losses of more than Fl 100m since
opening its new plant, which required a total investment of between Fl 300m
and Fl 350m. The losses were attributed to the weakness of the dollar,
overcapacity in the market and initial difficulties in getting the Rotterdam
site on stream, Mr Klaar said.
Billiton, which is itself loss-making, is seeking to divest the company in
line with its new strategy of emphasising upstream rather than downstream
operations.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Leslie Wise founder dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LESLIE WISE, executive chairman and founder of the eponymous textile and
women's wear group, has died.
Mr Wise, who was in his 70s, died on December 26. It is likely that a
non-executive chairman will be appointed in his stead.
For the past 10 years the Leicester-based group has, in effect, been run by
Mr Wise's son, Neil, who is chief executive, and Mr John Gowers, managing
direc-tor.
The Leslie Wise Group, which came to the stock market in 1958 as Rudkin &amp;
Laundon, supplies women's wear to retailers such as Burton and Etam as well
as merchanting textiles.
In July, it announced a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.51m on turnover 25 per cent ahead to Pounds 22.8m.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Vauxhall profits strongly ahead despite recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is understood to
have increased its pre-tax profits by more than 40 per cent this year to
around Pounds 190m, helped by record output from its two UK assembly plants.
The higher profits, achieved in spite of recession in the UK, contrast with
the financial performance of Ford of Britain, the UK market leader, which
has fallen into loss in the second half.
Vauxhall said yesterday it had:
increased production of cars and light vans at its two assembly plants at
Luton, Bedfordshire, and at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, by 15.3 per cent this
year to 302,047; increased its UK new car registrations by 7 per cent to
around 266,000 in a market which it expected to have declined marginally to
1.587m from 1.592m; increased its share of the UK new car market to a record
16.8 per cent from 15.6 per cent; and
raised productivity by 8 per cent with a fall in its workforce to 10,871
from 11,248 in spite of opening an engine plant at Ellesmere Port.
Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman, warned that '1993 would bring the
industry its greatest challenge to date'. He forecast increasing competition
in the UK market, which was 'unlikely to show any real evidence of an upturn
until the middle of the year'. At the same time new car demand was expected
to weaken in continental European markets, which would hit UK exports.
Vauxhall has said its Luton plant will work a four-day week in January to
cut output.
The company has cushioned the impact of recession by boosting exports of
Opel-badged vehicles for sale by GM in its continental European markets.
Vauxhall's exports, which accounted for 37 per cent of its UK vehicle output
this year, rose by 7.1 per cent in 1992 to 111,796.
Vauxhall's market share in the UK peaked previously at 16.6 per cent in
1985, while its vehicle output reached its previous peak in 1990 at 276,031.
Renault, the state-controlled French motor company, suffered a sharp
deterioration in the final quarter, said Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. He said Renault, which forecast profits of
FFr6bn (Pounds 720m) for 1992, made pre-tax profits of FFr7.5bn in the first
three quarters.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Glaxo wins US approval for migraine drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, the UK's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday secured approval
in the US for the sale of what will be one of its biggest selling drugs of
the 1990s, sumatriptan, a migraine treatment.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which controls drugs sold in the US,
approved the injectable version. The tablets are likely to be approved late
in 1993.
Approval came more quickly than some observers had feared: the drug does not
treat a life threatening condition and so was thought to be low on the FDA's
list of priorities.
Approval helped Glaxo shares rise 27p to 774p. Trading was heavy in London
and New York, where the shares are also quoted.
Sumatriptan should be available on prescription in the US by late March
under the name Imitrex, Glaxo said. Its brand name in most other markets is
Imigran.
Some 33 countries have already approved the drug, in spite of criticism,
especially in France, of its price. Glaxo can charge a high price - about
Pounds 40 for two doses - because sumatriptan is much more effective than
rival treatments for most patients.
In Glaxo's last financial year, to June 1992, sales of sumatriptan reached
Pounds 43m. Analysts believe sales for the current year will more than
double.
Within five years, the drug could be a 'blockbuster', usually defined in the
industry as having sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year.
About half should be in the US.
US approval is important for Glaxo, the world's second largest drug company,
because its best-selling ulcer treatment, Zantac, is losing market share to
a new rival, Losec, made by Swedish company Astra.
However, sumatriptan is unlikely to replace Zantac as the company's main
source of profit. Zantac sales are still growing, while sumatriptan is only
one, albeit the most important, of a new generation of Glaxo drugs. The
others are Serevent, an asthma treatment, Zofran, which reduces nausea in
chemotherapy patients, and Flixonase, an anti-inflammatory designed to help
people with allergies.
Between them, these four could account for 25 per cent of Glaxo's sales
within five years, said Mr Jonathan Gelles, an analyst with New York
stockbroker, Wertheim Schroder.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Frankness makes gloomy read: The warnings in the leasing
company's prospectus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extent of the difficulties facing GPA Group in securing a satisfactory
agreement with its banks and aircraft manufacturers was spelt out in a
prospectus issued in the US shortly before Christmas.
Harris Investment Management, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based Harris
banking group which bought Dollars 45m (Pounds 29.6m) of GPA notes in a
private debt placement in June, recently exercised its right to enable the
notes to be traded publicly. This forced GPA to file a prospectus with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, by the end of the
year.
The prospectus, which was filed on December 11, shows that the group's core
business of leasing has suffered since the group was forced to abandon its
Dollars 800m flotation in June.
For the three months to June 30, 1992 - the latest publicly available
figures - profits from aircraft leasing fell 54 per cent, from Dollars 24m
in the same quarter the previous year to Dollars 11m. Since then GPA says it
has suffered a 'general deterioration in the credit quality' of its leases.
The prospectus goes on to warn that the current difficult environment in the
civil aviation industry has resulted in the group having a higher proportion
of non-revenue earning aircraft.
At the end of November the group had 36 unleased aircraft and owned four
McDonnell Douglas DC8-71 aircraft which were unavailable for lease, out of a
total of 409 aircraft on its books. GPA was also recently forced to
repossess 13 Boeing 737s from Vasp, the Brazilian airline, although some of
these have already been released.
To help lessees in financial difficulty, GPA has rescheduled some lease
rentals for periods of four to 24 months. At the beginning of the month four
lessees were being allowed deferrals of rent, maintenance and miscellaneous
payments totalling Dollars 32m.
The group's share of providing debtor-in-possession financing loans to
America West Airlines, a customer of GPA which filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, is around Dollars 70m.
According to the prospectus, 14.9 per cent of the group's 409-plus aircraft
were not earning revenue.
GPA's advisers yesterday pointed out that the prospectus contains 'the most
pessimistic and gloomy' portrayal of the company and parts of it were
already out of date.
As of last Friday the company said only 34 aircraft were not earning
revenue. It is confident it will find new leases for most of the aircraft
still not not earning revenue.
The group admits that it will make a loss for the half-year to the end of
September and for the year ending March 1993. But it blames this loss
primarily on the cost of cancelling its flotation, estimated at around
Dollars 23m in legal fees, and the cost of the refinancing plan aimed at
deferring up to Dollars 1bn of debt payments, expected to be more than
Dollars 20m.
Nonetheless, the information contained in the prospectus is likely to cause
some concern to shareholders and lenders.
Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at M. J. Whitman, the Wall Street firm
specialising in bank debt trading, believes that the prospectus highlights
the areas of concern for the core lenders. 'Given the problems facing its
core business (leasing) the banks must be concerned with the company's
ability to maintain the value of the collateral in a depressed aircraft
market,' he said.
GPA's financial advisers do not pretend that it is easy to conduct talks
about its future with its creditors amid a deterioration in the airline and
aircraft industry.
However, they remain confident that final agreements on deferring billions
of dollars of aircraft will be announced shortly.
The prospectus warns that its talks with aircraft manufacturers are
conditional upon GPA reaching agreement with its bankers regarding the
restructuring of its borrowings and upon agreements with shareholders
regarding new equity financing.
It adds: 'There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied
or that the agreements will not be modified as part of the ongoing
conditions.' Most of GPA's shareholders are still waiting for the talks with
bankers and aircraft manufacturers to conclude before considering whether to
take part in any future equity financing.
One of GPA's shareholders said he reluctantly concurred with the prospectus
that as things stand there is no assurance that the talks with bankers or
aircraft manufacturers will be successful.

FT  30 DEC 92 / GPA to cut firm aircraft orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP has reached agreement with aircraft manufacturers to reduce its
firm orders by more than Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn). The resulting penalties
may adversely affect its results in 1993 and later years, it says.
The information is contained in a prospectus the aircraft leasing company
filed in the US earlier this month.
By the beginning of the December GPA had agreed with its aircraft
manufacturers to reduce its Dollars 11.9bn of firm orders up to the year
2000 by Dollars 3.2bn, after taking into account aircraft purchased since
April.
A further Dollars 3.1bn of orders which are 'subject to cancellation' has
been agreed, which may allow the group to cancel most of its Dollars 4.8bn
worth of orders beyond 1994.
The prospectus says: 'The combination of the cancellation, deferral and
recharacterisation of orders is likely to result in penalties to GPA which
may materially affect results of operations for fiscal 1993 . . . and also
affect results of operations for later years.'
Aircraft manufacturers have agreed to provide short-term finance for the
purchase of aircraft and have already made some advances.
The penalties mentioned in the prospectus are likely to be the loss of some
of the Dollars 954m of pre-delivery payments made to aircraft manufacturers
by GPA at the end of March.
It is understood that Boeing and Airbus Industrie have proved more willing
to reach an accommodation with GPA than McDonnell Douglas.
GPA's negotiations with aircraft manufacturers, which are expected to be
concluded by January 17, depend on a successful outcome of the group's talks
with its lenders. The group is seeking to defer up to Dollars 1bn of debt
and to change its bank covenants by the end of next month.
The banks have agreed to waive potential breach of covenants until the end
of January. However, during the term of the temporary waiver, the group is
prevented from increasing the amount drawn on the facilities.
According to the prospectus, further temporary waivers may be necessary
before agreements are reached with the bank lenders.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Merger of Matra and Hachette gets go-ahead

<TEXT>
MR JEAN-LUC Lagardere, the flamboyant French businessman, yesterday secured
shareholders' approval for the merger between Matra, the electronics
concern, and the Hachette media group. He promised a 'very significant
improvement' in their 1993 combined profits.
Last spring's announcement of plans to merge Matra and Hachette, both
chaired by Mr Lagardere and controlled by his family interests, was
criticised by the French financial community because of the apparent
incompatibility of the companies and Hachette's financial problems.
However, Mr Lagardere has maintained that there will be significant
financial benefits in combining the two groups.
His proposals were accepted overwhelmingly at yesterday's meetings of Matra
and Hachette shareholders.
One effect will be to dilute the 8.43 per cent stake in Hachette held by
Montana Management, a Swiss-based Panamanian company allegedly linked to
Iraqi interests, to 1.8 per cent.
Matra-Hachette, the new company, will form one of France's larger private
sector concerns with nine operating subsidiaries. Mr Lagardere confirmed
that the group should meet its 1992 profit forecast of FFr350m (Pounds 43m)
to FFr400m on sales of FFr53bn. He said Matra's shareholders should receive
the same net dividend for 1992 as the FFr5.50 paid in 1991.
However, he promised substantial profits growth for Matra-Hachette in 1993.
One of the chief catalysts will be the rise in Matra's defence orders from
FFr11bn in 1991 to FFr20bn in 1992.

FT  30 DEC 92 / UK seeks opt-out from employment rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is to seek an opt-out from the requirements of a European directive
which has caused uncertainty about public services contracted out to the
private sector.
The directive can prevent companies cutting pay and conditions of staff they
take on after mergers and acquisitions. When an 'undertaking' is
'transferred', staff who transfer may retain their existing pay and
conditions, except for pensions.
Companies and government officials are unsure whether the directive applies
to compulsory competitive tendering and so-called 'market-testing' in local
and central government. Contractors and employers' organisations have called
for clarification. Conflicting legal opinions have been given in the absence
of a firm ruling.
The government, which is extending contracting out to Whitehall services,
has dismissed the debate over the regulations as a 'red herring' which will
have, at worst, a limited effect.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, will seek an opt-out from the
directive under the year-long subsidiarity review of the proper
responsibilities of national and European authorities agreed at the
Edinburgh summit. The government has consistently rejected an extension of
EC influence over employment matters.
The employment department said: 'Mr Forsyth will seek to have the directive
withdrawn on the grounds of subsidiarity.'
But it is not clear that an opt-out would be possible; an annex to the
Edinburgh agreement gives conflicting signals on the Commission's view on
the application of subsidiarity to social policy. Some legislation is
excluded from the review.
The Trades Union Congress said the government was unlikely to win another
opt-out. A TUC official said: 'The government can scarcely take comfort in
the Edinburgh summit which agreed to supplement European social legislation
with additional measures and to implement all the provisions of the social
chapter. It also limited UK demands that 71 European measures be withdrawn
to 21.'

FT  30 DEC 92 / Collor quits but senate votes to continue impeachment
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRAZILIAN senate pressed ahead last night with the impeachment of Mr
Fernando Collor de Mello over corruption charges, despite the president's
resignation in an attempt to halt the decisive session of his trial.
The vote to continue the impeachment process, by 73 to 8, brought to a
climax the battle over the political career of Mr Collor, who had been
suspended from office since September when Congress approved the impeachment
charges.
Final impeachment of Mr Collor, which would require a two-thirds majority of
senators and which looked likely last night, would lead to his being banned
from public office for eight years.
By resigning, Mr Collor loses his presidential immunity. He could face
criminal charges.
A spokesman for Mr Collor said 'the president had resigned because the whole
country knew that the sentence was already delivered'. The senate decision
to proceed with impeachment came despite a request from Mr Collor's lawyer
for the hearing to be halted, given that the president had resigned.
Mr Itamar Franco, who had been acting president and who was sworn in
yesterday as Mr Collor's successor, is expected to address the nation this
morning. Last night, at the presidential palace, he described the new
economic order in Brazil as 'unjust' and said it had to be changed.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the foreign minister, said: 'This will now
allow us to get on with governing the country.'
After a volatile session the Sao Paulo stock market closed down 1.2 per
cent.
The parliamentary drama began when the Supreme Court chief justice called on
Mr Collor's attorney, Mr Jose Moura Rocha, to begin questioning his first
witness. The lawyer said he had spoken to Mr Collor and that the president
would resign.
He then passed a note in Mr Collor's hand to senate president Mauro
Benevides which said: 'I am resigning my mandate as president of the
republic, a position to which I was elected in the elections of November 15
and December 17 1989.'
Mr Franco, 62, read the oath of office before a roaring gallery of
supporters singing the national anthem and chanting: 'The people united will
never be defeated.' People in the galleries tossed T-shirts emblazoned with
'Collorbuster' to the Chamber of Deputies and teenage activists cheered the
inauguration.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European central bankers may be feeling secretly grateful for the revival of
tensions in the Middle East. That is one of the main reasons for the
dollar's two-pfennig rise since the Christmas break. In theory yesterday's
positive US data on consumer confidence and home sales should support the
trend. They suggest the US economy is indeed on a recovery path - in stark
contrast to that of Germany. Were the dollar to remain strong, a fresh
crisis in the ERM might just be deferred until the Bundesbank is ready to
start cutting interest rates.
It would be rash, though, to claim victory too soon. The dollar's rise has
come in a thin market. It may not have the strength for a further advance
once trading volumes return to normal in the new year. Besides, the real
doubt about the ERM concerns the degree to which participants are prepared
to allow Germany to lead them into recession.
The foreign exchange market may have placed too much weight on the seemingly
encouraging weekend remarks on interest rates from the Bundesbank's Mr
Helmut Schlesinger. The bank is unlikely to move before it can gauge the
inflationary effect of next month's VAT rise, not to mention the outcome of
current wage negotiations and the new year trend of the money supply. It may
be February before it can even consider lower interest rates.
That realisation alone could reverse the dollar's gain and put fresh strain
on the ERM. The longer the Bundesbank delays, the more pressing the need for
lower rates elsewhere and the deeper it would eventually have to cut to calm
the system down. The clear misalignment of the Irish punt still provides a
weak link for speculators to have a go at the system as a whole.

FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Banco Santander
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Madrid seems to have been overcome with nerves in marking Banco Santander
down by more than 8 per cent this week. The bank has been obliged to post a
Pta8bn bond against possible fines and tax charges on transactions going
back to the late 1980s, but the amount is little more than 10 per cent of
last year's net income. Santander could meet the sum out of general reserves
without any serious effect on its remarkably strong tier 1 capital ratio of
9.4 per cent.
It may take some time to establish definitively whether withholding tax
should have been paid on credits assigned by the bank to third parties.
Assignment was once a widespread practice among Spanish banks. By taking
loans off the balance sheet, they were not only spared expensive reserve
requirements; their capital also went further. The Bank of Spain clamped
down in 1989, though, so Santander has not been dependent on this lucrative
practice for its recent profits.
The greater worry is that Santander has been singled out for political
reasons. Its aggressive growth ambitions have aroused the jealousy of its
peers. The case is an embarrassment which may cause the pace of innovation -
it is now trying to introduce securitised mortgages - to slow. The share
price may be vulnerable while the affair drags on. In the longer term that
may prove to be a buying opportunity.

FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arguments about the market power of British Gas rumble on as the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission investigation proceeds. But it is far from clear
which structure for the industry will best promote efficiency and
competition.
If British Gas were split into separate trading and pipeline operations as
the regulator wants, the pipeline company would own the vast majority of the
assets. Its fortunes would be dictated by the effective rate of return it
was allowed to earn on the pipes. The marketing company or companies would
be much flimsier entities, yet these would be expected to enter into
long-term contracts for large amounts of gas with producers. Their low
capital would not allow much margin for error in fixing their purchasing
requirements. If the rate of return were held down on the pipes to allow
high marketing margins and encourage new entrants, pipeline shareholders
would suffer. But if the pipes earned a commercial return that might not
leave enough margin for marketing companies unless gas prices rise.
By contrast the price cap structure with British Gas at least offers some
economies of scale and competitors are at last taking a significant
proportion of the business market, while gas prices are falling. Yet
whichever way the MMC leans, British Gas shareholders are reasonably well
underpinned by a combination of net asset value and 7 per cent yield, which
are not seriously under threat. As deposit rates fall, British Gas shares
may look an alluring alternative to gilts.

FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Bargain hunting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One day of traffic jams as bargain hunters head for the sales may not make a
retailing summer, but there is at least the hint of spring in the air for UK
stores. Consumer confidence may be starting to revive now that the shambles
of sterling's exit from the ERM is a fading memory. Spending will also rise
a little in 1993 once the effect of lower mortgage rates feeds through. And
as retailers currently hold small stocks, the uptick may feed back down the
chain if the January sales go well.
Yet it would be wrong to get carried away by the enthusiasm. With house
prices still weak and wage settlements low, consumers will not feel much
richer next year. The high savings rate indicates that individuals are still
reluctant to borrow, so any modest increase in consumer spending is unlikely
to exceed the rise in disposable incomes. Even suggestions of a rise in
housing turnover will take quite some time to translate into sales of
carpets and curtains.
In any event, retailing shares have already discounted a recovery. Given the
sector's rating, stores will need more good news to push much higher. The
defensive qualities which supported the likes of Marks and Spencer and Boots
through the recession will also limit their progress into the upturn. There
are some recovery prospects, particularly among groups whose young adult
customers were hit by high interest rates, but only those with strong
management and a well-focused business are likely to benefit.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Boardroom bestsellers: FT writers give their verdict on the
year's best business books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a disappointing year for business books. There were few
interesting titles and even fewer books which did their subject justice.
Here is a subjective selection of business publications which FT
correspondents have read and enjoyed. They are often concerned with
analysing and learning from the managerial and financial failures of the
1980s. For several of the books, any drift towards the intellectually
lightweight tends to be offset by sheer physical bulk.
The best financial book of the year was Money of the Mind - Borrowing and
Lending in America from the Civil War to Michael Milken (Farrar Straus
Giroux, Dollars 27.50) by James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate
Observer. Although there is nothing new about debt-financed bubbles, Grant
argues that the rapid economic expansion in the US in the 1980s, financed
largely by borrowing, was unique.
Two important trends converged in the period: the democratisation of lending
and the socialisation of risk. Increasing numbers of people were able to
borrow, and more and more debt was federally subsidised. The result was
that, all around the world, the marginal borrower found it much easier to
raise finance. The consequences have been devastating for the international
economy, and the story is told in gripping detail.
No one has found the consequences more destabilising than the international
property industry and its bankers. In Bricks and Mortals (Century Business,
Pounds 25), Alastair Ross Goobey takes the reader on a tour of the property
industry's booms and busts of the past 20 years.
It is a compelling story, not least for its abundance of idiosyncratic and
audacious personalities, whose failings are held largely responsible for the
industry's current slump.
Ross Goobey's account, though occasionally turgid, is accurate and thorough.
His book, published in the summer, skates too quickly over the recent
profusion of corporate collapses, but it is worth reading for its insight
into the ambitious developments and deal-making of the second half of the
1980s.
The recent spate of corporate failures that has resulted from the collapse
in asset prices has left many shareholders concerned about the standards of
information they receive from companies in which they have invested.
Little wonder that Accounting for Growth (Century Business, Pounds 12.99),
Terry Smith's useful, if incomplete, book on the potentially dry subject of
accountancy, has attained great heights of publicity and sales: more than
60,000 copies to date.
For the more seedy side of the late 1980s boom, try BCCI: the Inside Story
of the World's Most Corrupt Financial Empire (Bloomsbury, Pounds 20).
Written by Peter Truell and Larry Gurwin, it is the third and most
comprehensive of the books on the bank since its collapse in 1990. It
outlines in detail the Middle Eastern and US political connections to BCCI
that made it far more than a bank and helps explain how it managed for so
long to escape the scrutiny of financial regulators.
A very different escape was staged by Nigel Lawson, the chancellor during
the 'boom' part of Britain's latest and longest boom-bust cycle, who managed
to jump ship with the rocks in sight. His memoirs, The View from No 11:
Memoirs of a Tory Radical (Bantam Press, Pounds 20), provide a compelling
and lucid explanation of events and personalities of the Thatcher era.
The book does not pull its punches in its analysis of why the main
protagonists parted company. In the process, it touches upon many economic
issues that are still very much alive. But it contains much more - a wealth
of material on City issues ranging from tackling fraud to bank behaviour and
Lawson's own successful struggle with the BP underwriters after the 1987
Wall Street crash.
Readers deterred by the book's 1,000-plus pages could heed the author's own
suggestion in the foreword, and treat the contents as an a la carte meal.
But at least there is only one volume.
The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance (The Macmillan Press,
Pounds 350) runs to three volumes, more than 2,500 pages and checks in at
14lb on the bathroom scales, making it the heavyweight business publication
of the year. It is not an impulse buy.
Built around more than 1,000 sizeable essays written by more than 800
authorities from around the world, it is a rich mine of information. It is
readily accessed through a system of cross references which, if you have
time on your hands, can send you off on lengthy and diverting by-ways
through the text.
Another weighty tome, physically at least, is Liberation Management:
Necessary Disorganisation for the Nanosecond Nineties (Macmillan, Pounds 20;
Knopf, Dollars 27.50) by Tom Peters, the millionaire American business
evangelist.
Do not be put off by its length - 834 pages - or Peters' penchant for wacky
American slogans, such as 'marketising', 'fashionisation' and 'Glow] Tingle]
Wow]' This is, in fact, the best management book of the year.
Peters' enthusiasm for fast, flexible and customer-responsive companies
lightens this packed guide to almost every advanced management practice
under the sun: from delayering, delegation and empowerment to outsourcing,
vertical disintegration and 'networks'.
David Osborne and Ted Gaebler have produced a book of Peters-style
prescriptions for the public sector. In Reinventing Government: How the
Entrepreneurial Spirit is Transforming the Public Sector (Addison-Wesley,
Pounds 19.95/Dollars 22.95), the authors argue that government must be more
'entrepreneurial' or businesslike if it is to overcome decades of
accumulated bureaucratic inertia and financial waste. Their solutions
include privatisation, decentralising responsibility to encourage
innovation, and greater flexibility among civil servants.
Improbably for such a dry subject, the book spent eight weeks on the New
York Times non-fiction bestseller list and has been through several reprints
since publication in February.
Fans include Mr William Waldegrave, the cabinet minister in charge of
reforming the UK's public sector, and President-elect Bill Clinton.
Finally, some in-flight reading for the weary executive. While the New
Palgrave Dictionary may be a little heavy for hand-luggage, a much more
manageable alternative is Dave Barry Does Japan (Random House, Dollars 18),
the story of US comedian Dave Barry's incursion into the inner sanctum of
Japanese industry, the Keidanren.
Dave Barry may be the funniest man writing in America today. His humour has
a deliciously outlandish quality. He works out that, when a Japanese
businessman tells a visiting foreigner 'we will study your proposal', he
really means 'we will feed your proposal to a goat' - one useful tip that no
management handbook or financial dictionary could reveal.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Wrong impression of elections in Kenya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M NGALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Flawed Kenya poll is set to resolve little' (December 22)
gives the wrong impression of the Kenya general elections.
The Kenyan general elections, due to begin yesterday, were set to enable the
Kenyan electorate to pick leaders of their choice and not to bar a
particular party or individual leader. That is what democracy is all about
and, if President Moi and Kanu win, it cannot be largely by default. Surely
if a party picks uncommitted candidates who subsequently defect it cannot be
the fault of the winning party.
It is known that the opposition political parties, because they were
established only recently, have failed to find and field suitable candidates
in all the constituencies in the country, thus leaving the long-established
ruling party with candidates coming in unopposed. This cannot be seriously
blamed on the ruling party.
It seems to me that what is expected of the ruling party by the authors of
the article is that Kanu should disqualify itself or make it easier for the
opposition to win. This would create neither a level playing field for all
nor democracy.
It is incorrect to suggest that all members of the Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya
communities were disillusioned with Kanu and that only weighting in favour
of the ruling party will result in its victory. On the contrary, Kanu still
has a fair amount of support from the three communities.
As to the murder of Dr Robert Ouko, there is an ongoing High Court case
which makes the matter sub judice. It is not known whether the killer was
from within or without. It therefore seems to me that the bitterness
referred to is misplaced.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Report must look at adequacy as well as safety of
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SMALLBONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As your leader, 'Safer pensions' (December 16), so rightly says, it will not
be enough if Prof Goode's report confines itself to narrow questions of
safety. The urgent need is that private-sector pensions should fulfil the
government actuary's precept - '. . .the fundamental objective. . .is to
provide a satisfactory income in. . .retirement'.
The key word is satisfactory. It is not sufficient that pensions funds
should merely be secure against fraud. An income may be secure but at the
same time hopelessly inadequate. As the Occupational Pensions Board report
(Cmnd 8649, note 1, Chapter 9) of 1982 pointed out, the average level of
pension provision is appalling, notwithstanding the case sums invested and
the huge tax privileges funds are accorded.
As presently constructed, defined benefit schemes allow shiploads of money
involving true funding rates of 100 per cent and more of nominal salary, to
be tipped into the pockets of those who lest need such massive subsidies. at
the same time, because true funding rates are ruthlessly age progressive,
the UK's notorious 'too old at 50' employment syndrome is encouraged.
There are far better ways of achieving the fundamental objective (notably
fully-indexed revalued average schemes).

FT  30 DEC 92 / Slowly rebuilding reform from the ruins: India faces the
task of restoring business confidence at home and abroad after the Ayodhya
temple sacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Ismail, a furniture maker whose business was destroyed in the
recent riots in India, stares at the blackened remains of his workshop and
says: 'Only God knows what we can do now.' Mr Ismail's livelihood went up in
smoke when rioters set fire to a timber market in Seelampur, a poor suburb
of New Delhi, inhabited mainly by Moslems.
The commercial life of the district is slowly limping back to normal. In the
narrow alleyways surrounding the timber yard, men are hard at work at sewing
machines, lathes, and welding irons. 'We lost two weeks' work through the
violence and through police curfews,' says Mr Bashir Rahmad, who sews
button-holes into jeans for export, 'but now things are all right.'
India will be relying on men like Mr Rahmad in the next few months, if the
country's economy is to recover from the damage done after the sacking of
the mosque in Ayodhya.
Not only will the physical destruction have to be repaired, but so will the
harm done to the confidence of businessmen - including foreigners, whom
India expects to play a critical role in the government's economic
modernisation programme. Mr Ashok Desai, the government's top economic
adviser, says: 'Ayodhya is a setback.'
The crisis has come at a tough time, with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, under public pressure to demonstrate the benefits of the
liberalisation policy launched in mid-1991. So far, businessmen have
responded hesistantly to the government's initiatives. Ayodhya will make
them even more cautious. They are pleased the violence has been stopped; now
they want to see that political in-fighting does not distract Mr Rao from
economic reform. As Mr Tarun Dass, director-general of the Confederation of
Indian Industry (CII), says: 'The government has already lost four weeks.
Let's hope it doesn't lose any more time.'
The estimate of production lost through disruption amounts to about Rs90bn
(Dollars 3.2bn) or the equivalent of about 1 per cent of national output.
Even if some companies recapture lost orders, others will not, particular in
time-sensitive industries such as fashion textiles for export. The Indian
Export Organisation, a trade promotion group, says some export shipments
will have to be carried by air to meet customers' demands - at a loss to the
producer. 'It will take weeks or months for the situation to normalise,'
says Mr Freddie Mehta, a director of Tata group, India's largest industrial
conglomerate.
Fortunately, good rains have boosted farm output this year, so the
government should exceed its 3.5 per cent real economic growth target for
the year to the end of March 1993. However, industry, the main focus of
economic reform, is doing worse than anticipated - the CII expects to see
industrial growth of just 3 per cent, compared with an official target of 5
per cent. A curb in government spending, a crucial element in the
liberalisation programme, has hit demand for steel and engineering goods,
while private sector demand has failed to fill the gap. Exports are growing
steadily, as the government had intended, but domestic consumption is
sluggish.
With shoppers holding back, businessmen have been reluctant to commit
themselves. Some are scared of the prospect of foreign competition. 'They're
trembling at the thought,' says Mr Deepak Mukarji, communications manager at
Dupont, the US chemicals group. Other companies are busy seeking tie-ups
with foreign companies for manufacturing foreign-designed goods in India.
Foreign companies have pledged to invest some Dollars 1.4bn since mid-1991.
However, less than 25 per cent of this total is expected to come to fruition
in 1992-93. A few foreign companies, mainly American, are pressing ahead
with sizable projects, among them General Electric, which has established
joint venture factories in plastics and medical equipment and is planning
others in refrigerators and lighting. But other groups see little need to
rush into India. Royal Dutch/Shell, the oil giant, this month pulled out of
a planned Dollars 2bn petrochemicals complex after arguments with its Indian
partner.
Ayodhya will give further pause for thought to foreign executives who are at
an early stage of planning Indian ventures. Some economists in Delhi like to
compare India with China, and argue that the crisis will not derail economic
modernisation, just as the shooting of students in Tiananmen Square in 1989
barely affected China's reforms.
However, even in 1989, reform was more deeply entrenched in China than in
India today. Foreign investors were convinced that the rewards outweighed
the potential risks. As a senior official of AT&amp;T, the American
telecommunications group, says: 'China had reached critical mass. India has
not.'
Also, China is an authoritarian dictatorship. Its leaders were able to
suppress post-Tiananmen protests without fear of being overthrown. India is
a democracy in which consensus is important. Mr Rao was able to carry out
economic reform quite rapidly in the year to mid-1992 because there was
little criticism from the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the main opposition
party.
But, even before Ayodhya, the consensus was coming under strain. The pace of
reform appeared to slow amid protests from farmers about the impact of cuts
in fertiliser price subsidies and from trade unionists about proposed
redundancy laws. The Bombay securities market scandal delayed planned
financial liberalisation. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank warned Mr Rao against foot-dragging on reform. The prime minister told
them to wait until February, when the 1993 Budget would bring a bagful of
important measures.
Even though Mr Rao remains committed to deregulation, as does Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, their supporters are distracted by the
arguments over Ayodhya. The crisis threatens to polarise politics between
supporters and opponents of the BJP, which sponsored the rally at which the
Ayodhya mosque was destroyed. Mr Rao is seeking to build an anti-BJP front,
which would include left-wing parties.
At the least, since the ruling Congress (I) party lacks an absolute
majority, Mr Rao will have to bargain with his allies to get economic
legislation through parliament. At worst, Congress could decide that a new
man is needed at the helm - perhaps someone more forceful than the
mild-mannered Mr Rao. Such an upheaval would unsettle even the most
positive-minded investors. As Mr Stephen Brandon, General Electric's manager
in India, says: 'Although Ayodhya has brought us short-term disruption and
delay it will not (of itself) have any long-term effect on our plans.
However, we would be disturbed to see any change of government bringing
uncertainty about policy.'

FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Planning for higher education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HOWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The timely article by Andrew Adonis ('Competing answers to university
challenge', December 21) raises the question of how future governments will
pay for higher education. One possible solution is to force students to pay
part of their fees according to some means tested formula. Whatever the
merits of this, it is fatally flawed when it comes to higher education
courses linked to training for posts in the public sector, in particular in
nursing and education.
The greater proportion of funding now available to institutions through fee
income rather than by grants to institutions has encouraged universities and
colleges to expand rapidly. In September, recruitment to courses for those
training as primary school teachers was some 50 per cent over target at
18,000. Many of those starting out to train as teachers will have little
realistic hope of securing a job as a teacher. Asking them to pay part of
their fees would only saddle them with a bigger debt on top of their
existing loans.
Unless sensible planning is introduced quickly the pool of unemployed
teachers will rise dramatically over the next few years. The announcement
that bursaries for teachers in the former shortage subjects will be reduced
from next September is a start if it helps to reduce demand for courses but
it will have no effect unless institutions try to match recruitment more
closely to demand for teachers.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Act swiftly on Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENZY of the new year holiday sales is as good a time as any to reflect
upon the illogicalities of the laws which govern shop opening hours in
Britain. Shortly before Christmas, the European Court of Justice ruled that
the UK's restrictions on Sunday trading were not invalid under the Treaty of
Rome. That leaves the thousands of stores which currently open on Sundays in
breach of the Shops Act 1950. It also allows zealous local authorities free
rein to seek injunctions stopping such stores from opening on Sundays. Now
that there is no doubt about the validity of the Shops Act, the reform of
this archaic, unworkable and unpopular law is a priority.
The government has promised to bring forward legislation to reform the
Sunday trading law early in the new year, but on a leisurely timetable. The
new legislation is unlikely to be in place much before 1994.
Following the defeat of a previous attempt to deregulate shopping hours in
1986, at the hands of a skilful alliance of sabbatarians and shopworkers'
unions, the government plans to offer parliament three choices:
Reform of the Shops Act to preserve the current restrictions while tidying
up some of the more bizarre anomalies.
Partial deregulation to allow small shops complete freedom to open on
Sundays while restricting the opening hours of larger stores.
Total deregulation - as has already happened in Scotland.
Obvious danger
This approach has the merit that a government with a small majority does not
stick its neck out too far, but it also courts an obvious danger, that none
of the three options will command majority support, so preserving the Shops
Act.
Anything less than full deregulation would be a mistake: partial measures
will inevitably throw up further anomalies like those which have cast the
Shops Act into disrepute. Currently the courts are required to fine shops
selling bibles on the sabbath while permitting the sale of pornography.
Complete deregulation is right because it allows individuals a choice
otherwise denied. For shop-owners, Sunday opening offers the opportunity to
make more efficient use of capital. They can also compete against other
attractions for the consumers' money - garden centres and DIY stores closed
on Sundays lose business to cinemas, restaurants and pubs.
Equally, many people who work Monday to Friday welcome the freedom to shop
on Sundays rather being forced to join the Saturday rush. This is why 16m
people have taken advantage of Sunday shopping since the law was thrown into
confusion. There is no reason why they should be denied this convenience, so
long as shopworkers who prefer not to work on Sundays are not compelled to
do so.
Coalition for change
The question for the government's business managers should be how best to
achieve the desirable objective of full deregulation.
One possibility might be to draw Labour into a coalition for change by
working at the legal protection available to prevent staff being forced to
work on Sundays or disadvantaged if they decline requests to do so. This is
not a simple matter, but there are precedents in employment protection law
to encourage the belief that the task is possible.
Another tactical gambit might be to provide local authorities with the power
to hold referendums on the issue of Sunday trading in their own areas. This
device has been used, successfully, to test opinion on pub licensing hours
and, it is easily forgotten south of the border, Scotland has already
liberalised Sunday trading with no perceivable ill consequences. Such
referendums could easily be held on the same day as council elections and
would have the added advantage of adding some genuine local issue excitement
to these contests. Those in favour of deregulation would have reason to be
confident of the outcome.
But, however the government assembles a majority, it must act fast: the
European Court of Justice ruling removes the last alibis for inaction.
Speedy deregulation of Sunday shopping hours should be one of the
government's new year resolutions.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Personal View: Time to open EC door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By UFFE ELLEMANN-JENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fifth Danish presidency of the European Community - and the third for
the present Danish government - begins on Friday. I am looking forward to
being in the chair again, because we are living in 'interesting times', as
the old Chinese curse goes.
When Denmark joined the European Community 20 years ago, the world was
dominated by two superpowers. Since then a global revolution has taken
place. One superpower has gone, and everyone is looking anxiously for a new
order.
The most important question, therefore, during the Danish presidency is: how
should the EC respond to that challenge? The answer will be decisive, not
only for the EC 12, but for the rest of Europe. All the other European
countries are looking to the EC as the framework through which economic
success and political stability can be achieved.
Our answer must be an open EC.
We must cease looking inwards, spending most of our time with the EC's own
institutional problems. We must offer membership right away to the most
advanced of our neighbours, and support others in preparing their entry
through extensive EC agreements. At the same time, the EC must continue its
process of integration in order to strengthen economies and democratic
institutions.
Following the Edinburgh summit in October, the agenda for the Danish
presidency is more or less set. An important task will be to implement the
Edinburgh decisions on subsidiarity and transparency. Denmark should know
the importance of this even better than its 11 colleagues, since it has
experienced the widening gap between political decision-takers and their
constituencies with regard to the EC.
The result of the Danish referendum last June - and the debate since then in
most other member states, not least the UK - has underlined the need to
react to the widespread popular apprehension that the EC has become
increasingly centralised and closed. Therefore nearness and openness have to
be keywords in the future development of the EC.
As decided at Edinburgh, one of the tasks on the Danish agenda in the next
six months will be the start of enlargement negotiations with Sweden,
Finland and Austria - and very soon Norway. It will be up to the Danish
presidency to organise the talks in such a way that the EC can increase its
membership from 12 to 16 in 1995.
Another significant result at Edinburgh was the agreement on financial
reform for the period 1993-99. This agreement will have to be implemented in
the necessary legal acts.
January 1 marks a symbolic milestone in the Community - the formal
realisation of the internal market. The original 300 proposals for
implementing the internal market have almost all been adopted - the internal
market, therefore, already has a history of success. But it is a process
that will have to be continuously developed and adapted.
For this reason, it is important to read the clear political messages from
all member countries: something more must be done for promoting employment
for the almost 16m unemployed in the Community. A growth policy will
therefore have to be established.
Another important concern will be environmental policy - Denmark will stress
that the principle of subsidiarity should not be abused to carry through
inappropriate re-nationalisation.
The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will also be
a priority. We shall try to secure a speedy and well-balanced Gatt
agreement.
When it comes to European political co-operation, there is no doubt that the
situation in the former Yugoslavia will be the most demanding task. The need
for progress is increasingly evident.
Central and eastern Europe are also not stable. A worsening of economic
crises there could easily have political consequences leading to new
confrontations and conflicts.
These countries are our immediate neighbours. We have a special
responsibility towards them. Therefore it was agreed in Edinburgh that, at
its next meeting in Copenhagen, the European Council will decide on
preparations for accession to the EC of countries from central and eastern
Europe.
In the former Soviet Union, the potential for conflicts is large. Here an
active effort to promote the reform process is needed.
The remaining superpower, the US, will change its administration in January.
It is important that good relations with the incoming American president are
fast established. A well-functioning transatlantic alliance is a
precondition for an effective performance, when it comes to the
international challenges we are facing.
It will also be Denmark's task to speak on behalf of the 12 in the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, while the Middle East
peace conference and Africa are other priorities.
The agenda is full indeed. This presidency is going to be the most demanding
Denmark has ever held.
The author is foreign minister of Denmark.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Parting is such sweet sorrow: As Czechs and Slovaks
separate, their two states will be hard-pressed to maintain their identities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It all began with a war of words over a hyphen,' recalls Rudolf Filkus, who
will be Bratislava's first ambassador to Austria when the Czech Republic and
Slovakia go their separate ways on Friday. He was referring to the bitter
debate over the name of post-communist Czechoslovakia which followed the
brief euphoria of the 'Velvet Revolution' three years ago.
Czechs from the historic provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, who make up
two-thirds of the dying federation's 15.6m population, thought it would be
sufficient to drop the word 'socialist' from the official title of the
federal state and add a hyphen to create a simple 'Federal Republic of
Czecho-Slovakia'.
Months of anguished debate later, the hyphen idea was dropped and both sides
finally approved a renamed Federal Republic of Czechs and Slovaks. By then,
however, no one could ignore the depth, or at least the decibel level, of
Slovak resentment. It is the bitter fruit of centuries of subservience to
powerful Hungarians under the Habsburg empire, only to be followed by seven
decades of playing second fiddle as junior partner to the more populous,
richer, ethnically closer, but condescending Czechs.
It took the emergence of a stocky former boxer with a communist past to
channel Slovak resentments into a nationalist movement, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which promised to make Slovaks master in their
own house and respected abroad. For Mr Vladimir Meciar, the HZDS leader,
victory in last June's general election was seen as a mandate to negotiate a
new and more equal relationship with the Czechs, and to pay off old scores
against Czechoslovakia's morally superior federal president, the playwright
Vaclav Havel.
But the general election which elevated Mr Meciar in Slovakia confirmed a
very different kind of politician as leader of the neighbouring Czech lands.
Many Slovaks identify Mr Meciar as the personification of 'Janosik' the
rustic hero of Slovak folk history. But no one could confuse Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the spiky, punctilious economist who won the Czech elections, with
Good Soldier Sveik, the obstinately dim-witted but good-natured scourge of
Habsburg officialdom in whom many Czechs see aspects of themselves.
Over the past six months these two men have sealed the fate of
Czechoslovakia. With legalistic precision they, and a handful of senior
officials, have worked out highly detailed divorce papers on 26 complex
subjects, ranging from the division of the federal army to apportioning the
foreign debt. They have also agreed to maintain a customs union and the free
movement of goods and people after independence. The two states will also
have separate central banks and ultimately separate currencies after a
probably brief initial period with a common currency.
Within months, possibly weeks, the old Czechoslovak crown will be split into
Slovak and Czech crowns. They will begin life with equal value but most
observers expect a substantial devaluation of the Slovak crown within a few
months. The general principle followed in these talks has been a division of
assets and liabilities on a 2:1 ratio, reflecting the population split.
Both sides appear proud of the unprecedentedly civilised manner of their
divorce arrangements, and both leaders have expressed nothing but mutual
respect and esteem in public. There is a nagging feeling, however,
especially in Slovakia, that the wily Mr Klaus caught the former Slovak
pugilist off-balance at their first meeting, and retained the psychological
advantage through subsequent sparring rounds.
From the start, Mr Klaus made clear that the Czechs had no intention of
bankrolling Slovak independence, and would consider only a strengthened
federation or a split. 'Better a quick divorce than a messy marriage,' was
the uncompromising message that Mr Meciar brought back from his first talks
with Mr Klaus. There was never any suggestion that Prague would emulate
Belgrade, which 18 months ago sent federal troops into Slovenia in a
half-hearted attempt to keep the small republic within the now defunct
Yugoslav federation.
Economically, there is little question that Slovakia's best hope for a
prosperous future lay in remaining firmly attached to the powerful Czech
locomotive. A glance at the map of central Europe explains why. Prague is
200km west of Vienna and the Czech lands were the most industrialised part
of the Habsburg empire. Between the wars Czech industry was as technically
proficient as Germany's.
After the divorce the Czech republic will be firmly anchored in western
Europe while Slovakia will retain only a narrow border with Austria and be
hemmed in by Poland, the Ukraine and Hungary.
The danger is that both halves of the soon to be divided federal state will
be hard-pressed to maintain their future identities. So linked is the new
Czech state with the German-speaking core of Europe that some Czech wits
suggest that their new state should be called East Germany. Mr Klaus Kinkel,
the German foreign minister, was reportedly not amused when a Czech
journalist shared the joke with him at a recent Czech-German summit meeting.
The spiritual fathers of the Czechoslovak state, mainly Czech and Slovak
emigres in Pittsburgh and other American industrial towns during the first
world war, sold the idea of the new dual nation to President Woodrow Wilson
as a Slav bulwark to reduce German influence in postwar Europe. Now the
Czech republic risks ending up as little more than an extension to the
German economy.
Northern Bohemia, with its busy industrial towns like Teplice, even looks
like Germany, with solid round-turreted houses and sturdy factories. This is
no coincidence. Until 1945 this area was the German-speaking Sudetenland
whose 3m inhabitants were used by Hitler in 1938 to justify the first
partition of prewar Czechoslovakia which, when ratified by the infamous
Munich Agreement, sealed Czechoslovakia's fate for 50 years.
While the new Czech republic will be surrounded by prosperous Germanic
Europe, and working full-out to fulfil the rising demand for cheap
industrial goods produced by Bohemian workers at wages roughly 10 per cent
of German levels, Slovakia, where unemployment at 12 per cent is already
four times the Czech level, will become Europe's new frontier with the east.
Nowhere is this uncomfortable reality clearer than at the Russian market on
the outskirts of Kosice, the principal city of eastern Slovakia. Here on a
frozen muddy field, thousands of Ukrainian, Russian and Vietnamese stand in
the bitter wind to display their pathetic wares  - grubby underpants, rusty
deodorant spray cans, used car parts, plastic flowers, cheap homemade
alcohol. Groups of Slav imitation Rambos indicate where, for the equivalent
of a few dollars, pistols, Kalashnikov rifles and ammunition are for sale.
The vulnerability of Slovakia to economic and political instability in the
countries to its south and east can also be clearly seen at the east
Slovakian Steel Works (VSZ), which is the main employer in Kosice and the
surrounding area. The Czech-built plant's output of cheap, high-quality
sheet steel has already attracted anti-dumping measures from the European
Community. Now its entire output is threatened by a shortage of
Russian-supplied fuel in Ukraine.
VSZ depends on a regular supply of enriched iron pellets from Krivoi Rog in
south-eastern Ukraine and Russian gas supplied by pipeline under Ukrainian
soil. Now, Krivoi Rog is short of diesel fuel and VSZ is having to send a
fleet of diesel tankers on a 2,000km round-trip shuttle service to the
Ukrainian city so that trucks can load railwagons with pellets for VSZ.
Without these pellets much of the downstream manufacturing capacity of
Slovakia would be crippled, including the big tank and arms factories. These
were hobbled by the federal government's virtual ban on arms exports but
have been given approval by Mr Meciar to compete for a 300-tank order from
Pakistan and other potential deals in Africa and the Middle East.
Kosice, with large Hungarian, Ruthenian and Ukraine minorities, is a city
which has traditionally looked to Prague to counterbalance what it sees as
the dangerous centralising tendencies of Bratislava, and retain links with
western Europe.
Mr Dusan Klinger, publisher and chief editor of Slovensky Vychod, the
principal local newspaper in Eastern Slovakia, was a dissident during the
Communist regime. He articulates the fears of many Kosice intellectuals
that, with independence severing these old ties, democracy, freedom of
speech and prosperity will slip away from a region which voted heavily for
Mr Meciar's opponents at the elections.
But the approach of independence is also being greeted nervously in the
Slovak capital, which, with its complement of newly refurbished foreign
embassies, government buildings and parliament, should be the main gainer
from Slovakia's new sovereign status. Bratislava's baroque old town,
dominated by its austere square castle overlooking the River Danube, is less
than 70km from Vienna and will soon be connected by improved road and rail
links.
Until now Slovakia has attracted less than 10 per cent of the Dollars 1bn
which has flowed into Czechoslovakia since 1990 and Volkswagen's new Audi
station-wagon assembly plant in the industrial suburbs is the main single
foreign investment. But joint ventures with Austrian companies are the most
numerous, and Mr Meciar's team hopes to build a Mexican-style industrial
free-port close to the Austrian border to attract inward investment.
The hope is that future links with Vienna will prove more fruitful than the
long and subservient connection with Budapest. But it is hard to escape the
conclusion that Slovakia, with more than 600,000 ethnic Hungarians, will
need to build friendly relations with Hungary, with whom it has been in a
bitter dispute over the Gabcikovo dam on the Danube river, as well as with
the Czech republic itself.
Just before Christmas, Poland, Hungary and representatives of the future
Czech and Slovak republics signed a free-trade agreement linking the
Visegrad 4. This is the grouping named after the Hungarian town where two
years ago the central European countries agreed to co-ordinate their
eventual entry into the EC.
Many Czechs and Slovaks hope that full membership of an enlarged EC by 2000
will allow both states to come back together, still as sovereign countries,
but within the over-arching compass of a wider EC whose eventual contours
still have to be defined.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Arms control after Start
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE'S first reaction, on reading that the US and Russian foreign
ministers yesterday reached agreement on 'a historic nuclear arms reduction
treaty', may well be to think that an item from a few years back has somehow
got itself reprinted. The age of such news reports seemed to have ended with
the dissolution of the Soviet Union a year ago.
Yet only two weeks ago in Stockholm Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the same Russian
foreign minister who initialled yesterday's agreement, sent shivers down
spines with an unorthodox but rather effective hoax speech, giving the world
a foretaste of what it should expect from his successor if anti-western
forces in Russia were to regain the upper hand.
That is certainly not to be ruled out, and the new agreement (which will not
be fully implemented until the year 2003, or at best 2000) reminds us that
Russia remains by far the west's most formidable potential adversary; so
much so that the US can envisage cuts amounting to 50 per cent of its
strategic budget, or nearly 10 per cent of its total defence budget, on the
basis of reciprocity with Russia alone.
Implementation cannot be taken for granted. Even if Mr Kozyrev's fears are
not realised, and power in Moscow remains in the hands of people committed
to reform at home and co-operation with the west abroad, the task of
decommissioning so many strategic weapons will tax Russia's financial,
technical and administrative resources to the limit; indeed, it is already
asking for US assistance, which for this purpose Congress will probably be
happy to provide.
Last of its kind
In any case, it can safely be assumed that this agreement will be the last
of its kind. It marks the limit of what can be achieved by a bilateral
US-Russian arms control process. From here on, nuclear arms control will be
multi-lateral, as conventional and chemical weapons control already is.
Already it would be true to say that the officially recognised nuclear
powers are much more worried by the danger of proliferation than they are by
the size and nature of each other's arsenals.
This danger takes two forms. The classic one, which inspired the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the danger that hitherto non-nuclear
states will acquire nuclear weapons. This danger has been significantly
increased by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rapid run-down of its
defence industries. While there is as yet no evidence that ready-made
nuclear weapons are being sold to third-world countries, there can be little
doubt that nuclear materials and above all skilled technicians are finding
their way there.
Intense eagerness
The more novel danger is that new nuclear powers may be coming into
existence by political fission as the former Soviet Union breaks up. During
the past year much American effort and ingenuity has gone into heading off
this danger by trying to ensure that ex-Soviet republics other than Russia
renounce any nuclear pretensions. This effort was facilitated by the fact
that most if not all Soviet nuclear weapons, wherever located, were under
the control of Russian personnel; and also by the intense eagerness of all
the ex-Soviet republics for western recognition and support.
As far as short-range weapons are concerned, the effort has seemingly
succeeded: by last May the US and Nato were able to certify that all such
weapons had been 'repatriated' to Russian soil. But uncertainties persist
about strategic weapons in Ukraine, and to a lesser extent in Kazakhstan and
Belarus.
Though all three of these states have promised to sign the NPT, none has yet
done so; and Ukraine has yet to ratify the protocol associating it with the
1991 US-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start). None of these states
can properly be called a nuclear power, in the sense of having operational
command and control of the weapons on its territory, but Ukraine at least
has the capacity to become such a power.
So far, it is unclear whether Ukraine's leaders are merely holding out for
more western aid or whether they wish to retain the option of building a
nuclear deterrent to safeguard their national independence. Either way, the
west's interest must be to persuade them that Ukraine's security can be
better ensured by other means.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Arts: New brooms and contemporary music - Andrew Clements
stresses the importance of the BBC in commissioning new works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubting the single issue that exercised British music lovers
most strenuously during 1992. Elevated from the ranks of music critics to
become the BBC's Controller of Radio 3, Nicholas Kenyon set about making the
network more approachable and user-friendly, and immediately brought the
massed forces of reaction down upon his head. There was, he claimed, no
intention of diminishing the breadth and depth of Radio 3's music and drama
output; the perceived threat to his audience was the imminent arrival of
Classic FM, the first nationwide independent radio station and the first
promising to devote itself to 'classical' music.
Kenyon's innovations, brightening up the travel-time programmes with more
news and chat, replacing hardened Radio 3 announcers with 'personalities'
and mixing and matching the late-night schedule with reviews and interviews,
were all in place well before Classic FM hit the airwaves. When it did one
could only wonder why he had worried so much; anyone with half an ear for
serious music was quickly repelled by the mixture of ignorance and
incompetence that packaged the bite-sized chunks of easy listening on the
commercial station; Radio 2's audience rather than Radio 3's was surely the
target.
If in retrospect Kenyon's hasty changes look the result of a panic attack on
either his own part or that of his paymasters, listeners have been left with
the consequences for good or bad. Time will doubtless heal the worst scars
of the cosmetic surgery to the network, though the emetic effects of Sunday
mornings' stream of cosiness will take a very long time to overcome. In
general terms anything which increases the discourse on the arts is a good
thing, provided it is well-informed discourse and not softened and sanitised
for BBC consumption.
There remain, though, some worryingly grey areas in the Kenyon plan.
Certainly Radio 3 drama seems an endangered species, and the future for
contemporary music on the network seems a precarious one; it is easy to
envisage it shunted off into the late-night 'cross-over' programmes where
art music and rock and pop can lie together in blissful ecumenical union.
That may be good news for the currently trendy holy minimalists - Tavener,
Part, and Gorecki (a particular Kenyon favourite) - but hard on the
mainstream which lacks a popular, record-buying following; to be shunted off
into the ghetto of 'Music in Our Time' seems an increasingly uncertain fate.
Already the BBC's winter week of contemporary music at the Barbican has been
abandoned, reduced to a weekend of more accessible 20th-century music -
concerts of Alban Berg last January, Janacek this time - the splendidly
valuable surveys of Berio and Stockhausen, Henze and Birtwistle are now
things of the past.
In the current climate the extent of the BBC's role in actively fostering
contemporary music will surely come under further scrutiny before too long.
Doubtless the major orchestral commissions will survive; they will be fitted
into the showcase of the BBC Symphony Orchestra's South Bank concerts (which
are undeniably benefitting this season from Kenyon's policy of single-price
tickets) and at the Proms, while the regional orchestras too will continue
to get their quotas of new works.
Where the BBC commissioning policy does much of its most important work is
precisely where it is most vulnerable - in the 'hidden' commissions, the
works that are commissioned for performance by independent ensembles and
soloists and receive their premieres under BBC auspices in a wide variety of
invitation concerts and studio sessions. It would very tempting for a
financially embarrassed BBC to reduce this expenditure drastically, and
almost impossible for anyone outside the organisation to quantify the loss
of revenue to composers, those less well-known and up-and-coming figures who
need this kind of unglamorous encouragement. Just how essential the BBC
remains to the vitality of new music in this country is demonstrated by
three of the most impressive British orchestral scores of the year, all
commissioned by the corporation - Colin Matthews's Broken Symmetry, Simon
Holt's viola concerto walking with the river's roar, and David Sawer's
Byrnan Wood.
These and the tour de force of Dominic Muldowney's Violin Concerto aside, it
was an undistinguished year for British composers - Tippett's new work, a
fifth string quartet, was a sad disappointment, Birtwistle's wind and piano
quintet failed to materialise, the younger generations paused for breath.
Yet in Europe as a whole there was much to admire, not least the definite
emergence of the Finns Magnus Lindberg and Kaaija Saariaho as composers of
real international stature. Dienstag, the latest instalment of Stockhausen's
Licht project, was the familiar infuriating mixture of vivid musical
invention and absurd, heavy-handed theatricals, while the retrospective of
Luigi Nono's late works mounted at the Holland Festival was a marvellous
tribute, crowned by a performance of his unclassifiable, evening-long
Prometeo.
Highlight of the year, though, was the premiere in Hamburg of Wolfgang
Rihm's theatre piece Die Eroberung von Mexico, perhaps the finest new opera
since Birtwistle's The Mask of Orpheus and like that work a marvellous
mingling of myth and magic, underpinned with music of sensuous beauty and
immense power. In some shape or form it really must be heard in Britain
before too long, even perhaps under the auspices of the BBC.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Arts: A generous dose of dramatic adaptations - Television
in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY

<TEXT>
FOR television the year which ends tomorrow has been much like any other, in
one respect at least: a large part of the middle class intelligentsia, the
chattering classes, call them what you will, continued to complain
throughout the year that 'There's nothing on television these days, is
there? It's all rubbish, isn't it?' From the first week of 1992 when Channel
4 brought us the superb autobiographical mini-series An Angel At My Table,
charting the extraordinary life of New Zealander Janet Frame, to the end of
the year when BBC2 was giving us Jennifer Saunders' wickedly accurate comedy
about the world of fashion PR, Absolutely Fabulous, the chorus remained at
full volume: 'Just nothing on these days, is there . . .'
Television is a huge grab-bag, a monstrosity of a medium, even more
multifarious than print. Of course much of it is appalling. The flops of
1992 included a drama on BBC1 called Moon And Son in which Millicent Martin
played the psychic owner of a market stall whose son was also in the
business. Other duds included the Nicholas Craig Masterclass on BBC2, a joke
about taking yourself too seriously which might have sustained a five-minute
skit but was, unbelievably, stretched out to fill an entire series. It took
itself far too seriously. It was BBC2 again which messed about with The
Young Musician Of The Year, turning what had been a great pleasure into a
great trial. Many former enthusiasts switched off. Astonishingly it was also
BBC2 which brought us Ps And Qs, an 'etiquette quiz' which made anybody who
knew anything at all about the subject writhe with embarrassment, while
failing utterly to inform those who did not.
The Velvet Claw on BBC1 was that rare phenomenon, a bad wildlife series.
ITV's new Maigret, despite having Michael Gambon in the title role, was
frequently compared, detrimentally, with the BBC's famous black and white
series starring Rupert Davies. But the biggest boo-boo of the year was
BBC1's new twice-weekly soap opera Eldorado which was set in Spain among
expatriates and a few foreigners and was supposed to win big ratings with
its formula of sun, sangria and sex. Instead it entered the BBC1 Top 30 in
July with an audience of 10 million, slid to seven million by October, fell
off the bottom of the list, and has not reappeared since.
Yet it is surely no great surprise if there are some disasters in a medium
which now offers all of us four terrestrial channels, operating day and
night, and attempts to cater for the entire population, young and old, rich
and poor, clever and not so clever. The surprise - and it is strikingly
obvious to anybody who travels the world even a little and has a look at
what television manages elsewhere - is that British television sustains such
a high success rate.
Take drama. In January ITV brought us a two-part dramatisation of Fay
Weldon's novel The Cloning Of Joanna May with memorable performances from
Patricia Hodge and Brian Cox. It would have been a peculiar viewer who could
watch Part 1 and then forego Part 2. February offered Channel 4's adaptation
of The Camomile Lawn, Peter Hall's first effort at directing a television
series. The cast list alone would have caused queues round the block for any
West End theatre: Felicity Kendal, Paul Eddington, Claire Bloom, Rosemary
Harris, Richard Johnson (who turned out to be flavour of the year) and
Virginia McKenna. There was lots of rumpy pumpy, not only on the eponymous
grass, but upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber. Generally
speaking it did seem in 1992 as though the British were becoming a little
more relaxed about sex and a little less happy about perpetual violence on
screen, which is a move in the right direction.
In March BBC2 treated us to a hugely enjoyable adaptation (yes, another
adaptation) of Kingsley Amis's The Old Devils, and May brought one of the
major contenders for the year's prizes, ITV's three-part adaptation (yes
another . . .) of Angus Wilson's Anglo-Saxon Attitudes which once again
starred Richard Johnson. It also starred Douglas Hodge who managed to take
the lead simultaneously in BBC1's adaptation (yes . . .) of Ruth Rendell's A
Fatal Inversion, a story which, looking back from the year's end, seems to
have been pretty nasty. Yet it was undeniably a gripping production. The
idea that there is 'Nothing on television' in a week which - apart from
everything else - offers two such distinguished dramas surely suggests
something more serious than ennui in the viewer.
The autumn season was equally generous, and this time all the best material
was written specially for television. Downtown Lagos was an eccentric
three-part BBC2 production about the English legal system and colonialism,
or possibly drug smuggling and racism, or perhaps all four. On the same
channel Nice Town was, most unusually, a piece of true satire - ridiculing
the hypocrisy and priggishness of British suburban life - and as such seemed
to be widely distrusted and disliked. A later generation may find it funny
and telling. BBC1's Look At It This Way had an an attitude that was
sometimes equally sardonic, plus the advantage of good location filming in
yuppy London. But the best of the autumn bunch was BBC1's Between The Lines,
a series about an internal police investigation body which provided a new
foreground story each week while following background threads throughout the
13-part series. This is another potential award winner.
Single dramas were more scarce than ever, and most of the few that did
appear were better described as films. My shortlist contains only one
non-BBC2 title: Channel 4's A Sense Of History consisting of a single
virtuoso performance by Jim Broadbent. He played what seemed at first to be
a completely conventional English aristocrat, only slowly revealing himself
to be completely loopy and a murderer. Screen 2 accounted for practically
all the other impressive single dramas. The Last Romantics was an
astonishingly successful piece about FR Leavis and in-fighting among
Cambridge academics; and An Ungentlemanly Act gave a graphic account of the
extraordinary events at the start of the Falklands war involving the
governor, Sir Rex Hunt.
With all that on offer solely from the drama departments, what could anybody
mean by saying 'There's nothing on'? There were Winter Olympics and The
Olympics, a Cricket World Cup which helped Sky sell lots of satellite
dishes, though they won few friends with their far too frequent commercial
breaks, and in BBC2's Grand Prix we watched Nigel Mansell finally win the
Formula 1 World Championship. The March election campaign became notorious
for Jennifer Bennett's glue ear, the subject of one of Labour's party
political broadcasts, and for John Major's decision to abandon all the ploys
of the spin doctors and revert to a soap box. This was the general election
where the worm turned and television began to analyse in detail the
politicians' attempts to exploit the medium.
The programmes intended to mark the 500th anniversary of Christopher
Columbus's famous voyage were pretty lacklustre, but good work was done in
Spain. Fire In The Blood was an outstanding BBC2 series which conveyed an
amazing amount about the Spanish people and their country; Coast Of Dreams
an excellent pair of Channel 4 programmes about the British connection; and
Floyd On Spain - BBC 2 again - was the best set of
cookery/travel/folklore/wine/architecture and gags programmes yet made by
Keith Floyd whose series get better and better.
Three utterly contrasting productions would have to compete for any prizes
in the Documentary Series category. Perpetual Motion was a collection of
fond reports on BBC2 of long-lasting vehicles such as the Morris 1000 and
the FX4 London cab; in Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint Bamber Gascoigne
offered highly entertaining reports on European tourism in the 15th century
(rules for pilgrims included 'Don't paint your coat of arms on monuments')
on Channel 4; and The Kennedys was ITV's autumn series of classic
documentaries about the No. 1 political family in the US.
Virtually all the BBC's regular series produced at least one
more-than-usually-impressive programme. Inside Story screened an important
up-date on 'Bloody Sunday'; Timewatch showed how 'Bridge On The River Kwai'
marginalised the significance of Asian prisoners in the building of the
Burma railway; Bookmark combined drama and documentary flawlessly to
describe 'Miss Pym's Day Out'; 40 Minutes told the story of Radio Luxembourg
in 'Farewell Fab 208'; and the Video Diaries series included one of the most
poignant documents of any year when it showed the material shot by an
Albanian doctor about the pitiful state of his country. Then in October
Kenneth Griffith finally managed to bring to the screen an account of the
life of one of his heroes in Roger Casement, Heart Of Darkness.
There is another category of programmes which becomes increasingly important
and might, perhaps, be called 'Current Affairs Series' since they deal with
the present rather than the past. The Racing Game on BBC2 in May was far
more interesting about horse racing than any non-enthusiast might have
dreamed possible. States Of Mind in August, also on BBC2, was fascinating on
attitudes and lifestyles in the US. Some programmes in the Video Diaries
series already mentioned were less successful than others, but generally
this was a triumphant use of amateur video at a time when such footage is
exploited more and more elsewhere on television for embarrassment series.
Highly original and worryingly revealing was BBC1's autumn series Off The
Back Of A Lorry in which Mike Scott and a large lorry criss-crossed Europe
investigating the way that the new regulations operate (almost invariably
against British interests).
Two types of programme which have often been so strong in Britain - comedy
and arts - were less impressive in 1992. But nearly everyone seemed to enjoy
Absolutely Fabulous on BBC2, especially Joanna Lumley's performance as the
drunk sidekick. The only other notable newcomer was The Big One in which
Sandy Toksvig got away with some of the most explicit gags ever used on
British television either because nobody understood them or because nobody
believed such a sweet little thing could be so rude. The other good series -
Red Dwarf, Waiting For God and Have I Got News For You - all began before
1992.
There was even less originality in the arts. As usual several editions of
ITV's South Bank Show remain memorable at year's end: one which
deconstructed the 'Sgt Pepper' recording; and another that looked at the
lives of two young female stars in the Royal Ballet. The Late Show on BBC2
maintained its standard though as ever it sometimes felt like a private
club. If you had to name an arts series of the year it would probably be
Channel 4's Without Walls which proved with its treatment of 'The End Of
History', Shakespeare's sexuality, and much besides that there are really no
limits to what can be described as 'art and culture'.
The steady growth of tabloid TV continued, manifested largely in a passion
for 'real life' crime stories. BBC1 gave us Crime Limited and 999, and ITV
contributed Michael Winner's True Crimes and Crime Story. In July ITV
launched a morning studio series called The Richard And Judy Show which was
like an electronic edition of 'Peg's Paper' and in October BBC1 dutifully
followed suit with Good Morning . . . With Anne And Nick. Channel 4
disregarded its famous 'remit' and launched The Big Breakfast Show which
took the 'television for morons' notion further than ever before.
Deaths are always sad, but the 1992 list seemed even more so than usual.
Frankie Howerd and Benny Hill, two of the greatest clowns of their
generation, died within 24 hours of one another in April. In June, Juris
Podnieks was killed, apparently while scuba diving on holiday, a terrible
irony for a man who had come so close to death so often while filming the
collapse of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union. It was Podnieks who
brought us the outstanding series Hallo, Do You Hear Us? Then in December,
only six months after retiring, Dan Maskell, the voice of Wimbledon, died.
Tomorrow will see the last of TV-am across the country, Thames Television in
London, TVS in southern England, and TSW in the west country. On Friday they
will be replaced by a new ultra-competitive market driven ITV. On the same
day John Birt will take over from Sir Michael Checkland as director-general
of the BBC and will begin his self-appointed task of overseeing the decline
of BBC audiences by one third.
Will 1993 be as good for the viewer as 1992? It seems unlikely. True, the
British have muddled through to remarkably effective broadcasting systems,
producing, more by luck than judgment, structures and organisations which
have served us peculiarly well. But load too much on her back and even Lady
Luck will stumble and fall. Perhaps 1993 will be the year when we really
shall have cause to say 'There's nothing on television these days, is
there?'

THE version of Tosca to be shown between 6.30 and 8.25 on BBC2 is the one
originally relayed live from Rome in July. With Domingo as Cavaradossi,
Catherine Malfitano as Tosca, and Ruggero Raimondi as Scarpia it was
performed on the Rome locations and at the times specified in the script. It
can now be seen in one evening without breaks.
If Tchaikovsky appeals more than Puccini, Radio 3 is offering Symphonies 1
and 4 in its concert series The Tchaikovsky Symphonies (7.30). The St
Petersburg Philharmonic performs under Yuri Temirkanov.
The situation comedy about night security men, Nightingales, which begins a
new batch on C4 at 10.30, is at its best when the most absurd of fantasies
are mixed with reality. The acting is extraordinarily strong with James
Ellis (once of 'Z Cars'), Robert Lindsay (so good in 'GBH') and David
Threlfall (unforgettable in 'Nicholas Nickleby') playing the security
guards.
Radio 4's series about radio itself, The Friend In The Corner (11.00),
considers 1967 when the Home, Light and Third disappeared and local radio
first took to the air.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Management: Successful to a degree - Critics are forcing
business schools to re-think the way they approach the MBA qualification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALLAN BOLTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Master of Business Administration qualification, once seen as the
indispensable element in senior managers' and companies' development plans,
is no longer the only way ahead for ambitious executives.
The harsh international business climate has prompted some companies to ask
why business schools continue to turn out highly numerate and analytically
able graduates - 'quant-jocks' - who seem unable to exercise the arts of
management and dealing with people.
Part of the problem stems from the way MBA courses are structured in the US,
where the degree originated. Its business schools now produce more than
70,000 graduates every year.
US business schools vie with one another for official accreditation. The
previously rigid criteria imposed by the main US accrediting body had led to
undifferentiated programmes. Critics of the MBA system in the US have raised
a number of questions:
Why do business schools persist in emphasising case studies (made famous by
the Harvard Business School) which analyse yesterday's issues?
How can the MBA adapt to the demands of a complex global business
environment instead of a stable home market?
Will the schools produce chief executives capable of leading businesses
which can meet society's higher standards on ethical and environmental
matters?
Where are the leaders capable of negotiating complex joint ventures with
foreign companies and of motivating increasingly diverse, multi-cultural
workforces in the US?
The situation in the UK is different because British MBAs were essentially
an unknown quantity until the early 1980s. British business schools also
have more diverse curricula.
Nevertheless, some employers are disillusioned. A survey by Her Majesty's
lnspectorate last year of 52 companies and those business schools in the
former polytechnic and college sector uncovered widespread doubts about
course quality, language and information technology training, and personal
skills development.
The MBA provision received support from only a minority of employers. Most
saw it as irrelevant to the needs of their companies. There was concern
about the growing number of institutions which offer the qualification. It
was felt that some teaching staff lacked relevant business experience.
Doubts were also expressed about the quality of some courses.
The lack of an accreditation body, such as the American Assembly of
Collegiate Schools of Business, leaves UK providers vulnerable to such
charges. Only 27 UK business schools are recognised by the Association of
MBA's. But there are 116 institutions offering MBA programmes, in spite of
the difficulties in recruiting teaching and research faculty in subjects
such as accounting and marketing.
A shake out is a real possibility. The recession is held responsible for a
recent fall-off in applications. Students paying full fees favour the
leading business schools, but even these have placed expansion plans on
hold. Smaller, less well-known providers may have to withdraw from the MBA
market altogether.
It is a common misunderstanding that the MBA is a quick-fix conversion
course, allowing students to tick off the acquisition of knowledge in
functional areas - marketing, accounting, finance, production - and then
graft on a strategic management component derived from prepared case
studies. Some second-rate programmes may achieve little more.
The better programmes, however, provide education rather than training,
personal development rather than technical expertise. They recognise that,
in the time available, it is impossible to teach advanced specialist
knowledge of the functional areas: this is the preserve of a few of the
leading graduate schools. Instead they ensure that students receive adequate
grounding in finding ways of crossing artificial corporate internal barriers
and of identifying strategic solutions.
Most programmes culminate in a consultancy project in which students
participate either individually or in small teams. Managers taking part-time
MBA programmes are likely to work in their employing organisation on a
problem which would otherwise be neglected or handed to consultants.
Business schools can produce powerful evidence of the value of MBA
programmes - and not just in terms of the salaries their graduates are
likely to receive. Managers taking a full-time course are often
career-shifters, seeking to move into different functions or organisations.
Those sponsored by their employer are often seen as potential high-fliers.
They study while remaining in their jobs, moving in new career directions
during or after completion of the MBA.
Recent changes in MBA programmes promise greater relevance to corporate
needs. Flexibility of provision has become the watchword. In addition to the
traditional 21-month programmes of the London and Manchester Business
Schools and 12-month programmes offered by most providers, there are modular
courses for a consortium of companies or for a single company (such as
Lancaster University Management School's MBAs for British Airways and VSEL).
There are also distance learning programmes, some with world-wide student
participation.
Most significantly the leading business schools can point to their graduates
who embody the knowledge and skills required in modern management. There
have been advances in teaching the management of information technology as
well as in the availability of hardware. The curriculum is constantly
reviewed in most schools.
Again the American parallel is instructive: most leading US schools have
recently completed a fundamental review of their curriculum.
De-regulation of the curriculum in the US, together with successful
innovation in European business schools, is creating a competitive
international environment. Leading US schools recruit European students and
some European schools reciprocate, while both look to Asia for
highly-motivated students.
Perhaps the most encouraging trend is away from injections of knowledge and
facts towards integrated study based on practical projects requiring the
student to analyse, reflect and develop rounded management aptitude. Some
desirable attributes - leadership ability, motivation, breadth of vision,
global awareness, coping with ambiguity - cannot readily be taught; but the
best business schools have demonstrated that they can facilitate their
development.
These trends suggest that the MBA will continue to serve as the standard
international qualification for those intent on becoming senior managers.
The threat, however, is that some corporations are developing their own
management education programmes without a commitment to specific business
schools. Top business schools not only need to offer quality MBA courses,
but they must also include pre-MBA and post-MBA provision.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Management: Bulgarian entrepreneurs cash in on capital ideas
 -The early success of market initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH and THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1989 Irona Komitova and her colleagues were called 'happy suiciders' by
sceptics who doubted their ability to encourage market sector initiatives in
Bulgaria.
Three years on they work in smart offices in the centre of Sofia, having
successfully created Bulgaria's first private bank, launched a string of
business newspapers, set-up an insurance company and initiated several key
pieces of commercial legislation. Their organisation also acts as a voice
for the country's emerging entrepreneurs.
Komitova, aged 33, is a founder member of the Union for Private Economic
Enterprises which was formed in 1989 on the initiative of Valentin Mollov, a
Sofia lawyer.
Mollov started the UPEE by asking for volunteers on a local radio station.
About 600 would-be entrepreneurs, including Komitova, then working at a
steel institute, turned up at the first meeting.
'Even before the fall of the Zhivkov (communist) regime in November 1989, we
had had Law 56 which permitted individuals to set up private companies.
Mollov had the idea of bringing these people together,' she explains.
A core team of seven emerged with Komitova becoming secretary general, a
post she still holds.
Within five months, the UPEE had launched First Private Bank. 'We played an
'incubating' role for the bank. We approached the legislature to amend the
constitution which did not allow private banks. We organised the share
subscription and publicised the necessity of a private bank in the press,'
Komitova says.
The bank, which lends mainly to private companies, now has more than 70
branches and 650 employees.
The UPEE also launched a weekly business newspaper. 'We called it 168 Hours
 -the number of hours in the week,' Komitova says. 'We wanted to get across
the idea that a market economy means hard work and that private businessmen
are responsible for their companies seven days a week.' The group launched
another business newspaper, 24 Hours, in 1991. Within two months it was
Bulgaria's top-selling daily.
'Independent information about the market economy is essential in a country
like Bulgaria which had one of the most closed communist regimes,' Komitova
says.
According to the UPEE, another leftover from the past is the state's
attitude towards entrepreneurs.
'The government has been slow to facilitate the financing and new
legislation that private business needs', she says. 'Privatisation of state
companies should not be presented as the only way to a private sector. We
encourage entrepreneurs to set up their own companies - it's easier and
cheaper.'
The UPEE lobbied successfully for the corporate tax rate to be reduced from
50 to 40 per cent. It has also helped to draft legislation, including laws
to govern small- and medium-sized companies.
The UPEE leaders have not concealed their new-found riches. They all have
shares in First Private Bank. Some have developed their own projects.
Dimiter Zvezdev, UPEE vice-president, for example, owns a computer plant in
Singapore.
'We've been open because we want to promote the idea that it's not a vice to
be rich,' Komitova says. 'Historically, Bulgaria has been more conservative
than the central European countries. We've had fewer examples of what
private initiative can achieve.'
But there is still disbelief that the group has earned its profits legally.
UPEE companies have been investigated several times for alleged tax fraud.
'Government officials cannot understand that certain types of businesses can
make really big money,' says Petyo Blaskov, editor-in-chief of the 168 Hours
press group.
Komitova also believes UPEE has been targeted because it is critical of
government policy. It has called for faster privatisation, for a bankruptcy
law to be passed and for state enterprises, which control 95 per cent of
industry, to be managed more professionally.
'The biggest problem private entrepreneurs face is the country's shortage of
funds available for investment. Our large external debt has made it hard to
raise much foreign capital,' Komitova says.
'It's been encouraging to see the successes of some of our first members.
But overall, for private companies in this country, it's still a struggle to
survive.'

FT  30 DEC 92 / Think tanks halted in battle for ideas: The fight to lead
the Conservatives' political offensive in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the prime minister gathers close advisers at his Chequers country house
the weekend after next for a summit on domestic policy, the contributions of
'think tanks' that aim to direct Tory party thinking will be noticeable by
their absence.
Such a meeting would have been unthinkable in the 1980s without the
influence of the Centre for Policy Studies, the Adam Smith Institute and the
Institute of Economic Affairs.
'There is a battle of ideas going on,' said Lord Skidelsky, chairman of the
Social Market Foundation. 'There is a Darwinian struggle. I wouldn't like to
say that it was a battle of organisations as such, or that we wished anyone
ill. It is just: who can come up with an agenda for the 1990s that can
work?'
The foundation was set up to protect the ideas of the defunct Social
Democratic Party but now leans towards mainstream Conservative thinking.
Local government minister Mr John Redwood, head of Downing Street's policy
unit when Lady Thatcher was prime minister, said the influence in Whitehall
of outside thinkers had declined markedly. 'No single think tank is
currently having a golden run or making the incisive contribution to the
political debate as, for instance, the Centre for Policy Studies did in its
heyday,' he said.
The vacuum partly arises from changes in personalities. The Institute of
Economic Affairs split in 1991 after factional clashes. Mr Graham Mather,
the general director, refused to become a repository for the Thatcher
legacy. He set up the European Policy Forum, with support from Mr John
Major, to develop policies in a European context. The forum hopes to become
more influential in the run-up to the 1996 inter-governmental conference
that will review Europe's future post-Maastricht.
Similarly, the No Turning Back Group of backbenchers and ministers - once
Mrs Thatcher's praetorian guard - has been divided. Many members are loyal
to 'Majorism'. Others, particularly the Euro-sceptic members, want to
protect its original Thatcherite instincts. One rightwing minister said: 'It
would be helpful if they turned their attention to domestic agenda rather
than agitating on Europe.'
Perhaps more influential has been the style of politics and thinking
associated with Mr Major's premiership.
Mr Mather said Conservatism was less about factionalism, more about a search
across the political spectrum for fresh, practical ideas. He added: 'The
trench warfare and the political flag-flying are over because there has been
a convergence in politics. The differences are less stark. The market is the
starting point for most policymakers whichever political party they are in.'
That has not tempered the argument but has made the likely impact on future
Conservative thinking less clear. Lord Skidelsky said think tanks 'are like
entrepreneurs - they see the market changing'. This week he proposed using
Keynesian discretionary economic policies to compensate for failures of
monetarist economics.
Much debate has been postponned because of Westminster's preoccupation with
Europe. But the No Turning Back Group decided before Christmas to start
publishing pamphlets again.
Housing, unemployment, and pensions are possible topics. Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury and a group member, is one likely
author.
The Social Market Foundation plans papers on retirement and education. The
Adam Smith Institute has contributed to developing Mr Major's Citizen's
Charter.
Mr David Willets, the former director of the Centre for Policy Studies who
is now MP for Havant and a board member of the foundation, said: 'More
activity is good for the Conservative party and, to be a bit pompous, it is
good for public policy.'
A CRISIS in accountability is looming as an unelected elite assumes
responsibility for many public services, according to a report published
yesterday by the European Policy Forum, an independent think tank, Alison
Smith writes.
Professor John Stewart of Birmingham University warns in the first of two
studies in the report that a 'new magistracy' is taking control of services
such as health and education. Its members are virtually unknown to the
public and may not be required to provide information about their activities
as local authorities are.
The second study, written by Professor Norman Lewis and Ms Diane Longley of
Sheffield University, warns that the new education quangos are 'notoriously
unregulated by administrative law'.
It says education reforms have done little to enhance the role of parents.

NO HOSPITAL closures should take place in London until alternative services
are available as part of a planned programme of change, the Association of
London Authorities says today.
The Labour-controlled association has told Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, in its response to the Tomlinson report on London health care
that the study does not provide a sufficient basis for closing hospitals or
reducing medical teaching.
It says London has a range of particular health needs, including high
accident and mortality rates, high levels of mental illness and a lack of
local clinics and small hospitals.
The report recommends reducing the number of hospital beds in the capital
and transferring resources to family doctor and community services. The
association says difficulties facing general practitioners in the capital
are among the particular problems that need to be addressed before closing
hospitals.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Toxic clean-up breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN BRADLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Atomic Energy Authority claims that a new process it has patented can
render toxic chemicals harmless.
AEA Technology acknowledges that the high costs involved in the 'silver two'
technique - developed at the Dounreay Nuclear Establishment in Scotland -
may initially limit its market. It said: 'There is no doubt that there is
potential but it's still in its demonstration stage and is very expensive.
But we hope to be able to make it commercially viable.'
The authority is unsure when the process might reach commercial production.
It has secured patent cover in the UK, Europe and North America - an
application is pending in Japan.
The technique reduces a range of toxic chemicals to their basic elements -
principally carbon dioxide and water - without high-temperature burning,
until now the only means of destroying them.
The AEA said the 'solvent destruction rig' could dispose of plastic
explosives, nerve gases, other chemical and biological weapon compounds and
toxic polychlorinated biphenyls - created in a wide range of industrial
activities including hydraulic fluid manufacturing and solvent recovery.
The electro-chemical process uses silver dissolved in nitro-acid, and also
platinum, hence the high costs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEATING room only: one of the first all-seater football league stadiums to
be built since the Taylor Report in 1990 on ground safety is taking shape in
south-east London. Millwall FC's 20,000-seat stadium at Senegal Fields will
replace The Den nearby, with its 3,000 seats and 17,000 standing places.
The Den was built in 1910 at a cost of Pounds 10,000. The Pounds 15m project
to build the New Den is on schedule for completion by August. The club's
offices will move in May. The cost has been met with the help of Pounds 5m
from the sale of the old ground, a Pounds 2.7m grant from Lewisham council
and Pounds 2.75m from the Football Trust.
The new ground is multi-purpose and of the first 70 licensed events only 36
are football matches. The stadium will have a hospitality suite for 500, a
total of 32 executive boxes, compared with three at The Den, and an adjacent
sports centre.
Millwall Holdings, which runs the club, is one of only three league football
clubs quoted on the Stock Exchange. The club is in the Barclays League
Division One.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Caution urged on sales figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPPERS continued to flock to the sales yesterday, but retailers warned
against reading too much into sales figures from the past two days.
Many said Monday's high turnout resulted largely from the good weather and
the bank holiday.
One Marks and Spencer manager said: 'People had got fed up at home, they
were full of turkey, and they all came out on Monday to see what bargains
they could find.'
Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges in London's West End and
chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said yesterday's number of
customers was probably 20 per cent to 25 per cent lower than the exceptional
figures recorded on Monday, but this was normal for the second day of the
sales.
Mr Daniels said menswear was selling particularly well - something also
reported by the House of Fraser chain of department stores. 'Menswear had a
disastrous second half-year. I think people were saving up for the sales,'
he said.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, agreed that
shoppers had been saving for the sales and said frantic bargain-hunting seen
on Monday might be a signal of the continuing lack of consumer confidence.
Elsewhere there was more encouraging news. At the Lakeside Shopping Centre
in Thurrock, Essex, Mr Brian Lucas, manager, said that after a slower start
the number of vehicles in the car park was 10 per cent up on Monday.
Mr Gordon Allanson, manager of Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle
upon Tyne, estimated yesterday's visitors at 200,000, the same as Monday.
Gateshead's MetroCentre reported 165,000 customers on Monday - a record for
a bank holiday and 20,000 up on the first day of the sales last year.
Yesterday's figure was expected to be similar to the 117,000 recorded on the
second day of the sales last year. Mr Ron Woodman, the centre's marketing
manager, said he believed spending yesterday would be about two thirds of
that on Monday - when some retailers reported takings 20 per cent up on the
equivalent day last year.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Contracting out may prove an expensive undertaking: The row
over European rules for transferring staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES bidding for contracts to provide services in the public sector
often rely on cutting wages and staff benefits to make a profit. But some of
the attractions for companies in bidding for contracts are now in doubt.
Recent rulings by the European Court of Justice have led unions and some
legal experts to argue that successful bidders may be bound to honour the
pay and benefits of employees they retain.
If they are right the case for contracting out could be seriously
undermined, as labour represents about 80 per cent of the cost of public
services.
Many of those who are preparing the current round of compulsory competitive
tendering and market-testing in local and central government are deeply
concerned.
At the heart of the dispute are the UK's 1981 Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations which were designed to implement the
European Commission's 1977 Acquired Rights directive.
Where there is a 'transfer' of an 'undertaking' the regulations oblige
employers to observe the contractual rights and obligations - except
pensions - of employees they retain. If these regulations do apply, then in
theory workers continue with no break in their employment rights.
The central question is whether the regulations normally apply to
contracting out. The government says the regulations can apply in the public
sector, but ministers have insisted they do not apply where local
authorities contract out in-house services under tendering legislation or in
the contracting out of Whitehall services.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, is sufficiently irritated by
the confusion to seek a UK opt-out from the EC directive. He argues that it
should be left to national governments.
Mr John McMullen, head of the employment unit and a partner at solicitors
Simpson Curtis, said: 'For each contract, companies and government officials
need to ask themselves whether there is likely to be a 'relevant transfer'
of an 'undertaking'. Only if both conditions are satisfied will the
regulations apply.'
All cases must be considered individually but there are some generally
agreed tests. First, an 'undertaking' is usually defined as an economic
entity with, for example, its own balance sheet. Then, the more similar the
function of the entity after the transfer, the more likely it is the courts
would rule its 'identity' was intact.
Finally, the easier it is to point to physical evidence of a transfer, for
example equipment and staff, the more likely it is the regulations apply.
Legal opinion is still divided over when the regulations will apply. A
recent ruling by the European Court of Justice appears to reinforce the
arguments of those who claim the regulations will normally apply to
contracting out.
This month the court indicated that the transfer of a management contract
could constitute a transfer under the regulations, and that the sole
question for national courts was whether the undertaking had retained its
identity after the transfer had taken place.
Each case would have to be considered on its facts in national courts.
Firm court rulings on contracting out in the UK should reduce the
uncertainty and several cases are pending.
Meanwhile the unions hope they have found fresh support from the EC in their
efforts to curb the market-led policies of the UK government.
Some companies say that, whatever the outcome of the cases, they will not be
dissuaded from bidding for contracts. Some contractors for skilled services,
such as information technology, even say they prefer to transfer staff under
the regulations.
They rely on retaining experienced staff who are often earning less than
their counterparts in the private sector. Mr Lynton Barker, the partner at
accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand responsible for advising companies
preparing to bid for Whitehall services, said that in cost calculations for
a five-year contract overheads and technology would be at least as important
as labour.
There remains one clear reason the regulations do matter. Failure to apply
them could expose the government and contractors to claims for compensation.
Already unions are preparing retrospective claims on behalf of members who,
they say, suffered losses as a result of earlier rounds of contracting out.

UNIT TRUST funds under management rose to a record Pounds 61.95bn in
November, the Unit Trust Association says today, John Authers writes.
The Pounds 258m net inflow was the highest since September 1991, and may
have been boosted by savers transferring out of building societies following
last month's cut in the base rate to 7 per cent. The Building Societies
Association saw a net outflow of Pounds 184m for the same month. Cash and
fixed-interest unit trusts attracted a gross Pounds 820m.

EMPLOYEES at greenfield sites are no more motivated than workers elsewhere
and are usually poached from other employers rather than recruited from the
unemployed, says a study published today.
A survey of 67 employees at three greenfield sites found they were more
likely to say their job was 'just a means of earning a living' and that they
were less likely to 'work as hard as they could regardless of pay' compared
with views expressed in the national British Social Attitudes Survey.
Dr Helen Newell of Warwick University Business School, author of the study
published in Personnel Management Plus, says unrealistic job descriptions -
emphasising challenging work, autonomy, flexibility and training - create
inflated expectations among recruits which can lead to job dissatisfaction
and absenteeism.
The three companies surveyed were involved in brewing, textiles and
cable-making.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Labour renews jobs campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED campaign to put jobs at the top of the political agenda will be
launched early in the new year, Labour pledged yesterday.
Mr John Smith, the party leader, said: 'In 1993 Labour will campaign with
vigour and determination for an end to rising unemployment and for a
programme of national recovery based on the vital importance of investment
and training.'
At the heart of the campaign will be a demand for an emergency employment
programme to be introduced before the budget in March. The need for skilled
jobs to help rebuild the economy will also be emphasised.
The party's call for action to create jobs in the construction industry and
to improve and expand training programmes will come against a background of
continuing rises in the jobless numbers. The TUC expects unemployment to
rise by about 50,000 a month over the next three months, reaching 3m in
January or February.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, gave a taste of the type
of Westminster campaigning that ministers can expect. He published a list of
the increases in unemployment over the past two years in cabinet ministers'
constituencies. The total in the 20 seats has more than doubled, rising from
34,000 in November 1990 to 71,000 in November 1992.
Labour's initiative also contains a significant element of grassroots
campaigning. Material issued to local party branches this month says the key
task is to link the government's difficulties over pit closures with the
wider issues of recession and unemployment.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Meridian tones down TV contrast: The successor to TVS seeks
continuity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST memorable moment of the television franchise affair for Mr Roger
Laughton, managing director of Meridian Broadcasting, was the signing of a
Pounds 7.5m deal to buy TVS's studio headquarters in Southampton, including
the desk of Mr James Gatward, former TVS chief executive.
Meridian takes over from TVS on Friday and Mr Laughton said: 'The deal meant
we could plan an orderly handover between TVS and Meridian - including a
commitment to employ at least 150 TVS staff.'
Meridian took over all TVS's assets, including its local film library.
The lack of acrimony between the winner, which bid Pounds 36.5m a year, and
the loser, which was judged to have over-bid with Pounds 59.75m, has helped
produce a feeling of continuity between old and new.
TVS happily pocketed about Pounds 1m from Meridian for advertising the
imminent arrival of its successor.
Mr Laughton, who worked at the BBC for 25 years, said he wanted to build on
the strength of the ITV network by not changing too many things at once. The
Meridian schedule next month will not look very different from this month's
TVS schedule.
Coast to Coast, the TVS regional news programme, will give way to Meridian
Tonight and a third news region which covers the Thames Valley will be
added, but three of the six presenters are survivors from TVS.
Country Ways, the popular regional countryside series, will continue.
The real changes will be behind the camera.
Meridian's controlling shareholder is MAI, the financial and media services
group. Meridian is a publisher broadcaster, commissioning almost all
programmes apart from news from independent producers, though it will sell
its own advertising air time.
It will have a staff of fewer than 400 people, compared with about 800 at
TVS before the redundancies began.
SelectTV will be the sole supplier of comedy and comedy drama, including one
of Meridian's first big shows for the ITV network - Full Stretch, a six-part
comedy drama series by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais starting on January
5.
Local programmes will include The Pier, a regional arts programme,
Ambulance, a seven-part series on the region's busiest ambulance station,
and Three Minutes, a daily slot giving the public a chance to air its views.
Lord Hollick, the Labour peer and chief executive of MAI, which has invested
Pounds 30m in the venture, believes that in spite of the Pounds 36.5m bid
and the recession, Meridian will contribute to group profit in 1993 - 4.
Lord Hollick said: 'If we can demonstrate that Meridian can deliver the
right product at the right price then we can possibly say with confidence we
believe this model (publisher broadcaster) will work elsewhere.'

FT  30 DEC 92 / Businesses show rise in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence recovered sharply between October and December but a
further cut in interest rates is needed to pull the economy out of
recession, according to the Institute of Directors.
The institute's latest two-monthly survey found that the proportion of
business leaders who were more optimistic about the economy compared with
six months ago increased to 38 per cent last month from 10 per cent in
October. There was an especially strong rise of confidence in the Midlands,
where half of directors were more optimistic.
The proportion of directors who were less confident fell from 67 per cent to
36 per cent, making a positive balance of those more optimistic over those
less optimistic for the first time since June.
The institute polled 327 directors, more than half of whom were managing
directors or chairmen, between November 26 and December 11. It found that
all industrial sectors showed increased optimism about the economy compared
with six months before. Directors were also more upbeat about profits.
Although employment prospects remain gloomy, directors from all sizes of
company appeared to believe that the worst of the job losses are over.
The proportion of directors who were more optimistic about the prospects for
their own companies compared with six months ago was 48 per cent against 37
per cent in October. The proportion of directors who were less optimistic
about their own companies fell to 24 per cent from 36 per cent. In the
Midlands 53 per cent said they were more hopeful about their own company's
prospects.
These upbeat assessments were reflected in improved business volumes. In
December 39 per cent said their business volume - turnover minus all
bought-in goods and services excluding labour - had risen in the previous
six months compared with the same period of 1991 while 35 per cent reported
a fall.
In October the proportions were reversed with 34 per cent reporting a rise
and 39 per cent a decline.
Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, warned that business
confidence, although improved, was only back at the level of a year ago.
'While the foundations for recovery are in place, we do not yet have the
economic conditions to pull out of recession,' he said.
'To build on those foundations, the chancellor should announce a further cut
in interest rates and continue the steady and sustained downward movement in
steps which would avoid destabilisation of the currency.'

THE POLITICAL divide is no longer between Labour and Conservative but
between those who want to modernise and those who want stagnation, Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said in his new year message.
The Liberal Democrats are confident that they can play a leading part in
discussions on social issues, even though they are most unlikely to
volunteer their views to the social justice commission which Labour set up
earlier this month to review taxation and benefits.
Senior Liberal Democrats believe that they are better placed than Labour to
claim from the Conservatives the role of being the 'party of opportunity'.
Mr Ashdown said social security should be 'a route to freedom, not a
tramline to dependency', and taxation should create 'opportunities for
achievement, not disincentives to success'.
He returned to the theme of constitutional reform, which played so large a
part in the Liberal Democrats' election campaign. He said British politics
caused a deep sense of anger and hopelessness in people because of the
antiquated institutions of the political system itself, as well as the
mistakes of politicians.
He said Britain was governed 'by people and institutions who have grown
complacent with power, out of touch with the realities in their country'.

LOCKHEED, one of the largest US defence contractors, is joining forces with
Khrunichev Enterprise, the Russian aerospace company, in a commercial space
venture which will focus on the marketing of Khrunichev's Proton launch
vehicle.
Under the deal, the two companies have set up a joint venture entity, called
Lockheed-Khrunichev International (LKI). This will act as the marketing arm
worldwide for the Proton launch vehicles and future derivative products. The
financial details of the joint venture arrangement were not disclosed.
The companies said that the formation of LKI followed months of talks on
potential co-operative business ventures, and that the US Department of
State had provided an initial authorisation for the commercial space
venture. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has also
approved the link-up between the two companies.
Commenting on the joint venture, Mr Dan Tellep, Lockheed chairman, said that
it should prove 'a highly positive and forward-looking arrangement' that
would benefit both sides. The Proton rockets are expected to compete
strongly with European launch vehicles, notably the launch business of
Arianespace, the French consortium.
Lockheed, head-quartered in Calabasas, California, is a broadly-based
defence company but its missiles and space company division is involved in
the design and production of space systems technology, electronic systems
and satellites.
Yesterday, the US company's shares closed at Dollars 56 5/8 , down Dollars 1
1/4 .

FT  30 DEC 92 / China turns screw on France over fighter sales to Taiwan

FRANCE yesterday expressed regret at reports that China has banned French
companies from a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) subway project in the southern
city of Guangzhou in protest against a reported sale of French fighter
aircraft to Taiwan.
Li Ziliu, mayor of Guangzhou, yesterday told the Wen Wei Po newspaper that
his city would 'cancel all co-operation with France including plans to
purchase key equipment' and would prohibit French companies tendering for
subway contracts.
The threatened ban comes when Sino-French relations are under strain because
of reports of the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Taiwan. The
Chinese last week ordered the closure of the French consulate in Guangzhou.
The official Xinhua newsagency said in yesterday's People's Daily that the
Mirage sale 'wantonly trampled on the established norms of international
relations'.
Xinhua warned that 'the French government's determination to serve its own
parochial interests will force it to eat bitter fruit'. This is the toughest
diplomatic action taken by China in years and could seriously damage French
business interests in the south, the fastest growing Chinese region and one
of the fastest in the world.
The chief casualty of yesterday's threatened ban would be GEC-Alsthom, the
engineering group owned by the UK's GEC and France's Alcatel Alsthom, which
had hoped to win a Dollars 300m contract to supply rolling stock and
telecommunications equipment to the subway.
GEC-Alsthom declined to comment other than to stress that it had 'not
received official notification' of the ban. The French government said it
'regretted anything which would affect co-operation' with China.
The French have made strenuous efforts to forge commercial links with China.
French exports to China were worth FFr6.3bn (Pounds 760m) in the first 11
months of this year, against Chinese imports to France of FFr17.2bn. But
French companies have won substantial contracts in China. Alcatel Alsthom is
currently also involved in the Daya Bay nuclear power project with the EdF
electricity group and Framatome, the nuclear reactor concern.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Big savings spur Start 2 N-arms meltdown: The deal to cut
18,000 warheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Start 2 treaty is the latest and largest step in almost 30 years of arms
talks between Washington and Moscow.
The cuts it promises should bring the strength of the nuclear forces back to
levels not seen in the US since the early 1960s, and in Russia since the
mid-1970s.
Under its terms, almost three- quarters of the strategic nuclear warheads
the two countries possessed in 1990 will be removed by 2003. If the US helps
Russia pay for their demolition the deadline will be three years earlier.
Among them are the most destructive weapons ever devised: the land-based
multiple warhead missiles. These are single missiles with many separate
nuclear warheads that detach from the launcher to be guided on to different
targets.
There are also cuts in missiles launched from submarines, considered
essential in the effort to counter the threat of a pre-emptive strike, and
bombs carried by aircraft, still a main pillar of nuclear strategy in the
US.
The treaty means Russia should end up with about 3,000 strategic nuclear
warheads and the US about 3,500 by early next century. Most will be carried
by submarines. This compares with 1990 figures of 12,646 US warheads and
11,012 Russian. Most Russian warheads are currently in land-based missiles.
These two stocks of strategic weapons will form virtually all the world's
nuclear stockpile because tactical nuclear weapons, not part of Start, are
set to be abandoned after a series of unilateral disarmament gestures made
by Washington and Moscow in late 1991 and early 1992.
The vast arsenals in the former Soviet states of Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Ukraine, not part of Start 2, are supposed to be destroyed as part of the
first Start treaty signed last year. Without these cuts, the three countries
would have as many warheads as either Russia or the US in a post-Start 2
world.
The other significant nuclear powers, France, China and the UK, have yet to
signal their intentions. In the past the UK and France have scaled back
nuclear procurement programmes in the wake of treaties between Washington
and Moscow.
Unlike the previous treaties, Start 2 was completed in record time, little
more than six months from the initialling of a draft in Washington by
Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin. Strategic arms limitations talks
(Salt 1 and Salt 2) and Start 1 each took nearer a decade to complete.
Much of that six months was taken up with solving three main questions:
could Russia keep some silos for its SS-18s, its largest missile, or how
much should they be made smaller; to what extent could Russian SS-19
missiles be modified for single warhead use; and how easy should it be for
US B1 bombers designed to carry conventional bombs to be modified to carry
nuclear payloads.
Driving the negotiators on was the prospect of massive cost savings. The
cuts come at an opportune moment for governments struggling to contain
spending when revenues are falling as a result of the world's economic
slowdown.
Some savings will be available to them quickly as procurement and
modernisation programmes are cut.
However, there will be costs incurred too as the task of disposing of almost
18,000 nuclear warheads and their launch systems gets underway.
There are also likely to be job losses in some labour intensive parts of
defence industry such as ship and submarine construction. In the UK, for
example, pressure could be renewed to trim the Pounds 10bn Trident submarine
programme.
Defence contractors in conventional arms are unlikely to benefit from the
cash liberated by the contraction in nuclear forces, according to Mr Jack
Mendelsohn, a former member of US Salt and Start delegations, now deputy
director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association.
US spending on strategic nuclear weapons has in the past accounted for
between 14 and 18 per cent of the Department of Defence budget. Cutting this
in half would be a simple method for the incoming administration of
president-elect Bill Clinton to cut costs.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Arms accords offer Bush a dignified exit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush can leave office next month with three important arms
reduction treaties under his belt after tying up the loose ends of the Start
2 nuclear missile cuts he agreed with President Boris Yeltsin last June.
The pact, coming on the heel's of last year's Start 1 and of the 1990 treaty
reducing conventional forces in Europe, will certainly provide a more
triumphant tone to the final days of the Bush presidency than seemed likely
after Mr Bush's decision to pardon Mr Casper Weinberger, the former defence
secretary, and others involved in the Iran-Contra scandal.
'I think it's about the best gift we could have during this Christmas
season,' commented Congressman Lee Hamilton, who is about to take over as
chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee.
'It is good news that these two powers will be reducing sharply their
warheads and it certainly gives a good send-off for President Bush as he
leaves the presidency.'
While the details of the Start 2 agreement remained to be settled, Mr Bush
had come in for some criticism for failing to seize the chance to clinch
deep cuts in the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union.
Some have even criticised the Start 2 pact for offering too many
opportunities for 'breakout', where one power starts a rapid rearmament
programme with the aim of securing a nuclear advantage.
This is because both Start treaties will allow some 'down-loading' to
convert multiple warhead missiles into single warhead missiles, and so
present the possibility of 'uploading' by putting extra warheads back on.
Most arms control specialists, however, argue that the risk of break-out is
exaggerated: it would take a considerable time, can be monitored and would
have little effect against weapons that can survive an attack and threaten
retaliation, such as submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).
The agreement leaves open the question of where disarmament efforts should
now be focused.
A hypothetical Start 3 agreement could, according to Mr Ronald Lehman,
director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, aim for the
elimination of all intercontinental ballistic missiles, the 'Greenpeace
option' of eliminating all SLBMs, or the 'Reykjavik option' of eliminating
both categories of weapon.
But participants in a recent conference at Georgetown University's Institute
for the Study of Diplomacy warned that if the US pursues disarmament through
the Start framework, it could slow down the political changes it wants in
Russia, by strengthening the hand of Russian hardliners. The conference
urged a broader approach to curbing the threat of nuclear proliferation.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Yeltsin faces powerful opposition to treaty at home

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE greatest problem for Russia will not be for President Boris Yeltsin to
come to an agreement with President George Bush but to push the deal through
possible domestic opposition and then to implement it.
Despite recently being accused by one opposition leader of falling into the
'Gorbachev habit' of relying on foreign successes to boost his domestic
popularity, President Yeltsin can still count on a measure of public support
for signing a treaty which will abolish the world's most threatening class
of nuclear weapons.
Mr Andrei Kortunov, a defence analyst at the United States and Canada
Institute, said however that Start 2 faced a difficult passage through the
Russian parliament, whose powerful chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, had
already voiced reservations about the treaty.
Mr Kortunov also foresaw objections within Russia's still mighty defence
industry circles, including highly-placed supporters such as Mr Yuri Skokov,
who now heads a special presidential body on Russia's foreign relations.
'It will be a question of bargain-ing - what will they get in exchange (for
endorsing the treaty),' he said.
'They will probably want major investment (by the Russian government) in the
modernisation of the remaining strategic arsenal.'
It was also no surprise that the schedule for implementing the Start 2
treaty is to be tied to the availability of foreign assistance for
implementing it. The silos containing the land-based missiles with multiple
warheads are concentrated mainly in Siberia and just west of the Ural
mountains, as well as near Russia's border with Ukraine.
A foreign ministry official said the main bottleneck in dismantling nuclear
missiles under agreements reached so far was the storage of nuclear
materials extracted from the warheads.
He said US and Russian representatives negotiating the use of Dollars 400m
(Pounds 267m) credit approved by the US Congress had agreed on the design of
a special storage facility to be built in Russia, but now had to agree on
the details, including the location. 'We will have to convince a local
community to accept such a facility. The population is (environmentally)
active nowadays - everybody says 'not in my backyard'.'
He also said that talks would have to start with the Ukraine to iron out
Ukrainian complaints in implementing its obligations under the Start 1
treaty.
Only yesterday a senior Ukrainian official told reporters that his republic
needed ten times the amount promised by the US to help it get rid of its
long-range missiles - and said that Russia should pitch in too.

FT  30 DEC 92 / US trade groups puzzled by selection of Kantor
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE election of Governor Bill Clinton to the presidency set off a gunfight
among candidates for the US trade representative's job. When the smoke
cleared, the victor was Mr Mickey Kantor, an able, energetic long-time
political adviser to the Democratic candidate, chairman of the Clinton
campaign and a novice in the international trade arena.
The nomination was greeted with dismay by many in the US business community,
who had hoped to get a Uruguay Round deal on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade done quickly and the increasingly controversial North
American Free Trade Agreement through Congress.
Mr Kantor's views on trade - if indeed he has any at all - are as undefined
as those of the president-elect.
In fact, when he was nominated at a press conference last week, the
Californian lawyer was perhaps the only cabinet nominee to say nothing at
all about the job he would hold if confirmed by Congress.
It fell to Mr Clinton to explain that American economic security now depends
on trade, but where there is opportunity there are also 'serious risks' to
businesses, workers and the environment.
The trade representative must ensure that America's trading partners 'play
fair'.
Clearly the job is a reward to Mr Clinton's old friend, who moved his family
to Little Rock during the campaign.
With Mr Clinton intent on choosing an ethnically and gender-correct cabinet,
Mr Kantor - as a white male - could count himself fortunate to get a job.
Opponents of both the Gatt deal and Nafta, on the left of the Democratic
party, had hoped for a trade representative more ideologically attuned to
their concerns about lost manufacturing jobs and the environment. Many farm
groups want a total unravelling of the agriculture liberalisation deal so
painfully negotiated by the US and EC this month.
They were pleased with the nomination of Mr Mike Espy, a young black
Mississippi congressman as US agriculture secretary, who they believe will
give them access to decision-making.
In Mr Kantor, however, they have an enigma. Mr Clinton himself speaks in
favour of free trade but campaign operatives had a long list of changes they
wanted in the Uruguay Round negotiating text and an apparent conviction that
the 107 other Gatt members would be delighted to accommodate US views.
Perhaps Mr Kantor will bring some new thinking to drive a path through the
minefield of competing interests in Geneva and in Congress. Some of the most
able trade representatives have been political pros - among them former
Russian ambassador Mr Robert Strauss.
Mr Kantor will follow another lawyer from California, Mrs Carla Hills. She,
too, knew little about the intricacies of trade. He can be expected to also
put in long gruelling hours to learn his brief.
If he is untried as a trade negotiator, he did prove his mettle in another
sphere. It was he who apparently out-negotiated Mr James Baker, the former
secretary of state, in making arrangements for the televised campaign debate
which paved the way for Mr Clinton's election victory.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Brazil's beached playboy bows out: Collor fails to evade
impeachment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOTE by Brazil's Senate last night to press on with the impeachment of
President Fernando Collor de Mello, following hard on the heels of his
resignation, brings to an end the Dallas-style saga of greed and family
feuding that has paralysed the world's ninth largest economy.
Mr Collor, Brazil's first directly elected president for 30 years, had been
suspended from office since September when Congress voted to authorise his
impeachment over corruption charges brought to light by Mr Collor's jealous
younger brother.
Originally hoping to enter the history books for his 'modernisation
revolution', Mr Collor now joins the sorry ranks of Brazilian presidents
who, through suicide, coup, or death, have failed to complete their mandates
 -only one civilian president in the last 67 years had lasted a full term.
But his attempt at avoiding the humiliation of becoming the world's first
impeached president by resigning on the day of his judgment failed, and with
it his last hopes disappeared of being able to salvage what once seemed the
most promising political career in Latin America.
That had seemed like a long shot. Mr Collor still faces criminal charges
and, although Brazilians do not expect high standards of morality from
politicians they are deeply resentful that while he was preaching austerity
amid the worst recession in a decade he was arranging a Dollars 2.5m
landscaping of his gardens, apparently on a pre-tax salary of around Dollars
22,000 but allegedly paid for with the proceeds of a multi-million dollar
kickback scheme.
Now spending his days reading books on mind control in a shabby library
surrounded by mementoes from the presidency, Mr Collor is left to
contemplate his folly. Only two years ago he seemed to have everything going
for him. A political unknown from Alagoas, one of Brazil's most backward
north-eastern states, he won the 1989 elections without any party backing on
the banner of modernisation and clean government.
The glamorous former playboy quickly caught world attention with his love of
dangerous sports, free market rhetoric and daredevil acts such as freezing
80 per cent of the nation's bank accounts on his first day in office.
Never afraid to tackle vested interests, Mr Collor did introduce important
changes. He began opening up one of the world's most protected economies,
started privatising state companies and introduced words such as
productivity, competitiveness and quality into the businessman's lexicon.
But behind the modern facade, the Mont Blanc pens and Hermes ties, his ways
of working were pure Alagoas. His alleged front man was said to be busy
accepting kickbacks from the very businessmen Mr Collor was attacking, and
so arrogant were those running the scam they kept details on computer disk.
Mr Collor's two economic plans failed to reduce inflation and his imperial
style meant no one was sorry to see him under fire.
It must now be asked whether his demise spells the end of the modernisation
programme. His successor, Mr Itamar Franco, has already suspended the
privatisation programme. Mr Alexandre de Barros, a Brasilia-based risk
consultant, warns: 'These guys are disorganising the economy at a fantastic
rate. All the bad signs are there but people just don't want to believe
them.'
With monthly inflation now pushing 30 per cent, the economy is expected to
worsen. In the meantime Mr Collor, who has continually denied the charges,
will be watching and waiting, portraying himself as a victim of the
interests he challenged and taking advantage of the short memories of
Brazilians in hoping that by the next elections in 1994 he will be regarded
as a hero.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in consumer confidence and a strong increase in home sales indicated
the US economic recovery is gathering momentum, writes Michael Prowse in
Washington.
Consumer confidence rose almost 13 points to 78.3 this month, according to
an index compiled by the Conference Board, a New York business analysis
group. The gain was bigger than Wall Street expected and took confidence to
its highest level since the surge in consumer sentiment following the end of
the Gulf war in spring last year.
Sales of existing homes rose 5.8 per cent between October and November to
their highest level in nearly six years - a sign that big cuts in interest
rates this year are reviving the housing market. The November increase
followed a revised 10.3 per cent jump in October and left sales 19 per cent
higher than in the same period last year.
Consumer confidence has risen nearly 24 points in the past two months.
However, the rise in the index, mainly reflected a sharp increase in a
sub-index measuring 'expectations', which rose from 70.7 in October to 104.5
last month.
Yesterday's figures follow encouraging reports from many retailers who have
reported the best Christmas sales for four years.

THE YUGOSLAV parliament yesterday passed a motion of no confidence in Mr
Milan Panic, the moderate federal prime minister, thwarting the challenge of
the Serbian-American millionaire to the country's most powerful political
figure, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
The parliament voted to allow Mr Radoje Kontic, a deputy prime minister, to
lead the caretaker government. Mr Panic said he will remain in Yugoslavia to
lead opposition to the new government.
Both houses of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the motion introduced by
the extreme nationalist Serbian Radical party.
The result was in contrast to a vote in November when delegates to the upper
house from the republic of Montenegro, who enjoy parity with delegates from
Serbia, saved Mr Panic's premiership by defeating a similar motion.
The Radicals' leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, named as a suspected war criminal
by foreign governments and human-rights watchdogs, had called for Mr Panic
to be barred from leading a caretaker government which would rule until the
newly elected parliament is seated in early 1993.
In last week's fraud-marred elections, Mr Milosevic heavily defeated Mr
Panic.
Yesterday the US State Department said elections in Serbia and its ally
Montenegro 'failed to meet international standards for a free and fair
democratic process.'
It said Mr Milosevic's ruling party abused its position. Voter lists were
manipulated so many eligible voters were excluded from voting, ballot boxes
were not handled properly and voters were said to have been intimidated.
Reuter adds from Sarajevo: Some 10,000 Moslem fighters have gathered on a
strategic hill overlooking Sarajevo amid rumours of an imminent Moslem
assault to break the Serb siege of the Bosnian capital.
However, Mr Mik Magnusson of the UN Protection Forces (Unprofor) in Sarajevo
said Unprofor troops had not been placed on any kind of alert as a result of
the build-up.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Moi resentful as Kenyans vote: Polling stations overwhelmed
as voters queue for hours

<TEXT>
IN an isolated mountain retreat deep in Kenya's Rift Valley, President
Daniel arap Moi let off steam.
Standing in the shady gardens of the Kabernet Hotel, Mr Moi was perhaps
recovering from a nasty new experience: voting in a multiparty election
clearly still anathema to him.
The 68 year-old president painted himself as an isolated and helpless victim
of hostile western governments.
'I have been mistreated by . . . the western world purporting to be fighting
for democracy when they have been fighting against me.'
'Violence has been introduced. People are talking about civil war,' he said.
Thumping his fist into his palm the president, who has ruled Kenya
autocratically for 14 years, said violence had erupted because Kenya had not
been allowed to develop its democracy naturally. Instead it had been forced
into rapid change by foreign governments who kept telling him 'Do This. Do
that. Do this.'
Mr Moi, speaking to western reporters for the first time in 10 months, made
his bitter attack shortly after casting his vote. He voted shortly after
dawn in his Baringo Central constituency in the heart of the mountains and
gorges of the Rift Valley, home to Mr Moi's Kalenjin tribe.
Mr Moi is unopposed in Baringo Central, as are 14 other candidates of the
ruling party, Kanu, in other constituencies in the Rift valley, Kanu's
heartland and a province still run like a medieval fiefdom. At a primary
school polling station, queues of voters formed silently on a scrubbed
playing field. Inside voters were only issued one ballot paper with the
names of the eight presidential candidates.
Mr Kegan Chebii, a civil servant, said: 'Opposition parties did not come
here. They don't have any supporters. We are Kanu by blood.'
Voting was calm in Baringo Central but in some parts of the country polling
was marred by inefficiency and chaotic organisation. National Electoral
Commission (NEC) Chairman Zaccheous Chesoni said there was widespread
irregularities in mainly opposition areas and was investigating reports of
rigging.
In the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, a humid industrial town on the
shores of Lake Victoria, angry supporters of Ford-Kenya alleged Kanu agents
had been distributing money inside the polling station. A number of stations
opened late and long queues of voters waited impatiently.
In the tense central town of Nakuru election observers said there was a
shortage of ballot papers. At another urban polling centre voters allegedly
bussed in by Kanu had to be escorted out after an unruly crowd threatened to
stone them.
Despite the confusion many voters were determined to vote. In Kikuyu, Mr
David Kariuki looked back at the seemingly interminable queue that had been
growing since dawn. How long had he been waiting? Four hours, perhaps, or
possibly five? 'No, 26 years,' chuckled the middle-aged farmer.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Germany faces business gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY two sectors in the entire German economy - power engineering and waste
disposal - are more optimistic about the prospects for 1993 than they were
one year ago.
There has been a dramatic worsening in the mood in export-oriented sectors,
including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor manufacturing and
electronics.
More than half the leading sectors of trade and industry expect a drop in
production or turnover during the year, and 29 out of 41 sectors expect to
reduce their labour forces.
Those are the main conclusions of the annual year-end survey of business
opinion carried out by the Institute for the German economy (IW) in Cologne,
the economic research arm of the German industry federation (BDI).
They coincide with a grim warning by the German employers' association that
the number of fully or partially unemployed people in the united Germany
could reach 5.5m by the end of 1993, without a drastic change in the wage
demands of trade unions.
The same message comes from the German chambers of trade and industry
(DIHT), which say the real crisis for the economy is high domestic costs,
not lack of demand.
The IW survey of 41 sectors of trade and industry singles out the
traditional export sectors of the economy as the gloomiest, both because of
their declining price-competitiveness, and the weak level of investment
spending in the rest of the world.
It concludes that 22 of the 41 sectors expect a fall in turnover, with just
nine expecting a rise. The only sector expecting a 'significant' rise is
waste disposal, due to new stricter waste disposal regulations.
The power engineering industry is expecting some improvement thanks to
orders from eastern Germany, and the other sectors are mostly affected by
the relative buoyancy of the construction industry - again thanks to
publicly-financed orders from the east.
The other exceptions to a totally gloomy economic outlook are the insurance
and tourism industries.
German author Gunther Grass yesterday resigned from the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) in protest at their co-operation with the government in
limiting political asylum rights for foreigners.
The 65-year-old author of 'The Tin Drum' has accused the SPD of 'hypocrisy
and viciousness' for bowing to government demands for strict limits to
liberal asylum rights in the constitution.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has issued Britain's toughest warning
yet to the Serbs of possible military action to end their 'bloody-minded
cruelty'. The change of tone, in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph,
represents a shift in stance. Mr Hurd said he still distrusted military
action as a way to force a settlement but the Serbs had brought even those
with that view 'to the point where we can imagine armed action against them
to prevent a general Balkan war'.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Fall in chip sales to Japan spurs trade fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government announced yesterday that the foreign share of the
country's semiconductor market declined from 16 per cent to 15.9 per cent
during the third quarter, increasing the probability of renewed trade
friction with the US.
Under a US-Japan semiconductor pact, Tokyo agreed to a target of 20 per cent
foreign share by the end of this year, but the decline has put this goal out
of reach and means that chips may be the first item on the trade agenda of
President-elect Bill Clinton.
After the foreign share surged from 14.6 per cent to 16 per cent during the
second quarter, the Japanese government hoped the year-end figure would be
close to 20 per cent, while the US industry applauded the increase as a
'step in the right direction'.
A Japanese electronics company official suggested that the sharp fall in
profits at most electronics makers is behind the decline. These companies
have begun using more of their own chips and encouraging long-time customers
to increase their purchases, limiting opportunities for foreign chips.
The US government has warned that it will take 'additional actions, as
necessary, to fulfil' the chip agreement, which superseded a pact signed in
1986 and was accepted by Japan to placate the politically-influential US
semiconductor industry.
Japan has its own formula for calculating market share, which includes chips
made by Japanese companies, but sold under foreign brands, and chips shipped
by US producers to subsidiaries in Japan. Under that formula, generally
ignored by the US, foreign share fell to 17.7 per cent from 17.9 per cent
during the third quarter.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said it hoped 'the
share of foreign chips will rise' in the final quarter.

Italy's budget, treasury and transport ministers' approval clears the way

The Italian railroad consortium TAV Spa is the flagship of FS Spa, the new

FT  30 DEC 92 / Lebanon rejects joint aid for deportees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lebanese authorities yesterday rejected an Israeli proposal that both
governments should simultaneously allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to
the 415 expelled Palestinians who have been stranded in south Lebanon for
the last 12 days.
Mr Rafif al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, dismissed a suggestion from
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, his Israeli counterpart, that medical supplies be
forwarded from Israel to the deportees' camp in no-man's land between
Israeli and Lebanese forces, while food and fresh water was delivered from
Lebanese-controlled territory.
He then refused to allow Mr James Jonah, a UN undersecretary general, to
visit the deportees, alleged by Israel to be Islamic fundamentalist
militants. 'Jonah is wasting his time with us. This is a wasted trip. Our
position is firm,' Mr Hariri said.
Mr Jonah was sent to the region by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, following the adoption of Security Council resolution 799
calling for the return of the deportees to the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Lebanon, backed by Syria and other Arab states, says Israel should
implement the resolution immediately.
Israel confirmed yesterday that it was willing to take back 10 men whom it
said were deported mistakenly. But the army said they would be put on trial
when they returned. Mr Rabin, who will see Mr Jonah for the second time this
week in Jerusalem today, has refused to consider reversing the deportations.
Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said the deportations were successful
because they had hit at extremists opposed to Middle East peace talks,
without destroying the talks themselves. But he admitted the issue had
caused some negative effects - including the postponment until February of a
visit by a European Community delegation to discuss closer EC-Israeli
economic co-operation.
The Israeli finance ministry is to utilise Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7m) in US
loan guarantees granted earlier this year to aid the absorption immigrants
from the former Soviet Union. This would start next March, when Israel would
seek to borrow Dollars 1bn backed by the guarantees.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Dollar's strength forces sterling under Dollars 1.50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued its strong end-of-year rally on foreign exchanges
yesterday, rising to its highest level against the D-Mark since the summer
and pushing sterling below Dollars 1.50 for the first time this year.
The US currency reached a high of DM1.6235, boosted by better-than-expected
consumer confidence data in the US, increasing expectations that the US is
set for strong growth in 1993. The US consumer confidence index rose to 78.3
per cent this month from a revised 65.6 per cent in November.
The dollar's surge, which faded towards the end of European trading, was
helped by a growing belief in financial markets that Germany may cut
official rates early next year, triggering a Europe-wide relaxation of
monetary policy.
This speculation - with no support from the Bundesbank - pushed the pound
down to a low of Dollars 1.4988, a level last seen in January 1987. The
dollar closed in London at DM1.614, more than a pfennig up on the day.
Sterling closed at Dollars 1.5135, down nearly two cents on the day.
In New York, the dollar finished at DM1.6138, while sterling was trading at
Dollars 1.5082. In Tokyo this morning the dollar opened at DM1.61385 and
sterling was quoted at Dollars 1.507.
The London stock market reached a record closing high, helped by hopes of
lower UK interest rates and reports that the winter sales had started well.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose 20.3 to 2,847.8. The broader
FT-SE Actuaries 350 index also closed at a record at 1,388.9, up 9.1.
Activity was well below the recent average.
On Wall Street, a late round of computer-driven sell programmes pushed
prices sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.42 to
3,310.84, after registering an 18-point gain at one stage.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Bank of Spain to control monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain will take control of the country's monetary policy under a
draft statute of autonomy - modelled on that of the German Bundesbank -
approved by the cabinet yesterday. It will go before parliament early in the
new year.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, who has been determined to
establish the central bank's autonomy before next year's general election,
said the draft bill reflected Spain's commitment to the 'philosophy of
Maastricht'.
By ensuring the autonomy of the central bank, Spain was meeting an important
condition for its future presence in the European Community's planned
economic and monetary union at the end of the decade.
The development was hailed by analysts as a vital structural change that
would force the government to control its spending and that should ensure a
low and stable rate of inflation.
'We have taken a very important step forward on the road to Emu,' said Mr
Jaime de Pinies, head of research at Banco Santander de Negocios. 'We can
probably trust in a firmer peseta in the future.'
The government's decision to introduce such legislation well ahead of the
schedule laid down last year at Maastricht was viewed as a significant
gesture that provided a much-needed boost to Spain's Emu convergence plan.
In the course of this year the government has failed to meet the convergence
targets it had set itself on reducing the public deficit, and the peseta has
undergone two devaluations in order to remain within the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.
Under the draft legislation the Bank of Spain is alone empowered with
'defining' monetary policy, and the bill states that the 'prime end' of such
a policy is to 'ensure price stability'. Until now monetary policy has been
defined by the government and executed by the Bank of Spain.
Echoing the Bundesbank's own statutes, the Bank of Spain will in future
'support the government's general economic policy' as long as such support
is 'not in detriment' of price stability.
Additionally the Bank of Spain is expressly forbidden from funding
government deficits. Under the current system the treasury can temporarily
borrow from the bank to cover spending overshoots although all such loans
have to be repaid to the bank within the fiscal year.
Earlier this year direct government borrowing from the Bank of Spain to
cover emergency expenditure items was independently reckoned to have been
more than Pta1,000bn (Pounds 5.7bn).
The legislation also sets a six-year single term for the governor of the
Bank of Spain, instead of the current four years renewable, and states that
the governor, who is named by the government, will choose his deputy instead
of the Economy Ministry as at present. The present governor is Mr Luis Angel
Rojo, who is likely to continue in the post.

FT  30 DEC 92 / US and Russia agree N-cuts: Drastic reductions in nuclear
arsenals - Deal may be signed this weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND RUSSIAN foreign ministers yesterday agreed to a strategic arms
limitation deal that would cut the number of nuclear weapons by almost three
quarters within a decade.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
his Russian counterpart, said after a meeting in Geneva that they would take
their draft of the treaty known as Start 2 to presidents George Bush and
Boris Yeltsin for final approval.
The cuts that should follow would leave the world with its smallest nuclear
arsenal since the early 1960s.
Mr Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, last night said Mr Bush and
Mr Yeltsin would issue a joint statement today and were likely to sign the
treaty on January 2 or 3. Earlier, he said the summit was likely to be held
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Mr Bush is already due to travel to Somalia to spend New Year's Eve with US
troops. He will then fly on to Saudi Arabia and is expected to meet King
Fahd on Friday.
Mr Eagleburger, however, left open the possibility of further negotiations
to fine-tune the agreement. 'It's up to the presidents to look at the
documents and see if we've made sufficient progress to sign an agreement,'
he said. 'If there are changes they would want to suggest, obviously, we'd
have to come back together again.'
The negotiations over the wording of Start 2 were completed in record time,
just six months after presidents Bush and Yeltsin agreed a draft at their
summit in Washington.
Nevertheless, the final agreement was held up by disagreements on the size
of Russian missile silos, the convertibility of multiple-warhead missiles to
single-warhead use and the flexibility of US bombers to carry nuclear or
conventional payloads.
The details of how these differences were resolved were not revealed
yesterday.
In Washington, congressional leaders welcomed the news of Start 2's apparent
completion. 'This is a great gift to the nation and to the world,' said Mr
Lee Hamilton, who is about to take over as chairman of the House of
Representatives foreign affairs committee.
An announcement from US officials on when and where a summit meeting between
Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin might take place was expected after Mr Eagleburger
returned to Washington late yesterday. In the meantime, White House planning
for a trip to Sochi was going ahead.
In Russia, Mr Yeltsin may yet face domestic opposition from politicians and
the military over the nuclear weapons accord.
Other countries which were once part of the Soviet Union that also have
nuclear weapons may also delay the implementation of Start 2. Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Belarus should disarm under the Start 1 treaty signed last
year between Washington and Moscow, but only Kazakhstan has ratified Start
1.
Alison Smith writes: In London, the Foreign Office welcomed the prospect of
defining in treaty form the agreement on further reductions in strategic
arsenals. The progress in the Start talks, however, brought renewed
opposition pressure on the government not to increase the number of nuclear
warheads when the Trident submarine is deployed in the mid-1990s.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Conservative chairman of the cross-party defence
committee of MPs, welcomed the progress made but sounded a note of caution
as he pointed out that Ukraine had neither taken part in the talks nor
agreed to surrender its nuclear armaments to Russia.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Brussels scuppers VAT dodge on yachts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN customs officials have scuppered one of the most enterprising
offshore tax devices of the rich - the wandering yacht.
From Friday, value added tax will be levied on yachts in any European
Community country at the time of sale, under an agreement reached by finance
ministers in Brussels earlier this month.
Until now, yacht owners have been able to escape VAT by keeping them
harboured for no more than a few months a year in any one EC country.
The existing rules allow yachts temporarily held in UK waters to remain
exempt from VAT. They only become liable after six months and a day, when
they are classified as imports. Similar rules apply in other EC states.
That has led to a large avoidance industry, with British yacht owners who
live on the south coast of England keeping their boats on the French coast
and other EC residents taking advantage of favourable locations in the
Mediterranean such as Cyprus.
Now EC mariners will have to pay immediately the VAT rate applicable in the
country where they buy their boat.
Those from non-EC states will remain exempt as long as they export their
yachts to non-EC waters.
Prudent sailors will now have extra incentive to shop around for the lowest
VAT rates, which range from 14 per cent in Germany to 38 per cent on luxury
goods in Italy.
Transitional arrangements for the next six months will allow existing yachts
in EC countries to remain as temporary imports. After that, they will be
treated as imports and VAT will normally be levied.
No additional VAT will be charged if the tax has already been paid in the EC
or the boat is more than eight years old.
There will be no VAT levied in the UK if the value of the vessel is less
than Pounds 4,000.
HM Customs and Excise has set up a special unit - the Dover Customs Yacht
Team - to deal with questions arising from the new arrangements. There is
still an escape clause. Those who moor their yachts in permanently anchored
offshore tax havens such as Jersey, Gibraltar or Malta will remain exempt.

FT  30 DEC 92 / ITC willing to look at further bid for Channel 5 franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission is prepared to re-advertise the
Channel 5 franchise within months if a bidder comes forward with the
necessary money.
Earlier this month the ITC rejected a bid for the franchise by Channel Five
Holdings, a Thames Television-led consortium, mainly because of what it
called insufficient shareholder commitment to the project.
The commission said it would begin a review on what to do with the
frequencies set aside for the channel, which can reach three-quarters of the
UK population.
'If at the beginning of the review someone says 'we think we can do it and
we know where the money is coming from', then I think there is a
re-advertising job to do fairly quickly,' said Sir George Russell, ITC
chairman.
He did not rule out a reconsideration of Channel Five Holdings' original
application if there was clear evidence within a few weeks that the Pounds
175m needed for the project was in place.
'Can we do something immediately? I don't know,' Sir George added. 'If the
question is put to us, we will have to test out what the law is and what the
rules are. It is something we have never faced before.'
Thames and its consortium partner, Time Warner, the US-based media group,
are exploring the possibility of trying to raise the money within the next
three months and asking the ITC to reconsider.
The consortium's bid foundered mainly because Time Warner was only committed
to a 10 per cent stake on top of Thames's 35 per cent. A possible further 25
per cent investment by Time Warner depended on main board approval.
Other potential investors - Capital Cities/ABC and Cox, the US media
companies; Pearson, owner of the Financial Times; and Associated Newspapers,
publisher of the Daily Mail - expressed interest but not commitment.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the ITC believes it can only award a
franchise if it believes it will be viable over a 10-year period. The
commission cannot award a licence in principle and then see whether it can
be made viable before the licence is actually granted.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARMED men in ski-masks and camouflage uniforms were yesterday presented as
the Russian interior ministry's New Year gift to the people.
Major-general Mikhail Yegorov, the first deputy minister, said the men - a
few of them on display at a news conference yesterday - were part of a new
rapid deployment force set up by presidential decree to fight the mafia.
A government gift of 19,000 extra men plus helicopters, armoured vehicles
and various weapons would help local police combat ordinary crime when
necessary, he said.
General Yegorov added that the government had also provided funds for extra
judges to try cases in addition to auditors to examine crooked documents.
'The best present which law enforcers can offer is the exposure of criminal
groups and to give people the feeling they will be safe walking the streets
on New Year's Eve,' said the ministry's press officer.
A video was then shown to journalists to illustrate various cases of
corruption and organised crime uncovered around the country as a result of
the government's drive against corruption.
Gen Yegorov said about 3,000 criminal organisations, with tens of thousands
of members, were operating in Russia - many with foreign connections. Half
their revenue was spent on bribing officials. Of 1,541 criminal cases of
official corruption, 400 were linked to organised crime.
Bribe-taking had gone up 27 per cent on 1991, with large scale theft up 6.4
per cent. Three hundred officials had been sacked for violating another
presidential ban on combining government service with private business
activities.
According to the interior ministry, the most corruption is in the banking
system - which has been defrauded of billions of roubles by criminal gangs
with support from banking officials.
It was also prevalent in state organisations responsible for raw materials,
the privatisation of state property, and the conversion of military
factories to civilian uses.
The interior ministry has also uncovered a number of cases of corruption
within the military involving the illicit sale of military equipment and
within the judiciary.
Gen Yegorov said that ultimately corruption was a 'social' problem - whose
causes - such as the low pay of civil servants and law enforcers  - also
need to be addressed.

FT  30 DEC 92 / US starts crackdown on Somali gunmen
</HEADLINE>

   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US FORCES began a crackdown on gunmen in the Somali capital yesterday
seizing weapons, missiles and battlewagons 48 hours before a visit by
President George Bush, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
US Air Force aircraft dropped 100,000 leaflets on Mogadishu warning
residents that machine guns, mortars, and battlewagons would not be
tolerated on the streets.
'Anyone aiming or pointing weapons directly at CTF (Combined Task Force)
forces will be shot,' the leaflet said.
Military spokesman Colonel Fred Peck said US troops seized a large cache of
arms and missiles in north-east Mogadishu and a smaller arsenal from a
building opposite the US embassy, which Mr Bush will visit.
The actions marked the start of a clampdown by the multinational task force
on bandits in Mogadishu, where shootings, looting and mugging are still
widespread.
More evidence emerged that Somalia's warring clans engaged in a final fling
of killing and looting just before the December 9 US-led intervention in
Somalia. Diplomatic sources confirmed that a clan in the southern port of
Kismayu massacred over 100 people from another clan on the eve of the US
Marine landing in Mogadishu.
The diplomatic sources said the killings were believed to have taken place
over three nights. Mr Sean Devereux, a Unicef worker in Kismayu, recently
called the pogrom 'targeted clan killings.'
Gunmen also shot dead four Somalis working for the International Red Cross
(ICRC) and one from the relief agency Care on Monday in incidents which
highlighted continued lawlessness, officials from both agencies said.
Mr Bush is coming to Somalia primarily to meet US troops for the New Year in
what will almost certainly be his swan song as commander-in-chief of the US
military before he hands over the White House to President-elect Bill
Clinton on January 20.
The visit will last about 27 hours, half of it aboard the amphibious assault
ship Tripoli. Mr Bush will meet soldiers at bases in Mogadishu, Baidoa and
Bali Dogle and make brief stops at a relief agency field centre and a home
for orphans of Somalia's famine and war, US officials said.

FT  30 DEC 92 / AMR agrees share stake deal with Canadian Airlines

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday announced plans to
invest CDollars 246m (USDollars 192m) into a restructured Canadian Airlines,
in exchange for a 33 per cent economic interest in the loss-making carrier
and a 25 per cent voting stake.
The share stake deal comes as part of a broader agreement between AMR and
PWA, Canadian's parent company, under which Canadian has agreed to sign a
20-year services contract with AMR. This requires the Canadian airline to
buy a range of airline administrative services from American.
The services contract is designed to cut Canadian's costs, but would
probably eliminate around 1,200-1,300 jobs. AMR says the agreement should
produce revenues of Dollars 2bn over the two decades, with the first full
year generating Dollars 115m.
Canadian, which lost CDollars 105.6m after tax in the first nine months of
1992, will also tie up its frequent flier programme with American's, so that
Canadian passengers can earn credits for flights with American (and vice
versa).
Canadian's international routes, mainly to Europe and Asia, will remain
under its direct control.
AMR said that this was 'the most comprehensive package' of services it had
ever sold to another carrier.
Among the administrative functions which the Canadian carrier will buy from
AMR are accounting, data-processing and communications operations.
The deal is a key step in Canadian's restructuring. AMR will receive
convertible preferred stock, providing it with the 25 per cent voting stake
in Canadian. PWA will retain 75 per cent. The US carrier will be entitled to
designate two of the eight members of Canadian's board of directors.
However, AMR said it would not control any of Canadian's 'major strategic
business decisions'.
The deal requires both US and Canadian government approval. A tie-up between
the two carriers has been complicated by the requirement that Canadian
extract itself from the Gemini electronic reservation system, in order to
join American's Sabre system. Its attempted withdrawal has prompted
litigation.
The two airlines estimate that the deal will be finalised by autumn 1993.

FT  30 DEC 92 / Moi says west has backed Kenyan opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KABERNET, KENYA,, NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYAN president Daniel arap Moi launched an unprecedented attack on western
governments yesterday, accusing them of supporting his political opponents,
promoting tribalism and bringing the country to the brink of civil war by
forcing the pace of transition to a multi-party system.
The president was speaking shortly after casting his vote in the country's
first multi-party poll for 26 years. The day saw a heavy turnout of voters,
some queueing for several hours. Sporadic incidents of violence were
reported in some parts of the country.
Last night the national election commission said widespread irregularities
in polling had been reported in mainly opposition areas and that reports of
rigging were being investigated.
At his retreat in Kabernet, in the Rift Valley, the 68-year-old president
said the west had 'starved us for the past 12 months', referring to cuts in
aid flows.
He accused western governments of keeping silent about opposition threats of
post-election violence. 'They are partisan,' he said. 'They are supporting
the opposition so if there is civil war in Kenya they will be supporting
that also.'
Mr Moi's attack will strain further an already deteriorating relationship
with the west, alienate donors and deepen the country's economic crisis. A
positive verdict by international observers that the elections had been fair
is essential to a resumption of aid, frozen a year ago when donors applied
pressure for political and economic reform.
Mr Moi lifted the ban on opposition parties in November, paving the way for
yesterday's general and presidential election.
His outburst suggests that he expects that the observers will conclude that
the election has been critically flawed by government election abuses, and
that he has little to lose by venting his anger.
Most analysts expect the ruling Kanu party to retain power.
The observers were investigating reports that polling booths in the
stronghold of Mr Oginga Odinga, leader of the opposition Ford-Kenya party,
had remained closed for at least five hours after polling was due to start.
One international observer, however, attributed the problems to 'utter
confusion' rather than electoral malpractice.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Personal View: Call to arms controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir ANTHONY PARSONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years on from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the realisation that Iraq, a
small and semi-industrialised state, had by 1990 succeeded in accumulating
an arsenal of weaponry greater than that of any state other than the
superpowers, seems to have been forgotten.
'Never again' was on everyone's lips as the five permanent members (P5) of
the UN Security Council met in October 1991 to draw up criteria for
restraint of destabilising arms transfers to conflict areas and the UN
general assembly resolved to establish an open register of arms exports and
imports. And yet a recent report* by Saferworld, the foreign affairs
think-tank, informs us that, whereas Dollars 6.8bn worth of arms were
ordered by Middle East countries in 1990, orders worth Dollars 35bn-Dollars
45bn have been placed since.
The P5 agreed to inform each other of big sales to the Middle East. I wonder
if the Russians did so in regard to more than 100 aircraft, 200 T-72 tanks
and three submarines sold to Iran, or the Americans in regard to 236 tanks
to Kuwait, 700 tanks to Egypt, 72 F-15s to Saudi Arabia and so on. These are
only a few of the deals we have learnt about, and the Chinese have now
withdrawn from the P5 discussions because of the US and French sales of
combat aircraft to Taiwan. China too is alleged to be making hay with orders
to Iran and to have exported the M-11 ground-to-ground missile to Pakistan.
None of this creates confidence in the effectiveness of the P5 initiative.
The Saferworld report proposes a common EC policy for regulation and control
of arms and dual-purpose exports. The authors point out that six of the 15
leading exporters in the world are EC members and that, in 1991, the EC
accounted for some 20 per cent of all defence sales. They argue that a
co-ordinated EC approach to other big exporters would have a greater effect
than initiatives by individual member states, and that the EC needs to
harmonise members' regulations, and to achieve a higher standard of
implementation of controls. The advent of the single market on January 1,
resulting in the freer movement of goods and services, will add further
urgency to this task.
The report develops the guidelines governing arms and dual-use exports and
proposes lists of countries to which goods would be controlled. Essentially
these would be based on compliance with international agreements such as UN
sanctions, nuclear non-proliferation, plus the categorisation of importing
states in relation to, for example, human rights records, domestic tensions,
regional peace and security, end-user reliability and other considerations.
Such an approach has its difficulties. Drawing up lists of countries to
which arms exports/dual technology would be totally or partially banned
would be particularly problematic. There is a broad spectrum between states
which are under mandatory UN arms embargoes (South Africa, Iraq, Somalia,
Serbia) and countries where there is no problem (Australia, New Zealand).
For example, to decide when a government's human-rights record would render
it offside could lead to endless wrangling.
Moreover, definitions of the legitimate self-defence needs of importing
states and of strategic considerations would vary between members.
In a broader context, between 1987 and 1991, the US, Russia and China
exported Dollars 31bn of arms. Without some prior indication that the
example of those exporting some 20 per cent would be followed by those
exporting 80 per cent, it seems likely that the latter would simply gobble
up a further proportion of the former. The competition between the US and UK
over tanks for Kuwait and aircraft for Saudi Arabia is discouraging.
I come, therefore, to two tentative conclusions which are interlinked and
which amount to modification and expansion of the notions in the report.
First, the most effective instrument of restraint is prior consultation and
agreement between leading exporters (ideally the P5 and the EC) on any large
and/or destabilising order from a government in an area of tension or
conflict. This was the principle underlying the Tripartite Declaration of
1950 between Britain, France and the US in regard to the Middle East and it
worked, more or less, for five years until overleapt by the Egyptian/Soviet
deal of September 1955.
Second, such a system should, as a long-term aim, be extended to incorporate
all significant arms manufacturers/exporters. I realise that these goals are
distant, especially as the low quality of eastern European ploughshares will
make it particularly difficult - in a time of agonising economic transition
 -for Russia and others to move away from the profitable export of swords.
However, the recommendations in the report would constitute a beginning and,
if considered by EC governments, it is essential that they should be
combined with simultaneous approaches to the remainder of the P5 and to the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter to Calcutta: No rest from her mission of mercy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Christians around the world have been celebrating Christmas, their
most revered co-religionist quietly carried on with her work. 'I spend
Christmas as I spend every day - with the poor,' says Mother Teresa of
Calcutta. 'We share with them whatever food we have.'
At the age of 82, she takes no rest. While age and illness have forced her
to slow down, she does not allow herself any time off. Mother Teresa does
not carry her burden lightly. Even conversation can be a distraction from
the enormity of her mission, since she is utterly convinced that she must
dedicate every moment to God. She says: 'Everything I do is for Christ.'
This fierce determination lives inside the frailest of bodies. At times, she
seems as weak as some of the destitute sick that she tends. She has
difficulty walking and can scarcely kneel to pray. Only her hands are strong
 -she takes visitors by both hands, gripping them in a combination of
greeting and blessing.
Mother Teresa lives in the house in Calcutta from which she directs her work
for the poor through the Missionaries of Charity, the order of nuns she
founded in 1950. The building stands on a busy road, exposed to the dirt and
the diesel fumes which permeate the city. It is well-maintained but simple:
there is no glass in the windows, no air-conditioning and only one fan.
Mother Teresa inhabits a small room next to the chapel.
The veneration with which she is treated is palpable: her patients stare in
silent adoration; the nuns speak in her presence in hushed voices; a
well-dressed Indian woman, who has come to give thanks for a favour, drops
to Mother Teresa's feet and kisses her ankles. She says: 'When you touch
her, you can feel the power coming from her.'
Mother Teresa's answers to questions are brief. How does she manage to keep
going? 'I pray. With prayer you can do anything.' She adds with the faintest
trace of pride that the Missionaries of Charity now have houses in 105
countries, including homes for the poor, for the sick, for orphans and for
Aids victims.
She visited Britain this year to open a house for the homeless in
Birmingham. I ask her why such places were necessary in rich countries. She
says that riches are unevenly divided. 'It's because some people are rich,
others are poor.' And what could we do to put that right? 'Share,' she
answers. 'Share until it hurts.'
The west is too materialistic, she says. Westerners lack the capacity to
share because they are too attached to their possessions. 'You must become
more spiritual. You must have time to pray.'
With those words she grips my hands once more. The meeting is over. 'Mother
is tired,' says one of the nuns. 'If you want to know more about her work,
why don't you go and see it for yourself.'
Early the next morning, I go to Kalighat, a particularly poor district of
Calcutta. The grand old Victorian buildings hide in the shadows, like
dowagers trying to conceal the effects of age. The roads are littered with
potholes and rubbish. The rickshaw men are already at work, pulling loads of
vegetables to the city's markets. People throng the streets - washing,
talking and eating breakfast.
Kalighat is dominated by a temple to Kali, the Hindu patroness of Calcutta
and the goddess of destruction. Next door, somewhat incongruously, stands
Mother Teresa's home for the dying. Inside, the sick lie on rows of low
beds, while their nurses - nuns and young volunteers from western countries
 -quietly prepare food, doling out portions into aluminium plates. Above
their heads on a blackboard hangs a silent summary of the previous day's
work: 'Males 47; females 46; admissions nil; discharges four; deaths nil.' I
ask a nun from southern India why she came to work in Calcutta. 'For God.
And for Mother Teresa,' she says.
The same dedication is apparent at Shishu Bhavan, Mother Teresa's Calcutta
orphanage. Nuns and volunteers look after about 300 children, most of whom
have been abandoned in the city's teeming slums. Virtually all are found
adoptive parents. 'Today, people are willing to take even the difficult
ones, even the handicapped,' says a nun over the noise of 10 small children
eating breakfast together. Outside, the orphanage runs a soup kitchen on a
grand scale - some 600 local poor are fed at the gates every morning under
the careful eye of a large cook who watches to make sure that no one steals
an extra meal.
Among the volunteers in the orphanage is a woman from Cardiff who says she
waited 12 years for her own children to grow up before coming to work for a
month in Calcutta. 'I love it here. But it's easy for me. I can go and have
a drink in the hotel when it gets too much. And I'm going home in time for
Christmas. It's the nuns I admire, they never leave. Nor Mother Teresa.'
In the evening, I return to Mother Teresa's house, where her nuns and some
of the volunteers gather for prayers. The chapel looks out on to the street
and on to the noisy rush-hour traffic. Mother Teresa crouches on the stone
floor near the back, apparently too frail to kneel properly. She stares at
the ground and it seems her strength might fail her at any moment. Yet, her
strong hands are clenched together, as if trying to grapple with some unseen
force. Even in her prayers, Mother Teresa does not seek rest.

designer of La Tour Sans Fins in Paris, talks to Alice Rawsthorn

<TEXT>
If central casting was asked to rustle up an actor to play the role of a
contemporary architect, no self-respecting movie mogul could complain if the
chosen candidate looked like Jean Nouvel.
Nouvel does, after all, have all the requisite accessories. He is invariably
dressed in black, with close-cropped hair and a nice line in techno-toys,
like the deep sea diver-style watch wrapped around his wrist. At 47, he has
already made his name in architectural circles through his uncompromisingly
modernist designs, such as the Arab cultural centre in Paris, now marked by
an exhibition of his work at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.
But his biggest and, possibly, his best building has yet to come. Early next
year the builders will arrive at a plot of land beside the futuristic Grande
Arche at the La Defense business district in western Paris, to start work on
Nouvel's La Tour Sans Fins, the Tower of Infinity.
This is the building that seems set to propel Jean Nouvel into the tiny band
of contemporary architects, such as Richard Rogers and I M Pei, whose names
are known beyond the cloistered world of architecture. It should also place
him in the forefront of the new wave of modernists redefining architectural
thinking in the 1990s.
La Tour Sans Fins, at 1,400ft (425m), will be the tallest tower in Paris,
easily dwarfing the Eiffel Tower's 984ft. It will be built in glass - black
at the bottom, but gradually becoming paler until it is completely clear at
the top. 'It's one of the projects where I've been given most freedom,' says
Nouvel. 'It's an office block, a serious building, and the design reflects
that, but it's also fun. I want people to enjoy it.'
The sci-fi style and scale of La Tour Sans Fins seem set to cause as much
controversy as other modern Paris monuments, notably the Pompidou arts
centre, the building that brought Rogers into the limelight, and Pei's
glacial glass pyramid in the Louvre museum. Nouvel sees his tower as 'a
metaphysical object' and an exercise in 'urban poetry'. One of the judges of
the architectural competition that chose it was more prosaic. He described
Nouvel's design as 'a pure object of capitalism'.
If Nouvel cares about such quips, he is far too shrewd to show it. La Tour
Sans Fins is typical of his style. It is a witty building, which twists the
traditional tenets of 1920s modernism - the geometric lines and emphasis on
function - into new forms for today. 'I'm a true modernist, a man of my
time,' he says. 'The role of the architect is to reflect the age they live
in.'
Jean Nouvel looks like his buildings, thoroughly modern and larger than
life. He is a big, burly man with a diabolic face, who punctuates his
conversation with rumbustious chuckles. He works from a rambling open-plan
studio in an old warehouse in the dowdy 11th arrondissement of Paris. He
moved there a few years ago when he outgrew his old studio on Rue Beaubourg
opposite the Pompidou centre. The Beaubourg studio is now his home. 'It's
pretty basic,' he says. 'I spend 12 or 14 hours a day designing buildings,
so I don't want to do that in my spare time. Lots of architects dream about
building their own homes. Not me.'
He was born, the son of teachers, at Fumel in the Lot valley in southern
France. He ended his education at the prestigious Ecole des Beaux Arts in
Paris where he began by studying painting, but soon switched to
architecture. 'At the time I didn't have any money, so architecture seemed
like a better bet,' he recalls. 'I always planned to go back to painting but
after two years of architecture I was hooked.'
Nouvel quickly became a notorious figure in French architectural circles,
initially because of the unusual vehemence of his attacks on other people's
work. His vitriolic views, coupled with a penchant for publicity (he
recently featured in a Swiss Air advertising campaign), have saddled him
with a reputation for megalomania.
He was one of the most vociferous opponents of the Forum des Halles
development in Paris during the late 1970s, when the old fruit and vegetable
market was pulled down to make way for a shopping centre - 'the
indescribable architectural catastrophe'. He then emerged as a critic of
post-modernism, the trend for reinterpreting historical images that
dominated in the 1980s, producing buildings such as Robert Venturi's
National Gallery extension in London.
But he has been equally critical of the bastions of early modernism such as
Le Corbusier - 'he was a genius, but he also wrote some really stupid
things' - and of contemporary architects who continue to copy them. 'I don't
want to perpetuate the legacy of the architecture of another age,' he says.
'Just because something was modern 50 years ago doesn't make it modern
today.'
The architects he does admire - Alvar Aalto, the Finnish modernist who
emerged in the 1920s, Tado Ando, the grand old man of contemporary Japanese
architecture, and Richard Rogers - all share his passion for reinterpreting
modernist principles in his own way. 'They all have their own idiosyncratic
styles,' he says. 'A building by Rogers just couldn't have been designed by
anyone else.'
Nouvel made his mark in the 1980s through the grands projets, the
architectural schemes initiated by President Francois Mitterrand to
celebrate the 1989 bicentennial of the French Revolution and to raise
awareness of modern architecture.
The grands projets, such as the Louvre pyramid and the new finance ministry,
were accompanied by a reform of public sector building in France, which
included introducing architectural competitions and encouraging local
authorities to launch their own petits projets. Nouvel was lucky. He came to
maturity as an architect at a time when an unprecedented number of major
buildings were being commissioned in France, and there were relatively few
French architects with enough experience to handle them.
But luck was not enough. The architects for the grands projets were chosen
by international competitions. Being in the right place (and of the right
nationality) at the right time probably helped Nouvel to get on to the
shortlists, but after that he was on his own. He lost the competitions for
the finance ministry and national library, but won the commission for
L'Institut du Monde Arabe, the Arab centre on the banks of the river Seine
in Paris.
The FFr500m (Pounds 61m) Arab centre combines all his favourite themes. It
is a futuristic building made in modern materials, steel and glass. Nouvel
broke it down into sections so that it looks different from each angle. He
also indulged his love of technology in the computerised blinds, designed in
traditional Arab patterns, which regulate the flow of light through the
windows.
The result is a building which is superficially stunning and becomes
increasingly complex the closer you look. 'It's not enough just to make
something that looks amazing, or to show how clever you can be with
technology,' he says. 'The building must work as a whole.'
L'Institut du Monde Arabe established Jean Nouvel in the international arena
and garnered the Grand Prix d'Architecture, France's most prestigious
architectural prize usually given for a lifetime's work. He now faces the
challenge of developing his ideas in his new projects - the Opera house in
Lyons, a factory for Cartier in Switzerland and La Tour Sans Fins.
'It's easy to get complacent and to become mediocre by doing the same thing
again and again,' he says. 'You have to know exactly what you want and how
to get there. But I'm lucky. I'm an optimist. I always look for the positive
side in everything.'

JAPANESE stocks succumbed to Monday blues and closed just off the day's lows
in very thin trading, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 368.42 or 2.10 per cent lower at 17,188.62, after
a high of 17,538.88 and a low of 17,162.74. Decliners led gainers by 812 to
131, with 154 unchanged. On Friday, the Nikkei fell 91.81 to 17,557.04, and
decliners led advancers by 586 to 337 with 213 unchanged. On Thursday, the
index lost 41.82 to 17,648.85.
Yesterday, the broader first section Topix index was down 19.98 or 1.5 per
cent to 1,321.84 while the second section index fell 5.45 to 1,727.78.
About 100m shares were traded, which brokers said was the lowest daily
volume since May 31, 1982, after 180m on Friday and 200m on Thursday. The
Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday that total traded turnover in 1992 up to
December 25 was about a quarter of that recorded in 1991, and for the whole
of 1992 looks set to be the lowest in 17 years.
Selling by investment trusts and dealers squeezed prices, while most
investors shunned the market in the absence of fresh incentives and ahead of
the New Year holiday. Yesterday was the first trading day for January
delivery and some participants had hoped for a year-end technical rebound.
NTT fell Y5,000 to Y575,000 on continued profit-taking after its recent
sharp gains as an asset re-evaluation stock and a top candidate for a new
weighted average.
Semi-conductor related issues were also down on profit-taking after last
week's jump. Canon fell Y10 to Y1,380, Kokusai Electric Y20 to Y1,680 and
Nikon Y20 to Y705.
Roundup
TRADING was mostly quiet in the region ahead of the New Year holidays.
TAIWAN plunged 3.7 per cent to a 23-month low on fears of political
instability after the December 19 parliamentary elections. The weighted
index closed 128.33 down at 3,327.67, the lowest close since January 16,
1991 during the Gulf crisis, in turnover of TDollars 10bn. Last Thursday,
the weighted index ended 7.85 higher at 3,456.00 in low turnover of TDollars
8.1bn.
HONG KONG rose on year-end window-dressing but trading was lacklustre as
many players remained on holiday. The Hang Seng index finished at 5,531.65,
up 89.64, in turnover of HKDollars 2.27bn. On Thursday, overseas buying
lifted the Hang Seng by 124.02 or 2.3 per cent to 5,442.01 in half-day
turnover of HKDollars 1.47bn.
Yesterday, expectations of a lift on the mortgage ceiling boosted the
property sector. Cheung Kong rose 70 cents to HKDollars 19.40, Sun Hung Kai
Properties was up 60 cents to HKDollars 28.30 and Henderson Land jumped 90
cents to HKDollars 14.90.
SEOUL fell on the last trading day of 1992 as afternoon profit-taking eroded
early gains. The composite index fell 6.97 to 680.96 after adding 4.93 to
675.36 last Thursday.
MANILA edged higher on firm investor sentiment after Christmas passed
without violations of a ceasefire agreement between the government and army
rebels. The composite index closed 6.44 higher at 1,241.01 after a rise of
10.90 to 1,234.57 on Christmas Eve.
Also on Christmas Eve, AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index jumped 11.4 to
1,536.2 in turnover of ADollars 305.6m. Western Mining went against the
trend with a fall of 6 cents to ADollars 4.36 after it said that first-half
profits were likely to be 'substantially lower' than the same period a year
ago if low nickel prices persisted.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE 40 index added 7.1 to 1,542.25.

Wall Street
US STOCK prices floated higher late in the afternoon in thin, featureless
trading, as the market marked time ahead of the new year, writes Karen Zagor
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Averagem which lost more than 14 points at
mid-session, ended the day up 7.02 at 3,333.26 with the gains coming in the
last 15 minutes of trading. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 was
off 0.62 at 439.15, while the Amex composite edged 0.01 higher to 394.18 and
the Nasdaq composite rose 0.36 to 666.24. NYSE trading volume was less than
145m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 990 to 809.
Last Thursday, the Dow rose 12.70 to 3,326.24 in an abbreviated
pre-Christmas session. NYSE volume was less than 100m shares. The
Standard&amp;Poor's 500 closed 0.74 higher at 439.77 while the Nasdaq composite
firmed 2.92 to 665.88.
In the pharmaceutical sector, Glaxo Holdings' ADRs slid Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 22 1/4 in active trading. Merck also saw heavy turnover, closing
unchanged at Dollars 44 3/4 .
IBM started the week on a weak note, losing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 51 3/4
. Investors are still wary of the stock, which hit a 17-year low of Dollars
48 3/4 a week ago.
Occidental Petroleum shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 after the company
announced a proposed settlement of legal action surrounding its dividend
policy. The company, which currently pays a regular quarterly dividend of 25
cents per share, said that the proposal included maintaining its annual
common stock dividend at no less than Dollars 1 per share through 1997. The
settlement is subject to final approval by the federal court.
A number of department stores and other retailers ended the day higher after
losing ground in mornining trading. The sector has suffered from lower
investment ratings in spite of a strong Christmas season. Shares in Wal-Mart
closed unchanged at Dollars 64 7/8 , Kmart rose Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 25,
JC Penney was up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 78 and Dillard Department Stores
advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 50.
Canada
TORONTO was closed yesterday for a public holiday. On Christmas Eve, the TSE
300 fell 3.2 to 3,319.9 pressured by losses in the heavily weighted BCE Inc
and Oshawa Group A shares. Advancing issues outpaced decliners by 226 to
171.

FT  29 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Japan impatient for 'annus horribilis'
to end - Emiko Terazono looks back on a difficult 1992 and assesses the
stock market's prospects for next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The last year has brought more trouble to the Tokyo stock market, rocked by
horror stories about a possible meltdown of the financial system, a plunge
in the real estate market, a slump in consumer demand and poor corporate
earnings. From a high of 23,801.18 early in January, the Nikkei average had
dropped 40 per cent to 14,309.41 by mid-August.
At that point, a Y10,700bn (Dollars 86bn) emergency government spending
package to revive the economy took the Nikkei up to 18,908 in September, but
that recovery has been only partly sustained and analysts believe that many
of the problems affecting Japanese share prices are likely to continue in
1993.
Tokyo's woes started in early April, when bank shares plunged on fears over
the financial system. Investors' worries were compounded by the authorities'
failure to react, causing discontent among the financial community.
Sharp falls in real estate prices and rumours of financial problems at
leading condominium developers and housing concerns came next. Mounting bad
debts at housing loan companies also distressed investors and figures for
bad loans held by the banking sector, ranging from Y20,000bn to Y60,000bn,
circulated the market.
The government's emergency package lifted the Nikkei from a six-year low.
Along with the fiscal spending package, the government pledged to stimulate
the stock market by adding additional public funds into stock investments
and restricting investors from selling stock holdings to realise profits.
The government's support for the stock market, however, has kept shares
expensive at a time when the economy is still stumbling, and corporate
earnings are continuing to fall.
Companies were hurt by the sudden decline in consumer demand which
government officials had hoped would pull Japan's economy out of the
doldrums. A study showed that interim earnings at 516 leading manufacturing
companies fell by 38 per cent on average, and most analysts are predicting a
20 to 30 per cent fall for the fiscal year to March. With the Nikkei at a
price/earnings ratio of 55 times, investors have little incentive to jump
in.
The critical question for the stock market next year is the level of
economic growth, and corporate earnings. This month the government halved
its growth forecast for the current fiscal year from 3.5 to 1.6 per cent,
and has declined to say when a recovery will begin.
Private growth forecasts range between 2.3 to 2.8 per cent, while most
economists predict corporate profits may not recover until 1994. Stock
market strategists have set their forecasts accordingly. Mr Peter Tasker at
Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo predicts that the Nikkei average will trade
between 15,000 and 19,300 while Mr Jason James at James Capel sees it moving
within a 16,000-20,000 range.
Japanese analysts are a little more bullish, with Mr Tatsuo Kurokawa at
Nomura Securities predicting 16,000-21,000 and Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities on 16,500-24,000. Mr Ueki expects heavy profit-taking around the
20,000 level, but thinks that sentiment will be lifted by economic recovery.
The lack of exciting new products this year probably heralds a trend over
the next few years. Mr Tasker says that the major talking point next year is
likely to be how well leading companies handle a rehabilitation phase.
Manufacturers will undergo slow and painful restructuring, adjusting to low
growth over the next few years, and shedding fat accumulated in the late
1980s by cutting staff and capital spending.
Meanwhile, some analysts predict a return of the crisis in confidence in the
banking sector, triggered by surfacing problems at a few smaller financial
institutions.
The banks are scheduled to launch the 'Co-operative Credit Purchasing
Company', a loan and land buying agency early next year, with 162
institutions investing a total of Y7.9bn. But rather than stimulate the
faltering property market, the new agency is designed to accelerate the
write-off of bad loans at the banks. Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, comments: 'I don't know anybody who has high
hopes of the land buying company.'
However, share prices are likely to remain firm against possible turmoil in
the financial, political, or industrial arenas thanks to support from public
funds. And while heavy-handed management may increase the inefficiency of
the market, investors may find comfort in some sectors.
The revival of the US economy could lift high-technology issues, especially
in semiconductor-related sectors. Early buyers have already started to move
into electricals and semiconductor equipment makers. Other investors may see
value in public works-related stocks, such as regional contractors,
roadmakers and sewage diggers which are likely to be beneficiaries of the
government's fiscal public works programme.

FT  29 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Zurich rally on
window-dressing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RALLIES in Germany and Switzerland, with more than a suggestion of
window-dressing, contrasted with a shock for the Spanish banking sector,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT forged ahead again as window-dressing, thin turnover and
expectations of a year-end rally took the DAX index to its highest close for
four weeks, up 17.66 at 1,544.61, just 2 per cent below its starting point
for 1992.
Turnover fell from DM2.7bn to DM2.6bn. Volatility in illiquid stocks such as
the battery maker, Varta, DM14.50 higher at DM225, and the ball-bearing
manufacturer, Kugelfischer, DM5 better at DM91, suggested that fund managers
were using the thin market to enhance year-end performance.
Deutsche Bank rose DM8.90 to DM653.50 and the insurer, Allianz, added DM33
to DM1,988 on short-covering and hopes of an interest rate cut early next
year.
Kaufhof rose DM15.50 or 3.8 per cent to DM425 on a continuing reaction to
last week's announcement that the retailer had bought 50.1 per cent of the
Swiss travel agency, Kuoni.
ZURICH's SMI index rose 30.9 to 2,092.4 on hopes for lower interest rates in
Germany, and in turn in Switzerland. Speculation on a strong rally in 1993,
a dollar above SFr1.45 and window-dressing also contributed to the firm
tone.
Banks benefited with CS Holding SFr60 higher at SFr2,140, SBC up SFr9 at
SFr304 and Swiss Volksbank, the subject of takeover speculation some weeks
ago, up SFr60, or 8.8 per cent at SFr740.
Brown Boveri rose SFr80 to SFr3,620, having returned to favour this month
after a share price retreat earlier in the second half.
MADRID's banking sector fell, leading to general weakness after a high court
ordered Banco Santander to post a Pta8bn bond to cover alleged tax
irregularities in past loan transactions. Santander fell Pta230 to Pta4,290.
Central Hispano and Popular both eased by more than 1 per cent as the
general index closed 3.07, or 1.4 per cent lower at 215.07.
PARIS gave back most of the day's gains but managed to close slightly
firmer. The CAC-40 index put on 2.94 to 1,857.53 in thin volume of FFr1.7bn,
off the day's high of 1,872.43. On Christmas Eve, the index rose 33.48 to
1,854.59 on the first day of the January account.
MILAN ended virtually unchanged as early losses were countered by a light
recovery later on. The Comit index rose 0.61 to 438.48 in estimated turnover
of L100bn after L260bn on December 23.
Fiat was fixed down L96 at L3,834 but later recovered to L3,870. Other
gainers included the retailer Rinascente, up L290 at L7,900, and the
insurance sector, led by Fondiaria, up L468 at L27,218.
BRUSSELS was pulled down by a decline in the food retailer, Delhaize. The
Bel-20 index fell 4.60 to 1,132.99, after gaining 1.94 to 1,137.59 on
Christmas Eve.
Delhaize dropped BFr22 to BFr1,368, pushed down by a 4 per cent drop in
shares of its US Food Lion unit on new rumours that hygiene standards at the
discount chain were unsatisfactory and on a newspaper report, denied by
Delhaize, that Food Lion would halt its expansion programme.
AMSTERDAM continued its end-year rally but a flat opening on Wall Street
dampened earlier gains. The CBS Tendency index closed at 107.1, up 0.3 from
last Thursday when it closed 0.2 higher at 106.8.
STOCKHOLM was little changed after late buying reversed a weak trend at the
opening. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 0.9 to 917.8 as turnover
dropped to SKr368m from SKr624m.
Among active stocks, Ericsson B share roses SKr3 to SKr190 while Astra B
closed SKr1 down at SKr737.
OSLO fell 1.4 per cent in thin post-holiday trading. The composite index
fell 5.21 to 368.75 in turnover of NKr66.8m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr3.5 to
NKr151 while Saga Petroleum A shed NKr1 to NKr67.50.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Good prospects for US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR'S pre-Christmas rally against the D-Mark has underlined the view
of many analysts that favourable growth in the US will propel the US
currency higher in 1993, writes James Blitz.
However, in spite of a reduction of tensions inside the European exchange
rate mechanism in recent days, dealers are still poised to test the strength
of the French franc in the new year.
The US currency's mini-rally against the D-Mark in recent days has been the
result of a growing perception in the markets that Germany will ease
short-term interest rates in the new year.
When the Bundesbank decided not to ease policy at its council meeting on
December 10, the dollar fell as low as DM1.5570 against the D-Mark. But
there has been renewed speculation in the last fortnight that Germany will
cut rates earlier than anticipated, and the dollar was trading as high as
DM1.5940 in Europe on Christmas Eve and rose further to around DM1,6090
yesterday.
Analysts also believe that increasing signs of an upturn in the US economy
will help to underpin the currency in forthcoming months. Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank in London, says: 'US data releases are
increasingly pointing to a sustainable recovery there, while the dichotomy
in growth performances between the US and Europe is set to intensify.'
Inside the ERM, the calm of recent weeks will probably continue up to the
new year. On December 24, the central bank of Ireland took advantage of the
easier tone to trading by saying that it would cut its overnight support
rate to 14 per cent from 16 per cent. Dealers said the move reflected the
recent steadiness of the punt on the foreign exchanges.
Some analysts suggested that the calm could end abruptly in the new year if
Ireland removes capital controls as it has promised to do. Mr Paul Chertkow
of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London continues to believe that the Irish punt
and the Portuguese escudo will be devalued in the order of 7 per cent and 6
per cent respectively next year.
Pressures on the French franc abated considerably in the week before
Christmas, with the currency momentarily rising above FFr3.41 against the
D-Mark, and three-month French francs falling to 11 5/8 per cent from an
earlier high point of 12 1/2 per cent.
The may have been helped by statements from opposition politicians in France
that they would respect the franc fort policy if they win the March
parliamentary elections.
Mr MacKinnon is gloomy about the franc's prospects. 'Downward pressure on
the French franc looks set to intensify,' he says,'and policy settings
insidethe ERM are clearly unsustainable.' Mr Chertkow expects speculation
against the French franc but believes that Europe's central banks are ready
to defend it to the hilt.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Rise in Euromarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN money markets were extremely quiet in the run-up to Christmas but,
as the new year approaches, there may be another surge of speculation over
whether Germany will cut official rates, writes James Blitz.
In the first two weeks of December the market took an extremely pessimistic
view about the prospects for an easing of policy by the Bun-desbank.
On December 10, the German central bank decided not to ease policy at its
council meeting, and the March Euromark contract fell as low as 91.92
shortly thereafter. At that level, the market assumed that three-month money
in the spring would be at about 8.18 per cent, barely below the current
discount rate level of 8.25 per cent.
The run-up to Christmas saw a change of mood, partly triggered by comments
from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who said that
inflation could be contained to 3 per cent by the end of next year.
On Christmas Eve, the March Euromark contract was back up at 92.24, pricing
three-month money at 7.76 per cent in the spring and assuming a small cut in
offic-ial rates. On December 24, German call money was at the low end of the
current range, at 8.76 per cent.
Economists believe that the pressures on the Bundesbank to ease policy are
stronger than ever. The German economy is entering recession, and the Ifo
institute recently reported that German GDP could decline by 0.5 per cent
next year.
Inflationary pressures may not be as great as the Bundesbank fears. 'The
idea that Germany will suffer inflationary pressures when they have not had
a devaluation of the D-Mark is bizarre,' said one commentator last week.
The crucial issue now is when Germany will ease policy. Miss Alison
Cottrell, who keeps a close watch on the Bundesbank for Midland Global
Markets in London, believes that a reduction in official rates is unlikely
to come before the council meetings on February 4 or 18.
The next council meeting is set for January 7, but this is one day before
talks on the German public sector wage round are due to take place. 'The
Bundesbank is unlikely to take any policy decisions before it knows the
results of those talks,' she said.

FT  29 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAe falls on broker reratings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE contractor British Aerospace (BAe) was among the most heavily traded
stocks in quiet Christmas Eve dealing as most analysts cut profits forecasts
for 1992 and 1993. The shares were off 12 at one stage but rallied to close
5 down at 157p after some 2.6m dealt.
The downgradings followed a company meeting with analysts on the previous
evening. Hoare Govett, the company's broker, was said to have cut back its
estimates but was unavailable for comment. County NatWest lowered its
forecast to a loss of Pounds 865m for 1992 from a previous Pounds 840m loss
prediction, mainly because of 'massive exceptional charges'.
The house also cut the 1993 forecast to a Pounds 60m profit from Pounds
105m. However, County is sticking to its 'hold' advice for short term
investors and believes the stock will 'outperform' in the long term. Smith
New Court is predicting a loss of Pounds 1.075bn. Analyst Mr Chris Avery
said: 'There is going to be a Pounds 1bn exceptional charge. If you are
going to have a blood bath, what is the point of showing any profit at all?'
HSBC responded to a rally in Hong Kong and to recent broker buy
recommendations. The London stock rose 8 to 486p and the Hong Kong stock 9
to 473p. SG Warburg firmed 5 to 545p, reflecting the consistent high levels
of activity on the London stock market since the Conservative election
victory.
The effect of forecast and rating downgradings in the UK and US lopped a
further 8 off Glaxo, which closed at 748p.
P &amp; O recovered 8 to 508p as a recent fall prompted by a debt downgrading
provided a cheap buying opportunity.
BP was one of the most actively traded stocks in the market, with the shares
maintaining their recent strong showing and closing 4 higher at 241 1/2 p.
The buying came mostly from the US, where investors now speak for more than
21 per cent of the shares.
Lasmo's recent sale of assets continued to attract buyers and the shares
added 2 at 158p.
The regional electricity stocks were bought by income funds. East Midland,
which goes ex-dividend on January 18, put on 4 to 420p and Yorkshire, xd on
January 4, gained 4 at 499p.
Welsh Water, whose sale last week of a stake in South Wales Electricity
netted a profit of around Pounds 17m, rose 7 to 521p.
USM-quoted jeans manufacturer Pepe fell 5 to 4p after reporting a Pounds 10m
loss and a restructuring.

FT  29 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities steady in confident session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London stock market celebrated Christmas Eve with a fresh display of
confidence which melted away only as traders effectively abandoned the
half-day trading session at mid-morning. Early dealings saw the FT-SE Index
rise 13.2 to the day's high of 2,840.6, but the initial share gains
disappeared very quickly as the Christmas spirit spread through the City of
London.
The final reading on the FT-SE Index, taken at 12.30pm, showed a net gain of
0.1 points at 2,827.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, maintained its
early firmness to finish 6.3 points ahead at 2,848.9. The broadly ranging
Mid 250 Index provided a strong lead to the stock market last week,
indicating the refocusing of institutional portfolios on the second tier
stocks.
A more accurate picture came from the total of a mere 173.6m shares traded
through the Seaq electronic network; few prices were genuinely tested, since
marketmakers had no wish to take on positions over the extended holiday
break. But trading in non-Footsie stocks was significantly higher than in
the blue chip Footsie-listed issues.
The unexpected surge in share prices since the beginning of the month kept
securities analysts on the alert, however. Profits downgrades in the
aerospace and pharmaceutical sectors depressed several of the market's
leading names, and underlined the switch from defensive blue chips into
cyclical sectors likely to lead the way towards the revival in the economy,
on which the stock market is pinning its faith.
In derivatives markets, the March future contract on the FT-SE Index
maintained the strong premium over the underlying blue chips which has been
driving equities ahead, but saw very little business. The Footsie contract
had only 733 contracts traded, effectively a record low volume figure. At
the best of the session, March touched 2,884, but soon settled back to 2,866
to show a final premium of 39 against cash; the fair value premium, allowing
for dividend and financing flows, stood at an estimated 19 points.
In traded options, volume more than halved to 6,373 contracts. Business in
the Footsie fell to 2,482 lots, while Fisons headed the individual stocks
list with 806 contracts traded.

FT  29 DEC 92 / International Bond Markets: Return of the nightmare on
Eurobond Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS like a bad sequel. The horror was over, tranquility had returned. The
placid folk of the Eurobond market were going about their innocent business,
making money. And then, just when they thought it was safe to go back into
the water . . .
To the casual bather, the international bond markets certainly looked
inviting at the start of this year. The bad, cut-throat days of the late
1980s were over. 1991 had brought rallies in most major bond markets. The
fixed price reoffer method of selling bonds, introduced to the international
market by Morgan Stanley, had helped to raise the profits of intermediaries.
This was going to be the year when banks sat back and raked in their fees. A
strong US Treasury market, convergence among European currencies and big
planned borrowings from sovereign and other top names all pointed to a
banner year.
The shark had other ideas. Before the first quarter was out, some savage
bidding and a deluge of bond offerings had churned up the placid waters of
the market. Unwary swimmers lost a limb here or there, most notably when
Finland sold Ecu500m of seven-year bonds through Yamaichi in February.
As in all bad sequels, the innocent Eurobond folk looked stunned and
retreated to lick their wounds. They did not realise that worse was to come.
No sooner had they plucked up the courage to dip a toe back in the lagoon
than the shark struck again, this time swimming in from a different
direction: Denmark. European bond convergence was not going to be achieved
as smoothly as most had expected. Exit several more limbs.
At this point, the inhabitants of the bond markets demonstrated the sort of
stoic heroism one expects at such times. They were not going to let it get
them down. The Ecu still had a future, after all - in fact, it was now
trading at well below its theoretical value (bonds denominated in this
basket currency were yielding more than the sum of their constituent parts).
Surely, some suggested, it was a good time to buy?
This presumably had nothing to do with the fact that most market-makers were
sitting on a mountain of the stuff. By July, however, the Ecu market-makers
had let the cat out of the bag: they stopped making markets to each other,
tacitly admitting to the world that this particular EC surplus was likely to
take some time to shift.
The shark was circling, waiting to strike again. When it came in September,
the denouement was frenzied and bloody. Even before French voters got to
cast their verdict on the Maastricht treaty, the dream of bond market
convergence in Europe had been dragged under in the churning waters of the
ERM.
No sequel is complete without an unexpected twist. This one was provided by
the Italian authorities, who decided that now was the moment to withdraw
their withholding tax exemption for supranational borrowers - a concession
which had effectively held down the yield spreads paid by all borrowers in
the international bond markets. Already damaged by credit concerns, bond
spreads duly widened.
As if that was not enough, the Italians returned for a second go,
introducing the 12.5 per cent tax to repurchase agreements as well. This
spelt the death of the international repo market in Italy, through which
banks had recycled the tax concession to provide lower borrowing costs to
their Italian customers. Some Dollars 20bn of international bonds would be
released on to the secondary market as a result, it was estimated.
Was anyone brave enough to enter this maelstrom? Apparently so. The Kingdom
of Spain decided now was the time to come up with its first Eurodollar bond
issue, a Dollars 1.5bn seven-year effort. It was forced to increase the
yield on its bonds by 10 basis points, to a spread over US Treasuries of 55
basis points - and even then the yield rose by another 10 basis points in
the secondary market. To add insult to injury, Moody's Investors Service,
the US rating agency, decided days later to put Spain's AA2 rating under
review (though it later confirmed the rating at its existing level).
The waters calmed again. The shark was gone. The US election came and went
and the Eurodollar market decided the world was not going to come to an end.
Peace and normality returned. Big borrowers paid their underwriters fat
commissions to produce successful transactions for them: the UK's DM5.5bn
deal, for instance, and Sweden's Dollars 2.5bn issue. Finland made good past
errors with a Dollars 2bn blow-out of a deal in November. Even Spain's
Eurodollar issue was trading close to its issue price. The Eurobond folk
went about their innocent business.
It was time to survey the damage. The camera panned back to take in the
battered wreckage of this small-town community, revealing some marked
difference in the features of the landscape. Things would never be the same
again:
The Ecu was nowhere to be seen, presumed lost at sea. In the first half of
the year, the basket European currency had accounted for around 15 per cent
of all international bond issues by value. In the second half, it made up
less than 2 per cent.
The D-Mark had swum to the rescue. From 10 per cent of the market in the
first nine months, the D-Mark's share jumped to 24 per cent in the final
quarter. Liberalisation of issuing rules in the German bond market in the
summer had come just in time (this removed the requirement to list all
D-Mark bonds on a German stock exchange, use a German bank as an issuing
house and make the bonds subject to German law). Also, Morgan Stanley
brought the fixed price reoffer system to Germany in the autumn. It was too
early to tell, though, whether the D-Mark had really broken out of its
retail origins to become a cornerstone of the international bond market.
The US dollar had proved its value as a long-term vehicle for the
Euromarkets. The days when it accounted for virtually all activity in the
international markets may be long gone, with the currency accounting for
less than 30 per cent of activity in the first half of the year. But with
European currencies paralysed in the third quarter, the dollar made up 54
per cent of new bond issues (slipping back again to around a third in the
final three months).
Many of the swimmers were looking rather dishevelled. Most banks had
invested heavily in the future of the Ecu (some, even now, could be heard
singing its praises). A scattering of badly-priced deals had punctuated the
year, the memory of which was not totally expunged by the placid ending.
Some appeared healthier than others. J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Goldman
Sachs were reckoned to have had a more profitable time than most. Two other
US banks had also impressed: Lehman Brothers, which clawed its way up the
league table to 13th place, and Salomon, which had managed to hold onto its
market share despite being effectively shut out of the market in the early
months as punishment for last year's Treasuries scandal.
Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, had clawed its way to the top of the pile
(claiming all the way that it had not been buying market share), supported
by the two other big-volume houses, Nomura and Credit Suisse First Boston.
There were also some new additions to the landscape. One was the structured
floating rate note, designed to attract fixed-rate investors who thought
dollar interest rates were about to rise. Kidder Peabody took the credit for
introducing the cap-and-collar floater, which promised a minimum interest
rate (usually of 5 per cent) higher than the current market rate. In return,
investors gave up some of their yield if rates rose above this floor, and
also accepted a ceiling above which their return could not rise. Contrary to
most predictions, more than Dollars 7bn of such notes were sold, as UBS
joined in by bringing a number of top-rated names to this market.
There were dark predictions that such instruments could yet disturb the
tranquility. As interest rates rose towards or above the floor, who would
want to buy them? Would the banks that helped issue them continue to bid
actively, or would the market disappear?
These, though, were distant thoughts as the year drew to a close. 1993 was
going to be a good year. Bond markets would rally. Underwriters would hold
the line on fees and issuers were going to be sensible on pricing. Even the
Ecu might stage a come-back. The next sequel really would be much happier -
wouldn't it?

London Metal Exchange base metals prices moved irregularly during a thin and
shortened Christmas eve grading session as dealers squared their books ahead
of the holiday, traders said. Three months delivery COPPER dipped to Dollars
2,258 a tonne early on but recovered to Dollars 2,270 before ending at about
Dollars 2,265, up Dollars 8 from Wednesday. ALUMINIUM rose on short covering
prompted by recent support around Dollars 1,250 a tonne. Last business was
at Dollars 1,255 a tonne, up Dollars 5.50. In the absence of a lead from the
closed Kuala Lumpur market, TIN relinquished some of its recent price
advance, with cash metal ending Dollars 20 down at Dollars 5,840 a tonne.
Robusta COFFEE futures closed with losses of Dollars 2 to Dollars 9 a tonne
on key positions in very quiet conditions. Dealers continued to attribute
the decline to a downside technical correction following the recent advance
to 20-month highs. COCOA futures ended narrowly mixed as the market
continued to struggle to overcome resistance in the Pounds 695-Pounds 700
area, for March delivery. The GOLD market showed little life.

OMV, the state-controlled Austrian oil and chemicals group which has a stock
market listing, has appointed Lehman Brothers International to advise on the
selection of new strategic investors and business partners.
The appointment follows the decision by the Austrian state holding company,
Osterreichische Industrieholding, which owns 70 per cent of OMV shares, to
sell another large block to cover losses in its other holdings.
The Austrian press has speculated that stakes in OMV might be purchased by a
leading international oil company or the government of an oil-producing
country, such as Kuwait.
OMV is seeking to strengthen its position in the promising oil and gas
markets of central and eastern Europe, and new shareholder-partners could
help it achieve those goals.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Risk and Reward: Derivatives rush to catch up with emerging
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE the following blueprint for a market. Turnover: officially reckoned at
Dollars 120bn in the first 10 months of this year, though some market
estimates put it at twice this level. Performance: the best-performing
dollar-denominated debt markets in 1990 and 1991, though total return to
investors in 1992 was only around 5 per cent. Future prospects: unstable
political background and uncertain economic outlook likely to lead to
continued extreme volatility.
This is the secondary market in the debt of lesser-developed countries
(LDCs), one of the fastest-growing financial markets since the late 1980s.
Sophistication, in the form of over-the-counter risk-management (or
risk-enhancing) instruments, is only just catching up.
Derivatives are particularly suited to LDC markets (now usually lumped
together under the fashionable 'emerging markets' banner). Many institutions
have not been able to buy the actively traded external bank debt of these
countries: to do so would effectively constitute making a loan, something
that many investors are forbidden by their trust deeds from doing.
The only alternative for these institutions has been to buy options over the
traded debt, or to buy structured instruments which pay a return based on
the performance of the debt. However, as more countries have reached
official debt-reduction agreements, this has become less of a motivation.
Another reason for buying derivatives rather than investing directly in the
cash market has been the generally weak credit standing of most of the
countries involved. A banker faced with a low exposure limit to, say,
Argentina could gear up by buying call options on the country's par bonds,
rather than buying the bonds themselves.
The privatisation programmes of countries like Argentina also generate
demand for options. Argentina accepts its own external debt in part payment
when selling state-owned companies: bidders may therefore think it
worthwhile to buy options over the country's debt, against the possibility
that they are successful and will need the debt in the future.
There is also a growing 'retail' market in derivatives based on the debt of
these countries - that is, for investors with upwards of Dollars 250,000 to
put aside. This year has seen the creation of warrants on debt from Brazil
to Poland, giving many investors their first chance to bet on these debt
markets. Given the low (or falling) rates of interest available in many
developed countries, there has been a steady market for such products, tied
as they are to dollar-denominated instruments.
The strong performance in many LDC debt markets at the beginning of the
1990s may have blinded some investors to the very real risks that remain.
The return to international financial respectability of some parts of Latin
America (which accounts for the lion's share of the debt outstanding, and
therefore most of the weighting in any emerging markets debt index) explains
the strong performance. But recent political turmoil in Venezuela - one of
the stars of the debt-reduction era - and Brazil point to the dangers.
The degree of risk is born out by the implied volatility levels in the
options markets - that is, the extent to which secondary market debt prices
are expected to move, implicit in the pricing of an option. There has been a
steadily declining trend in volatility levels in the past three years, with
Mexico now down to a range of 7 to 13 per cent. Implied volatility on
Venezuelan debt is also less than 20 per cent, though on Argentina it is 20
to 25 per cent and on Brazil, 30 to 35 per cent. These figures reveal the
substantial risks that remain.
Nor is the option market as liquid as is sometimes claimed. True, the market
has improved greatly over the past year: bid/offer spreads have narrowed
from around a half to a quarter of a point in that time, according to one
bank which buys but does not trade in options. This is due to the advent in
New York of a group of active option market-makers. Most traders there point
to Merrill Lynch and Chase Manhattan as the most aggressive, with J. P.
Morgan, ING and Chemical also active. However, there are still complaints
about the difficulty of cashing in an option position when the market has
moved in the holder's favour.
A number of banks have invested heavily in these derivatives markets over
the past year. Usually, they have brought in experts from other markets,
hoping to transplant skills learnt in other over-the-counter markets.
Typical are Mr Mark Brickell, of J. P. Morgan, and Mr Christopher English,
of Merrill Lynch. Both had spent several years in the swaps markets (Mr
Brickell is a former chairman of the International Swaps Dealers
Association) before being appointed to run emerging markets derivatives
groups at their respective banks this year. Given the scale of the LDC debt
markets - and the new international interest in emerging equity markets -
other banks look likely to follow suit.

FT  29 DEC 92 / US Money and Credit: Prices drift lower in thin trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY bond prices moved lower across the maturity spectrum yesterday
in extremely thin post-Christmas holiday trading.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year issue stood at 102 21/32 , down 15/32
from the close on December 24, to yield 7.40, up from 7.36.
The falling prices continued a reversal of the Christmas week rally which
saw the yield on the long bond fall to 7.34 on Tuesday night - the first
time in two months that it had dropped below 7.40.
However, weak demand at an auction of five-year Treasury notes helped send
the market into reverse last Wednesday.
Yesterday, there was no fresh news on the US economy to spur strong
movement, and traders said that the negative bias stemmed from a combination
of factors, including tension in the Middle East following the shooting down
of an Iraqi fighter aircraft.
The market was also continuing to digest last week's Treasury auctions of
two and five-year notes, which attracted relatively little retail interest,
leaving market traders with significant amounts of the issues on their
books.
Wall Street was also nervously rethinking the more positive attitude it had
adopted last week towards President-elect Bill Clinton.
The pre-Christmas rally stemmed largely from a growing belief that any
stimulus to the economy he announced after taking office would be relatively
modest, and thus would not re-ignite inflationary pressures.
That thinking was coupled with hope that Mr Clinton may be more inclined
than previously expected to take action to reduce the Federal budget
deficit.
However, some analysts yesterday expressed continuing unease with Mr
Clinton's spending intentions.
The market was also absorbing the minutes of the Federal Reserve's November
policy-making meeting, released on Christmas Eve, which showed that it
tentatively agreed to reduce its 1993 money-supply growth targets to
emphasise that it wanted ' avoid any pick-up in inflation should the
expansion gain momentum'.
That line is consistent with Wall Street's expectation that there will be no
more relaxation of monetary policy in this interest rate cycle and that the
Fed may abandon its long-time bias towards easing quite soon.
Minutes of the Fed's latest policy-setting meeting, held last week, will not
be released for another five weeks.
The market is expected to remain extremely quiet for the remainder of the
holiday-shortened week, in spite of the publication of a raft of statistics,
including those for consumer confidence, leading economic indicators and
factory orders.

FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Gilts: Economic data give investors incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES edged sideways in thin trading as the market digested recent
indicators about inflationary conditions in the UK economy next year,
together with the likely extremely heavy flow of new gilt issues.
The economic data of the past week have again underlined the fragility of
the UK economy.
That gave investors more incentives to buy gilts on the assumption that
inflationary pressures over the next 12 months will be weak.
Set against these trends, however, are indications that in the 1993-94
financial year the Bank of England may have to issue new gilts of about
Pounds 1bn a month to fund the likely large public-sector borrowing
requirement.
New issues on this scale could strain the government's system for
channelling gilts into the market place and force up yields, with consequent
downward pressure on prices.
Last week, 10-year gilt yields stayed generally steady at just above 10 per
cent. There was some buying pressure from investors, resulting from
government data suggesting that the increase in imports in recent months may
have started to level off, a sign that any overall economic recovery is
proceeding extremely slowly.
According to the Central Statistical Office (CSO), underlying import
volumes, excluding oil and erratic items such as ships and aircraft, saw no
growth in the three months to the end of November compared with the previous
three months.
The CSO also said that, in the third quarter, the savings ratio - the
percentage of consumers' personal disposable income channelled into savings
 -was 12.3 per cent, the highest quarterly figure since late 1984. The
number was up from 11.4 per cent in the second quarter and indicates that
consumers were still reluctant to step up spending - a development which, if
repeated in the fourth quarter, is expected to hold back next year's
expected economic upturn.

FT  29 DEC 92 / European Government Bonds: Year of Maastricht and recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO words which have determined the performance of the government bond
markets this year are 'Maastricht' and 'recession'.
When Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty on June 2, European
government bond markets were thrown into confusion over the prospects for
European economic and monetary union. Investors moved out of the
higher-yielding bond markets, such as Italy and Spain, and into the safe
haven of the D-Mark bloc, forcing up prices on German, Dutch and Belgian
government bonds.
Hopes of lower interest rates - or actual cuts in interest rates - helped to
propel several of the government bond markets, particularly those in Europe
which were suffering from severe recession, as well as the Japanese
government bond market.
The chart shows the performance of the main government bonds markets over
the last year, and illustrates the impact of uncertainty over European
economic and monetary union as well as the effect of falling interest rates
in certain markets.
The UK government bond market was the top performer among the world's 14
largest government bond markets in local currency terms, according to data
compiled by J. P. Morgan. Gilts showed a return of 18 per cent in local
currency terms, helped by falling UK interest rates during the year.
The UK base rate peaked at 15 per cent in 1989-1990. It has been cut
steadily since October 1990 as inflation has gradually fallen and the
government has recognised the need to try to stimulate the UK economy.
While sterling was a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, the
room for manoeuvre on the interest rate front was severely restricted, due
to the Bundesbank's determination to keep German interest rates high in
order to conquer inflation.
At the start of 1992, the base rate stood at 10.5 per cent, falling to 10
per cent in May. However, as the Danes voted against the Maastricht Treaty,
the weaker member-currencies of the EMS - including sterling - came under
pressure.
After briefly increasing the base rate to defend the pound's exchange rate
against the D-Mark, the government decided to pull sterling out of the ERM
in September. Since then, the government has enjoyed greater freedom to cut
rates, and the base rate has been slashed from 10 per cent on September 18
to 7 per cent on November 13.
Clearly, the gilt market has benefited from the steady cuts in interest
rates over the year - and by expectations of much lower interest rates
during much of the autumn and winter. Some economists predicted that the
base rate would fall as low as 5 per cent by early 1993 as the government
attempted to kick-start the UK economy.
The other top-performing government bond markets in local currency terms
this year were those in the D-Mark bloc, reflecting the rush by investors to
the more stable ERM currencies at a time of turbulence in the foreign
exchange markets, and expectations of lower interest rates in Germany.
Following the reunification of Germany, the Bundesbank has been forced to
tighten monetary policy in order to try to curb inflation. German interest
rates have gradually risen, but in September the Bundesbank allowed a small
easing - with the discount rate cut from 8.75 to 8.25 per cent and the
Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.50 per cent.
Most economists believe German interest rates have now peaked and should
gradually fall as inflation and money supply figures improve.
Investors saw a 15.71 per cent return in the Dutch government bond market
(in local currency terms), followed by 13.87 per cent from Belgium, and
13.01 per cent from Germany. Buyers had flocked to the high-yielding bond
markets such as Spain and Italy in 1991 and early 1992 as they looked for
so-called 'convergence plays' - hoping to gain from falling inflation and
cuts in interest rates in these markets. However, after the Danish vote,
investors rushed to sell high-yielding bonds and bought bunds, as well as
Dutch and Belgian bonds.
Returns from the traditional high-yielding European markets lagged those of
the D-Mark bloc. The Spanish government bond market showed a return of 6.89
per cent in local currency terms, while Italy rose by 9.68 per cent.
For sterling-based investors, the top-performing government bond market was
Japan, which showed a 36.26 per cent return. The Japanese government bond
market showed a 10.83 per cent rise in local currency terms as the Bank of
Japan has eased interest rates.
A year ago the Bank of Japan cut the official discount rate from 5 per cent
to 4.5 per cent, and the central bank eased further during 1992, allowing
the discount rate to fall to 3.25 per cent. Hopes of further easing
sustained the Japanese government bond market throughout much of the year,
especially as the stock market plummeted and the economy remained weak.
For sterling-based investors, the returns from the D-Mark bloc markets were
also boosted by sterling's 15 per cent depreciation against these
currencies, with the Dutch bond market showing a 34.71 per cent rise in
sterling terms, followed by Belgium (32.63 per cent), and Germany (31.34 per
cent).
The US Treasury bond market gained 30.39 per cent in sterling terms,
although it only showed a 7.21 per cent return in dollar terms. 'The US
Treasury bond market performed badly during the first four months of the
year as investors started anticipating a pick-up in the economy,' according
to J. P Morgan. However, as the US economy remained weak, the US Treasury
bond market rallied until the autumn.

FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Upjohn to restate results
following Dollars 224m charge
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, said it would take a Dollars 224m
after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 1992 to adopt new accounting
standards for retiree healthcare benefits, Reuter reports.
The company said the charge, which amounts to Dollars 1.26 a share, would be
effective January 1 1992, and the previous quarterly results would be
restated.
Upjohn said the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule
number 106 would result in a one-time transition obligation of Dollars 378m,
or Dollars 237m after tax. The charge will be partially offset by a one-time
gain of Dollars 13m, or 7 cents a share, for adoption of FASB 109, which
allows US companies to change the way they account for income taxes.
The adjustment wipes out more than half of Upjohn's earnings for the first
nine months of the year.
Upjohn reported a net profit of Dollars 411.47m for the year to September
30, up from Dollars 401m in the same period last year.
The company is due to report its 1992 financial results in February.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial strength ratings of three Japanese life companies were
downgraded yesterday to Aa2 from Aaa by Moody's Investors Service, the US
rating agency, which said the industry was experiencing 'considerable
stresses'.
Moody's said the earning capacity of the three companies - Sumitomo Life,
Dai-ichi Mutual and Meiji Mutual - had been weakened by the turbulence in
financial markets, while the medium-term deregulation of the industry would
put the companies under increasing competitive pressure.
'Increasingly, a profit-driven and more competitive environment will produce
a secular decline in asset quality,' the agency said.
The collapse of stock prices has undermined the unrealised gains on the life
industry's stock portfolios, while the industry also complains that dividend
payments by Japanese companies must be increased in order to improve their
returns on investments.
For the first half to the end of September, the eight largest life companies
reported an 11.5 per cent decline in investment returns, while their latent
profits on stocks were down by 28.4 per cent.
If the stock market fails to improve, they will be forced to record large
appraisal losses on stocks at the end of the fiscal year.
As a result, the companies are reviewing employee levels and generally
attempting to reduce expenses.
Moody's said that the downgrading meant that the three companies were now in
the middle range of the 'excellent' category instead of the 'exceptional'
category.

CHAROEN Pokphand, the Thai industrial group which is one of the largest
foreign investors in China, has outlined plans for further projects in China
worth about Dollars 4bn, including petrochemical and telecommunications
projects.
Mr Dhanin Chearavanont, group chairman, said in an interview that the
company's Hong Kong subsidiary, Guah Kua Shen, was expected to hold a 70 per
cent stake in a Dollars 3bn petrochemical complex at Linpoh, near Shanghai.
According to a preliminary agreement with the Chinese authorities, the
remaining 30 per cent would be held by the state-owned China Petrochemical
Corp. Mr Dhanin said the first phase of the project would be a refinery with
a capacity of about 200,000 b/d.
Solvay of Belgium, one of CP's partners in Thailand, is thought likely to
collaborate with the company.
Another proposed CP project is a fibre-optic cable television network in
north-east China aimed at about 700,000 potential subscribers.

Banco de Santander
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Spain has rallied to the support of Banco de Santander, which
was yesterday forced to guarantee an Pta8bn (Dollars 70.7m) bond as surety
against possible fraud charges.
Mr Miguel Moreiras, the Madrid monetary court judge, ruled before Christmas
that there was 'clear evidence of criminality' in Santander's use, between
1986 and 1989, of an alleged tax avoidance instrument called loan
assignments.
The ruling stunned the Spanish banking establishment and posed a serious
threat to Santander. However, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the central bank governor,
has paid tribute to the Botin family which founded the bank.
Mr Rojo described the Botins as 'an exceptionally competent professional
family that over the years has developed the Santander group into one of
(Spain's) most dynamic and strong institutions.'
Santander, which had total assets at September 30 of more than Dollars 53bn,
is one of Spain's biggest banks. It owns 10 per cent of the Royal Bank of
Scotland and 16 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorporation of the US.
A Santander spokesman said that while the amount of the bond ordered by the
court was substantial - it is believed to be the highest bond posted in
Spain - 'we are certain depositors and investors will view it within the
context of our strong balance sheet.'
The guarantee was extended by Bankinter, a bank which is also controlled by
the Botin family and whose chairman, Mr Jaime Botin, is the brother of Mr
Emilio Botin, Santander's managing director, and also deputy chairman of
Santander.
Within hours of Mr Moreiras' ruling on December 23, Santander lodged an
appeal that categorically rejected his definition of loan assignments as
bank time deposits that should have been subject to a withholding tax on
interest.
The cornerstone of Santander's appeal against Mr Moreiras' as yet incomplete
investigations is that the loan assignments were not bound by normal fiscal
guidelines on deposits until a government decree specifically made them so
in July 1989.
The scheme, under which the bank sold loans on its portfolio as investments
to selected customers, is understood to have been widely practised by other
leading domestic banks.

FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: New year, old problems at
Olivetti - A return to profit depends on more cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS time last year, earnest discussions were under way at Olivetti aimed at
tackling the one-off restructuring charges which loomed over the computer
group's 1991 earnings.
Eventually, it was decided to ascribe the entire cost of redundancies and
factory closures to the 1991 accounts, a move that contributed substantially
to the L459.8bn (Dollars 321.8m) group loss for the year.
By biting the bullet in this way, Olivetti hoped to prepare the way for a
return to profits - or at least break even - in 1992. Now, it appears that a
similar discussion will be replayed when senior managers open their next
round of budget meetings in January.
The continuing crisis in the information technology industry means the
process of rationalisation and restructuring has, for Olivetti and many
other leading computer makers, not been a one-off affair.
Although some parts of its business are performing much better, thanks to
previous bouts of cost-cutting and reorganisation, others are still
depressing earnings.
Mr Corrado Passera, the most trusted of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's lieutenants,
who was posted into Olivetti as joint managing director three months ago,
has indicated how severe matters have become.
Prices of personal computers, one of the products for which Olivetti is best
known, have plummeted by 40 per cent a year over the past two years as a
result of overcapacity and cut-throat competition. The collapse in prices,
along with a sharp cut in production at Olivetti's Triumph Adler subsidiary
in Germany, largely accounted for this year's L700bn fall in group sales to
around L8,000bn, he said.
Other areas are performing somewhat better. Mr Passera said the company was
already making 'significant' earnings in services, while its systems and
projects arm, which accounts for around a third of group sales, was
expanding and 'not far from profit'.
In recent months, Olivetti has notched up a series of deals in both sectors.
In October it signed a contract to service all British Telecom's computer
equipment in continental Europe. Soon after, it sealed an important
servicing deal for the domestic branches of Barclays Bank, one of its
biggest customers.
Earlier in the year, another breakthrough came with the selection of
Olivetti as one of the approved suppliers of computer workstations to the US
franchises of the McDonald's fast-food group.
The performance testifies to Olivetti's continuing shift away from low
value-added items, such as personal computers and office equipment, to more
profitable lines such as software and services, which now account for around
a third of turnover.
But, in spite of the shift in its priorities, Olivetti has no intention of
pulling out of the lower value-added sector, according to Mr Passera. The
group is Europe's largest maker of PCs, providing potential economies of
scale, while its 4,000 distribution outlets gives it strong retail coverage
for office equipment and visibility in the market place.
However, it is with such 'commodity' items that further improvements to
competitiveness are required. Stressing that some production would be
maintained in Italy, in spite of relatively high costs, Mr Passera called on
union leaders to show 'understanding and co-operation' with the company's as
yet undisclosed plans to reduce costs further.
Winning such support will be just one of the problems facing the group in
1993. For Olivetti's hopes to break even by December and return to profit in
1994 will depend as much on the market as on continuing efforts to cut costs
and yet more internal reorganisations.
The group will have to pursue its strategy of alliances with other companies
in specific product areas and technologies. It will also have to work on its
relationship with Digital Equipment of the US, which last June bought a 4
per cent stake and could go up to 10 per cent by the end of 1994.

FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Moulinex chairman warns of 'bad'
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOULINEX, the French household electronics group, is experiencing a 'black
year', according to Mr Roland Darneau, chairman, with pressure on both sales
and margins.
Mr Darneau told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that the group, which has
already reported a heavy loss for the six months ended June, faced further
problems in the current half-year, although it might manage to stay in the
black.
Moulinex, which last year significantly expanded its household electronics
interests by buying Krups of Germany, made a loss after tax of FFr11m
(Dollars 2m) in the first six months of 1992, against net profits of FFr35m
in the same period of the previous year, on static sales of FFr3.7bn.
The group has been hit by the impact of the economic slowdown across Europe,
including its main markets of France and Germany, and by the financial
effect of the DM130m Krups deal.
The acquisition of Krups, which specialises in coffee machines and electric
mixers, was largely responsible for the rise in Moulinex's turnover from
FFr5.96bn in 1990 to FFr8.36bn in 1991, when it made net profits of FFr149m.
Mr Darneau, who yesterday secured shareholders' agreement to extend
Moulinex's year-end to March 31, anticipated 'bad results' by the end of the
present year, when the value of unsold stocks should be around 12 per cent
higher than the previous year at FFr2.1bn.
However, he said there were some signs of improvement, particularly in
Germany, which now accounts for a fifth of sales.
The French national telephone company France Telecom has decided to increase
its holding in state-owned Thomson to 19.9 per cent from 17.7 per cent,
Reuter reports from Paris.
France Telecom said the operation would bring FFr350m to the government.

FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Fairbriar restructures and seeks resumption
of dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIRBRIAR, the troubled property group which has been in administrative
receivership since September last year, has applied for the suspension of
its shares to be lifted with the announcement of a capital restructuring.
The group proposes an offer of 7.67m new ordinary shares of 1p each, and the
re-organisation of its existing share capital.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will convert about Pounds 12m in borrowings into
4.13m new ordinary shares and 8.82m convertible preference shares. It will
also convert some debt into a maximum of Pounds 10.6m in loan notes, in
addition to providing further credit facilities.
Pre-tax losses fell from Pounds 7.43m to Pounds 4m in the half year to
September 30. Turnover amounted to Pounds 4.49m (Pounds 6.86m).

FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Last ditch attempt to keep Pepe in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPE, the jeans designer and distributor, is to make a last ditch attempt to
stay in business based on a Pounds 9.1m open offer underwritten by a new
management team and Novel, the Hong Kong textile group, writes Matthew
Curtin.
Pepe's much-delayed results for the year to end-March showed a Pounds 13m
plunge from pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.74m to losses of Pounds 10.3m.
The directors said the group would continue to make losses this year. Pepe
was in 'severe financial difficulties' and unless the offer was approved by
shareholders, it would have to cease trading. Should the group go into
receivership, shareholders were unlikely to realise any return on their
investment after creditors were paid.
Mr Andrew Davison, non-executive director, said Pepe's longer-term survival
would depend on the successful revival of its marketing efforts to
re-establish the Pepe brand name and lift sales.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 156.1m (Pounds 158.8m). The closure of the
group's Norwegian and Canadian operations and losses on the sale of minor
brand businesses resulted in extraordinary charges of Pounds 2.6m.
Pepe's rescue - from an ill-timed and badly-managed expansion overseas after
becoming the leading UK jeans brand behind Levi's in the late 1980s - is
being led by an investment management consortium, put together by Mr Silas
Chou. He replaced Mr Arun Shah, who founded the group, as chairman when
Novel bought its 29.6 per cent stake in March this year.
The consortium includes Mr Maurice Marciano, the former president of Guess
Jeans who becomes chief executive (Americas), and Mr Lawrence Stroll - a
director of Tommy Hilfiger, the US clothes group - who becomes group chief
executive.
They and Novel have formed a new company, SML, to underwrite the offer and
will end up owning between 56.4 per cent and 65 per cent of Pepe. The Shah
family will retain a stake in the group.
The offer involves the issue of 726 new shares, at 5p a share, for every 100
held.
The group and its bankers are negotiating Pounds 35m worth of new facilities
which will only be provided once the offer is successful.

FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: A disturbing case of tunnel vision -
Japanese bankers and the Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it Eurotunnel, the operator of the channel tunnel linking
Britain and France, has every reason to be pleased with relations with its
Japanese bankers.
An overwhelming majority of the 37 Japanese banks involved in the project
last month voted to allow Eurotunnel to continue to draw down its
borrowings, even though it was in breach of banking covenants.
The vote among the Japanese banks, which are providing 23 per cent of
Eurotunnel's Pounds 6.8bn borrowing facilities, is thought to have matched
the level of support provided by the French.
The Japanese banks' mounting bad debts, caused by the collapse in the
property market, have led many to withdraw from international lending.
Eurotunnel appears to be a notable exception.
The reality is more complicated. Behind the public facade some leading
Japanese banks, as well as several smaller regional institutions, harbour
deep misgivings about Eurotunnel's prospects.
Those doubts may yet surface, if as some Japanese bankers expect, Eurotunnel
runs into another financial crisis next year.
Such a crisis may well prompt a tussle between the public and the private
sides of the Japanese banks' attitudes towards the project.
Senior Eurotunnel executives describe the company's relationship with the
Japanese banks as 'comfortable'. The direct corporate relationship between
Eurotunnel and its bankers is underpinned by the Japanese Ministry of
Finance and the Bank of Japan which have shepherded their banks behind the
project since 1986.
The Bank of England and the European Investment Bank have also helped
through their links with the Japanese long term credit banks.
Before last month's vote Sir Alastair Morton, the Eurotunnel chief
executive, visited about 11 top Japanese banks to deliver his message that
construction was almost finished and would be completed without further
significant cost increases.
A senior Eurotunnel executive involved in the meetings said: 'The Japanese
banks will support this project because they recognise its historic
significance for European integration. To pull out of this project would be
far too embarrassing politically for them."
The banks are also under strong commercial pressure. Japanese manufacturers
who have invested huge sums building plants in the UK as a base to sell
their products in the single European market would not welcome any move by
the banks which might jeopardise the tunnel.
Eurotunnel also argues that the banks face minimal risks. The executive
explained: 'The banks are assured the cashflow from this project well into
the next century. If it takes longer than expected for that cash to arrive
then the banks will make money by providing us with extensions to our
borrowing facilities. The real risk is being carried by the shareholders not
the banks because they will get their money.'
Yet some of the leading Japanese banks are yet to be convinced. Several
regional banks abstained in the vote, as a protest at what they regard as
the lack of information provided by Eurotunnel about the outlook for
passenger revenues when the tunnel opens in late 1993.
A senior executive at one of the top four Japanese instructing banks, which
organises the other banks in the syndicate, said: 'We are staying with the
project to protect our position in case it folds. Eurotunnel has become a
form of speculative finance, no one knows whether it will be successful."
The four Japanese instructing banks are the Long Term Credit Bank, the
Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Tokyo and Sanwa Bank. The other main
banks involved are Mitsubishi Bank, DKB, Sumitomo and Fuji Bank.
Senior bankers admit to their pressing need to improve their banks'
profitability to pay for their bad debts has changed their approach. One
explained: 'When we entered the project there was no shortage of funds in
Japan looking for lending opportunities. At that time the historic
significance of the tunnel project may have been the greatest reason for our
involvement. I am not sure a sound theoretical analysis was the basis for
our involvement. But there is now a huge marketing risk with Eurotunnel that
it may not generate the revenues it expects. Now we are asking to see the
bottom line.'
One of the main banks involved in the project has two staff working full
time trying to independently assess Eurotunnel prospects because it
complains Eurotunnel will not provide the information it has asked for.
In spite of the agreement to allow Eurotunnel to continue drawing on its
borrowings Japanese bankers expect another financial crisis in the early
months of next year.
As a condition of agreeing to the waiver, the banks have asked Eurotunnel to
present a refinancing plan by May. That package will outline how Eurotunnel
aims to raise more finance once the tunnel is open. The banks have insisted
that this money will not come from them and it must not be superior to bank
debt.
A senior Tokyo banker commented: 'It is going to be very difficult for them
to come up with a credible plan to raise more money from the market if
construction is delayed and the revenue outlook remains very cloudy. If that
plan fails to satisfy us then the waiver will fold, the project will run out
of money and Eurotunnel will be in default."
For its part Eurotunnel said it was happy to provide such a plan
immediately. However, the banks preferred to delay it until next year.

FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore - Correction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merivale Moore, the property group, was the victim last week of a fake press
release which said it had gone into receivership.
'The announcement was a total fabrication and the matter is being
investigated,' the company said. 'Merivale Moore continues to have the full
support of its bankers.'
A news item, based on the fake press release, appeared in later editions of
last Thursday's Financial Times. The FT regrets the distress the item caused
Merivale Moore.
The press release was received by the FT's UK Companies newsdesk at about
7pm Wednesday evening. Normally news items are checked thoroughly before
they are published. If no verification is possible, the item is left to the
next day.
Given the season and the hour, it was not possible to verify the information
in the fake press release. Contrary to our rules, a short item appeared.

FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Management takes over Atco Qualcast for
Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE management of Atco Qualcast has completed a Pounds 17m buy-out from Blue
Circle Industries of the Suffolk-based lawnmower manufacturer.
The deal is being equity-financed by institutions investing through Candover
Investments, the investment trust specialising in management buy-outs and
development capital projects.
Bank term debt worth Pounds 8m and working capital facilities are being
provided by Bank of Scotland.
Mr Stephen Roberts, head of the management team, said Atco Qualcast had
successfully consolidated its operations after closing its Derby factory in
1991. It had increased market share this year, returned to profits on sales
of Pounds 40m after two years of losses associated with restructuring costs
and poor rainfall.
Mr Roberts said prospects for 1993 were good and it was important to
complete the buy-out before the company's busy February to June season
began.
Blue Circle acquired the business when it bought Birmid Qualcast, the
Birmingham engineering group, in 1988.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Japanese ministry penalises broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday disciplined Cosmo Securities, a
second-tier stockbroker, by ordering it to suspend certain corporate
business and bond trading operations.
The penalty follows the first completed investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Surveillance Commission, which was established to clean up the
industry following the scandals that hit the Tokyo stock market last year.
Cosmo is accused of irregularities in dealing with corporate clients. Mr
Yasuo Bunya, Cosmo's chairman, has indicated his intention to resign next
month.
While Cosmo is the first to be punished, most other Japanese brokers have
admitted compensating favoured corporate clients for investment losses, and
it remains to be seen whether they will also be pursued by the new
commission.
Cosmo was also not the only company to have concealed clients' losses
through the technique known as 'tobashi' - transferring lossmaking stocks
from client account to client account in an attempt to avoid booking the
loss.
The ministry ordered Cosmo to suspend corporate business in Tokyo from
January 11 to January 18. It will be forbidden from dealing in convertible
bonds on its own account for four weeks from January 11.
Three former Cosmo executives are alleged to have compensated select clients
for losses by buying their convertible bonds at higher than market prices.
The commission said the company continued the compensation even though the
ministry said the practice was unlawful.
The Finance Ministry blames the compensation scandal for undermining
individual investors' confidence in the stock market.
Meanwhile, the 'tobashi' dealings have led to court cases against Japanese
brokers from companies which say they suffered unfairly by being lumbered
with the losing stocks.

FT  29 DEC 92 / British banks bullish about US expansion: transatlantic
opportunities for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE happiest face in the line of directors trying to explain this month why
Royal Bank of Scotland had made a pre-tax profit of only Pounds 20.9m was
American. Mr Larry Fish, chief executive of the bank's New England
subsidiary, had two reasons to be cheerful. Not only had Citizens Bank
contributed Pounds 19.7m to profits, but alone among Royal Bank's banking
operations, it envisages rapid growth.
Over the next three years, Mr Fish wants to double Citizens' current assets
of Dollars 4.4bn (Pounds 2.9bn) by buying banks in Massachusetts and
Connecticut. He plans to expand the Rhode Island bank's Dollars 350m capital
through issues of subordinated debt. 'We are not going to let our mouth get
ahead of our tummy and buy something in Ohio. We are going to expand
sensibly and contiguously,' says Mr Fish.
Mr Fish is not the only director of a British clearing bank to be talking
about expansion in the US. Mr John Tugwell, chairman of National Westminster
Bank's Dollars 22bn subsidiary in New York, is also bullish. 'We have got to
do something to increase our size, because I would say we are not really big
enough to give our parent company a steady level of return,' he says.
Such talk marks a turning point in how British banks regard their US
operations. After enduring losses in the late 1980s, and debating how
quickly they could sell, the mood has changed. As they struggle with bad
debt at home, US operations are becoming an attractive source of income. But
the banks are choosing different strategies for the US, based partly on what
they own there, and partly on their global aims.
Some analysts think the US market is a logical place for the banks to
expand, given their difficulties with domestic loan provisions and
recession. 'In the long term, the US economy may well do better than the
British one, and if you are National Westminster you are not going to
increase your market share at home very much,' says Mr Ray Soifer, a bank
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
The market also presents opportunities for growth because of the supply of
small banks needing rescue. The fragmented industry - there are some 14,000
banks - is consolidating as large US banks merge and absorb smaller ones.
But this also means that British banks which want to remain in US retail
banking may have little choice but to expand.
The expansionist mood is nonetheless odd given the history of clearing banks
in the US. Starting with Midland Bank's ill-fated purchase of the
California-based Crocker National Bank in 1980, they have poured huge
amounts into largely unsuccessful attempts to run US branch networks.
NatWest lost Dollars 845m on its US business between 1989 and last year,
mainly through bad debt provisions.
Aside from this murky history, there are doubts about whether British banks
are ever likely to be significantly better at running branch networks in the
US. 'It has to be a universal truism that retail banks operating in a market
other than their domestic one fail. They simply do not have the local market
knowledge to assess risk properly,' says Mr Nick Collier, a bank analyst at
Morgan Stanley in London.
Barclays accepted that view after making a loss of Pounds 217m on its US
operations last year. It is selling its New York retail bank and will
instead offer corporate lending and investment banking services. 'Retail
banking is capital intensive, and successes outside home markets are few,'
says Mr Richard Webb, deputy chief executive of Barclays in the US. The bank
sees this less ambitious strategy as cost-effective.
Yet other banks are trying to disprove conventional wisdom. NatWest's
strategy is partly forced on it by the need to make its US operations worth
more if it chooses to sell. NatWest Bancorp is expected to make more than
Dollars 130m this year, and its post-tax profits will be boosted for the
next three years by a tax loss carry-forward of Dollars 700m. But Mr Tugwell
thinks it needs to grow to maintain earnings.
He says the consolidation of the US banking industry means it must expand
even to maintain its current standing. This may mean growing to some Dollars
40bn in assets and only then does he believe it would be sensible to
consider selling. Yet it is clear that he would put forward a strong
argument for keeping the US base.
Mr Fish thinks Citizens should also double in asset size, although from a
much smaller base. Citizens has grown nearly as much as it can in Rhode
Island: 60 per cent of the state's households have some link with the bank.
'This is a wonderful banking franchise, but it is pretty much capped, and
the economy is not too vibrant,' he says. Instead, he wants acquisitions in
the bordering states.
The question with expansion is whether the banks will get into the same
trouble as they did in the past. Talk of rapid growth marks a new phase for
Citizens, which Mr Fish says has gained in asset quality from being 'a very,
very conservative institution'. He is careful to play down any suggestion of
careless expansion. 'We are not going to go around putting bad loans on our
books,' he insists.
This cautiously expansive mood is even shared by a bank which has slimmed US
oper-ations over the past three years, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. HSBC's Marine Midland subsidiary has dropped in asset size from
Dollars 26bn to Dollars 16.5bn as managers from HSBC pushed it back toward
being a regional bank based in upstate New York, cutting activities into
which it diversified in the late 1980s.
Mr John Bond, Marine Midland chief executive, says the bank suffered from
diversifying into 'exotic things' such as wholesale lending and leasing. Mr
Bond has been devoting effort to reforms such as reducing the bank's
cost-income ratio and improving service. Yet he does not dismiss the notion
of Marine Midland growing by consolidating its branch network in New York
state.
'I would like to be more profitable, and market dominance gives you
economies of scale,' says Mr Bond, who will become HSBC's London-based chief
executive next month. He is likely to watch any growth closely from London
after HSBC's last brush with giving local managers their head. This was
partly caused by a regulatory deal which barred HSBC from exercising control
for five years after buying a stake in 1978.
The past has also affected NatWest's view. 'We had local management and it
got us into trouble. We did not have the right level of control from
London,' says Mr Tugwell. The Royal Bank is unusual in having retained a US
management team at Citizens throughout. Yet the exertion of more control
from the UK means that if any new growth goes wrong, most British banks will
have only themselves to blame.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Invesco director quits after board power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS Johnson has resigned as a director of Invesco MIM and head of
the fund management group's non-American operations following a boardroom
power struggle with Mr Charles Brady, Invesco's recently-appointed chief
executive.
Mr Johnson's departure on Christmas Eve means that Mr Brady, who built up
the group's Atlanta operations, has emerged as the key figure in the group.
Mr Brady and Mr Johnson were joint deputy chairmen until Mr Brady pipped Mr
Johnson for the chief executive's post in July after Lord Stevens stepped
down following pressure from non-executive directors. Lord Stevens has
stayed on as chairman but is to relinquish the post at the group's annual
meeting in April.
The latest boardroom changes come after a difficult year for Invesco in
Britain, and further consolidate the grip held over the group by its US
businesses. Invesco MIM manages around Pounds 34bn worldwide, but about
two-thirds of that is managed from the US.
While the North America operations are highly profitable and now dwarf those
in Europe and the Pacific, the group has been dogged by adverse publicity in
Britain which has undermined the group's ability to attract new clients.
The group's links with Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced tycoon, caused
embarrassment in the aftermath of the publisher's death. Invesco was also
fined Pounds 75,000 by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation for
accounting failures relating to its Personal Equity Plans.
More recently, the group agreed to pay compensation to investors in Drayton
Consolidated, the investment trust managed by Invesco, which specialised in
unquoted stocks before it was put into liquidation by shareholders last
month.
Mr Brady is expected to announce further boardroom changes at Invesco.
Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong securities house backed by some of the
colony's most powerful businessmen, lifted its stake in Invesco to just over
24 per cent last month.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Olivetti loss forecast to exceed L300bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, has warned of a
much heavier-than-expected loss for 1992 in a further sign of the crisis
affecting some of the world's leading information technology suppliers.
Mr Corrado Passera, Olivetti's newly-appointed managing director, said this
year's operating loss would be between L300bn and L350bn (Pounds 160.5m). In
1991, Olivetti's operating losses totalled L28.3bn, while group net losses
reached L459.8bn.
'To the figure for 1992 operating losses one has to add extraordinary costs
and restructuring charges,' Mr Passera said. He did not give an estimate for
this year's net losses, and implied the overall figure depended partly on
accounting decisions regarding the attribution of extraordinary items. But
'the net loss will not be light', he stressed.
Olivetti's earnings have deteriorated this year, in spite of predictions in
early 1992 that it would close the year at around break-even. Since then,
the company reported a first-half loss of L93.4bn and chairman Mr Carlo De
Benedetti warned of a difficult second half.
According to Mr Passera, this year's sales would probably fall by around 8
per cent to just under L8,000bn against L8,607bn in 1991.
Net debt is expected to surge to L1.200bn, up from L571.9bn, largely as a
result of continuing heavy restructuring costs, he added.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Economic Notebooks: Bumps ahead on the road to UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS the time come to call a turning point in the UK economy?
After 18 months of withering green shoots and a mixed bag of economic
statistics in December, it is both safe and tempting to stay gloomy about
Britain's economic prospects.
But there are growing signs that the economy has turned and that the end of
the longest recession since the Second World War is in sight.
What is certain is that the next few months will not feel much like a
recovery. Unemployment will continue to rise as the redundancies announced
in recent months work through into the number of unemployed claiming
benefit. Gloom will spread from the European continent where the German
economy is turning down sharply, dragging the remaining members of the
exchange rate mechanism in its wake.
But there are hopeful signs for Britain, especially compared with a year
ago. Last week's FT survey of forecasts for the UK economy was notable in
that none of the 38 universities, inter-governmental institutions,
independent think tanks and City investment houses predicted a further
contraction of the economy in 1993. On average, the forecasters came to the
same conclusion as the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast in projecting
modest 1 per cent growth next year.
Twelve months ago, by contrast, forecasters were frantically slashing
forecasts and the Treasury itself was acknowledging that it had been
over-optimistic in predicting 2.25 per cent growth for 1992 less than two
months earlier in its autumn 1991 forecast.
Cautious optimism about next year has been reinforced by reports of a late
rush in pre-Christmas shopping, the strength of UK equities in December,
particularly among the mid-250 where capital goods issues are strongly
represented, and the 29 per cent jump in new car sales in the first 20 days
of this month.
Local chambers of commerce report more hope among businesses. Mr Richard
Brown, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says early
returns for the chambers' late January survey point to a sharp jump in
business confidence in the fourth quarter, although from an admittedly low
base in the third quarter. The chambers of commerce and the Confederation of
British Industry say industry's export order books have improved since
September.
Looking ahead, there are hopes that sterling's devaluation since September
and increasingly strong economic growth in the US and Latin America will
open up opportunities for exporters to offset more difficult times on the
European continent.
At home, the beneficial effects of the three percentage point cut in bank
base rates in the last three months has still to be passed on fully to
mortgage holders. This will happen in the first quarter when building
societies and banks which adjust mortgage rates annually will be making
changes.
The potential benefits for mortgage holders of the interest rate cut are
huge. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, calculates that
homeowners will be Pounds 20bn better off next year than three years ago
when the government held base rates at 15 per cent for 12 months, causing
households to pay Pounds 40bn in mortgage interest in 1990.
But caution is still the watchword. As Mr Spencer points out: 'Economic
recoveries are rather like pregnancies. They are never confirmed until some
time after they have taken place.' He expects no clear signs of recovery
until the spring.
Similarly, Prof Douglas McWilliams, who recently stepped down as chief
economic adviser to the CBI to set up his own Centre for Economics and
Business Research, warns: 'We have stabilised, we are not yet going up.'
Prof McWilliams says that most of the companies that he deals with are
planning for a flat year in 1993. He predicts some bumpy months for the
economy and at best a very slow recovery with company boards under pressure
to boost profits. In a difficult domestic and international climate,
companies will be under strong pressure to continue cutting costs and
shedding staff.
Mr Spencer argues that it is wiser to view 1993 as a year of winners and
losers rather than to hope for buoyant growth. Among the winners will be
exporters that had already cut costs sharply in expectation of Britain
staying in the ERM. They will now benefit strongly from the pound's
devaluation.
Another group of potential winners are first-time house buyers, who stand to
benefit from low interest rates, low house prices and who will not be
encumbered by the loss of equity in existing homes caused by falling house
prices.
Whether buyers will return to the housing market remains one of the great
uncertainties of 1993. Recent large-scale debt repayments by industry and
consumers suggest that the traumas of overindebtedness in the late 1980s
continue to cast a cloud over borrowing throughout the economy.
The UK may be in a similar position to the US in the summer when many of the
motors of growth were beginning to turn but there was little sign of
activity.
In one respect, however, the UK faces recovery in a far worse condition than
could have been imagined a year ago. The government's own finances have
deteriorated dramatically during 1992. The FT survey of economists'
forecasts suggested that the public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94
could jump to Pounds 46.9bn, with one forecaster forecasting a PSBR as high
as Pounds 58bn next year.
While the Treasury hopes that financial markets will be tolerant of the
deficit so long as the economy is depressed, Mr Brown says the government's
budgetary problems are beginning to weigh on business sentiment, with
members fearing raised taxes.
In these circumstances, it is a happy chance that the government is allowing
itself two budgets this year. It could use the last of its traditional
revenue raising budgets in March to boost confidence and recovery before
turning in the first of its unified budgets in December to the daunting task
of repairing the UK's public finances.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Lebanon blocks UN mercy visit: Israel says 10 stranded
Palestinian deportees can return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANON said yesterday it would prevent a United Nations envoy from crossing
its territory to visit 415 Palestinians stranded in severe winter conditions
for 11 days in no man's land in the south of the country.
Mr James Jonah, a special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, travels on to Beirut from Jerusalem today for talks with
the government of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister. Lebanon
still refuses to co-operate with Israel over the deportations and says
Israel must take back the men.
The Israeli army said early today that 10 of the deportees could return. It
said the decision to deport the 10 had been found to be incorrect but some
would have to face trial in Israel for hostile activities.
Officials have also stressed that the deportees can appeal individually to
the High Court. The High Court ruled against moves to stop the deportations
last week, but has yet to rule on the overall legality of the expulsions.
In spite of Mr Jonah's efforts, there were few signs of any substantive
breakthrough in the crisis which has convulsed Middle East peace
negotiations.
Palestinian leaders, frustrated that Israel has repeatedly escaped reprisals
for ignoring UN resolutions, told Mr Jonah at a meeting in Jerusalem
yesterday that it should be forced to implement a Security Council
resolution calling for the return of the deportees - alleged by Israel to be
militant Islamic fundamentalists - to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
'We demanded that they should be returned immediately, that Israel should
apply UN Sec-urity Council resolution 799 immediately,' said Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman. 'Unfortunately, we explained, so far
Israel has been given preferential treatment by the world community.'
However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, ruled out any
reversal of the deportations, undertaken after a spate of killings of
Israeli soldiers by Moslem extremists, when he met Mr Jonah on Sunday.
The deportees, camped in south Lebanon in an area between Israeli and
Lebanese forces, have been forced to endure heavy snowfalls and freezing
temperatures without adequate supplies of food and water, or access to
proper medical care, as both Israel and Lebanon have refused to take
responsibility for their welfare.
Mr Rabin has maintained wide support within his government for the
deportations. But his refusal to allow humanitarian aid to be taken to the
camp through Israeli-held territory has come under strong opposition.
Yesterday, France requested permission to do so and said it was awaiting a
response.
The Israeli government has acknowledged that the deportations have shattered
the favourable international image fostered by Mr Rabin since he came to
office in July. The military said deportees who were expelled due to
mistaken identity could return if they appealed to a special army committee
or the High Court.
A meeting of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians at the
weekend decided to seek UN action to enforce resolution 799. But it did not
rule out a return to the peace talks after the new US administration takes
over next month.

FT  29 DEC 92 / US warns Serbia against military action in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT George Bush has warned Belgrade that the US would use military
force if Serbia provoked military conflict in the province of Kosovo
bordering Albania.
A letter from Mr Bush to President Slobodan Milosevic and General Zivota
Panic, the army chief-of-staff, was delivered on Christmas Day, it emerged
yesterday. The letter also said action would be taken against Serbian
aircraft if the United Nations Security Council votes to back with force the
no-fly zone over Bosnia, which it is expected to do later this week.
Mr Bush said the US would also protect UN peacekeepers on the ground in
Bosnia and ensure safe passage of humanitarian aid.
The US warning was complemented in Geneva by a similar admonition to Serbia
from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, who plans to make a
one-day visit to Sarajevo on Thursday. He reportedly told Mr Dobrica Cosic,
president of the rump state of Yugoslavia, that military intervention was
inevitable unless fighting in Bosnia was brought to a halt.
In drawing a metaphorical 'line in the sand' in Kosovo, the previously
autonomous region which Serbia in effect re-annexed three years ago, the
Bush administration clearly hopes to contain the conflicts in former
Yugoslavia.
The letter raised fears among diplomats at the Geneva conference on former
Yugoslavia that Kosovo's repressed Albanians may try to provoke military
intervention in an effort to gain independence from Serbia.
US State Department officials privately doubt that in its final three weeks
the outgoing administration will do more than issue warnings, unless Serbian
provocation in Kosovo becomes intolerable. Nor is it thought likely that the
US will authorise the provision of arms to the Bosnians.
The same officials hope that the incoming government of Mr Bill Clinton will
be less reticent.
In Geneva, international peace mediators warned that Bosnian forces were
poised to launch a counter-offensive amid growing calls for military
intervention. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the Geneva conference, said UN
peacekeeping forces had reported a build-up of mostly Moslem Bosnian forces
on Mount Igman, outside Sarajevo.
He reported progress among the three sides in peace talks aimed at building
a political framework to accompany the draft constitution proposed by Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-presidents of the conference.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Japan current account surplus tops Dollars 106bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus in November rose 48 per cent from a year
earlier to Dollars 10.4bn (Pounds 6.8bn) bringing the cumulative total so
far this year to Dollars 106.2bn, the first time it has topped Dollars
100bn.
The government expects the surplus to go on rising in coming months,
overshadowing the previous yearly record of Dollars 87bn in 1987 and
possibly prompting an increase in trade tension with the US and European
Community.
Finance ministry officials said the surge in the surplus last month was
caused by a fall in demand for imports (down 5.7 per cent) and an unusually
large Dollars 1.1bn surplus in invisible items, which resulted from a
decline in the travel account deficit and an increase in the investment
account surplus.
The travel account deficit has fallen for three consecutive months because
of a decrease in tourism departures, a side-effect of the economic downturn,
while Japanese companies are thought to be repatriating an increasing amount
of their returns on foreign investment.
In the long-term capital account, foreigners' net sales of Japanese shares
were Dollars 1.48bn during the month, compared with net sales of Dollars 86m
in October. Net purchases of Japanese bonds were Dollars 1.5bn, a sharp
turnround from net sales of Dollars 3.6bn the previous month. Net Japanese
purchases of foreign stocks totalled Dollars 994m, compared with Dollars
761m in October.
The overall balance of payments showed a surplus of Dollars 149m, compared
with Dollars 12.6bn in the same month last year.

FT  29 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Good behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether changes in the method of score-keeping will change company behaviour
is another matter. Since restructuring costs count as direct deduction from
earnings under FRS3, companies might be tempted to delay incurring them. If
the new standard had been in force, 1991 earnings per share across the
market would have been 6 per cent lower. In the media sector, earnings would
have been cut by 45 per cent. One can only hope that companies modify their
accounting practice rather than delay overdue action. That might mean taking
exceptional restructuring costs year-by-year instead of a large one-off
extraordinary provision.
There are some areas where the new rules have already made their mark. ASB
proposals on accounting for capital instruments have stifled the supply of
debt/equity hybrids such as convertible capital bonds. If greater scrutiny
of cash flow statements encourages companies to maintain better standards of
housekeeping even when the economy turns, so much the better. Against that,
there must be a danger that companies are simply led to manipulate cash flow
figures by, say, delaying payments to creditors until after the year-end.
Prof Tweedie has already complained that companies are not entering into the
honest spirit in which his accounting revolution was conceived. All the more
reason for the market to rely on no single measure of performance. The
effort involved in scrutinising the whole picture should be worth the
inconvenience.

FT  29 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Range of measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prof Tweedie's stated aim is to encourage the market to look at a range of
measures of company performance. He is surely right to insist that earnings
per share, however calculated, is only part of the story. The new cash flow
statement invites the market to place more emphasis on cash flow per share.
As with earnings, though, investors will have to grapple with a plethora of
alternatives.
Basic measures of cash flow - taking pre-tax profits plus depreciation -
ignore some strong demands on corporate liquidity. Tax, interest charges and
preference dividends are hardly paid at the discretion of the company.
Equally, some capital expenditure can be deferred from year to year, but
routine maintenance costs are a drain on resources. That suggests no single
measure of cash flow per share will be sufficient. Companies with high
capital expenditure will be flattered on one measure, but suffer if the cash
earnings line is drawn lower in the cash flow statement. Whether most
investors will have time for such detailed analysis remains an open
question.
The new shape of the balance sheet, proposed in the recent exposure draft on
accounting for capital instruments, will reveal more about how companies are
funded. But again, the market will have to decide whether the new balance
sheet category of non-equity shares - which covers instruments such as
preference shares - should be counted as debt or equity for the purpose of
gearing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings figures under the old accounting rules were never much more than a
useful ready reckoner. At worst, they were misleading. Companies which
stretched the old accounting rules to boost earnings were often priced
accordingly. But so long as less scrupulous finance directors retained
latitude over what to include in earnings per share, there was a danger that
investors could be hoodwinked. They will be protected from that, but that
does not mean they will have an easy life. The ASB has placed the onus on
investors to make up their own minds, based on the whole - and still
complicated - picture.
Some consensus on interpreting the new figures would be useful. Since the
ASB is adamant that it is not in the business of issuing guidance,
institutional investors and analysts could take the lead. Investors may be
tempted, for example, to adjust or 'normalise' FRS3 earnings to reach a
figure comparable to that reported under the old rules. That might at least
offer a consistent basis of valuation during the transition to FRS3.
It is easier said than done. The standard places companies under no
obligation to disclose the impact of exceptional provisions on tax or
minority interests. Simply shuffling aside exceptional items will not take
these factors into account. The dissenting view of FRS3 put forward by Mr
Roger Bradfield of Cazenove, a member of the ASB, makes just such a point.
In theory, the new standard allows the market to go one better and calculate
'maintainable earnings'. It demands that the contribution of acquisitions
and discontinued operations is laid bare. But again, arriving at
maintainable earnings also entails allocating tax and interest charges
between acquisitions, continued and discontinued operations. That is often
an arbitrary decision.

<TEXT>
The equity market has not decided whether to cast Professor David Tweedie as
hero or villain. This year's missives from the Accounting Standards Board
certainly demand fuller disclosure from companies. In theory, that should
contribute to a more transparent and efficient equity market. The danger is
that the new standards will simply breed conflicting measures of company
performance which leave investors none the wiser.
The full-year results season in spring promises to be a rollercoaster affair
as the market comes to terms with the regime. That some companies will
report under the old rules and some under the new hardly implies an orderly
transition. Since the market is accustomed to valuing shares by earnings,
the new shape of the profit and loss account will be a culture shock.
Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS3) includes a definition of extraordinary
items which all but outlaws below-the-line gains and losses. Earnings per
share will be more volatile as a result.
Reporting companies will doubtless publish their own preferred measure of
earnings, in addition to the FRS3 figure. The standard allows them to do so,
provided their reasoning is explained. The trouble is that if investors
choose to concentrate on these measures, they may be just as badly off as
before. Analysts may put forward alternative measures, but then investors
would have to judge the quality of the analysis as well as the accounts.
Many may yearn for the simplicity of the old system.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter: Co-operative sector demonstrates the continuing
relevance of real 'federalism' in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr R HOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Lorenz's critique of 'federalism' as the latest fashion in
the 'glossy' management journals was appropriately acerbic (Management,
December 18).
What he failed to mention was that, like all fashion revivals, the ersatz is
always preceded by the genuine article.
Some of the most successful experiments in corporate federalism have been in
co-operatives, which combine representative democracy with business
enterprise.
These organisations are founded on federalist principles with 'sovereign'
members creating a primary society through their patronage and
participation. Primaries, in turn, link together to form secondary and
tertiary federals which provide common services and achieve economies of
scale.
This model, first developed in retail distribution in Britain in the
mid-19th century, has been applied to agriculture, insurance, financial
services, fisheries and manufacturing in over 80 countries.
Among the most successful are the Japanese co-operative federals which have
played a vital role in the development of their economy and society since
the end of the second world war.
The Japanese co-operative federals are now so strong that they hosted the
recent 30th International Co-operative Congress in Tokyo with more than
1,000 delegates. This was the first congress of the world federation to be
held in Asia and the first to be addressed by a prime minister.
With over 700m people in membership of more than 250,000 businesses
worldwide, the co-operative sector demonstrates the continuing relevance of
real federalism in business.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter: Endless disputes in sight if British Rail is broken
up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor W P BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Most transport professionals would agree with one conclusion in your
editorial 'Privatising British Rail' (December 22). Lack of investment and
continual government interference must change and a more enterprising
culture must be adopted.
However, your endorsement of government plans to separate responsibility for
track and signalling from that of running trains shows a lack of
understanding of how the railway business is conducted. Unless all elements
are managed as a whole there will be endless disputes about responsibility
for delays and disruption, with lawyers involved at every trip and turn.
You say that separating track infrastructure from the provision of services
is the way of the future in Europe, quoting Sweden as having successfully
implemented this policy. You omit to say that vast sums of public money are
being spent on upgrading the Swedish railways or that these railways are
lightly used by our standards. In Sweden only about 25 per cent of the costs
of maintaining railway infrastructure are contributed by train operators
under a policy which sets out to equate the terms of competition between
road and rail.
You ignore the fact that, under the terms of the White Paper in Britain,
railway operators will have to pay the full costs of using infrastructure,
including a return on capital employed, a policy which is likely to drive
most freight off our railways.
You might have looked at Japan where the railways have been divided into six
regional companies embracing train operations and track. These
publicly-owned companies are making great financial progress prior to
intended privatisation. The same policy could be adopted in Britain.
Finally, you might have drawn attention to the lack of any transport policy
framework in Britain within which the railways are to fit. Sweden, the
Netherlands, France and Germany have such frameworks.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Mystery of missing mass: This year's models of the universe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a momentous year for astronomical observations draws to a close,
scientists remain in a ferment of uncertainty about the origins, structure
and future of the universe.
The first pictures of the emerging universe transmitted by the US Cosmic
Background Explorer (Cobe) satellite, together with observations from the
Hubble Space Telescope, have inspired new cosmological theories without
dismissing the old front-runners.
The only clear landmark is still the Big Bang itself. Mainstream astronomers
have accepted for several years that we live in the expanding debris of a
cosmic fireball that created everything 12bn to 18bn years ago. But there is
no consensus on the way the universe has grown, its composition today, and
whether it will expand forever into an infinite coldness or come back
together in a Big Crunch.
The Cobe pictures show gigantic 'ripples' of microwave radiation which
emerged from the universe when it was 300,000 years old - 0.002 per cent of
its present age. These faint echoes of the Big Bang are the earliest
detectable signs of the unevenness which gravity later pulled into clusters
of galaxies and stars. It may never be possible directly to see any further
back in time; when the universe was less than 300,000 years old, it was too
dense to allow any radiation to escape.
Cosmologists are using the Cobe patterns both to extrapolate further into
the past - to within a fraction of a second of the Big Bang - and to look
forward to the present universe and its fate.
They are particularly keen to solve the mystery of the missing mass. All the
visible objects observed by astronomers - galaxies, stars, dust clouds and
so on - contain less matter than they know must actually exist. They
calculate that the mass of 'dark matter' is 10 to 100 times greater than the
visible matter, in order to provide enough gravity to account for the
movements of the stars and explain the development of the universe from the
primeval ripples observed by Cobe to what we see today.
Theories to explain the missing mass include:
It is ordinary matter composed of the particles that make up the sun and
earth - protons, neutrons and electrons - but is not visible by any
astronomical instrument. For example, galaxies may be surrounded by a myriad
of planet-sized bodies, known whimsically as Massive Compact Halo Objects;
'machos' would be too small to kindle the nuclear fires that produce light
from visible stars.
It is 'cold dark matter' consisting of slow-moving subatomic particles left
over from the Big Bang. These Weakly Interacting Massive Particles may
pervade the whole universe. Theoreticians calculate that about 1,000,000bn
'wimps' pass through each one of us every second. But they make little
impression on ordinary matter and have therefore not been detected.
It is 'hot dark matter' consisting of subatomic particles, each with a tiny
mass but moving almost as fast as light. Neutrinos are the most likely
candidate for hot dark matter, if it exists.
Charles Alcock, an astrophysicist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in
California, believes that, before invoking exotic particles to explain the
missing mass, it is worth searching more thoroughly for ordinary matter that
has remained hidden. A US-Australian project is beginning to track millions
of stars every night and look for the tiny changes in brightness that should
occur as they pass behind planet-sized objects.
However, most cosmological theories put a limit on the amount of ordinary
matter that could have been created in the immediate aftermath of the Big
Bang. If they are correct, the universe must be still dominated by exotic
particles. Earlier this year, cold dark matter was the leading main
contender but the latest thinking is that a mixture of hot and cold matter
fits the Cobe observations most closely.
The 'inflationary' model of the universe, presently in vogue, postulates a
super-expansionary burst immediately after the Big Bang. The effect would
have been analogous to an explosion triggering an atomic bomb, releasing an
unimaginable amount of energy on a scale of less than a millionth of a
millimetre. Random fluctuations during this inflationary period sowed the
seeds of our universe.
Perhaps the most important prediction of inflationary cosmology is that we
are balanced between a 'closed' universe containing enough matter eventually
to reverse the expansion and an 'open' universe flying apart for ever.
Growth will stop after an infinite period but there will be no Big Crunch.
This idea, which appeals to astronomers' aesthetic sense, is supported but
not proved by Cobe.
On a more speculative level, some inflation theorists suggest that ours may
be one of an infinite number of universes. Each would have different laws of
physics because these would have been determined by random fluctuations in a
single primeval force, immediately after its Big Bang. The one we live in
happens to be conducive to the differentiation of matter into stars, planets
 -and life.
Astronomers are now waiting for other observations of the emerging universe
to confirm and supplement Cobe's. 'Everyone who works in this field believes
the Cobe results but we will feel more comfortable when an independent
experiment detects fluctuations in the microwave background,' says Peter
Coles, an astronomer at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London.
Several ground-based instruments are searching and Professor Martin Rees,
director of Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, expects positive
results to be announced by June. They should help to sort out competing
theories by distinguishing variations on a finer angular resolution than
Cobe is able to produce.
At the same time the Dollars 2bn Hubble telescope, in orbit around the
earth, is proving to be more useful than the pessimists predicted when a
flaw was discovered in the main mirror after its launch in 1990. 'You can
get out something approaching the telescope's original design specification,
but at the price of spending longer pointing it at the object you want to
look at,' says Ian Smail, an astrophysicist at Durham University.
He is part of a group using Hubble to explore 'gravitational lenses' -
clusters of galaxies billions of light years away whose gravitational pull
acts as a natural magnifying glass, bending and refocusing the light from
even more distant galaxies. Studies of gravitational lenses will reveal more
information about the way dark matter is distributed through the universe.
Recently, Hubble has also given a more precise estimate of the age of the
universe, based on its rate of expansion. And it has sent back pictures of
the most distant-known galaxy, forming 1bn to 2bn years after the Big Bang
around a massive black hole.
Astronomers expect another crop of new observations from space and earth
next year. By Christmas 1993 scientists will not be able to predict
confidently the ultimate fate of the universe but they should have a better
idea of whether it is filled with machos, wimps or hot neutrinos.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter: Report on Yugoslavia 'balanced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MICHAEL JERMEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Dunkley criticises ITN for 'sensational' reporting of
'systematic and organised rape' in the former Yugoslavia ('Glitz threatens
the News at Ten', December 23).
Our lead story by Penny Marshall on News at Ten, December 17, was nothing of
the kind. Her report on allegations of brutality and rape at Serbian
detention centres was a balanced piece of journalism which attributed the
charge of systematic rape to the World Health Organisation.
Far from failing to produce a 'single woman who would substantiate the
story' ITN interviewed an eye-witness to two rapes and a doctor who treated
other victims.
Our report went on to point out the great difficulty European Community
investigators will have in substantiating reports of the rape of Moslem
women, most of whom are reluctant to talk about their time in detention.
ITN has pursued the story of the abuse of human rights in the former
Yugoslavia with great vigour. In August our pictures of the Serb detention
camps alerted the world to the true horror of ethnic cleansing. We are proud
of our record of accurate and balanced reporting of the war and are
determined to maintain ITN's tradition of high quality news coverage.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose: The year's corporate
successes and failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,
And treat those two imposters just the same ..'
 - Rudyard Kipling There was a lot more disaster than triumph for the
corporate world in 1992. But even in such a year, there were winners as well
as losers. Here are 10 of the best of each.
Winners
George Soros. Surely the winner of the year - the man who spotted that if
the UK government was determined to buy pound notes at Pounds 1.20 apiece,
the trick was to borrow pounds in colossal quantities, hand them over and
pocket the difference - in his case, well over Pounds 500m.
Tiny Rowland. This was a good year for Mr Rowland, the founder and managing
director of Lonrho (qv, under Losers). At 75, he showed himself still
capable of inventive deals, such as bringing in Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the
Libyan leader, as part owner of the Metropole hotel chain. He ended the year
with a flourish, selling half his Lonrho stake to an obscure German
businessman at well above the price attainable by his fellow-shareholders.
Essex Furniture. With Essex deep in recession and the house market frozen,
the name of this company sounds like disaster squared. In fact, it increased
sales and profits by half, opened new shops and talked about moving into a
bigger factory. Asked for the secret, chairman Mr Michael Franks said
enigmatically: 'It's the way you put the ingredients together.'
Tomkins. Headed by an ex-pupil of Lord Hanson, this pushy young conglomerate
took on Hanson in bidding for the bread-maker RHM. Hanson blinked and
Tomkins won. Critics said it had paid too much. Its shares still ended the
year a fifth higher than they started.
Lord Weinstock. The head of GEC was pilloried in the go-go 1980s for his
unwillingness to spend his cash mountain. This year, while the profits of
the world electronics industry collapsed, GEC's went up. To rub salt in the
wound, the company doubled its cash mountain as well.
HSBC. Better known as the HongKong and Shanghai Bank, it successfully fought
Lloyds to take over the struggling Midland Bank. The stock market had to
think twice about this, but eventually decided it was a good thing. HSBC
shares doubled in the year, making it the best performer in the FT-SE 100
index.
MFI. As a furniture retailer carrying Pounds 500m of debt from a management
buy-out, MFI looked for several years like a loser on a heroic scale. But in
July it managed a stock market flotation, thus cutting its debt to Pounds
100m. The directors refused to sell their shares on the grounds that the
price was too cheap. It has since gone up by a fifth.
Rupert Murdoch. 1992 was the year in which Mr Murdoch showed that being a
debt-laden international media tycoon need not be the end of the world. He
not only placated his bankers, but he started talking about expanding again.
The shares in his News Corp doubled.
Wellcome Trust. The winning medical charity of the year. In the summer, this
charity sold rather less than half its stake in the drug company Wellcome
for a princely Pounds 2.3bn. Since then the share price has risen by a
quarter, valuing the rest at well over Pounds 3bn.
The liquidator. In a year in which going bust was big business, the grim
reaper made hay. The UK's top 10 insolvency practitioners had fee income in
1991-92 of some Pounds 300m. This year, with bankruptcy still booming - to
say nothing of plum long-term contracts such as Maxwell and Bank of Credit
and Commerce International - the figure looks like rising sharply again.
Losers
Body Shop. Ms Anita Roddick's adroit combination of moral fervour and a
soaring share price was one of the more striking features of 1980s
capitalism. In 1992 profits ran out of steam and the shares slumped from
370p to 155p. As older City hands might say, it would take a heart of stone
not to laugh.
Clarke Foods. At the turn of the year, Mr Henry D Clarke of the US spent
Pounds 12m buying the Lyons Maid ice cream business in the UK. He then
ordered expensive new machinery, advertised heavily and crossed his fingers
for hot weather. Early summer was wonderful, but the machinery played up. It
reached full output just in time for the wettest August in 53 years. Clarke
Foods went bust in October.
Ratners. Last Christmas, the profits of the world's biggest jewellery chain
had slumped and its share price had fallen 85 per cent in 12 months. Mr
Gerald Ratner, the company's chairman, must have reasoned that things could
scarcely get worse. Sure enough, they did. Ratners made a Pounds 122m loss,
the shares fell a further 70 per cent and Mr Ratner resigned.
Lonrho. This was the year in which the loyal army of Lonrho shareholders had
their faith finally tested. Their shares halved in value, their dividend was
slashed and some of their choicest assets were sold. Lonrho's debt mountain
was scarcely dented. Mr Rowland meanwhile started cashing in his chips.
'Believe me,' he told his fellow-shareholders, 'it is only my age that
occasions this.'
Fisons. A year ago, Fisons announced that it could not manufacture some of
its drugs to US standards. The chairman resigned on grounds of ill health.
Interim profits fell by nearly 60 per cent. Fisons' market value collapsed
from Pounds 3.5bn to Pounds 1bn. So much for the defensive virtues of drug
stocks.
BP. 'Because I am blessed by my good brain,' BP's chairman Robert Horton
said in February, 'I tend to get to the right answer quicker and more often
than most people.' In June he lost his job. In August BP announced a
quarterly loss of over Pounds 700m and halved its dividend.
Alan Sugar. Perhaps all the chairman of Amstrad wanted was to be alone. If
so, hard luck. Shareholders were baffled by his bid to take Amstrad private
and told him to stay on. Mr Sugar subsequently described his plan as 'just
another business venture that was tried and then failed'.
Barclays. In an almost universally lousy year for the banks, Barclays still
managed to stand out. It took flak over its treatment of small business
customers and the structure of its board. It made a loss for only the second
time in its history. It ended the year by taking over Imry, a property
company to which it had lent Pounds 440m, thus taking to new heights the
notion of repossession.
GPA. The world's biggest airline leasing company started the year with
confident plans of a Dollars 1.5bn share flotation. By mid-year the plans
had evaporated. By the year-end there were rumours that the company was in
trouble. Since its directors include troubleshooter Sir John Harvey Jones
and ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, the rumours must surely be wrong.
Trafalgar House. For connoisseurs of disaster, perhaps the company of the
year. Profits vanished, the shares plunged, Hong Kong Land moved in and the
chairman and chief executive quit. The previous year's profits of Pounds
122m had to be restated as a loss after a run-in with the accounting
authorities. In the summer, as a kind of symbolic grace-note, the group's
flagship, the QE2, was holed below the waterline.

FT  29 DEC 92 / The grimy face of coal: The energy policy review could prove
a setback for the environmental cause in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the environment get a look-in as the UK ponders the future of coal?
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has put
environmental factors on the agenda for his energy review. But he may find
it tough to reconcile them with his aim of boosting the use of domestically
mined coal. An increase in the quantity of coal burnt would not only raise
atmospheric pollution in Britain. It would also drag in other controversial
issues, such as acid rain and open-cast mining. Internationally, it would
raise doubts about the UK's commitment to the global effort to clean up the
environment.
In common with its European Community partners, the UK has pledged to cut
output of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2000. This was reinforced by an
agreement to curb greenhouse gases which Mr John Major, the UK prime
minister, signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June.
At the time, the UK's goal seemed just about attainable. Carbon dioxide
emissions in 1990 were 160m tonnes, and the forecast level for 2000 was in
the range of 157m-179m. But this assumed that the electricity generation
industry would switch from coal to cleaner natural gas on a large scale.
According to a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) analysis, which was
completed just before the crisis provoked by the government's announcement
in October of pit closures, the contribution of coal to electricity
generation is expected to fall from 68 per cent in 1990 to only 47 per cent
in 2000, while the share of gas is likely to go up from zero to 22-23 per
cent.
But the coal review could throw all these calculations out.
A recent report commissioned by the DTI concluded that coal was more harmful
than both its main competitors, gas and nuclear, because it causes more
deaths, and damages forests and the climate. Furthermore, UK-mined coal is
dirtier than imported coal, so any moves to bar imports to protect British
Coal would shift the country in a grimier direction.
A greater amount of coal burnt would also create difficulties over acid
rain. Under the EC's large combustion plant directive, the UK was given
lenient targets on sulphur emissions in return for a promise to burn more
gas instead of coal. If the UK goes back on that promise, there would be
trouble in Brussels.
British Coal estimates that the directive only allows the UK to burn 30m-35m
tonnes of coal a year, barely half the current figure. And there is a
further problem with open-cast mining. Local authorities are under pressure
to curb this activity because of the damage it does to the landscape. But
open-cast mining is the cheapest method of obtaining coal, and the
government may be tempted to relax mine licensing procedures to help British
Coal reduce its prices.
Knotty though these problems are, they pose less of a dilemma for Mr
Heseltine than they do for Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, who
has been keeping a low profile in the coal debate. Mr Howard is in a
difficult position. He risks being criticised by the green lobby if he fails
to press the environmental case.
But there is little Mr Howard can say to Mr Heseltine that will be of any
help. Mr Howard admits that the energy review will affect environmental
policy, but he maintains that it is still a matter of how environmental
targets are achieved, rather than whether they can be achieved at all. In
presenting a recent policy document on the options for meeting the Rio
targets, he said: 'If the energy review says more coal, more savings will
have to be found elsewhere.'
The coal debate has also put environmentalists on the spot. By instinct, the
green lobby is anti-coal because of the emissions problem, but it has been
reluctant to come out in outright opposition to preserving the coal
industry. One reason is that Mr Heseltine could decide to cut back the
nuclear power industry to make more room for coal in the generation market,
handing the environmentalists a big victory in one of their longest-running
campaigns.
Mr Stewart Boyle, energy policy director of Greenpeace, the lobby group,
concedes that there is an element of compromise in his position. But he
believes the government will be obliged to announce stronger environmental
measures as an offset to any moves to boost the coal industry. So the net
effect could actually advance the green cause.
But how far could Mr Heseltine go, given that environmental measures will
only add to the cost of saving the collieries? British Coal estimates, for
example, that extracting carbon dioxide from power stations' emissions would
add 45 per cent to the cost of electricity. He could provide support for
research into clean coal technology, or even subsidise clean-up equipment at
power stations, though there are both budgetary and EC limits on the size of
subsidies.
The short answer to whether the environment will get a look-in as the UK
considers the future of coal is no. The coal crisis could mark a setback for
the environmental cause and the UK's international commitments. But a
balanced answer to the coal dilemma would have to include measures to make
coal more environmentally acceptable. An imaginative answer might even
include a long-term plan to develop clean coal technology, a field where the
UK has played a pioneering role in the past.

FT  29 DEC 92 / The strongest candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Choosing a Man or Woman of the Year can be tricky and, by definition,
subjective - the more so in a year as sombre and confused as 1992 has proved
in many parts of the world. Amid the encircling gloom, few international
figures stand out as having made distinctive achievements or having left a
potentially durable impression on our lives as with some previous choices -
Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher or Mikhail Gorbachev. Deng Xiaoping - frail,
octogenarian, not occupying any formal office, and decidedly politically
incorrect - may be a controversial choice, but he is one man who arguably
has.
To understand this conclusion, consider the alternatives. The strongest
also-ran was Bill Clinton, his achievement in defeating George Bush against
what seemed insuperable odds being outweighed only by the fact that he has
yet to show what kind of president he will be - and by the unusually
successful challenge of Ross Perot.
Another strong candidate was Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger. His
exertions against the scourge of inflation and the perceived fiscal
profligacy of the German government have had an undoubted impact on millions
of individuals and businesses over the past year in Europe and beyond. The
story, however, is far from over. So far the Bundesbank has failed, despite
high real German interest rates, to reduce inflation and bring the money
supply within its target range.
Other runners were disqualified on various grounds. Prime Minister P V
Narasimha Rao of India made a strong early showing as a result of his
government's courageous economic reforms, but fell down over his mishandling
of the Ayodhya controversy. Elsewhere, European farm commissioner Ray
MacSharry appears to have secured two remarkable agreements - on reforming
the EC's Common Agricultural Policy and bringing farm trade under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - but they may yet be torpedoed.
That leaves us with Deng, who launched China's opening to the world in 1978
and gave another hefty boost to economic reform this year. His claim to the
title Man of the Year rests on the hypothesis that in 1992, the flowering of
Chinese capitalism that he fostered became irreversible; that, despite the
manifest flaws of its political system and the worries about its stability,
China is becoming a political, economic and commercial force with which the
world will increasingly have to reckon.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Long march to the market: Deng Xiaoping, China's reformist
leader, is the FT's Man of the Year. Alexander Nicoll examines his
achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only thanks to the political bankruptcy of China's Communist party
that Deng Xiaoping can be considered Man of the Year for 1992.
China's new push to open up the world's 10th-largest economy has raised the
possibility that it could quickly become a much more potent force. That this
could have been triggered by a frail 88-year-old with no official position
underlines the country's parallel failure to develop politically.
Through a simple visit in January to the most prosperous, fast-growing parts
of the south, Deng sparked a nationwide renewal of enthusiasm for
free-market reforms.
From revolving restaurants atop new skyscrapers, Deng surveyed the special
economic zones he created in Shenzhen, now hard to distinguish in appearance
from Hong Kong across the border, and Zhuhai, close to the Portuguese
enclave of Macao. His praise of the achievements there, and exhortation to
even faster development, fuelled an economic boom. China's growth rate is
about 12 per cent. The world's most populous country is now, therefore,
almost certainly to have its fastest growing economy.
Deng's southern visit was part of a carefully crafted campaign against more
conservative Communists to further the cause of the reforms he began in
1978. Victory came in October's party congress, with the promotion of
reform-minded officials, such as as vice-premier Zhu Rongji, to top
executive positions. Deng had done all he could to ensure that his doctrine
of free-market development under party control would outlive him.
Since October, Deng has demonstrated his continued dominance - and his
darker side - by directing China's furious reaction to modest proposals for
democratic representation in Hong Kong by its governor, Chris Patten.
Yet he did all this during the year in which he turned 88. He is in failing
health, and holds no posts in government or party.
His principal adversary in this year's battle over economic reforms was
87-year-old Chen Yun. After 43 years of the Communist apparatus and 14 years
of 'opening to the outside world', the fate of China's 1.1bn people still
lies in power struggles between very old men.
Their influence is testimony to the failure of China's leaders, including
Deng, to develop mature political institutions through which power can be
transferred.
Even after his rout of the conservatives, Deng can barely be more confident
than he was a year ago that, after his death, China will continue along the
path he has set. To the visitor to China, reform feels irreversible.
Businesses are growing everywhere and there is clear popular support -
consumer goods are widely available, markets are flourishing.
This year has substantially increased the likelihood that the reforms will
be long-lasting. The majority of the economic activity is in the private
sector. Foreign capital, especially from ethnic Chinese in the rest of Asia,
is pouring in; investment flows of Dollars 12bn in 1991 have been exceeded
this year. Foreign retailers have been allowed to establish joint ventures
and prices of many goods have been freed. The economic growth of provinces
has reduced the influence of Beijing.
Yet continuing struggles within the party indicate that reform may be only
as deeply rooted as the officials who promote it. The party's propaganda
machine remains at the disposal of whoever wins temporary supremacy in
factional wrangles.
In the seminal 'Document No 2', the party's official version of Deng's
remarks in the south, the veteran Chinese leader argued a new version of his
celebrated remark that it did not matter whether a cat was black or white,
as long as it caught mice. 'The fundamental difference between socialism and
capitalism does not lie in the question of whether the planning mechanism or
the market mechanism plays a larger role,' said Deng. 'Both planning and
market are just economic means. The nature of socialism is to emancipate and
develop the productive forces, to eliminate exploitation and polarisation,
and to finally achieve the goal of common affluence.'
China is proud of the contrast between its growth and stability and the
economic and political chaos in the former Soviet Union. But China's
Communist leadership still agonises about whether the reforms are socialist
or capitalist.
Even after Deng visited the south, hardliners led by Chen Yun launched an
attempt to slow reform. Though Chen Yun said he agreed with Deng about the
need to stimulate the economy, he argued for careful planning. According to
his 'bird-cage' theory, 'you cannot hold a bird tight in your hand, it will
die. You must let it fly, but only within the cage. Without a cage it will
fly away and lose direction.'
Deng won out, managing to get the document published in March. Then, his new
year message was doggedly spread by the Communist propaganda machine.
Factories and provincial officials acted in unison to increase production
and investment - in many cases, indiscriminately - arousing fears that the
economy will rapidly overheat.
It cannot yet be concluded that free-market reforms mean the Communist
system is on the way out. About half of industrial production is still
accounted for by inefficient state-owned factories, many of which depend on
state subsidies.
The 'contract responsibility' system, putting the onus for profitable
operation on managers instead of bureaucrats, is a step in the right
direction. But managers are handicapped by their lack of authority to change
officially controlled prices and reduce their workforces.
Nor does economic freedom mean political freedom. Deng's rationale is that
reform is the best way to create prosperity, and fostering prosperity is the
best way for the Communist party to achieve its most important objective -
the retention of power.
It was Deng who ordered in the tanks on June 4 1989 to crush pro-democracy
protests in Tiananmen Square, ensuring the party's maintenance of total
dominance at any cost. Deng also shares responsibility for countless abuses
of human rights - such as the detention of Wei Jingsheng, jailed for 15
years in 1979 after editing a magazine which advocated democracy. Though the
official line is that Wei passed military intelligence to a foreigner, his
sentence is thought to have been particularly severe because of criticisms
of Deng in a wall poster.
And it is Deng whom the people of Hong Kong have most to fear. In implacably
rejecting Mr Patten's proposals to broaden the franchise for elections in
1995, and in threatening not to honour business contracts extending beyond
1997, the author of the 'one country, two systems' approach to China's
sovereignty over the territory from 1997 has himself sown doubts about
Beijing's commitment to it.
Yet it is also Deng from whom Hong Kong has most to gain. Thanks to his
policies, Guangdong province across the border has expanded rapidly with
Hong Kong investment and employment as a driving force. He wants Guangdong
to catch up with the four industrialising 'tigers': South Korea, Taiwan,
Singapore and Hong Kong, within 20 years. Hong Kong's participation will be
vital if this is to be achieved.
Deng may not live to see Hong Kong returned to China. At his triumphal but
brief appearance at the end of the party congress, it was his shaking hand
which caught everybody's eye. But the man who twice fought back after being
purged from the leadership and was once reviled as the 'number two
capitalist roader' cannot be written off until his last gasp. 'The people
are pleased and the world has been astonished,' he commented of the progress
of his reforms. But saddest for China is that the most important question
remains: what will happen after he dies?

FT  29 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Clinton leads from the front
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY GOVERNMENT may be more, or less, than the sum of its parts. But, more
than most, the one that will be taking over in Washington on January 20
looks as if it will be especially dependent on the man who heads it,
President-elect Bill Clinton.
Notwithstanding an unseemly pre-Christmas rush of appointments, and the lack
still of a White House staff, his team is an intriguing amalgam. It is made
up of old hands and new, Washington veterans and novices, technocrats and
thinkers.
As promised, it contains more women and members of minority groups than any
before it. It lacks a Republican, which Mr Clinton once said was possible,
and its composition pretty much reflects the contemporary US Democratic
party, with the conspicuous exception that the old bulwark, organised
labour, is not directly represented.
Foreign policy has been principally vested in the experienced hands of Mr
Warren Christopher, as secretary of state, and Mr Anthony Lake, as national
security adviser in the White House. Neither are turf conscious or power
hungry and their relationship should be harmonious, as was the case in the
Bush administration, but not in those of presidents Carter and Nixon.
Negotiating skills
The standard criticisms of Mr Christopher, though less of Mr Lake, is that
he is not a conceptualist in the Kissinger mould and is too addicted to
conventional diplomacy. Yet much the same was said of three of the more
successful recent secretaries of state, Cyrus Vance, George Shultz and James
Baker. The Cold War may have passed into history, but this, if anything, has
increased the role of the US as the remaining superpower. If President-elect
Clinton is willing to project American power on a wide variety of fronts, Mr
Christopher's negotiating skills will be needed and tested.
Intellectually, the security affairs combination of Mr Les Aspin at the
defence department and Mr James Woolsey at the CIA looks formidable. Mr
Aspin may be precisely the sort of man to direct the US military through a
period of transition under which it must get by on less without sacrificing
its capabilities and its technological advantages. He may be more
interventionist than both Mr Christopher and his risk-averse service chiefs,
which is not necessarily a bad thing.
Wheeler-dealer
The installation of Mr Leon Panetta and Dr Alice Rivlin to run the budget
office may turn out to be the most significant of the economics
appointments. Both are practically-minded deficit reduction hawks capable of
keeping Mr Clinton's similar inclinations on track. Mr Lloyd Bentsen at the
Treasury is a consummate wheeler-dealer without pronounced ideology who will
need to exercise considerable authority if the much-maligned gridlock in
Washington is to be broken.
International economic policies may remain obscure for some time. Mr
Bentsen's experience in this domain is limited and his positions on trade
sometimes ambivalent. Mr Mickey Kantor, the new trade representative, was
chosen for his political skills, not his expertise. Given the fierce rivalry
for this position among trade ideologues and the considerable success in the
job during the 1970s of another non-expert, Robert Strauss, it is not
surprising that the president-elect preferred a neutral choice.
Mr Clinton is also promising to change some of the ways in which government
works. His new economic security council in the White House, under Mr Robert
Rubin, is designed to give a voice at the policy table to some hitherto
under-represented departments. Both Mr Robert Reich as secretary of labour
and Mr Bruce Babbitt at Interior are men with a lot of ideas, on industrial
retraining and the environment respectively, which at least deserve a full
hearing.
But in all this Mr Clinton's role is central. In picking a team better known
for the diversity of its views than for any ideological coherence, he has
set himself up, quite deliberately, as the active arbiter of the policies of
his administration. His talent and appetite for the task should not be
underestimated but nor should the immensity of the challenges he has taken
on.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Opportunity for extremists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS always possible, even probable, that acts of extremism would
undermine and might eventually destroy the foundations of the Middle East
peace process laid in Madrid 14 months ago. The only effective way to reduce
that risk was through sustained progress at the negotiating table. There had
to be enough diplomatic momentum to raise the eyes and expectations of the
region's populations above the daily and mutual abrasions of military
occupation and to isolate politically those who most vigorously opposed the
process.
The failure of Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to
progress beyond procedural issues during the eight rounds of negotiations
held so far is now bearing predictably sour fruit. Hamas and Islamic Jihad,
the two most radical Moslem groups in the West Bank and Gaza, have been
responsible for the deaths of six members of Israel's security forces this
month and are increasingly seeking to assume the mantle of Palestinian
resistance.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, responded crudely by deporting
415 alleged Hamas supporters, without charge or trial. Lebanon refused to
accept them and these men are now abandoned on a frozen hillside, without
basic humanitarian care, a testament to the ease with which Middle East
leaders can revert to the attitudes and actions which marked the past four
decades. The one sure thing is that Hamas will not liberate Gaza and the
West Bank for the Palestinians, and Mr Rabin will not find a secure,
negotiated future for Israel by taking harsh actions which have been
universally condemned by the world community, specifically by UN Security
Council resolution 799, and which simultaneously inflame opinion in the
occupied territories.
PLO squeezed
The Palestine Liberation Organisation, denied from the outset any formal
role in the peace process but in effective control of the delegation to the
Washington negotiations, is squeezed ever more painfully between Israel and
Hamas. Its diminished leadership will lose more ground among its own
constituents if it resumes talks without first having achieved something for
the 415 deportees, or for the other 600 or so Palestinians arrested at the
same time and still in detention. If the PLO decides against going back to
the table then it is unlikely that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon will break Arab
ranks. In short, the peace process will be stalemated, but not, perhaps,
lost.
What it most needs at this low ebb is an act of statesmanship recognised by
all sides as a sincere gesture towards compromise and negotiation. Given
that no Arab leader currently looks capable of emulating the late Anwar
Sadat and that Mr Rabin is politically hamstrung by his rash expulsion
orders, it is once again to the US that the region must look for help.
Concessions in the Middle East are invariably much easier to make in
response to a third party. All those directly involved in the conflict are
susceptible to initial requests from President-elect Bill Clinton.
American dimension
Much though the new president may wish to concentrate on domestic issues,
the peace process urgently requires the American dimension that it lost from
the day that Mr James Baker left the State Department to concentrate on Mr
Bush's re-election campaign. Without the enormous commitment of Jimmy
Carter, the last Democratic president, President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem
in 1977 would not have been translated into a peace treaty. Without the
unstinting efforts of Mr Baker, the Madrid conference would never have been
held.
Mr Bush has said repeatedly that, having got everyone to the table, he
cannot now desire peace more than the negotiating parties. But what an
American president can do is provide a more effective framework for
negotiations with a demonstration of his own personal interest and the
appointment of full-time, specialist conciliators, within or attached to the
State Department, who have the political weight to propose compromise
solutions. Too much time has already been lost since the Madrid conference;
the events of recent weeks have demonstrated once more that extremists in
Israel, the occupied territories and elsewhere in the region are always
ready to respond to any sense that the tide is beginning to turn back in
their favour.

A hidden camera in Truckers (8.00 C4) reveals how an international lorry
driver talks and bribes his way through border controls and police checks in
Europe.
Winter Dreams (BBC2, also at 8.00) is a ballet by Kenneth MacMillan which he
re-worked for television some time before his death in October. Inspired by
Chekhov's 'Three Sisters' and set to music by Tchaikovsky, it is a study of
the passions and longings of the three sisters who are danced by Darcey
Bussell, Viviana Durante and Nicola Tranah.
Rowan Atkinson's 'silent comedy' skits leave me stone cold so I shall not
watch Merry Christmas Mr Bean (8.30 ITV) but millions will, and the
programme may well win awards like its predecessors.
However I shall be trying the opening episode of The Vampyr since its full
title is The Vampyr - A Soap Opera (9.00 BBC2) and the idea of up-dating a
19th century romantic opera seems interesting. It continues daily until
Sunday. That is followed (9.25) by a one-off black comedy from BBC Scotland,
The Bogie Man, starring splendid Robbie Coltrane as a man of many disguises.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Arts: The rehabilitation of Busoni - Berlin Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Offenbach was not the only composer to find inspiration in the tales of ETA
Hoffmann. Hindemith was another, Busoni a third. And it is to Busoni, least
known of the three, that Daniel Barenboim turned in his opening season, just
ended, as artistic director of the Deutsche Staatsoper in Berlin. Die
Brautwahl was Busoni's first completed opera. Since its premiere in Hamburg
in 1911, it has been infrequently revived, partly because Busoni's
inexperience made for a long-winded text, but also because his music is so
hard to classify. This excellent new production is therefore another step in
Busoni's rehabilitation in the pantheon of 20th century music.
Die Brautwahl (The Bridal Contest), subtitled 'a musical-fantastic comedy',
is drawn from a collection of stories Hoffmann wrote shortly before his
death in 1822. It follows the bizarre train of events set in motion when the
Berlin dignitary Voswinkel decides to marry off his daughter Albertine.
Voswinkel's favourite suitor is Thusman, a grotesque old bureaucrat. His
rivals are the bright-eyed young artist Edmund Lehsen, with whom Albertine
immediately falls in love, and an aristocratic fop named Baron Bensch. But
larger forces are at work. The contest is manipulated by two mythical,
medieval Jews - the eerily benevolent goldsmith-magician Leonhard and his
eternal opponent, the malevolent hobo Manasse - who emerge from the woodwork
at every turn, slogging it out for good and evil.
Busoni, who was a bit of a wizard himself, matches this black farce note for
note. Mercurial, contrapuntal and full of tricks only a master orchestrator
can pull, the score shifts bewitchingly from sunny to sinister whenever the
supernatural world impinges on the action. There are lightly-worn melodies
and pirouettes, quotations from Rossini and Tchaikovsky, a love duet of
intoxicating lyricism and glimpses of visionary ecstasy. It is all very
eclectic.
The Deutsche Staatsoper used an edition specially drawn up by the Busoni
authority Anthony Beaumont and the stage director Nicolas Brieger. Roughly a
third of the original has been cut, leaving just under two hours of music.
This is not as extreme as it appears: disappointed by the work's poor
reception at its premiere, Busoni sanctioned a heavily cut version for
production in Mannheim and the swift succession of scenes hang together
convincingly.
The production, designed by Hermann Feuchter and Margit Koppendorfer,
matched the fun and dexterity of the music. The setting was updated to early
this century, with semi-naturalistic cut-away flats and gauzes and some
authentic stage magic. The film sequence giving Thusman's eye-view as he
hurtled through the Berlin streets was a tour de force, perfectly
synchronised with the music. Brieger's intelligent direction helped unravel
the complications of the plot, while Barenboim's conducting gave the
performance momentum and transparence. But the wind solos did not suggest a
major league orchestra.
The two outstanding members of the cast were both experienced German
bass-baritones - Siegfried Vogel as Albertine's cigar-smoking father and
Oskar Hillebrandt's scruffy, shifty, Schigolch-like Manasse. Roman Trekel
(Leonhard) and Robert Swensen (Lehsen) made up for small voices with strong
characterisation. Dalia Schaechter, arriving on roller skates, was the agile
Albertine, and Peter Kazaras a Mime-like Thusman.
Carl Heinrich Graun, Kapellmeister at the court of Frederick the Great in
Berlin, composed Cleopatra e Cesare for the opening in 1742 of his master's
new opera house, now known as the Deutsche Staatsoper or Lindenoper. The
work, unperformed for more than two centuries, has been revived as the
centrepiece of the theatre's 250th anniversary celebrations. A performing
edition was conflated from two hand-written scores - one apparently used by
Graun himself, the other Frederick's library copy - which were unearthed in
the east Berlin state archives. Rene Jacobs, a specialist conductor of 18th
century opera, was engaged along with his original ensemble, Concerto Koln.
The production team was German, the cast young and international. The result
was a spectacular success, not least because it showed the theatre to be
ideal for pre-Romantic opera.
Graun's music typifies opera seria of mid-18th century Germany: a succession
of da capo arias, linked by the briefest of recitatives, lacking Handel's
dramatic sensibility or Gluck's feeling for words, but making up
considerable ground in melodic elegance and coloratura.
Honours are due all round: first to Jacobs and his musicians for breathing
so much life into the score - fluent, well-sprung, texturally refined, full
of dynamic subtlety. The cast, too, gave almost unalloyed pleasure: no
self-serving vocal exhibitionism, stylistic correctness always married to
musicality. Lynne Dawson invested Cornelia's arias with palpable feeling.
Lentulo and Tolomeo were both tenors - the stylish Jeffrey Francis and a
fiery but out-of-condition Curtis Rayam. Cesare was sung by the Italian
mezzo Debora Beronesi, who held the stage like a classical god. Cleopatra
was the nubile Janet Williams - an operatic Eartha Kitt, more sex-bomb than
Egyptian queen, despatching her arias with mesmerising accuracy and aplomb.
Fred Berndt's unfussy staging respected the formality of the music, while
creating its own imaginative aesthetic. The decor was built around two
motifs - a blue pyramid, shaped like a hollow, triangular staircase, to
symbolise Caesar's precarious power, and a transparent pink obelisk
symbolising Cleopatra's love. The performance began and ended with
drop-curtains based on lithographs from Frederick the Great's time,
depicting him and his court in harmony with the ancient Greek and Roman
world. His example as patron of the arts serves us well today, and was the
rightful inspiration for this glorious performance.

William Packer sorts out the good from the bad and the over-esteemed in a
difficult year for painting and sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Horrible as it has undoubtedly been in so many other ways, 1992 has not been
as bad as it might have been for fine art. There have been difficulties and
a few galleries have closed, but reports of the death of Cork Street, that
serves so conveniently as the image of London's contemporary art market,
have been much exaggerated. One or two have changed hands and names, and a
brave new art-bookshop has lately opened, but only one gallery space remains
empty, where John Kasmin had stood for so long under the Knoedler banner,
and, last summer, made so much noise at his going. The lesson is that
confidence built up over decades may be talked away in a few days.
If Cork Street stands for anything, it is surely less for the more outre and
challenging expressions of current avant-garde activity than for the solid
professionalism of the more established dealers. Such galleries as the
Mercury, the Piccadilly, the Redfern and Browse &amp; Darby are all in Cork
Street, and have been there since long before the present storm blew up.
They may not be doing so very well during this recession, but they are well
run, founded on good stock, and they are surviving. Dealing in contemporary
art, they are yet hardly likely to supply a winner of the Turner Prize.
If there are villains to be discovered in the present crisis, they must be
the banks which, in the heady days of the late 1980s, threw money into yet
another market they evidently did not understand, but when they came under
pressure, drew back as fast as they had earlier gone in. David Messum and
Nigel Greenwood were respected galleries, dealing seriously and sensibly in
their different fields and not, it seemed, in terminal crisis. Fischer,
faced with terms which it could not accept for a renewed lease, chose rather
to close the gallery and deal privately. These are sad losses. The art
world's crisis, if crisis it is, has not been altogether of its own making.
But the art market perhaps needed to be chastened. Some higher-flying
dealers are still apt to be influenced by uncritically by an international
market reputation rather than real quality. Thus to be forced down to earth
with a few singed wings is no bad thing. Where have Julian Schnabel, David
Salle, Baselitz, Clemente, been this year? Ou sont les neiges d'antin? A
thoroughly pretentious show of Anselm Kiefier, at d'Offay in midsummer,
suggested he too is much over-rated.
By far the worst show of the year for me was the Tate gallery's
retrospective of the work of Richard Hamilton, who is to be our
standard-bearer and sole occupant of the British Pavilion at the Venice
Biennale next summer. In his work, he, more than anyone, stands for the
propensity of our art-administrative elite for choosing unfailingly that
which is supposedly about ideas, rather than the well-drawn, well-painted,
well-made; art which is intuitive in its expression and beautiful in itself.
The Turner Prize, too, was as depressing an affair as ever, more so perhaps
for the clear evidence that all criticism visited upon it in previous years
had been disregarded. And the Damien Hurst band-waggon rolls on, he of the
fish in formaldehyde, his shark at Saatchi's a window-dresser's coup de
theatre presented as somehow the creative equivalent of Picasso's
'Demoiselles', or 'The Night Watch', or 'The Last Judgement'.
I started by saying this this had not been a bad year. Oh dear.
But the good things have been very good. For sculpture the high spots were
Anthony Caro spectacularly installed in the Trajan Markets at Rome, and the
most beautiful Henry Moore exhibition to date, in the gardens of the
Bagatelle in Paris. At home, Phillip King at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park,
and the Peter Randall-Page touring show, which I saw at the Arnolfini in
Bristol, were memorable, with the Eduardo Chillida show at Annely Juda a
wonderful autumn bonus.
Painting began well with Alan Davie at Glasgow in January, and ends no less
so with Paula Rego at the Marlborough; the grossly under-recognised veteran,
Norman Blamey, at the Fine Art Society; Patrick Caulfield at the Serpentine;
Munch magnificent at the National Gallery and Sickert in splendid pomp at
the Academy. In between we have had Allan Ramsay at Edinburgh and the
National Portrait Gallery, Otto Dix at the Tate, Juan Gris at Whitechapel,
Magritte at the Hayward, Sisley at the Academy, Boudin at the Burrell in
Glasgow, and the great Rembrandt exhibition to end its European tour at the
National Gallery and the British Museum. We have had Swagger Portraits,
Alfred Wallis, John Wonnacott, Bridget Riley, Wyndham Lewis. Abroad there
was Leonardo in Venice and Braque at Martigny.
For me the most delightful exhibition was the comparatively modest study at
Brighton of Dieppe in its relation to British painters in the modern period.
My greatest disappointment was to miss the extraordinary Matisse exhibition
in New York: my greatest treat and exhibition of the year, the still-lifes
of Picasso, in Paris at the Grand Palais. No, it has not been a bad year.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Arts: Blockbusters continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every passing year is supposed to bring the international blockbuster
exhibition nearer to extinction. Yet in spite of mounting costs and the
increasingly restrictive lending policies of the world's museums, the
mammoth retrospective seems to be far from dead. 1992 opened with the
triumphant Mantegna show at the Royal Academy in London, and ended with the
glorious presentation of the work of Matisse at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York.
The Mantegna show managed to secure an unexpectedly large number of
paintings as well as drawings and prints, and in a theatrical setting at the
RA succeeded in conveying a palpable sense of the artistic personality of
this austere Renaissance master. The Metropolitan showing was completely
different, with fewer paintings presented against brilliant white walls with
a number of works in other media helping to place the artist in context.
Another revelation was provided by the gathering of works by Jusepe de
Ribera set against scarlet cloth in the imposing vaults of the Castel
Sant'Elmo in Naples. The scale, power and intelligence of his urgent, brutal
martyrdoms and gory mythologies are lost in reproduction. In his pitch-dark
world, raking light is the only sign of salvation and colour comes courtesy
of burning coals or flayed flesh. What disturbs even now is that Ribera's
protagonists are real people, and his executioners relish their tasks.
Ribera's critical reputation has suffered from the numerous copies and
imitations of his work. Jacopo Bassano has suffered even more, thanks to the
family workshop churning out Bassanesque night-pieces on a near industrial
scale until well into the 17th century. His home town of Bassano del Grappa
in the Veneto spent some Lire 1.5bn overhauling its museum in order to
present a show, in association with the Kimbell Museum of Art in Fort Worth,
which unravelled school and master to honour its most famous son on the the
400th anniversary of his death.
This summer the Uffizi mounted a spectacular show of 15th century drawings,
the high point in what was otherwise a disappointing year of exhibitions
marking the fifth centenary of the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The
display of some 187 sheets, in the main selected from its collection of
Florentine drawings - like the British Museum show of its holdings of
Rembrandt drawings - is yet another reminder of the virtue of celebrating
what is already in one's own back yard.
The most unusual treat of the year was the spectacle of Canova's chilly
expanses of naked flesh at the Museo Correr in Venice. Among the marble
groups and busts, sketches and models amassed from all over Europe were a
number of sculptures which gave a unique opportunity to compare the earlier
and later versions of the same work, usually to the advantage of the former.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 60m science laboratory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RMJM has produced a 'trend-setting' design for a building for the Ministry
of Agriculture Fisheries and Foods's Pounds 60m central science laboratory
at Ryedale, near York.
The construction contract for the 40,000 sq metre campus has been awarded to
LAING CONSTRUCTION and HADEN YOUNG. Work will commence in the New Year and
completion is scheduled early in 1996.
The RMJM team of architects, engineers and planners has come up with a novel
approach to providing flexible laboratory buildings by placing mechanical,
electrical and drainage services on the perimeters of the buildings. 'The
idea has been tried in one or two places, but this is the first time it has
been applied wholesale on a group of laboratory buildings in the UK', said
RMJM's project director Mr Alan Crawshaw.
The design locates major plant, such as bulky air handling units, at roof
level in link blocks which run at right angles to the laboratory blocks. The
roof spaces over the laboratories contain the ducts for air handling, which
are then fed down the exterior of the two-storey buildings to first and
ground floor laboratories. The result is standardised structures with an 80
sq metre grid which can be used for anything from office space to a
chemistry laboratory. The design has the additional advantage that it
eliminates conventional ground ducts and space consuming risers, which are
inflexible and expensive to replace.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Inner cities win easier
terms on loan guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to ease the terms of the Loan Guarantee Scheme in inner
city areas from next April, writes Charles Batchelor.
It will make the scheme available on more advantageous terms in a larger
number of areas and reduce the premiums charged.
At the same time, it will tighten up on other terms of the scheme. It will
set a minimum level of Pounds 5,000 on the size of loan which can be
guaranteed in all areas outside the inner cities and will ban loans in
sectors where existing firms may be pushed out of business. This ban applies
to the entire country, including inner cities, and covers retailing,
hairdressing, taxi and cab hire and motor vehicle repair.
Under the scheme, the government guarantees 70 per cent of loans made by
banks to businesses which do not meet conventional security requirements. In
inner city areas the guarantee covers 85 per cent of the loan.
The government has paid out Pounds 177m in guarantees since the scheme was
launched in 1981 and has made possible loans worth Pounds 980m to more than
32,000 small firms.
When the scheme was first launched the banks and the government had to write
off many loans and the terms of the guarantee were tightened up. Despite the
large number of loans made, the scheme has not been popular with many bank
managers. It has also been criticised by business support organisations
because, far from providing low-cost loans to businesses on the lines of
similar schemes in other countries, guarantee scheme funding has been more
expensive.
From next April, the 85 per cent guarantee will be extended to include the
31 successful City Challenge areas as well as the 16 task force areas at
present covered. The premium payable on new loans in all these areas will be
reduced from 2 to 1 per cent.
Outside the inner cities a Pounds 5,000 minimum level will be set on loans
because small amounts of loan capital are available from other sources. The
decision to exclude certain types of business from the scheme has resulted
from studies which showed that new start-ups in sectors such as hairdressing
simply put existing firms out of business.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Firm foundations -
Charles Batchelor looks at Britain's corporate old-timers and finds the key
to success has been in staying true to the core sector in which they started
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business is transitory. One-third of new firms can expect to fail within the
first three years and by year seven, two-thirds will have gone down. Only
three out of 10 family-owned companies are reckoned to reach the second
generation.
Early companies' law provided for a company to be set up for a particular
purpose and then to be wound up when the task was accomplished. There was no
intention that companies would last for ever, finding a new role when their
original purpose was fulfilled.
Despite the uncertainty of the commercial world some businesses do survive,
not just for decades but for centuries. A new guide* to the largest 50,000
companies in the UK compiled on compact disc by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business
information group, finds no fewer than 258 businesses which are more than
200 years old and more than 3,200 which are at least 100 years old.
The guide tracks businesses by date of incorporation or charter and D&amp;B has
amplified this with information from the companies' own archives. Where two
organisations vie for seniority in the same field of activity, as do the
Cambridge and Oxford University Presses, and the early records are missing,
the rankings may remain subject to dispute.
The inevitable question that arises from this league table of corporate
old-timers is what has allowed these businesses to survive when the vast
majority have succumbed to recessions, deaths among the founding families,
takeovers or the simple snuffing out of the entrepreneurial spark.
One common characteristic is that all have stayed true to the core sector in
which they started even though many have had to adapt to considerable
technological changes.
The oldest company on the list, the Aberdeen Harbour Board started out
collecting tithes from shipping in 1136 on the authority of King David I of
Scotland. It installed its first crane in 1582, adapted to steam trawlers in
the late 19th century and now serves the oil and fishing industries.
Alldays Peacock began in 1650 manufacturing bellows for blacksmiths' forges
and foghorns for the Admiralty. Long before mission statements became
fashionable the company appears to have decided that its role in life was to
'move air'. It now makes centrifugal fans for heavy industrial use.
Some of the companies listed owe their survival in their early and most
vulnerable years to the grant of government monopolies or privileges.
Cambridge University Press owes its existence to the granting by Henry VIII
to the university in 1534 of the right to print and sell books. Cambridge
and the Oxford University Press (1586) were the only two English presses
entrusted by the Crown with the printing of the Authorized Version of the
Bible.
Official backing also played an important part in the survival of
organisations such as the Post Office, which dates from 1635, and the Bank
of England (1694).
The Bank of England was in private ownership until 1946 but owes its
pre-eminence to earlier government patronage and its monopoly right, granted
in 1844, to issue English bank notes. The privatisation drive of the 1980s
may create a wave of new enterprises which will become the long-term
survivors in the future.
Private sector banks take up no fewer than three of the top 20 places:
Barclays, founded in 1690; Coutts, now part of National Westminster Bank;
and the Bank of Scotland which, unlike its English counterpart, is not a
central bank. In their early years these banks undoubtedly owed their
independence to their entrepreneurial drive - Barclays absorbed 19 other
private banks in 1896 - though in recent years governments have had a strong
interest in maintaining banking stability.
Most of these large institutions and public corporations have come too far
from their entrepreneurial roots to be recognisable as the same
organisation. Family-run businesses, by contrast, do retain that link with
their past.
Three of the top 21 have been owned and managed by the founding family up to
the present day while two more have been under a single family's control for
most of their commercial life. R. Durtnell &amp; Sons, a Kent building company,
has been run by the same family for 12 generations while Constantine John
Folkes, present chairman of the Folkes Group, is the seventh generation to
head the business.
Firmin &amp; Sons, makers of military buttons and badges since 1677, was a
family-run business until 15 years ago and a member of the family still
works in the accounts department.
Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, gold and silver bullion dealers and now part of Hambros
Bank, describes itself as a family partnership and was largely run, between
its founding in 1671 until 1957, by just six men - four Mocattas, one
Goldsmid and a Hay.
Family ownership is often a cause for dissension but if the founders can
disentangle domestic and business concerns and avoid the dangers posed by
disaffected younger generations then it can make for longevity.
London is the home of most of the businesses engaged in commerce although
its industrial base - now much reduced - is reflected by the presence in the
table of companies such as Ede &amp; Ravenscroft, robe makers, and Vandome &amp;
Hart, manufacturers of weighing machines. Birmingham and the West Midlands
also figure prominently with Alldays Peacock, James Gibbons Format,
locksmiths and metal founders, and Firmin &amp; Sons.
Kent scores highly with both Durtnell, based in the village of Brasted, near
Penshurst, and Shepherd Neame, brewers of Faversham. (This small north Kent
town is also home to the Faversham Oyster Company which dates from the 12th
century and lays claim to being the oldest company in the world. It is,
however, too small for the D&amp;B listings.)
Founded in 1698 by the mayor of the town, the Shepherd Neame brewery is
still based on its original site over a 200-foot deep artesian well.
Improved transport networks have meant that industries are less tied to
geographical areas than was the case in the 18th and 19th centuries but,
like Shepherd Neame, the Old Bushmills Distillery, in County Antrim,
continues to owe its character to clear local water. And, just as the Kent
brewer has depended over the centuries on local hops, Bushmills has used
locally grown barley in the making of its whiskey.
The frenetic mergers and acquisitions activity which characterises the
Anglo-American business world may mean that few of today's significant
businesses will survive for so long.
The power of family dynasties should not be underestimated however.
According to one recent study, more than 70 per cent of all UK companies,
listed as well as private, are effectively family-run.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Economics: Index of spending confidence likely to rise again
in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is showing the world that its work ethic is intact by pumping out
economic data in a week when most other countries are still taking an
extended holiday between Christmas and New Year.
Today's figures on consumer confidence from the Conference Board are
expected to show a continued upward trend in December, following strong
growth after president-elect Bill Clinton's victory in November.
MMS International, the financial information company, reports that the
analysts' consensus is for a 70.1 reading on the Conference Board index
against 65.5 in November.
However, J P Morgan, which expects an increase to 75, points out it is still
a long way from the 100 to 120 range which prevailed for several years
before the recession began in mid-1990.
Other indicators meriting attention will be tomorrow's new home sales and
the report of purchasing managers in Chicago, where a rise is expected in
December. On Thursday, analysts will be looking at the figures for US
factory orders in November.
The November figures should give some insight into whether Mr Clinton's
victory has been followed by any recovery in demand for capital goods. On
balance, US economists expect a slight decline.
The main economic events and figures published this week follow. The figures
in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts provided by MMS
International.
Today: US, December Conference Board consumer confidence (70.1), November
existing home sales.
Tomorrow: US, November leading indicator (up 0.7 per cent), new home sales
(625,000). Chicago purchasing managers index. France, November final
consumer price index. Japan, last trading day of 1992 for the stock
exchange.
Thursday: US. November factory orders (down 0.7 per cent), factory
shipments, initial jobless claims for week to December 19, money supply
figures for week ending December 21. UK, October energy trends, October
engineering sales and orders at constant prices.
Friday: New Year's Day. All markets closed. Denmark assumes EC presidency.
Start of European single market. Separation of Czech and Slovak republics.
During the week: Italy, November M2 (up 7 per cent on year), cumulative PSBR
including November (L140tr).

FT  29 DEC 92 / MMI agrees deal with Zurich Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZURICH Insurance yesterday announced that it had agreed in priciple to take
over a large part of the business of Municipal Mutual Insurance, the
troubled specialist in policies for local authorities, after months of
talks.
Under the deal, Zurich Insurance will acquire MMI's local authority
liability business, personal insurance policies and a range of commercial
insurance business. Zurich is also likely to employ about 1,800 of MMI's
2,000 staff.
The agreement follows prolonged negotiations between the two companies,
starting in October. Zurich was reluctant to assume liabilities on policies
already underwritten by MMI, which used to insure 90 per cent of local
authorities.
Zurich is not thought to be taking financial responsibility for MMI's past
liabilities but is taking on the administration of past liabilities with
current business, using the staff and assets that will transfer from MMI.
Zurich said that MMI policyholders would be offered renewal terms. It said
it would employ all MMI staff directly involved in the business being
transferred, as well as all relevant systems such as computers and working
assets.
Zurich said that the companies anticipated finalising contracts in January
subject to final board and regulatory approval.
MMI said that employees of both companies had already been briefed on the
agreement, and said it was pleased that the central administrative core of
the company had not had to be broken up.
An agreement had been widely expected after Zurich offered new facilities in
November to 300 local authorities whose policies were coming up for renewal.
It also offered fresh cover to about 31,000 individual MMI policyholders.
The deal will be an important step for Zurich Insurance towards its target
of expanding significantly in Britain. In 1990 its share of the British
non-life insurance market was 1.1 per cent and it ranked 20th by size, but
it was the third biggest life insurer in Europe last year.
MMI withdrew from the insurance market in September, leaving a number of
local authorities without cover. This followed the breakdown of earlier
rescue talks with La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires, the French
insurer.
The company first encountered trouble last year when it had losses of more
than Pounds 250m on its liability business. It was affected by claims over
fires in schools, as well as potential claims from former occupants of
children's homes, which led to it breaching the DTI's solvency guidelines.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Few food companies see upturn in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER than half of Britain's larger food, drink and consumer goods
manufacturers and their suppliers said they had noticed an upturn in demand
for their products by the middle of this month, according to a survey.
Almost half of those which had experienced no recovery expected one to start
in the first or second quarter of next year. Twenty-five per cent said they
expected no improvement until 1994.
A small majority of the companies did not want sterling to rejoin the
European exchange rate mechanism in the next 12 months. This view was
particularly strong among British-owned companies.
The telephone survey covered directors of 181 manufacturing companies with
annual sales of more than Pounds 5m, most of them in consumer businesses. It
was carried out for the Financial Times between December 14 and 21 by
Nielsen, the market research company.
About two thirds of the companies surveyed expected UK sales and exports to
increase next year, while about a quarter believed they would stay the same.
Slightly more than a quarter planned to increase adver-tising spending, and
about the same proportion expected their staff numbers in Britain to
increase. However, 16 per cent expected their staff numbers to fall.
Eighty-five per cent said recent currency fluctuations had affected their
business, and just over a third said they had to rethink their production
and distribution arrangements in Europe as a result.

REGULATIONS coming into force on January 1 will make roadworks less of a
disruption, the government says.
The rules provide for better control over the timing and co-ordination of
street works to help ensure that utilities such as gas and water do not rip
up the same piece of road in succession, and set standards for the
reinstatement of surfaces.

FT  29 DEC 92 / BA and Virgin set for libel trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways yesterday said it would meet Virgin Atlantic in court over a
libel action launched by its smaller rival, in spite of speculation about an
out-of-court settlement.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin group, initiated the libel action
after BA denied his allegations of 'dirty tricks' and unfair competition
practices. The action is due to start on January 11. British Airways is also
suing Virgin over the allegations.
BA said: 'We expect to be in court when the case starts and the whole matter
is in the hands of our solicitors.'

UNIONS won more than Pounds  1/4 bn in legal awards for their members during
1991, after spending Pounds 20m on legal services.
Most of the 150,000 legal cases a year pursued by unions are actions for
damages following personal injuries at work. The survey by the Trades Union
Congress covered 28 unions representing 89 per cent of members in unions
affiliated to the TUC.

FT  29 DEC 92 / An optimistic wake-up call from the cosy pink sofa: Raymond
Snoddy previews what morning viewers can expect from GMTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON SCREEN, commercial breakfast television is a world dominated by cosy
domestic interiors, the colour pink and optimistic wake-up presenters.
The set of Good Morning Television, which replaces TV-am at 6am on January
1, will have a similar pink cosiness and, in spite of dire financial
predictions, optimism is starting to spread backstage.
Earlier this year Mr Bruce Gyngell, chief executive of TV-am, forecast that
GMTV, which bid Pounds 34.6m a year for the franchise and must also pay 15
per cent of advertising revenue to the Treasury, would be 'bust' within 18
months.
In more measured terms, stockbrokers James Capel warned that the company
would not reach operational break-even until 1995 and would have to wait
until 1997 for its first pre-tax profit, put at Pounds 1.5m.
But Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director of GMTV, expects at least to
break even by the end of the company's first year on air.
He says it has already booked more than enough advertising revenue to cover
the bid and probably the 15 per cent to the government as well.
Mr Stoddart says that the company, based in London Weekend Television's
South Bank headquarters by the Thames, has just passed its first Pounds 50m
in advertising revenue. City analysts' forecasts for first-year revenue
range between Pounds 65m and Pounds 80m.
In spite of the recession GMTV expects to reach the upper end of the
forecasts, and perhaps even exceed them.
'We are ahead of schedule in selling terms, compared with where TV-am would
have expected to be at this time of year. TV-am expects Pounds 78.5m by the
end of the year,' said Mr Stoddart, who learned about cost-effective
television by running CIS, the satellite company that provides horse-racing
coverage to bookmakers.
Start-up costs for GMTV - jointly owned by LWT, Scottish Television, Carlton
Communications, Walt Disney and The Guardian - are Pounds 8m, 15 per cent
below the business plan figure.
The station will have fewer than half the 400 staff TV-am had in the run-up
to the competitive tenders for new licences. The total includes a 70-strong
news team on contract from Reuters Television, formerly Visnews.
TV-am spent Pounds 14m a year on news alone. GMTV has integrated news and
programming departments, with a total programming cost of Pounds 30m a year.
The programme will be unashamedly populist, including a feature called
Healthy Hunks, introduced by former Page Three model Linda Lusardi, advice
on what to do about such problems as 'wobbly bottoms' and a trivia quiz
featuring Jeremy Beadle.
After the morning rush, the last 35 minutes of the programme from 8.50am
will, the station says, feature fashion, real-life love stories and health
and sex advice.
The company says top national and international news stories will be
covered, but domestic news with human interest is likely to be emphasised.
'We will definitely be more Washington County Durham than Washington DC,'
says Ms Lis Howell, director of programmes.
News is promised on everything from education and politics to the royal
family 'when topical'. The regional ITV companies will supply local news and
weather.
GMTV promises its audience a 'bright start and a warm welcome to the day'
with a 'relaxed, informative and entertaining' programme.
'We will be bringing you (the viewer) up to date with what's happening in
the world and preparing you for the day ahead,' the company promises.
To begin with, audience ambitions are modest - to hold on to the TV-am peak
audience of about 2.5m, then build slowly.
Ms Howell, former managing editor of the 24-hour satellite channel Sky News,
says of GMTV: 'Populist to me means that it is something that will appeal to
everyone. It is not Newsnight, it is not The Money Programme, but it will
have something that appeals to people of all intellectual levels.'

FT  29 DEC 92 / Bucking the Trend: Lack of frills keeps curtain maker on
track - How a move upmarket and a new sales director helped transform
Curtina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE the plain grey office door of Mr Len Bichard, chairman of
curtain-maker Curtina, staff work quickly, cutting, sewing and folding
material.
They need to work quickly. Sales have doubled since 1990 and turnover for
the current year should pass Pounds 18m.
Exports have taken off over the same period and account for 10 per cent of
sales. Mr Bichard's salary last year was Pounds 106,688, up from Pounds
41,234 the year before.
It has been a long haul. He started the company in 1967 after working for
textiles group Courtaulds. For 20 years he made a steady living selling
velvet curtains from Rainham, a decaying town in Essex.
Then two decisions transformed the company: a move into printed fabrics and
the recruitment of a new sales director.
'We looked at the price of grey (raw) cloth and the price of printing and
found the others were charging four times cost. We thought we could charge
double,' says Mr Bichard.
That strategy has been maintained with the help of cost control.
Only 15 per cent of sales are through freelance agents. The rest is sold by
just three people, including Mr Bichard and his sales director.
There are no secretaries. 'We make our own phone calls and write one letter
a week.'
There is no design studio. Patterns are bought from freelance designers.
Specialist equipment for handling materials, such as cloth cutters, are
built by a freelance engineer.
Offices are plain to the point of shabbiness. The chairman's office is lit
by three ceiling striplights. The chairs are a tatty lime green.
Corporate entertaining is out. 'We are not interested in fancy lunches. Even
the PR is on the cheap.'
The choice of curtain prints has helped growth. 'The taste of the
curtain-buyer has always been seen as lower middle class,' says Mr Bichard.
'We gave them better taste and they bought it.'
With top management making up the sales team, financial policies are
designed to save time. Equipment is bought outright, there is no rented
property and no discounting of invoices.
Not everything is going well, however. Managing growth is unfamiliar ground
and the value of stocks has been allowed to rise to Pounds 3.25m. 'We are
addressing the problem,' says Mr Bichard.
The rise of exports means the tiny sales team is out of its depth. 'We have
not geared up to the standards we need to maximise overseas sales. Since the
pound fell we have had many more enquiries but our growth rate is stretching
us and limiting our selling drive.'
Those limits have brought their own benefits, Mr Bichard argues. The company
has been able to choose its customers to minimise the risk of bad debts. 'If
someone doesn't pay on time we simply don't deal. If they fall down on the
first payment we go in and take the goods back.'
Growth has also brought buying power. Curtina's factories in Rainham and
Leyland, Lancashire, consume about 100,000 metres of grey cloth a week.
Sales agents are knocking on the company's doors to offer cut-price deals.
Mr Bichard blames the 'silly' boom of the 1980s for rivals losing ground or
failing in the recession. 'Manufacturers recruited irresponsibly and buyers
were able to buy badly.
'Then things turned and management put the pressure on buyers. Money got
dear and retailers had to address stock levels. A 10-week lead time was
normal but our lead time is one week. We don't send a confirmation letter of
an order, the goods would arrive first.'
The result is a growing list of customers, including John Lewis Partnership,
Debenhams and Allied Carpets. Overseas customers include mail-order group
Quelle Grossversandhaus, Germany's second-largest fashion retailer.
At 61, Mr Bichard is an informal boss. He laughs easily and sometimes seems
awed by the pace of change. 'We don't have a five-year plan,' he says
sheepishly. 'We've not yet got used to the idea we are becoming a reasonably
sized business.'

FT  29 DEC 92 / 'Gentle' recovery predicted for homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSING market should start a gentle recovery in the spring, but further
measures might be needed to stimulate low levels of demand and help
householders with negative equity, Halifax Building Society says today.
In a review of the market in 1992, the society says house prices have
recently been slipping by about 0.5 per cent to 0.7 per cent each month. It
says these falls could continue over the winter months, but prices should
stabilise from the spring.
Some monthly increases are probable in the second half of next year and
market activity is forecast to rise by 10 per cent to 15 per cent from the
depressed levels this year, when about 1.1m house moves took place.
The building society bases its forecast on the affordability of houses,
which it says are as cheap now as at any time in the past 10 years.
It says: 'We also believe that the recovery in the economy as a whole could
be stronger than expected. The chancellor's forecast of 1 per cent GDP
growth next year could well be a little pessimistic with the out-turn nearer
1.5 per cent.'
It believes house prices will rise next year in line with earnings - about 5
per cent to 6 per cent - with house moves reaching 1.5m to 1.6m, up 30 per
cent on current levels.
Halifax says: 'This will mean a well-functioning housing market with prices
rising slowly in real terms but with people able to buy and sell houses much
more easily than has been the case for the past few years.'
The society's forecast for this year, made a year ago, proved to be wide of
the mark - it said prices should rise in line with an inflation rate of
about 4 per cent - and there are caveats in its current forecast.
It says there are several reasons why householders may not react to better
affordability as they did in the mid-1970s: rising unemployment -
particularly among the white-collar sector and in the southern half of the
UK; concerns about possible further house price falls, and the phenomenon of
negative equity.
The Halifax says further reductions in interest rates would help, but it
also sees 'a good opportunity for the government to reform the current
mortgage interest tax relief system to target subsidy more directly to those
who need it.'

MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, today makes a renewed effort towards
creating an economic upturn by insisting that British manufacturing
performance should be 'a source of confidence and pride'.
He is the latest in a line of ministers encouraging British industry to
capitalise on the opportunities offered by the fall in interest rates and
the change to a floating exchange rate since sterling left the European
exchange rate mechanism in mid-September.
Mr Lamont, attacking those who were 'too quick to run Britain down', says
the recession hid positive trends in manufacturing. International
comparisons showed British manufacturing well-placed to take advantage of an
upturn in the world economy.
In a foreword released ahead of the publication of a Tory research
department pamphlet on Britain's manufacturing record, Mr Lamont says that
the economy abounded in 'self-denigrating myths'. Although manufacturing now
accounts for a smaller proportion of national income and employment than it
used to, for example, this is not evidence of decline but mainly a
reflection of productivity gains.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, condemned Mr Lamont's comments as
'complacent and arrogant' when manufacturing output had been growing more
slowly since 1979 than in any other leading industrialised country and
650,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost since the recession started.
A survey from Manpower, the employment services company, also shows
generally gloomy employment prospects for the first quarter of 1993, but
says that job losses in manufacturing have stabilised and predicts that the
clothing sector is even set to start recruiting labour.
The survey of 2,000 companies found 10 per cent forecasting job increases
and 26 per cent expecting further job shedding. The net balance of 16 per
cent of employers forecasting job losses is worse than the first quarter of
1992 when the figure was 12 per cent.
Banking remains the worst affected sector, with a net 36 per cent of
employers surveyed predicting job cuts compared with 23 per cent in the
first quarter of 1992. In the public sector, a net 27 per cent of employers
are forecasting job losses, up from 16 per cent in the same period in 1992.
In local government the net balance is 36 per cent.
According to the survey the manufacturing sector is less pessimistic, with a
balance of only 6 per cent of employers predicting job cuts.
A net 6 per cent of employers in the insurance industry expect to recruit.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Young considers tax help for rented housing finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX CONCESSIONS and other incentives could be introduced to encourage
financial institutions to invest in housing for rent, Sir George Young, the
housing minister, said yesterday.
The fresh emphasis on promoting the private rented sector marks a shift away
from the 1980s Tory rhetoric in favour of home-ownership but Sir George made
it clear that the government stood by its manifesto pledge to maintain
mortgage tax relief.
His suggestion of new forms of government financial help for housing
investment, including cash grants and loans on preferential terms appeared
unrealistic to some investors, and people working in housing.
Sir George said on BBC radio that his talks with financial institutions had
shown they were interested in investing, but that 'at the moment, the sums
don't quite add up'.
There was a yield gap between the return an institution, such as a pension
fund, could expect from putting money into housing and what it would get
from other investments, he said.
'The decision government will have to take quite soon is whether they are
prepared to meet that gap in return for getting the substantial increase in
investment in property that we all want to see.'
Institutional investors reacted sceptically. They said it was unlikely they
would be attracted to residential property and cited the lack of liquidity
and the small size of the potential investment.
Mr Philip Scott, general manager of finance at Norwich Union, said it was
'highly unlikely' that institutions could be persuaded to invest in private
rented housing, although traditional landlords might be encouraged back.
Mr Scott said institutions tended to consider any investment of less than
Pounds 5m - the typical size of a residential investment - as small.
Economies of scale were not available from such investments, he said.
Mr Paul Gaunt, a senior investment manager at Equitable Life, said property
was likely to be such an illiquid investment that he did not believe most
institutional investors would be interested in it.
He added: 'If we are approached, we will certainly take a look at the risk
and reward but at first glance it looks like a non-starter.'
Ms Sheila McKechnie, the director of Shelter, the national campaign for the
homeless, thought the plans Sir George had in mind required a different
fiscal and investment structure.
She said they would need 'massive injections of government money - and I
don't see the Treasury doing that'.

Ghanaians today elect their first parliament since 1981 but an opposition
boycott will hand President Jerry Rawlings a hollow victory, Reuter reports
from Accra. Three pro-Rawlings parties and a dozen independents were left to
compete for the 200-seat assembly. 'That will. . .put in place a one-party,
rubber-stamp parliament with no credibility,' said Mr Kwesi Pratt, a radical
opposition activist. Ghana's three main opposition parties announced the
boycott this month in protest at what they said was wholesale rigging in the
November 3 presidential elections. Mr Rawlings was declared winner with more
than 58 per cent of the vote. Foreign observers said the result was broadly
fair but agreed that the electoral register was over-sized.

<TEXT>
THE US is dispatching the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk from Somali coastal
waters to the Gulf in response to Iraqi attempts to penetrate a no-fly zone
over southern Iraq, agencies report from Washington.
Normally the US has had a carrier stationed in the Gulf-Arabian Sea area but
none has been present since the build-up of US forces in Somalia began
earlier this month.
Pentagon officials said yesterday the Kitty Hawk would arrive in the next
day or two, with about 70 combat aircraft aboard along with 5,500 troops.
President George Bush and President-elect Bill Clinton say they are united
in a determination to enforce the UN-imposed no-fly zone, and they added
that it would be a mistake for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to test their
resolve.
State Department spokesman Joe Snyder said: 'US and allied forces remain on
alert and capable of enforcing relevant UN resolutions. We are closely
monitoring the situation and are prepared to respond as necessary to further
harassments of UN operations.'
He said Baghdad had waged 'a pattern of harassment against various UN
operations in Iraq, against (UN) inspectors in the south, and against
humanitarian operations in the north of Iraq.'

FT  29 DEC 92 / Iraqi clash highlights Gulf volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE challenge by President Saddam Hussein on Sunday of the air exclusion
zone over southern Iraq, during which one of his fighter aircraft was shot
down by an American F-16, serves as a sharp reminder to President-elect Bill
Clinton of how volatile the Gulf region remains.
Two incursions by Iraqi fighters within an hour on Sunday were the first
serious challenges to the allied policing of the no-fly zone since it was
imposed four months ago with the aim of protecting the southern Shia
population from further attacks by Baghdad.
Yesterday Baghdad vowed to avenge the destruction of the aircraft and said
it would exact revenge on Mr George Bush, the outgoing US president.
Iraq's deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said the country had no obligation
under UN resolutions to recognise the no-fly zone in the south. 'Iraq does
not recognise the ban imposed on its flights,' he said.
President Saddam may have calculated that the threat of a US air strike had
diminished during the final days of the Bush administration and that he
could afford to test the resolve of the US, Britain and France to keep
aircraft based in the Gulf. There have also been recent reports of growing
food shortages and rising inflation in Baghdad and President Saddam could be
trying to divert local discontent.
He will also hope to fuel Gulf tensions provoked by Iran's claims to
sovereignty over Abu Musa, close to the Strait of Hormuz, and the Greater
and Lesser Tumbs. The United Arab Emirates has taken the issue to the UN.
The already widespread concern among Arab countries at the threat of Iraq
being, in effect, divided into three would be further fed by the prospect of
a more assertive Iran. Iraq's military aircraft are also banned from flying
over the north of the country, beyond the 36th parallel, to offer protection
to the Kurdish population.
Baghdad and other Arab capitals will doubtless contrast the lengths the US
and its allies will go to ensure Iraqi compliance and the attitude adopted
towards Israel following its rejection of Security Council resolution 799
demanding the return of 415 Palestinians deported from the West Bank and
Gaza to southern Lebanon.
Iraq has agreed in principle to allow UN guards to escort food convoys into
Kurdish areas as well as inspect cargo at checkpoints, a senior UN official
said yesterday, Reuter reports from the UN in New York. UN agencies
suspended most of their winter relief for Kurds in northern Iraq after aid
trucks were bombed or mined earlier this month.

<TEXT>
CAMBODIA'S Khmer Rouge guerrillas, shrugging off pressure from Thailand and
economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council, yesterday
refused to rejoin the UN peace plan for Cambodia.
After talks in Bangkok with Mr Khieu Samphan, nominal Khmer Rouge leader, Mr
Prasong Soonsiri, the Thai foreign minister, said he saw no change in the
group's position.
In the face of international criticism of its support for the Khmer Rouge,
Thailand has announced plans to implement UN resolutions by stopping oil
exports to the guerrillas and preventing the import of logs from Cambodia.
Bangkok wants to be seen persuading the Khmer Rouge to abide by the Paris
peace accords, which the organisation signed last year but has since
repeatedly flouted.
After yesterday's meeting, however, Mr Khieu reiterated Khmer Rouge
allegations that Vietnamese forces were still active inside Cambodia and
repeated demands that the Supreme National Council - which comprises the
four main factions, including the Khmer Rouge - should be given more power.
He also ruled out UN checkpoints inside Khmer Rouge territory to monitor
sanctions against the group.
The UN has no evidence to support Khmer Rouge accusations that Vietnamese
forces remain in Cambodia in contravention of the peace accords. But to
Thailand's embarrassment there have been reports of Thai soldiers - other
than those serving with the UN - inside Khmer Rouge-controlled Cambodian
territory.

MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday defended his
government's decision to acquire the disputed holy site at Ayodhya, northern
India, saying that two separate trusts would be charged with building a
temple and a mosque there.
The Faizabad district administration yesterday allowed Hindu pilgrims to
worship at a makeshift temple built by militants after they destroyed the
400-year Babri mosque on December 6, prompting countrywide riots which left
more than 1,200 dead.
The decision to take over the disputed site, and then empower the local
authorities to decide whether or not to permit worship, has been criticised
by opposition parties and Moslem leaders.
The Babri Masjid Movement Co-ordination Committee said the district
authorities' decision to allow worship of the idols while a lawsuit on
behalf of the Hindu community was under hearing by the Allahabad High Court
'amounted to granting legitimacy to an act of vandalism and to a flagrant
contempt of the court'.
The Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, welcomed the decision to allow worship but
said trusts to build the temple were 'no conclusive solution'.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Balancing the risks to the world economy in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHASTENED by the failures of its economic forecasting team over the past few
years, the OECD has decided to offer alternative scenarios for economic
growth in its latest economic outlook.
Its baseline forecast suggests a modest world recovery over the coming year,
although most of the rise in growth rates is expected to occur outside
Europe. But the organisation has also provided gloomier alternatives for the
pessimists.
The OECD's baseline forecast is hardly optimistic. The US economy is
expected to grow by 2.4 per cent in 1993, a mere 0.6 percentage points
higher than this year. Japanese economic growth is also expected to pick up
to 2.3 per cent in the year. But Europe is the laggard with growth of just
1.4 per cent.
The main downside risk, according to the OECD, is that the effects of debt
deflation, which have undermined the organisation's forecasts over the past
year, may persist and even intensify in the short term. The OECD's baseline
projections assume that the recent caution of US and Japanese consumers will
taper off during 1993. But this could well prove too optimistic,
particularly in Japan where the adjustment process started later. In the
OECD's alternative scenario, Japanese domestic demand weakens by 1 per cent
of gross domestic product while US private consumption also falls by 1 per
cent of GDP, equivalent to a half percentage point rise in the US household
savings rate.
The effect on overall growth is assumed to be mitigated by a larger than
expected fall in short-term interest rates as inflationary pressures remain
subdued. The OECD currently expects US short-term interest rates to fall to
3.1 per cent in 1993, from an average 3.4 per cent his year, before rising
to 4 per cent in 1994. But its pessimistic scenario assumes a fall to 2.9
per cent in both 1993 and 1994.
The result is to reduce next year's US growth rate by 1.1 percentage points
relative to the baseline forecast for 1993, and Japanese growth by 0.9
percentage points. The spillover effects from this sluggish growth are
assumed to reduce the German growth rate by 0.2 percentage points and growth
in OECD Europe, excluding Germany, by 0.1 percentage points.
Yet too fast a US recovery could bring problems of a different sort. The
International Bank Credit Analyst, in its latest annual outlook, worries
that the combination of the US fiscal deficit and the low level of private
savings could mean that anything more than a sluggish recovery will be
choked off by higher interest rates.
The mechanism by which this rise in interest rates could occur is a loss of
confidence in the US dollar among foreign investors. The IBCA highlights how
dependent the US is on foreign investors - the cumulative US current account
deficit since 1970 amounts to Dollars 925bn, more than 15 per cent of
current US GDP. The improvement in the US current account deficit recently
has made only a small dent in that debt, as the chart shows.
Too fast a US recovery is the most likely way to frighten foreign investors,
the IBCA says. 'The already deteriorating current account would widen
sharply if the economy accelerates and the US would have to rely on foreign
savings to a much greater extent. This may not be possible unless US
interest rates rise sharply and that would probably abort the recovery.'
The UK, currently lumbered with a proportionately larger current account
deficit than the US as a percentage of GDP, faces a similar balance of
payments problems. But for the rest of Europe the most serious risk is that
German wage inflation will prove more stubborn than expected and German
interest rates will remain high.
The OECD's baseline forecast assumes that German short-term rates will fall
to 7.8 per cent next year from 9.4 per cent this year, and then decline to
6.5 per cent in 1994. But what if German wage inflation is 1 percentage
point higher than expected? The OECD guesses that German interest rates will
remain above 8 1/2 per cent next year, in which case its growth rate will
fall by a full percentage point, dragging the rest of Europe down with it.

<TEXT>
LEADERS of the four member countries of South America's Mercosur common
market reached agreement yesterday on the trade pact's future external
tariffs.
At the end of their third summit, in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo,
the presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil decided on a
common external tariff from 0 to 20 per cent that will come into force in
January 1995. By then all internal trade barriers within the four countries
should have been eliminated.
Tariffs had become a contentious issue because countries were forced to
compromise over different trade and industrial policies.
The agreement gives Mercosur an important boost at a time when Brazil's
economic and political problems and Argentina's decision in October to
impose protectionist measures had brought the common market's future into
doubt.
The four agreed that a few products would be protected by a higher tariff of
35 per cent that would be gradually reduced over the subsequent six years.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Clinton appointments upset party factions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton is spending this week in South Carolina in the
company of friends. But his final flurry of cabinet appointments on
Christmas Eve may have made him a few enemies and has not necessarily
clarified many of the directions his new government will take.
He and his wife Hillary will be attending the annual retreat known as
Renaissance, which brings together mostly like-minded politicians, writers,
lawyers, civil servants and many from the private sector for discussions on
everything from health care reform to personal spirituality.
The Renaissance group forms one of Mr Clinton's own network of contacts,
some of whom he used in the formation of his government.
Intriguing appointments - such as those of Ms Zoe Baird, who is the first
woman named attorney-general, and Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the black businesswoman
who will run the energy department - demonstrated how independent Mr Clinton
could be of the well-established vested interest groups.
However, some of these powerful lobbies are disappointed in some of his
selections.
Among those he may have alienated are the Daley family of Chicago. Mr
William Daley, brother of Mayor Richard Daley, was thought to be the likely
transportation secretary, only to be superseded on Christmas Eve by the
nomination of Mr Federico Pena, Hispanic former mayor of Denver, Colorado.
The Daleys worked mightily in the election to ensure Mr Clinton carried with
ease the vital state of Illinois.
Environmentalists were ultimately satisfied with the naming of Mr Bruce
Babbitt, former governor of Arizona, to the interior department.
It had seemed Mr Babbitt was destined to be US trade representative, so as
to open up the interior position to another Hispanic, Congressman Bill
Richardson of New Mexico, not considered a strong environmentalist. Another
candidate of the green lobby, Mr Tim Wirth, the outgoing senator from
Colorado, failed to land a cabinet position, as was expected.
Trade specialists profess to be puzzled by the appointment of Mr Mickey
Kantor, Mr Clinton's campaign manager, to the position now held by Mrs Carla
Hills.
Mr Kantor is a veteran political operator, to whom the president-elect is
much indebted, but he has no trade experience at a time when the Gatt
negotiations may be reaching a climax.
The evidence is that the president-elect will be almost as involved in the
choice of the second-tier members of his government.
Some of those disappointed so far may thus be offered substantive positions.

</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, and his Russian counterpart,
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, edged closer to a historic nuclear arms reduction treaty
yesterday, although doubts remained after several hours of talks, Reuter
reports from Geneva.
'We're making progress,' Mr Eagleburger said at a dinner he hosted for Mr
Kozyrev at the end of a day of talks. But asked if he could complete the
Start II treaty today, he said: 'I can't tell you. We're not going to say
anything more until we've got this thing finished. We will be doing our
best.'
Earlier, Mr Kozyrev had voiced optimism that he and Mr Eagleburger could
succeed in efforts to complete the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty before
President George Bush left office on January 20.
'I am ready to bet a bottle of whisky and say that we will do such work here
which will make it possible for our presidents to have a positive decision
after our negotiations today,' he said.
At the dinner the Russian foreign minister said he still expected to win his
bet. 'So far my glass is full,' he said.
But Mr Richard Boucher, a US spokesman, had said after the initial meeting
that it was clear the talks would have to continue today. Mr Eagle-burger
plans to return to Washington this afternoon, regardless of whether or not
he has secured a deal.
Start II aims to reduce the two countries' stocks of nuclear weapons by
about two-thirds and eliminate land-based missiles with multiple warheads,
the most dangerous category of cold war weapons.
As the talks began there were three issues separating the sides: the fate of
Russian SS18 silos, the role of Russian SS19 missiles and the question of
which US bombers should be counted under treaty limits.
The US relaxed its earlier position that all silos housing the 154 SS18
missiles should be destroyed. Under the treaty the missiles would be
eliminated but Russia had asked to preserve the silos to protect mobile SS25
missiles.
On SS19s, Mr Eagleburger said Washington was prepared to allow the Russians
to 'download' five warheads from some of their 170 missiles and thus
preserve them under the treaty.
On the issue of bombers, the US wants to retain the option of loading
nuclear weapons on its B1 aircraft as it retires B52 bombers. But Russia
says the B1s should be counted under the treaty limits if Washington wants
to preserve that right.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Collor fails to delay judgment

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court yesterday denied a
last-minute request by suspended President Fernando Collor de Mello to delay
judgment by the Senate on his impeachment.
Mr Collor, who was suspended from office in September for alleged
corruption, will be permanently removed from office if the upper house of
the legislature convicts him today, as expected.
Chief Justice Sydney Sanches rejected a suit filed by Mr Collor asking for
an additional 30 days to allow his new lawyer to prepare arguments.
Mr Collor dismissed his attorneys last Tuesday, on the eve of the original
trial date, forcing the Supreme Court to postpone the Senate hearing until
today.
However, Mr Sanches accepted Mr Jose de Moura Rocha as Mr Collor's new
defence attorney. The judge also maintained a court-appointed counsel, named
after Mr Collor dismissed his attorneys.
Mr Mauro Benevides, president of the Senate, said he expected all 81 members
of the upper house to appear at the special session. Opinion polls have
shown that pro-impeachment forces, who need a two-thirds majority, should
have enough votes to remove Mr Collor from office.
An aide to Mr Benevides said the Senate president planned to keep the
parliament in session until a final outcome was reached.
Mr Collor, the country's first democratically elected president in several
decades, is facing charges of official misconduct, including allegations
that he personally benefited from a multi-million dollar slush fund run by
his former campaign treasurer.
If Mr Collor is removed from office, interim president Itamar Franco, Mr
Collor's vice-presidential running mate in the 1989 campaign, should be
formally inaugurated tomorrow.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Weinberger hits back over pardon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Caspar Weinberger, a former US secretary of defence, yesterday accused
the Iran-Contra special prosecutor of pursuing a 'totally unethical'
vendetta against presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
In a series of television interviews Mr Weinberger said it was 'ridiculous'
to suggest that Mr Bush's Christmas Eve pardon of himself and five others
was intended to cover up the then vice-president's own involvement in the
scheme to sell arms to Iran in return for the release of US hostages in
Lebanon and then illegally to divert the proceeds to rebels in Nicaragua.
Mr Weinberger, in effect, said Mr Laurence Walsh, the special prosecutor,
had indicted him for lying to Congress about his knowledge of the affair as
a way to get at Mr Reagan and, now, Mr Bush.
The charges, he said, would have been dropped if he had implicated either Mr
Reagan or Mr Bush. A spokeswoman for Mr Walsh said yesterday that Mr
Weinberger was not asked to incriminate anybody else.
Mr Weinberger, 75, conceded he may have misled Congress but denied he did so
with criminal intent.
He agreed that Mr Bush attended meetings at which the sale of missiles to
Iran was discussed but said it was 'a matter of opinion' whether the
discussions also embraced Iran's help in securing the release of US
hostages. Mr Reagan, he noted, had asserted they did not.
The stage is set for a bitter confrontation between Mr Walsh and Mr Bush
over the president's private notes of his knowledge of the Iran-Contra
affair, which Mr Bush has said he will release. Congress may also get into
the act by holding hearings on the affair.
Mr Walsh's ire was exacerbated by Mr Bush's justification for the pardons.
In his statement the president accused the prosecutor of exploiting 'a
profoundly troubling development in the political and legal climate of our
country: the criminalisation of policy differences.' This so outraged Mr
Walsh that on Christmas Eve he revealed for the first time that Mr Bush was
a subject of his investi-gations.
Mr Weinberger's notes, which he insisted he had never sought to conceal from
Mr Walsh, suggest Mr Bush was in favour of the missile sale to Iran and, by
implication, the whole Iran-Contra-hostages scheme which Mr Weinberger,
along with Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, vigorously opposed.
There had been heavy lobbying, mostly by former Reagan administration
officials, for Mr Bush to pardon Mr Weinberger before Mr Bill Clinton takes
over as president next month. A central argument of their campaign was that
justice would hardly be seen to be have been done if Mr Weinberger, an
opponent of Iran-Contra, were found guilty while its chief architect, Lt Col
Oliver North, were roaming free, his conviction having been overturned on
appeal.
Mr Clinton has been careful not to comment on the Weinberger pardon,
although it has been sharply criticised by some prominent Democrats in
Congress. An exception is Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House, whose tacit
approval seems to have been secured in advance by the White House.
However, the incoming Clinton government will have on its plate a number of
outstanding investigations related to the Reagan and Bush administration
dealings with Iran and Iraq, as well as to the search of Mr Clinton's
passport records.
Mr Clinton has said, generally, he favours the renewal of the statute, which
expired earlier this month, authorising the appointment of independent
special prosectors.

FT  29 DEC 92 / US contract loss dismays French group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, the French computer group, yesterday said it was 'very
disappointed' that its subsidiary, Zenith Data Systems, had lost a Dollars
740m (Pounds 486.8m) contract to supply the US Air Force with desktop
computers.
US government arbitrators voided Zenith's contract on December 24 following
complaints from rival bidders.
The General Service Administration's Board of Contract Appeals did not spell
out the reasons for its ruling, nor explain the next stage in the contract
award. In an unusual move it decided to keep details of its ruling secret
until next Monday.
The contract has been embroiled in controversy for more than a year.
It was initially awarded in November 1991 to CompuAdd Computer, a
privately-owned company based in Austin, Texas, and Sysorex Information
Systems, based in Virginia.
The two companies lost the contract earlier this year after protests from
Zenith and other losing bidders, which complained they had been unfairly
disqualified from the race.
The contract involves about 300,000 desktop computers, along with related
software and peripherals, to be delivered over a three-year period.
Ironically, the deal was meant to set a model for a new 'fast-track' method
of bidding on US government contracts for computer equipment, designed to
eliminate the problem of equipment becoming obsolete by the time the
normally cumbersome procurement process has been completed.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Yeltsin gives information post to former deputy PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has appointed the man he was supposed to have
sacrificed to conservative deputies to an even more important job - telling
the Russian people what to think about market reforms in Russia.
Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, sacked as first deputy prime minister, is to head a
new Federal Information Service which will seek to redress the effects of
seven decades of Communist propaganda.
The agency's role will be to 'secure through print and the mass media, the
distribution of timely and wide information about the progress of reforms in
Russia and to clarify government policy.' Nobody in or out of office
disagrees that a lack of explanation and education about market economics
was one of the most serious shortcomings of the reforms begun in January
this year.
But it is not yet clear whether Mr Poltoranin, who achieved few practical
results in this area when he was minister for information and media, can
actually deliver what is expected of him in his new position.
His main strength, it would seem, is Mr Yeltsin's trust in him.
Meanwhile his deputy, Mr Mikhail Fedotov, who takes over as minister, is now
supposed to concentrate solely on registering and licensing new media,
together with the vaguer mission of promoting freedom of speech. The job's
more interesting functions have gone over to Mr Poltoranin, who will also be
directly responsible for state-owned TV and newspapers.
Another notable victim of Mr Yeltsin's government reshuffle has already
landed on his feet.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister whom Mr Yeltsin finally abandoned to the
Congress rage, has already received a number of invitations to return to
politics from small political parties looking for a leader.
Mr Gaidar, who displayed considerable political talents in his year in
office, says he would consider a larger grouping of various pro-reform
parties. In the meantime he has a direct line to President Yeltsin from his
office as director of one of Russia's many economic research institutes.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Tietmeyer joins calls in support of ERM parities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR European monetary policymakers yesterday sought to stave off market
pressure on the European exchange rate mechanism.
The comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, and Mr
Henning Christophersen, European Community commissioner for economic and
financial affairs, came as the Danish central bank trimmed two of its
pivotal money market interest rates.
Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday that there was no reason to change the parity
between the D-Mark and the French franc.
At the weekend, Mr Christophersen said he expected no change in the value of
the Irish punt and Danish krone in the ERM, and forecast 'no exchange rate
realignments in the next four months'.
As currency traders and securities dealers returned to quiet continental
markets after the Christmas break, the Danish central bank took advantage of
the calmer conditions to cut the rates it uses to steer money market rates
to 13 per cent from 14 per cent.
The 1 percentage point reduction in the fixed yields offered by the Danish
central bank in its transactions with 14-day certificates of deposit and on
a 15-day money market repurchase deal followed a similar cautious relaxation
of policy by the Irish Republic on Christmas Eve, when the Irish central
bank cut its overnight support rate to 14 per cent from 16 per cent.
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Quotidien de Paris, Mr
Tietmeyer said that he saw no reason to overhaul the European Monetary
System.
He said that financial markets had failed to appreciate France's low
inflation, balance of payments surplus, low wage costs and good
competitiveness. 'The markets still have not grasped how strong the
fundamentals are,' Mr Tietmeyer said.
His remarks echoed comments made by Mr Christophersen in an earlier
interview on German radio.
The EC commissioner said there was a 'a very healthy, a very positive
development with low inflation rates' in Denmark, Ireland and France. All
three countries had lower inflation and lower public deficits than Germany,
he said.
Mr Tietmeyer attributed recent pressure on the franc to a debate among
French opposition politicians over whether to keep the franc fort policy
after the national assembly elections in March. 'I hope this debate in
France on the strong franc will soon be over,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer said he was pleased that Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the
former French president, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the former finance
minister who has been mentioned as a possible prime minister if the
rightwing opposition parties win the elections, had said clearly that they
favoured keeping the strong franc policy.
Currency traders are still likely to test ERM parities once trading returns
to normal in the new year. Analysts point out that daily intervention by the
French central bank to support the franc continued at a relatively high
level in the weeks before Christmas.
According to economists in London, financial markets will want clearer
evidence of a prospective fall in German interest rates before they would be
prepared to relax pressure on the ERM. There was little sign of a change in
attitude at the Bundesbank over the holiday period.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Shoppers flock to busiest winter sales for years: Traffic
brings city centres to standstill - Large household items selling strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL, CHRIS TIGHE and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMERS streamed into the shops yesterday to hunt for bargains in one of
the most hectic starts to the winter sales season for years.
The AA said several city centres ground to a halt because of the weight of
traffic. There was a six-mile tailback on the M25 London orbital ring road
as drivers queued to go to the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex.
More than 150,000 shoppers turned up at the Meadowhall shopping centre near
Sheffield. A similar number thronged the MetroCentre in Gateshead. There was
a six-mile queue in both directions on the M1 near Sheffield, and a
five-mile tailback on the northbound A1 at Gateshead.
In London, Oxford Street was at a standstill because of illegally parked
cars. Mr Tim Daniels, chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said
yesterday was 'the best start to the winter sales for many years'.
Traffic came to a stop as car parks overflowed in Southampton, Oxford,
Cardiff, Swansea, Leeds, Birmingham and Glasgow.
Heavier household goods, such as washing machines, carpets and furnishings
appeared to be selling especially well. In Liberty's flagship Regent Street
store, four carpets reduced to Pounds 2,400 were sold in the first 40
minutes. A large number of shoppers from the Continent took advantage of the
pound's relative weakness.
Mr Daniels, who is managing director of Selfridges, said staff at the Oxford
Street department store had to switch off some escalators to control the
crowds: 'I have been here 12 years and I have never seen it like this
before.' Selfridges reported particularly good sales of carpets and
furnishings. 'In view of the housing market slump we were rather surprised
that all of a sudden there has been such a surge,' Mr Daniels said.
Mr Tony Salem, managing director of Liberty's, said: 'It looks as though
this year's sale really will be a record.' Overall, Liberty's estimated
sales were running about 10 per cent ahead of the previous year, he said.
House of Fraser, with 62 stores in England, Scotland and Wales, said
business had been 'exceedingly good', with sales of up to 40 per cent more
than last year.
The crucial question for retailers and the government will be whether the
strong sales signify the start of a real economic upturn or simply reflect
increasing consumer sophistication. The strength of consumer demand will be
an important factor in the shape of the March Budget which Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, will discuss with senior Treasury officials on January 8 and
9.
The Treasury has recently drawn comfort from retail sales figures. They have
been one of the better performing economic indicators, rising 0.7 per cent
in volume after seasonal adjustment in the three months from
September-November compared with June-August. Just before Christmas, news of
a 29 per cent jump in new car sales in the first 20 days of December was a
further pointer to a recovery in demand.
There are hopes that consumer confidence will strengthen further because of
falling mortgage rates. The cut in bank base rates to 7 per cent from 10 per
cent since September will have its full impact in the first four months of
next year when those building societies and banks which adjust mortgage
rates annually change their lending rates.

Tension within the exchange rate mechanism eased last week. Pressure on the
French franc has abated, but dealers are still poised to test its strength.
On Christmas eve, the central bank of Ireland said it would cut its
overnight support rate to 14 per cent from 16 per cent. There was a growing
perception in the markets that Germany would ease short-term interest rates.
Currencies, Page 25
The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent
fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the narrow band cannot rise
more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the
system. The Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent
fluctuation bands.

FT  29 DEC 92 / British Gas offers connection discount to power stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has been offering huge discounts on the cost of connecting
gas-fired power stations to its pipeline network while claiming publicly
that it is discouraging power station business because of a lack of gas.
The discounts have angered independent gas suppliers, which accuse the
company of making it almost impossible for competing pipelines to be built.
Independent power generators say that in negotiations British Gas will often
agree to offset half or more of the cost of connecting a new power station
to its nation-al gas supply grid - a saving for the generator of Pounds 10m
or more which British Gas would expect to recoup in future gas sales.
British Gas, however, says it has tried to restrict gas sales to the power
generation market by putting up the price of gas.
The controversy over pipeline charges is one of the reasons that Sir James
McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the industry regulator, has called for
British Gas's pipelines operation to be sold.
Sir James said recently that effective competition would not be introduced
into the UK gas market until British Gas's transportation and storage
operation was in separate hands.
Ofgas says British Gas's practice of offering allowances towards the cost of
generators' pipeline connections defies market logic. 'This is a very murky
area at the moment, and it is not clear to us that these marketing
allowances offered by British Gas are properly costed,' said Mr Greg
McGregor, of Ofgas.
There seems to be some confusion at British Gas over the incentives. Mr
Philip Rogerson, the company's managing director of finance, was not aware
of the offer. 'I would find it astonishing if we did that,' he said.
Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, an independent supply
company which has built the only rival pipeline, said: 'How can we expect to
compete when they are offering such huge discounts?' He accused British Gas
of predatory pricing.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is reviewing British Gas after a row
between the company and its regulator over an appropriate rate of return for
its pipeline business.
British Gas has insisted that it needs a rate of return of at least 6.8 per
cent while Sir James believes it should be between 2.5 per cent and 5 per
cent.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Russian pledge to fight spending pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR BORIS Fyodorov, Russia's new chief economic strategist, has pledged to
resist pressure to spend money the state does not have.
In an interview with the Financial Times, his first with a foreign news
organisation since his appointment last week, Mr Fyodorov also said he
wanted to build the market institutions that Russia lacks.
He called for greater emphasis on 'technical' measures to smooth transition
to a market economy than was the case under Mr Yegor Gaidar, dumped as prime
minister two weeks ago.
'We are moving towards a market but we need much more professional analysis
(of the economy) at micro-level,' said Mr Fyodorov, a 35-year-old economist,
who is quitting his job as Russia's representative at the World Bank in
Washington to become deputy prime minister.
He will guide overall policy of the finance and economics ministries, the
tax inspectorate and the country's pricing committee.
Although his fight against inflation would involve 'minimising the dangers'
of pressure for more money from state-owned enterprises, Mr Fyodorov said he
would also try to mobilise extra sources of finance for the country. This
would include fighting the flight of capital from Russia and issuing bonds
to the population on terms more attractive than the combination of negative
interest rates and high inflation now ravaging ordinary savings accounts.
'Even if you have a big budget deficit it should be financed in a civilised
manner,' he said, criticising the inflationary central bank practice of
printing money to complement budget revenues.
Mr Fyodorov - who resigned as finance minister two years ago when an earlier
government headed by Mr Boris Yeltsin failed to get economic reform under
way - said it was too early to discuss the substance of the policies to be
embraced by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister.
But he seemed encouraged by what he had seen so far of Mr Chernomyrdin,
former manager of the Soviet gas monopoly.
He said Mr Chernomyrdin's manner could make relations easier with the
parliament. 'Unlike Gaidar, he will not use foreign words or display
intellectual sophistication, and that will make it easier for the parliament
to understand him.'
Mr Fyodorov said he also hoped to find common ground with Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who has a big measure of control
over monetary policy and sees no alternative to inflationary financing. 'He
is a very reasonable man, but if we don't agree, we'll have to fight,' he
said of his former boss - Mr Fyodorov worked at the Soviet central bank,
before serving as Russian finance minister in 1990.
He welcomed the presence of consultants from foreign banks, law firms and
universities who advised Mr Gaidar. 'But if I work with advisers, I would
like to stick to concrete measures rather than broad-based policy. I want
very practical assistance.'
Mr Fyodorov said the bank and the previous government had done 'nothing' to
tackle the flight of capital. He wanted a carrot and stick approach to
encourage enterprises to keep money in the country.
To stabilise the rouble exchange rate he suggested widening the available
currency market set up by the central bank - 'if necessary we will set up
our own currency market'.

<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's largest state holding company, is planning to split its SME
foods, catering and retailing subsidiary into separate operations as a first
step to partial privatisation and dismemberment.
The proposal, which is due to be approved by an IRI shareholders' meeting
scheduled for January 7, is a vital preliminary to the disposal of some of
SME's main businesses.
The three divisions, to cover retailing and catering, frozen foods and food
production, involve a slight reshuffling of SME's current structure.
Autogrill, its catering arm, will be combined with the GS supermarkets
chain, while the Italgel frozen foods subsidiary will be split from the
other food production operations.
Union leaders, who met the managing directors of IRI and SME yesterday, said
IRI was ready to lower its stake in the retailing and catering business to
less than 50 per cent of the shares.
Separately, IRI has set out the criteria for the sale of its 67 per cent
stake in Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-largest bank. Only bids for the
entire holding would be accepted, although bidders could make offers
individually, or in groups.

<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company, is expanding
its South American food operations with the planned acquisition of Cica SA
of Brazil.
The purchase is conditional upon Unilever's Brazilian subsidiary, Industrias
Gessy Lever, receiving more than 90 per cent support from Cica's
shareholders. Its largest shareholder, Cragnotti &amp; Partners, has already
pledged support for its 67.5 per cent stake.
A public offer will be made for the rest of the shares and is likely to
close early in January. The offer values Cica at about Dollars 284m (Pounds
187m).
Cica is involved in the production and sale of canned foods, tomato based
products, mayonnaise and pasta. It employs about 3,500 people and sales this
year are estimated at Dollars 270m.
The acquisition will add to Unilever's Brazilian food operations which,
through its Anderson Clayton subsidiary, is already involved in edible oils
and fats. The company also has a joint venture ice-cream operation with
Nestle.
Gessy Lever also manages Unilever's consumer products business in Brazil and
sales last year totalled Dollars 1bn, making Brazil one of Unilever's most
important South American markets.

David Goodhart writes.
Sir Douglas Smith, the current chairman, retires next year and his successor
will be announced next month.
Along with several other prominent public-sector jobs, such as chairmanships
of the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities
Commission, the Acas job has for the first time been publicly advertised
rather than filled privately.
Another prominent applicant is thought to be Mr John Hougham, head of
industrial relations at Ford UK. Mr Hougham would neither confirm nor deny
that he had applied.
Acas's terms of reference will be changed under the Employment Bill,
currently going through committee stage in the Commons. Its new remit will
be to 'improve' industrial relations rather than 'encourage the extension of
collective bargaining'.
Ms Dean, 50, former leader of the Sogat print union, resigned in May as
deputy general secretary of the GPMU, which was formed by the merger of
Sogat and the NGA.

FT  29 DEC 92 / Lucre strips lustre from Kenyan poll: How bribery mars shift
to democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of people lined the dusty roads of Kisii district in western Kenya
yesterday and stretched out their hands to the convoy of Mr Kenneth Matiba,
an opposition presidential candidate in today's general election.
As his motorcade sped through the lush hills, with slogans of the FORD-Asili
party blaring from loudspeakers, the people shouted: 'Give us money, give us
money.'
'Everybody here is only looking for money,' Mr Matiba sighed. 'They've all
been bought.'
The candidate, making his last campaign swing before polling, was warned to
avoid Kisii town where the ruling Kanu party was holding a final rally.
Hundreds of youths in T-shirts bearing the portrait of Mr Simeon Nyachae,
the local Kanu boss, loitered on the streets looking for Mr Matiba's convoy.
Bribing of candidates and voters, intimidation and electoral abuses have
already sullied the election in Kenya, Africa's former role model which
today becomes the continent's test case for democracy.
Almost 8m Kenyans are registered to vote in the first multi-party election
for 26 years. Kanu is expected to win the most seats in the 188-member
parliament and a run-off for the presidency.
Although policies among the main parties do not differ much, ethnic
rivalries have undermined the transition to democracy and raised fears about
post-election violence and the country's stability.
But the outcome has ramifications that go beyond Kenya.
Looking on anxiously are western donors and governments, and the
Commonwealth. The former, led by the US, helped force President Daniel arap
Moi to end one-party rule by freezing aid pending democratic reform and
speedier implementation of economic change.
For the Commonwealth, represented by 40-strong observer group, the election
is the first significant test of the new role it set for itself at the heads
of government summit in Harare in October 1991.
The summit declaration renewed members' commitment to 'democracy,
accountable administration and the rule of law'. It represented 'more than
simply words', said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's
secretary-general. It was 'both a commitment to action and a set of
standards and principles by which the Commonwealth will seek to live'.
Should western governments and the Commonwealth observers decide that an
election won by Mr Moi is not 'free or fair', aid will not resume, putting
further strain on an economy already in crisis.
The onlookers do not seem entirely comfortable with their role and
responsibilities. The leading western governments appear divided; while
colleagues from the US, Germany, Canada, Sweden and Denmark staged a
walk-out from a national day parade this month on the grounds that Mr Moi
had turned it into a Kanu political rally, the British High Commissioner
remained seated.
Last week Germany went a step further and withdrew its observer mission on
the grounds that the election process was already fatally flawed and its
team had encountered government obstruction.
At the same time, however, the US has shown signs of backing away from its
hard line - possibly influenced by Kenya's role as a reliable rear base for
operations in Somalia.
The Commonwealth observers, led by former Chief Justice Telford Georges,
appears to be hedging its bets.
Unlike previous monitoring exercises in Zambia, the Seychelles and Ghana,
the group seems unlikely to deliver its assessment until after the result is
known.
Opposition parties yesterday made fresh allegations of electoral
malpractices, including the arrest of 500 supporters in the tense central
town of Nakuru. Most opposition leaders have warned of violence if the
elections are seen by the electorate to have been rigged by Kanu.
Should Kenya's stability be threatened, the blame will fall on the country's
leaders. But western governments and observer groups may have to bear some
of the responsibility for failing to apply greater pressure on the
government earlier in the process, to ensure a free and fair poll.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Social Democratic party of Japan, the country's largest opposition
party, yesterday began the difficult process of choosing a new chairman to
replace Mr Makoto Tanabe, who resigned in the face of criticism that he
failed to attack the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
The SDPJ, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party, has been unable to
capitalise on the weakness of the LDP even though Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, has a public approval rating of only 14 per cent as measured
by newspaper opinion polls.
Mr Tanabe, a right-winger, was condemned by younger SDPJ members for
allowing close personal ties to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of the
LDP, to undermine opposition attacks against the ruling party's links to
gangsters and its involvement in an illegal donations scandal.
The most likely successor is Mr Sadao Yamahana, 56, a left-winger and
secretary general for the past year, who announced his candidacy yesterday
and is hoping other factions will agree that he should take the post,
avoiding the need for a potentially embarrassing vote by party members.
Mr Yamahana, like Mr Tanabe and before him Ms Takako Doi, will face the
painful task of dragging the party towards the middle ground, and providing
Japanese voters with a genuine alternative to the scandal-tainted LDP.
'We must build a political party suitable for a new era,' Mr Yamahana said.
'I hope to play a role in building the new party.'
Similar statements were frequently made by Mr Tanabe, but his reform
attempts were blocked by the more ideological members of its extreme left
wing, which supports the dictatorship of Kim Il Sung in North Korea and does
not recognise the Japanese defence forces.
The Japan Communist party yesterday expelled its former chairman, Mr Sanzo
Nosaka, 100, for falsely accusing his then colleague, Mr Kenzo Yamamoto, of
spying, leading to his execution in Moscow in 1939. The decision, not
contested by Mr Nosaka, followed a study of newly opened archives in Russia.

FT  24 DEC 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Jolly pagan times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I DO NOT adhere to any religion. I agree with Arthur Koestler, who said that
the continuous disasters in man's history are 'mainly due to his excessive
capacity and urge to become identified with a tribe, nation, church or
cause, and to espouse its credo uncritically and enthusiastically, even if
its tenets are contrary to reason . . . wars are not fought for personal
gain, but out of loyalty to king, country or cause'.
If I lean in any direction, it is towards paganism. One of my favourite
places is Delphi. Another is Olympia. I believe I came from star-matter, and
to star-matter will return. If you ask me, paganism could be very big news
again by - strictly a guesstimate - 2100.
None of which means that I don't enjoy Christmas. I enjoy it enormously.
Especially this Christmas, which promises to be minimalist and beautifully
well-organised. Also economical. Thrifty. Cautious. This is all part of my
Lamont strike, my refusal to countenance any form of spending other than
what is strictly necessary so long as Norman Lamont remains chancellor of
the exchequer.
(Do not be fooled by those trendy political columnists who now maintain that
Major and Lamont have somehow escaped the grisly reckoning that awaits them;
they haven't; they are doomed; I can see it in their stars.)
My economical Christmas started well last Sunday when I and Miss Lee, my
executive assistant, visited, in the Rover, one of London's most exclusive
garden nurseries, not a million miles from Maida Vale, in search of a
Christmas tree. This nursery is so expensive it charges Pounds 100 for
weeds. At once, Miss Lee made a beeline for the 10-footers: strapping
Christmas trees royal in lineage, sap and price.
Fortunately, twirling in desperation, I noticed a dwarf affair propped by
the gate, inelegantly put together, bottom-heavy, a spindly, droopy top - a
bargain for just a fiver.
Summoning immense reservoirs of persuasion, I charmed Miss Lee into
believing that unless we purchased the dwarf it would be cast into the
canal, or burned. So home it rode with us, propped in the Rover, and a fine
sight it makes, its spindly, droopy top, now glittering and lighted, poking
above the sill of our sitting room window like a pinprick of civilisation in
a distant, dangerous galaxy.
Flushed with my success in extracting a Pounds 5 Christmas tree from a
nursery that charges Pounds 100 for weeds, I went for broke on Tuesday. I
took the bus to Knightsbridge, to see whether Harrods or the dreaded Harvey
Nicks were offering any bargains. Don't make me laugh. I hate those stores,
wish they could be vaporised, mainly because they consume, via Miss Lee's
credit cards and charge accounts, a measurable fraction of my income.
Harvey Nicks was quiet. No scenes of outrageousness. Nor, come to think of
it, any sign of the advent of John Major's classless society. In the
fragrance department, an Amazon in ghoulish make-up sprayed some concoction
on my wrist and asked if I liked it. I grimaced and gurgled, and ran for the
escalator.
In sweaters, a maiden (or youth) with Botticelli hair, Botticelli eyes and
Botticelli lips asked if I needed help. 'Only,' I replied, 'if you have
anything for less than Pounds 1,500.' The maiden (or youth) smiled anciently
and enigmatically, and returned to buffing her (or his) nails. I thought I
would have a coffee, but everyone in the coffee shop seemed to recognise me.
They all waved and shouted. So embarrassing.
Harrods was noisier: lots of common folk, foreigners in the main, Brazilian
cement kings and Australian princesses hocking the sheep farm. There was
also a group of choirboys, sweet-voiced and bored. I made for the pet
department. There were two parrots for sale, one at Pounds 750, the other
Pounds 700. There were some canaries and budgerigars, and some bizarre furry
articles.
Also tanks and tanks of fish, including glowlights at Pounds 2 each, zebra
angels, Pounds 10 each, marbled angels, Pounds 6.50 each, thick-lipped
gouramis, Pounds 6 a pair, and red cap orandas, Pounds 6 each.
It is a theory of mine that fish make an ideal Christmas present. They are
minimalist, and economical. If they prove not to be popular the recipients
can always eat them, breaded, I suppose, with a bottle from Sainsbury,
something Hungarian, possibly rather curranty.
I bought five red cap orandas and 10 glowlights. Happy Christmas.

FT  24 DEC 92 / A fashionable headache: Dominic Lawson says medical theories
of the day often prove to be a pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HUNDRED years ago, a fashionable doctor of the day by the name of Vogel
burst into print on what happens to little boys who play with themselves.
They become, said the good doctor, 'visibly emaciated and anaemic, remain
backward in their bodily and mental development; they develop an apathetic
expression of the countenance and flaccid muscles. . . the gait becomes
unsteady and lumbersome and the knees fall inward'.
Dr Vogel wrote with an unmistakeable air of authority. He knew he was right.
Nowadays we know - I hope - that he was wrong. But it is all a matter of
fashion. In the 1890s, high Victorian puritanism was sufficiently ingrained
that rational men in rational pursuits, such as the medical profession
claims to be, were driven to prove its scientific validity.
It is one of the features of a fashionable morality that its exponents
demand to be thought not merely good, but also right. The liberal moralists
who have dominated education and the social sciences for most of my lifetime
were every bit as dogmatic as Dr Vogel, and no less absurd in their lack of
respect for evidence. Their insistence that intelligence could not be partly
inherited was but one example; another was their refusal to admit that the
child of a one-parent family was starting life with something of a handicap,
and not just a financial one.
I use the past tense to talk of these attitudes because, after 30 years,
they are on the wane. The reason is simply that they had been long enough in
vogue to become visibly responsible for the dire consequences of their
fashionability. None the less, it still comes as something of a shock to
read in a medical scientific textbook of the 1950s, The Normal Child, that
'one-parent families are harmful to the child, and for this reason the
adoption of her illegitimate child by a mother is not to be encouraged.
There are commonly associated economic and social problems with housing
difficulties'. No messing about there by Doctor Ronald Illingworth
MD,FRCP,DPH,DCH, whose book is a joy and an education to read.
I ought perhaps to confess that I would not normally be reading 40-year-old
paediatric textbooks. But shortly I am due to become a father, and like most
men in that interesting condition at one remove, I have been hoovering up
the available literature, preferably in second-hand bookshops. For you will
not find the splendid Doctor Illingworth weighing down the shelves of shiny
new baby books in WH Smith. No. Instead, you will find Dr Miriam Stoppard,
who is absolutely high fashion.
Dr Stoppard's best-selling New Pregnancy and Birth Book advises its readers
of the advantages of yogic childbirth. The yogic mother-to-be, says Dr
Stoppard, 'may use meditation and chanting and the support of yoga groups'
spiritual participation. . . yogic education helps in the belief that a
woman has the ability to create or destroy her own pain and joy during
birth'. There are limits to medical hippiedom: Dr Stoppard tells her readers
sternly that they 'should refrain from smoking marijuana before they decide
to conceive'.
Dr Stoppard is a great believer in 'bonding'. This is a word which does not
occur in Doctor Illingworth's great tome. Dr Stoppard admits that 'it is
difficult to describe what bonding is', but, as I understand her, bonding is
mother and child staring at each other intently for the first 45 minutes of
the baby's life.
Common sense would suggest that this is rewarding for the mother but a
matter to be instantly forgotten by the stunned newborn. Dr Stoppard,
however, claims that 'research showed that, at the age of five years, the
children who had had extended contact with their parents immediately after
delivery scored higher in intelligence tests'.
Bonding is, of course, a very fashionable concept: no one really knows what
they are talking about, but they know they are doing the right thing. Alas
for them, a book is to be published next month in America called The Myth of
Mother/Infant Bonding. According to those who have read the proofs, the book
comprehensively debunks the supposed medical evidence that bonding has a
quantifiably positive effect on the infant: it just makes the mother feel
good, that is all. Thus ends another fashion in the wacky world of
pseudo-medicine.

CHRISTMAS has little to do with Christ. This is not to say that a Christian
festival has been hijacked by commercialism, although plenty of preachers,
in their Christmas sermons, will assert precisely that.
No: it means that neither the date nor the components of Christmas bear much
relation to Gospel accounts of the birth of Christ, nor even to early
Christian practice. The image of the babe born (away) in a manger among
cattle (lowing) in (bleak) midwinter, in the (little) town of Bethlehem, on
which so much of our celebratory apparatus depends, is mostly fantastical.
Mark and John tell us nothing about the nativity, Matthew refers to
Bethlehem, but locates the birth in a perfectly ordinary house and all Luke
gives is the detail of the feeding-trough used as a cot. The animals are
picturesque extras and Biblical scholars tell us that the birth more likely
took place in Nazareth with April the probable month.
Some time in the fourth century AD the Christian authorities decided to
align the birth of Christ with the winter solstice, as reckoned on the
Julian calendar. This was a purely pragmatic move, designed to accommodate
the manifold oriental heathens who were used to saluting the nativity of the
sun on December 25.
The compromise with paganism has not stopped there, of course. The extra
vegetation we admit to our homes to hail Jesus (or the sun) would make all
sorts of infidels happy. Bacchanalian ravers would snatch for themselves our
ivy wreaths; Druids nod reverently towards our mistletoe; and savage
Norsemen drink bumpers to the yule log. And so on. It all ought to be common
knowledge, if we ever bothered to think about it.
Meditating on Christmas Past is a useful exercise, however, particularly
when trying to imagine Christmas Future. That is, the nature of an end of
year festival in a society which is predominantly secular and religiously
pluralistic. Those who feel that Christmas is in danger of losing its
integrity might reflect on some statistics emergent from a series of
religious censuses taken between 1970 and 1987.
John Clayton, professor of religious studies at the University of Lancaster,
has drawn attention to the trends implied by these statistics. According to
the present pattern of growth and decline in membership of Christian and
non-Christian faiths in Britain, by the year 2000 adult affiliation to the
Anglican church will have slumped to just over one and a half million.
This is a little less than the projected membership of the Roman Catholic
church. Both Anglican and Catholic numbers have been markedly declining
since 1970, although in the case of the Anglicans, it is not clear how many
'born-again' associates of the church show up in these statistics.
Membership of the reformed churches (including Scottish Presbyterians) is at
more steady level, but is dropping to slightly more than one million.
Methodists have steadied, too, at about half a million.
It will not surprise anyone familiar with certain parts of London and
certain old industrial centres in the north of England, that the religious
sect showing the most significant growth is Islam. In cities such as
Bradford, the statistics are confirmed in physical change: chapels converted
to curry-houses and mosques the size of hypermarkets being erected.
Assuming that Moslem adherence in Britain is not affected by secularisation
 -which may not be a safe assumption - and continues at its current
strength, the number of Moslem worshippers will roughly equal that of
Anglicans by 2000, and go on to outnumber them over the following decade.
Other non-Christian sects are increasing in numbers, although on a much
smaller scale. None the less, by the end of the millennium there will be
more Sikhs than Baptists in this country.
To publicise these figures on Christmas may seem alarmist, insofar as they
evoke a ghost of Christmas Future who speaks no comfort to those who want
December 25 reserved as a celebration of the birth of Christ. But the
importance of the statistics is easier to grasp at Christmas than at any
other time.
Christmas is a rite of passage, tailor-made for a secular and multicultural
community. It is a hotch-potch of creeds and rituals which ought never to
have been yoked together, yet survive as a coherent whole. The ghost of
Christmas Future is not a monster: his message is the same as the message of
Christmas Past.

THERE WERE straws in the wind, and they blew from Brussels. So this week I
found myself knocking at a freshly-painted door high up under the roof of
the Berlaymont building.
A few days previously, The Times had carried a large colour picture of our
local butcher, Robert Harrison, with a turkey in each hand and a smile on
his face. Harrison, it explained, had just learned that EC vets and
hygienists hoping to ban the 'delayed evisceration' of Christmas fowl (that
is Eurospeak for leaving the guts in) had been told by Britain to. . . well,
get stuffed.
The Sunday before, tucked away on the front page of the Observer, was a
story about the Christmas Tree Growers' Association of Western Europe. This
grandly-titled body, led by a very modern major-general, is introducing a
Eurostandard for its products - height, width, bushiness, needliness, and so
on - which it wants the EC to draft into law next year.
In spite of these pointers, no newspaper bothered to chase the story.
Nobody, I was pleased to discover, had even guessed the existence of DG XXV,
the newly-formed EC directorate-general responsible for seasonal policy. I
was even more pleased when, after a bit of hemming and hawing, the
information people agreed to set up a briefing from the director-general
himself.
I knocked at the door. 'Entrez]' boomed a voice from within.
It was obvious to me as soon as I entered his office that Dr Klaus was new
to the ways of Brussels. Large, cheery and overweight, he looked more like a
Bavarian farmer than a senior Commission official. His suit might have been
expensive, but it did not fit. His shirt had lost the top button. The decor
was a bit too Upwardly Mobile Provincial: executive toys on the desk, a
stuffed head on the wall, that sort of thing. Above all, he failed to tell
me that the interview was for background use only.
So I got out my tape-recorder.
Dr Klaus, I said, I have been reading about harmonisation of Christmas trees
and turkeys. What is going on?
'Ha] So you have noticed]' He beamed. 'Yes, we make a beginning.' He waved
an arm around the room. 'Of course, we are new here, still very much in
consultation stage. We are far from making, you know, draft directives . .
.' He smiled apologetically.
But what exactly is 'seasonal policy'?
'Good question] You know, Mr Tyler, how some people, even good people, are
afraid of Maastricht - we know this now from Eurobarometer surveys  - and
they feel apart. So, we must bring them together]'
The role of DG XXV, he explained, was to stimulate a sense of cultural
identity among the citizens of the 12 member states in the hope it would
lead them to accept political and monetary union more rapidly. And the
cultural event most widely observed throughout Europe was, of course, a
seasonal one: Christmas.
'You see,' added Dr Klaus, seriously. 'We must seek for seasonal
convergence.'
But, I objected, every country has its own traditions and they hold them
very dear. For example British children hang out stockings for Father
Christmas, but don't Italians and Germans use pillowcases?
'Exactly. So we must apply the principle of social cohesion.'
You mean every child must hang up the same size article? 'Too fast, Mr
Tyler, too fast] First we must equalise the contents, so that little British
children will receive equivalent value to little Germans and little
Italians.' His eyes moistened. 'For this we will employ the ECSSF, the
European Community Seasonal Subsidy Fund - it was agreed, you remember, at
the Edinburgh summit - a rebate mechanism for disadvantaged regions on the
periphery of the Community which. . .'
I broke in. But what about our food, and drink, and decorations? What about
the holly and the ivy, the plum pudding and mince pies?
'Please, let me continue. . . which also is a guarantee that seasonal gifts
will be totally safe for non-adult use in accordance with CEN and CENELEC.'
Who?
'Our standards-setting bureaux, for electrical and other goods. Of course,
we have some problems for negotiation,' he continued. 'The Club Med - excuse
me, the Mediterranean member states - are not so happy.'
Why is that?
'Well, they have some small differences: they like to employ pine trees, not
fir trees. In Italy many little children still wait for the good witch La
Befana on January 6. In Spain they are putting out hay for the donkeys of
the Three Kings. There are other seasonal convergence difficulties of a
timetable nature - Scotland, for instance.' Dr. Klaus sighed and sat back in
the big swivel chair. 'We must have more transparency.'
So that people can see through this stuff, I asked?
The d-g ignored my sarcasm and I continued: What did you do before you got
this job?
'This is not for official information,' he replied, winking and tapping the
side of his nose.
Klaus is a German name, I suggested.
'It is of many origins. I would say German, yes, and even Syrian and
American - and also Finnish.'
Finnish?
'Yes. For very many years, I have been working near the town of Rovaniemi.'
On the Arctic Circle?
'Quite so.'
The penny dropped. You mean you're not just called Klaus? You're actually it
 -I mean him? Santa Claus, Father Christmas . . .?
The director-general was delighted. 'Yes, and Nicholas, Knecht Rupprecht,
Pere Bonhomme Noel, Robin Goodfellow, all these people.'
But, I stuttered, how am I going to tell the children that you are behind
all this - that you've left the Frozen North and chucked it all up to come
to Brussels on a big expense account?
'That's up to you. They won't believe it. Ho, ho, ho]' He laughed
uproariously.
The Klaus appointment (I can no longer call him 'Doctor') turned out to be a
political compromise struck in anticipation of Finland's hoped-for entry
into the Community. In return for abandoning its traditional neutrality to
qualify for full membership, the Finnish government had demanded control of
one of the Commission's directorates. This, for all the talk of seasonal
convergence, is the real reason why DG XXV was created.
But what about the reindeer, I asked . . . and the elves?
Klaus motioned with one thumb at the trophy on the wall. With the other he
pressed a buzzer. Two little figures came skipping through a side door, one
carrying a brush, the other a tin of shoe-polish.
'Please meet my staff,' he said.
'I regret that some friends in ECOSOC (the economic and social committee)
are envious,' he continued. 'They complain my staff are an example of
extra-Community social dumping - cheap foreign labour. I reply that they are
atypical but economically active persons admitted under temporary and
transitional arrangements.'
Santa patted his belly with self-satisfaction.
'Usually, they are engaged on my special database project. With the help of
EUROTECNET we are collating pre-season gift requests of nearly 10,000
children in selected cities: this is on a pilot basis, of course.' He flung
his arms wide. 'It will spread all over the Community one day. No more
letters up the chimney]'
I see, I said.
'You will say, course, there are not many chimneys in Europe. And you will
be right. So how can all the little children - some are not so little, I may
tell you - expect Dr Klaus to come down their chimney with a big sack of
presents?'
Go on, I said, tell me.
'Subsidiarity]', he roared.
You mean chimney subsidies?
'No, no] Subsidiarity. We believe here in DG XXV that national custom is so
very important, even while we strive for seasonal convergence. We say we
cannot make rules for everything.'
So?
'So children of all member states are free to believe what they like]' he
finished triumphantly.
Well, I said, as I rose to go, thankyou very much. And a Merry Christmas]
'Maybe,' said the director-general. It was an odd reply and I stopped at the
door.
'There are so many names, so many greetings, such confusion] I give you our
new Community greeting.'
Which is?
'Harmonious Eurofest]' And a Ho-ho-ho to you, too, I thought as I closed the
door behind me.

FT  24 DEC 92 / Markets: Hark, the City starts to sing - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor

<TEXT>
THE SOUND of Christmas carols can be heard regularly echoing round the City.
But, this year, the choristers have adapted some of the old standards to
reflect this recessionary season. New favourites include the following
ditties, intoned by a bunch of miserable-looking economists:
God make ye merry, Bundesbank,
You cause so much dismay;
Why don't you give us all a break
And cut your rates today?
To save the troubled ERM
And keep the slump away,
All because of Frankfurt and Bonn
Our industry's gone.
All because of Frankfurt and Bonn
and:
In the bleak mid-winter
Norm Lamont did moan,
The headlines scream 'Resign'
Pound drops like a stone;
Gloom is falling, GDP
Refuses to grow,
All the green shoots wilted
Long ago
These haunting melodies are interrupted by the wistful tones of the share
traders, as they sing:
I'm dreaming of a bull market,
Just like the ones I used to know.
When penny stocks glistened
And brokers listened
To bid rumours come and go.
I'm dreaming of a new Hanson.
With every put option I write.
May your earnings forecasts prove right
And may Footsie double overnight.
But they are answered by a rousing chorus from a group of private clients:
Small investors should watch out
On the feast of Stephen.
Rates have fallen all about
Few are breaking even.
Brightly shines the lure of shares
Through the risks are cruel;
Those who buy stocks unawares
Could soon be eating gru-u-el.
The clients also lament the failings of personal equity plans.
The first PEP was sold, so they say,
To a poor young librarian with kids on the way.
The tax break sounded good but the charges were steep
ow the manager's rich but the client can't sleep.
No-yield, no-gain, no-hope, much pain,
The small investor's been fleeced once again
This in turn leads to an angry anthem from a group of clearing bank
accountholders:
Ding dong, bank charges are high
The customers' hands are wringing;
Once your bank account runs dry
The overdraft rates are stinging; Gloria
Hosanna to extortion.
Occasionally, the merry voices of the life insurance companies break
through, extolling the virtues of their with profits policies:
'Tis the season to cut payouts
Fa la la la la la la la la.
All our forecasts have proved way out
Fa la la la la la la la la.
There's no point in shedding tears
Fa la la la la la la la la.
You're locked in for 20 years
Fa la la la la ha ha ha ha.
They follow this with a little number about that favourite subject of
rhythm'n'blues singers, the Financial Services Act:
Hark, the regulators sing
New authorities take wing.
FIMBRA, LAUTRO proved too mild
Salesmen's antics got too wild.
Throw your old rulebooks away
Join the brand new PIA.
Hear the great and good proclaim
Client protection is the aim.
Sadly this bad news we bring,
No-one wants to join the thing.
The building societies perform a routine about their charming habit of
letting depositors' savings languish in obsolete low-rate accounts:
Consider yourself
Ripped off.
Consider that you're
A punter we can exploit.
We've handled your cash
So long,
We feel it's
Been ours all along.
Although we claim to be
Efficient and friendly,
We've no charity for you;
If you're an old lady
Without any salary,
Then there's nothing you can do.
And when you find out
The facts.
The ombudsman won't act.
So after some consideration we can state
Consider that we're cheapskates.
Standing away from all the others is a small band of pinstriped buskers,
with a begging sign which reads saying 'No Ecus accepted.' It is of course,
the Euro-sceptics:
Once in rainy Maastricht city
Ancient enmities were shed;
Where our leaders made a treaty
Which said nation states were dead.
But the snag for Major mild
His backbenchers then got riled.
They came down to vote against him
From the backwoods whence they came.
So he promised opt-out clauses
And a veto for the Danes.
Tory whips were mean and lowly
Still they won by three votes only.
To be sung ad nauseam or until the Maastricht bill becomes law.
