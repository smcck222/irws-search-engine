FT  02 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC issues warning over
derivatives operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE derivatives operations of investment banks are in danger of slipping
outside the jurisdiction of securities regulators, Mr Carter Beese, a
commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, warned yesterday.
Speaking at a conference arranged by Risk magazine, Mr Beese said he was
concerned that 'current SEC capital rules have created an incentive to run
over-the-counter derivatives books out of unregulated affiliates'. He said
there was anecdotal evidence that securities firms had been shifting
derivatives business offshore, where regulatory regimes were less onerous,
or into off-balance sheet derivative units, out of the reach of regulators.
While recognising there is 'a fair argument to be made' that segregating
risks into entities that do not hold customer funds and securities is a good
policy, he warned that 'if we follow current practice, regulators will end
up stubbornly standing guard over a shrinking core of the retail-related
markets, while ceding growing portions of institutional and cross-border
finance to the unregulated arena.'
While a few specialist derivatives vehicles have been established so far,
over half a dozen US banks and securities houses are considering setting up
such units next year.
Last summer, the SEC adopted risk assessment rules which give it new powers
to look at the scope and nature of risks in such affiliates. Under the new
rules, which come into force next year, firms have to file quarterly
summaries that include a breakdown of their exposure in off-balance sheet
deals.
Speaking at the same conference, Mr Pen Kent, an executive director of the
Bank of England, said concern over extra risks created by the growth of the
derivatives markets had been overstated in some quarters. Derivatives
markets 'have on balance reduced rather than increased risk,' he said.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: NTT bond issue aims to cut risk
for investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications company, is
preparing to launch a straight bond issue this week of between Y50bn and
Y100bn (Dollars 403m-Dollars 806m).
The issue will use the fixed-price method, which will include some
alterations intended to reduce risk for investors and activate the secondary
market.
The issue will be the first to be sold in Japan that allows investors to
trade the bonds during the offering period. Under current market practice,
investors are forced to hold bonds until the offering period is over, making
bondholders vulnerable to market movements.
NTT will also remove the call option clause, giving issuers the choice to
redeem bondholders before maturity. The move will allow institutional
investors to use corporate straight bonds as hedging instruments against
government bonds.
Last December, NTT launched Japan's first fixed price deal, paving the way
for other Japanese companies to use the fixed price re-offering system in
the domestic bond market.
Mr Masaaki Nogawa, deputy general manager of NTT's finance and treasury
division, said he hoped the new issue would enhance liquidity of the
domestic secondary market, which is virtually stagnant.
Domestic corporate bonds have traditionally been issued using the 'proposal
method', where underwriting is awarded to the most competitive bid. The
excessive competition for underwriting contracts led to unrealistic offering
prices.
Details of the deal, led by Nikko Securities and Morgan Stanley Japan, have
yet to be decided, but NTT expects the amount to total between Y50bn and
Y100bn depending on investor demand. The issue will have a maturity of seven
to 10 years.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bank of Tokyo acts to aid
loan-burdened affiliate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Tokyo, the Japanese foreign exchange specialist, is helping to
restructure a non-bank affiliate, BOT Lease, which is burdened with an
increasing amount of non-performing loans to troubled property developers.
The case highlights the close relationship between Japanese banks and the
so-called non-banks, which have been blamed for fuelling property and stock
speculation during the late 1980s. Many of the non-banks are affiliates of
commercial banks, and heavily reliant on them for funds.
At the end of March, BOT Lease had about Y600bn (Dollars 4.9bn) in
borrowings, including about Y170bn from the Bank of Tokyo, which has set
aside Y20bn in loan-loss reserves to relieve some of the pressure on the
leasing and financial company.
BOT Lease, founded in October 1979, was involved in the leasing of office
equipment and ships, but later became heavily exposed to the property
market, which has collapsed over the past two years.
The leasing company apparently provided funds to other non-banks, some of
which were also exposed to the property market and have since been unable to
repay the loans, adding to the pressure on BOT Lease.
Apart from forgiving Y20bn in loans, the bank is likely to accept
lower-than-market rate repayments on its remaining debts from BOT Lease,
which is to review employee numbers and its branch network.
The leasing company plans to trim staff and restructure the organisation, as
well as make a third-party share allocation to lift its capital from Y1bn to
Y5bn. BOT Lease expects a loss this year, but is forecasting a return to
profitability in the following year.

DENIZCILIK Bank, Turkey's maritime bank, has become the second bank this
year to be rescued by the government. Denizcilik's operations are being
taken over by the state-owned Emlak Bank.
Emlak will take over Denizcilik's balance sheet, its 41 branches as well as
more than 1,000 bank personnel. The bank had assets of TL2,314bn (Dollars
279m) at the end of 1991. It suffered a loss on operations of TL88bn,
compared to a loss of TL483bn in 1991.
Denizcilik was earmarked for privatisation. However, like Tobank, taken over
by state-owned HalkBank, the government did not find a buyer.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bleak winter for industrial
Japan - Sharp falls in profits reflect weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past few weeks, haggard corporate executives have filled the press
room of the Tokyo stock exchange, painting daily a bleak picture of company
balance sheets and earnings prospects.
The latest six-month reporting season has been a grim business, with
Japanese companies turning in their steepest profit declines in 17 years.
Hopes for an early economic recovery have dimmed.
Most companies have announced cuts in executive salaries, staff and capital
spending.
Japanese manufacturers have been hit by weak domestic demand and high
depreciation. Some of the country's most famous companies have announced
losses - and the pattern of returns would have been far worse but for the
way large sections of industry deferred losses on securities investments.
For the six months to September, pre-tax profits at Japan's leading 516
manufacturers fell 38 per cent on average, and the Nomura Research Institute
is predicting a 30 per cent fall in earnings for the full year to March
1993.
The sharp profit falls at carmakers and electronics companies reflect the
severe decline in domestic consumer spending. Electronics makers - notably
Matsushita - have been hit by market saturation of video machines,
televisions and stereos, and the sated consumer appetite for upgraded
versions of appliances.
Matsushita, the largest consumer electronics maker, posted a 66 per cent
fall in consolidated pre-tax profits, while Sony fell 61 per cent. The rise
in inventories forced NEC and Sanyo Electric to hand out vouchers as part of
employees' winter bonus payments.
Carmakers were hurt by a 20 per cent fall in new car sales. Nissan Motor
(which saw its first pre-tax loss) and Mazda (which posted a 73 per cent
profits fall) were hit by surging depreciation costs due to aggressive
capital investments.
The weakness in the motor and electronic industries filtered through to the
machinery, materials and chemicals sectors.
The steel industry saw a 60 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. NKK maintained
pre-tax profits, but had to take in a Y13bn (Dollars 104.83m) profit on
stock sales to do so: Kobe Steel did not include appraisal losses on
securities for the half-year.
Many industrial equipment makers misjudged the sharp fall in capital
spending.
Minebea, the world leader in miniature bearings, posted special losses of
Y2.4bn due to inventory liquidations at NMB Semiconductor, its semiconductor
subsidiary, and other affiliates.
Companies which at the peak of the bull market used valuation gains on
securities investments to bolster earnings saw the value of their holdings
tumble.
With the Nikkei average down 55 per cent from its 1989 peak, Minebea posted
a Y2.9bn valuation loss. Fuji Heavy Industries increased profits for the
first time in three years by postponing a write-off of Y1.2bn for stock
appraisal losses.
The prolonged weakness of the Tokyo stock market also hurt those companies
which raised finance through equity-linked bonds in the late 1980s. Since
the funds were raised when stock prices were at their peak, many
equity-linked instruments have failed to be exercised, leaving companies
with redemptions on bonds.
For example, Wacoal, the leading underwear maker, repaid investors for
warrant bonds worth Y11.6bn. Redemptions of convertible and warrant bonds
are expected to peak next year, with some Y10,000bn worth of paper maturing.
Wacoal said its cash in hand and deposits fell due to the repayment, leading
to a decline in interests received.
Many other companies have also dipped into their cash reserves due to the
fall in sales and profits.
In contrast, high-technology toymakers posted strong profit increases, with
pre-tax profits surging 83 per cent to Y27.4bn at Sega Enterprises, the
video game maker. Its rival, Nintendo, improved by 5.5 per cent to Y80.2bn.
Aoki International and Aoyama Trading, retailers of cheap office workers'
uniform blue suits, saw firm increases in sales and profits.
The key elements of an earnings recovery will be capital spending and
domestic demand. But the outlook is gloomy. The Ministry of International
Trade and Industry says companies are planning to cut capital investment for
the year ending March 1993 by 11.9 per cent and heading for a similar cut
for the year ending March 1994. Economists are reluctant to predict a
rebound in consumer demand.
However, construction companies - major beneficiaries of the government's
public works projects - may lead the way to an earnings recovery. Ms Kathy
Matsui, strategist at brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, is
recommending leading exporting companies, such as electronics groups, on the
back of the yen's expected weakness against the dollar together with a
recovery in the US economy.
Japanese manufacturers are clearly trying to adjust to low growth, and may
emerge leaner and stronger from the sharp profit downturn. However, with
companies slow to implement use the sort of painful measures taken by
Japan's western counterparts - notably in relation to workforce levels - any
earnings recovery may take longer than most Japanese executives hope.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Difficulties seen in sale of
Fluor lead unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS and analysts suggested yesterday that Fluor Corporation, the
US-based international engineering group, would have great difficulty
disposing of its Doe Run subsidiary, America's biggest integrated lead
business.
'Doe Run has been up for sale for about four years and I doubt if they will
find a buyer now,' said one banker.
'The price has come down considerably in recent months - Fluor is
practically giving it away. But lead is not a business people want to be in,
particularly in the US.'
Fluor said on Monday it would take a charge of about Dollars 95m to 1992 net
earnings to cover the cost of the disposition of Doe Run. This included an
loss after tax of Dollars 17m.
Mr Jeffrey Zelms, Doe Run's president, said various methods for Fluor to
divest itself of his company would be considered during the next year.
These might include outright sale to a third party, a management buy-out, a
sale of Doe Run shares to the public or a distribution of shares to existing
Fluor shareholders. Fluor has retained Merrill Lynch as investment adviser.
Mr Zelms said the Dollars 95m charge included a reserve for clean-up
obligations related to Doe Run's past operations while 'we believe we are
regularly improving the situation so as to keep clean-up costs to a
minimum'.
Doe Run owns six mines, four mills and two smelters. A strike at its
Herculaneum smelter since July 30 has cut production to 50 to 60 per cent of
capacity.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of mining research at S. G. Warburg Securities,
said a pound of lead was cheaper than a pound of potatoes.
'No one wants to produce it. But one day the price will rise and when, for
example, people have to pay Dollars 300 each for lead-acid batteries to keep
their cars going, they will understand lead is an essential metal.'

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Chase applies some polish to its
image - The US bank's move to expand its operations worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE name remains a legend, but lately it has become a trifle tarnished.
Mr Arthur Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, is the first to admit the
famous New York-based banking group's image suffered because of errors made
during the 1980s.
But Mr Ryan, highly regarded by Wall Street analysts for his hands-on
management of Chase, is equally keen to point to the recovery he and his
colleagues have engineered since he took over as president in October 1990.
'Two years ago, the bank was clearly in a serious problem state. We were in
more businesses than we should have been. We didn't listen to the market. We
had credit quality problems, and we had to change the broader game plan for
Chase because of a changed business environment,' says Mr Ryan.
The problems were real enough. The bank's return on equity was negative in
1990, following a Dollars 334m loss caused by a Dollars 1.3bn bad debt
provision related to problem commercial property loans.
Annual operating expenses were excessive at 78 per cent of total revenues.
And the bank's ratio of common equity to total assets was an anaemic 3.97
per cent.
'I would have to say that the name of Chase was damaged back in 1990. That's
a fair characterisation. As I travelled around the reaction was 'Chase is
not doing well. What's wrong?'' recalls Mr Ryan, an affable 50-year-old who
made his name building up Chase's profitable retail banking operations.
Mr Ryan also admits that when he took over he found Chase could no longer
rely on the blue-chip cachet of being 'the Rockefeller bank,' a legacy
associated with the tenure of Mr David Rockefeller as chairman and chief
executive in the 1970s.
There was, however, a great deal of sympathy for the Chase name, one of the
legends in world banking. 'What we have done is to turn that into a plus for
us.'
To do that, Mr Ryan, along with the top management and Mr Tom Labrecque,
chairman of Chase, introduced a series of harsh measures. The one that
surprised Wall Street the most came in the autumn of 1990, when Chase halved
its dividend.
The bank also moved to reduce its workforce by 12 per cent to reduce annual
operating costs by Dollars 300m, to sell retail banking businesses in the
UK, Italy and Spain, to dispose of Dollars 400m of UK mortgage assets, and
to sell property assets in Europe, starting with its office building in
Frankfurt.
The cost cuts have proved successful, with staff numbers now at 35,000, some
8,000 lower than the 1990 peak, and the annual operating base Dollars 300m
lower at Dollars 3.8bn, down to 65 per cent of total revenues.
The common equity capital ratio has been strengthened significantly, to 5.04
per cent. And the bank has made heavy bad debt provisions and is working its
way through the problem property loans. Net profits were back to Dollars
520m in 1991 and could rise to Dollars 600m for the whole of 1992.
As Mr Tom Hanley, senior banking analyst at First Boston, puts it: 'The
Chase turnround is progressing on target. The goals that have been set are
clearly being met in terms of asset quality, capital and expense
management.'
But at the heart of the turnround is a strategic redirection of the bank
that is also on track.
Mr Ryan sums it up as an attempt to be strong in domestic retail banking (in
the north-east of the US and not nationwide), while focusing international
operations less on branch networks and more on wholesale businesses, such as
corporate finance, risk management and clearing and information services.
'This kind of strategy has worked well for Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of
Switzerland. It should also work for Chase,' Mr Ryan notes.
Chase's planned turnround is also distinctive from other US banks because
Chase says it does not feel the need to merge with another institution and
would rather concentrate on its chosen market niches.
In earnings terms, Chase's corporate finance made an estimated Dollars 130m
last year, the risk management business produced about Dollars 55m of income
and the Infoserve division, one of the biggest US dollar and D-Mark clearers
in the world, had more than Dollars 100m of profits. These figures compare
with an estimated Dollars 250m from US consumer products, Dollars 90m from
US branch operations and a further Dollars 90m from international private
banking client businesses.
Although these are all improving results, Chase has faced average quarterly
losses from commercial property loans of about Dollars 100m, a level
expected to continue into 1993.
The goal at Chase is to increase revenues from non-US businesses from the
current 34 per cent to half of the total by the middle of the 1990s by
targeting borrowers and investors and offering them a worldwide network of
services.
Mr Ryan reckons only 10 to 15 banks in the world will be truly competitive
players in this range of services, of which only five will be American.
Chase wants to make sure it is among those five.
First Boston's Mr Hanley maintains the goal is realistic: 'If, as I believe,
international banking will come back into favour during the 1990s, then
Chase is one of the best positioned American banks to benefit.'
Wall Street recognises the repositioning of Chase Manhattan has not been
easy - and that it is by no means complete. The bank's stock price reflects
as much.
While it has recovered from its low in 1990 of under Dollars 10 per share,
and has hovered in recently in the range of Dollars 25 to Dollars 27, the
price is still below its 52-week high of Dollars 30 3/8 .
Mr Ryan says he would like to see Chase's relative success at meeting its
goals for the 1990s measured in two ways.
First, he wants to see the bank's return on equity rise to 15 per cent from
its present 11.2 per cent and its annual expenses-to-revenues ratio drop to
60 per cent.
Second: 'We will measure our position as a major global institution by
seeing what the market place says about us,' notes the Chase president.
The aim, therefore, is to burnish a legendary name in world banking.

THE ROYAL Bank of Canada, after nearly doubling loan loss provisions in the
fourth quarter, saw net income drop to CDollars 107.3m (USDollars 83.6m) for
fiscal 1992, from CDollars 983m a year earlier.
After preferred dividends, the country's biggest chartered bank showed a net
loss of 5 cents a share, against profit of CDollars 2.92 a share in fiscal
1991.
It had warned provisions would increase by CDollars 900m in the quarter,
bringing the year's total to more than CDollars 2bn.
More than half the extra provision related to the depressed Toronto property
market. All the bank's estimated CDollars 780m exposure to Olympia &amp; York
Developments was placed in the non-performing category.
Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said that, despite the severe problems in
property and domestic corporate loans and CDollars 130m of restructuring
costs, retail banking did well with strong growth in residential mortgages
and personal savings business.
The treasury group did well and the investment banking subsidiary posted
record profits. International business was less profitable, partly due to
higher provision.
At October 31, total net non-performing loans were CDollars 3.5bn, up
CDollars 1.4bn on a year earlier. The domestic loan portfolio accounted for
CDollars 1.1bn of the increase. Total net loan loss provision stood at
CDollars 2bn, against CDollars 605m a year earlier.
The fourth-quarter net loss was CDollars 473m, or CDollars 1.63 a share,
after the increase in provisions, against net income of CDollars 260m, or 75
cents, a year earlier. Total assets at October 31 were CDollars 138bn, up 4
per cent from a year earlier.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ciga hotel chain lines up debt
reduction scheme
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGA, the international luxury hotel chain controlled by the Aga Khan, is
expected to announce later this week an agreement to slash debts by selling
a substantial stake in its hotel portfolio to an Italian private investor.
The transaction is set to reduce Ciga's debts, totalling almost L1,000bn
(Dollars 717m) including rolled-over interest and a convertible bond issue,
to between L350bn and L400bn.
The agreement should allow the company to lift much of the financial burden
which has pushed it into increasing losses and provide a breathing space for
further asset sales and restructuring.
However, after the deal, expected to involve the sale of a substantial stake
in the subsidiary which owns Ciga's 36 hotels in six European countries,
Ciga faces a continuing fall in demand for top-price hotel accommodation in
the economic recession.
Ciga's shares have plunged as a result of growing financial difficulties,
which earlier this year led to a debt rescheduling deal with its bankers and
the suspension of interest payments. Group losses rose to L98.9bn last year
from L33.4bn in 1990. Yesterday, Ciga's shares shed a further 3.1 per cent
to L1,151, having fallen by 4.2 per cent on Monday.
The new transaction, which should be revealed later this week, supersedes an
earlier plan to lower Ciga's debts by the sale of up to six of its top
Italian hotels, handled by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Although a
number of buyers came forward for both individual properties and all six
hotels, the prices offered were unsatisfactory.
The plan for hotel sales has been suspended pending completion of the deal,
which takes up an earlier scheme to bring in outside investors into Ciga's
property interests. The company may pursue outright disposals, subject to
agreement with its new partner, in order to further reduce its debts.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Credit rating of Swedish bank
cut again by S&amp;P

SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest bank, yesterday suffered the
third cut to its credit rating this year by Standard &amp; Poor's, reflecting
continuing concern over the severe troubles facing the country's banking
system.
Svenska Handelsbanken, another leading commercial bank, also had its rating
cut, while the ratings of Swedbank, a savings bank, and a number of mortgage
companies, remain under review.
Despite the proposed package of support from the government for the banking
sector, Swedish financial institutions still face serious difficulties.
'We would expect 1993 to be another very bad year for credit losses in
Sweden,' said Mr John Paulsen, a director of S&amp;P. While the worst of banks'
property-related problems may be over, broader credit losses in the
commercial and personal loan areas, resulting from economic recession, are
expected next year.
SEbanken, which started the year with a AA rating, yesterday had its Dollars
3.8bn of long-term debt downgraded from A+ to A-, with a stable outlook. S&amp;P
added that the change incorporated 'an expectation of continued high levels
of asset quality problems for the next few years'.
Svenska Handelsbanken's Dollars 4.2bn of long-term debt was downgraded from
AA- to A+, reflecting a sharp deterioration in the bank's asset quality due
mainly to the depressed commercial property market.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand package rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, looked
uncertain yesterday following a rejection by Uni's biggest creditor, West
Deutsche Landesbank, of a plan to recapitalise the crippled group.
The board appointed by the Norwegian government to administer Uni said it
would seek a new solution to strengthen the group and did not rule out
disposals.
The most saleable unit is the non-life insurance business, which has an
estimated 40 per cent domestic market share. But a disposal of this unit
could be disruptive for the life business, which is also the biggest
investor in shares in the Oslo market and behind the liquidity of free
shares traded on the bourse.
The board said it may sell shares in Uni Storebrand New - established after
the collapse in August of the old holding company - to pay off debt and
attract strategic investors.
The failed recapitalisation plan called for, among other things, 70 per cent
of NKr4.5bn (Dollars 690m) of debt to be converted to equity and a share
issue to raise NKr1bn in fresh capital, but it relied on the backing of
Uni's creditors.
The administration board said that it will work to achieve a solution by
next summer. West Deutsche Landesbank, which holds NKr1bn in Uni debt, has
also suffered heavy currency losses on the debt. It scuppered the
recapitalisation plan and demanded cash reimbursement.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: London is now a banker bet for
the Swiss - The leading financial institutions' switch out of Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a foreign subsidiary of a bank opens an outlet in the city in which its
parent is based, something is up.
Credit Suisse Financial Products (CSFP), the high-flying London-based swaps
and options affiliate of the leading Swiss bank, has just done it, opening a
representative office in Zurich.
This cheeky move is only the latest of many steps taken by the three top
Swiss banks - Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)
and Credit Suisse - which reveal a pattern of centring more and more
operations in London while letting their Swiss bases slide gently and
parochially towards the sidelines.
UBS and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, each employ more
than 2,000 people in London, compared with only a few hundred 10 years ago.
SBC employs 1,000 in London.
At a time when Germany is promoting Frankfurt as a European financial
centre, this build-up provides welcome reassurance for those worried about
the future of the City of London. The Swiss, at least, have no doubts. In
their view, no other European city can hope to challenge the City as an
international financial centre for the foreseeable future.
The Swiss may even help London maintain its pre-eminence. They have
established themselves in the past two years among the world's leaders in
the new high-tech game of using financial derivatives, mainly swaps and
options, to help clients - and themselves - control risks in their
investments. And London is their main base for these activities.
'London is the central information point. There is a different quality of
professional dialogue here than in any domestic market,' says Mr Bruce
Brittain, managing director of capital markets and treasury at SBC in
London.
Like many other large banks with international operations, the big three
Swiss banks have had outlets in London for decades. But, while many other
foreign banks have reduced their presence in the City in the past few years,
the Swiss have continued to expand.
This is perhaps best symbolised by the rather grand City premises of UBS and
SBC. More concretely, it is apparent in the range and scope of the
activities the big three undertake there. Their concentration of Euromarket
business, excluding Swiss franc issues, in the City is similar to that of
other international banks.
Yet it is unlikely that French or German banks will follow in putting most
of their European investment and corporate banking in London. They believe
they can compete from the home bases.
On the Swiss trend, an Italian banker remarks: 'We see Swiss bankers in our
country a lot more than we used to, and they are coming from London, not
from Zurich.'
The big three Swiss banks have nurtured institutional fund management
services in London and have even beefed up their private banking operations
in the City, apparently in response to the preference of more of their rich
individual clients.
UBS has gone a step further than its rivals, taking major shares in some UK
domestic financial markets through its acquisition, starting in 1984, of the
front-line UK equities firm, Phillips &amp; Drew.
To an extent, these moves reflect the decline of Zurich. Until the 1980s,
Zurich was the pre-eminent European foreign exchange market. It has lost
that title to the City, and the Swiss banks have, like others, boosted their
dealing presence in London.
Swiss tax laws have driven away securities transaction related business,
such as broking and fund management, even in Swiss securities. Credit Suisse
felt obliged to have its London branch take out a London Stock Exchange
membership last summer to keep pace with rivals.
Swiss restrictions on immigration and worker-friendly employment policies
are also factors. 'Labour laws are very important. It costs you a fortune to
change people in some European countries. Here, my maximum commitment is six
months,' says Mr Rudolf Muller, executive vice-president for Europe of UBS
in London.
Mr Jean-Christian Cheysson, managing director of CSFP, recalls that, when
his company faced the challenge of forming a team of 300 people in a very
short time to service its complicated transactions, 'it was easy in London;
it would have been impossible in Zurich.'
None of the big three publishes figures on the size and profitability of
their London operations, but they give clues. SBC says the capital employed
in its London-based businesses is roughly equivalent to that of SG Warburg,
the largest UK investment bank. Credit Suisse says about one-fifth of its
total capital is tied up in London operations.
For UBS, London is the most important foreign centre. Mr Muller says more
than half its foreign profits last year came from London. For SBC and CS
Holding, US operations are still larger than those in London, mainly because
of long-established commercial banking activities. CS also has a 64 per cent
stake in US investment bank, CS First Boston.
The banks' performance in London is less impressive. SBC and UBS made
profits there last year for the first time since 1986 and 1987 respectively.
Credit Suisse and SBC have figured prominently among the creditors to
companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell and other large UK
bankruptcies.
The three are confident that their troubles in London are now behind them,
and the word in Zurich is that they made killings during the recent currency
market turmoil. But they have yet to show that they can make triple A
quality returns in London or anywhere abroad.
All three expect that, within a few years, most profits will come from
abroad, which raises the question whether they will effectively, if not
formally, move their headquarters to London.
Mr Georges Streichenberg, executive director for international finance at
SBC, diverts the question. 'With modern communications, it does not make
much difference where you are, but we could not call ourselves Swiss if we
were in London.'
Paradoxically, the banks seem to be increasing central control in Zurich and
Basle, partly in response to bad lending experiences abroad and partly
because of the increasingly large and complex risks involved in derivatives
business.
Last summer, UBS appointed Mr Pierre de Weck as executive vice-president for
Europe, based in Zurich, and made clear that he would rank ahead of Mr
Muller in London, who carries the same title. Mr Georges Blum, who will
become chief executive of SBC next April, says that the freedom of
individual units 'has been very largely reduced'.
Mr de Weck also wants to build up expertise in Zurich as well as London.
'Being a Swiss bank, we need to have capabilities in both centres,' he says.
But neither he nor any other Swiss banker talks of cutting back in London.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Solvay warns profits will be
lower than last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, Belgium's largest chemical group, yesterday downgraded its profits
forecast, warning that its net profits would be lower than the BFr11.69bn
(Dollars 356m) last year.
The group said the general slowdown in European economic activity was to
blame for the profits warning. In July, the company had said full-year
results would be broadly comparable with 1991.
The profits warning follows a series of poor results by German chemical
groups, reflecting the slowdown in the German economy.
Solvay is the second-largest European manufacturer of PVC, but prices have
been hit by overcapacity and imports from former eastern bloc countries.
Operating earnings last year from plastics fell 81 per cent to BFr1.7m. The
interim dividend is unchanged at BFr100 per share.

<TEXT>
The Investment Bank of Ireland has ended up with 19.4 per cent of the
Wiltshire Brewery Company after a low subscription by shareholders in the
restructuring of the group that will leave the Indian UB Group in management
control.
Shareholders took up only 4.14 per cent of shares which were subject to a
placing under the restructuring, and 5.73 per cent of the shares available
under open offer.
The balance of 54.6m shares will be subscribed by conditional placees,
leaving the Investment Bank with its 19 per cent stake. Wiltshire's advisers
expect this to be placed in the next few months.
The deal will allow UB Group, headed by Mr Vijay Mallya and his family, to
take a 15.5 per cent stake and management control if the deal is approved by
an extraordinary meeting of Wiltshire shareholders tomorrow.

HILL SAMUEL the UK mer-chant bank owned by TSB Group, will halve its stake
in Macquarie Bank, the Australian financial services group, to 15 per cent
in a deal worth almost ADollars 53m (Pounds 24m).
The sell down, in line with an undertaking to the Australian government in
1985 when Macquarie was granted a banking licence, would involve 16.3m
shares at ADollars 3.25 each.
Macquarie plans to buy back 7.7m of the shares with the remaining 8.6m going
to Australian institutions.
The proposal is subject to approval by Macquarie shareholders but has
already been given the go-ahead by the Reserve Bank.
Macquarie said Hill Samuel had confirmed its intention to retain a 15 per
cent shareholding 'for the foreseeable future subject to price.' A Hill
Samuel representative will join the Macquarie board.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Norweb advances 11% to Pounds 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, said yesterday it planned
for real growth in dividends of 6 to 8 per cent until the end of the
century, as it unveiled an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits.
The performance was helped by staffing cuts - in distribution 100 jobs were
lost against a five-year plan of 700 - and a reduction in losses in the
supply business from Pounds 25.6m in the first half last year to Pounds
12.9m.
Separately, the company indicated resistance to signing long-term contracts
with generators for coal-fired electricity prior to the completion of the
government's review of energy policy scheduled for publication in January.
In the six months to September 30, Norweb recorded pre-tax profits up from
Pounds 33.4m to Pounds 37.1m on turnover ahead from Pounds 575.6m to Pounds
610.8m. Earnings per share were 15p (12.9p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 5.9p (5.3p).
In distribution, operating profits were down from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds
50.3m but this was partly because last year's profits were increased by
clawback from the previous year's under-recovery in tariffs and partly
because of Pounds 6.3m provisions for pensions and restructuring. Underlying
growth was 6 per cent in profit and 0.8 per cent in units, said Mr Ken
Harvey, chairman.
Manpower reductions in distribution mean the company has cut its staff there
by 500, half way into a five-year programme by which it intended to shelve
700.
Further job losses are in prospect in the contracting business where the
company is negotiating a new terms and conditions package with unions, and
wants to cut the 650-strong workforce by about 150.
In the first half contracting incurred losses of Pounds 900,000. The aim is
to be back in profits next year.
Mr Harvey said the supply business was expected to make profits this year.
Non-franchise customers were up 58 per cent in the first half. Tariff
increases next April would be well below inflation.
Retail profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 1.6m, the result of cost
inflation outstripping a 10 per cent rise in sales in high street shops and
'mainly' one-off provisions following an expansion into out-of-town stores.
Shops are performing 'better than expected' in the run-up to Christmas.
COMMENT
With so much uncertainty surrounding the electricity sector, regional
companies will be doing their best in the next few weeks of results to make
the most of their dividend potential. Norweb, the first to report, has set a
high growth target, which is perhaps just as well considering its
involvement in combined cycle gas turbine generation and retailing. Shares
have suffered in recent weeks because of the CCGT links; but they edged
ahead slightly yesterday as the market approved attempts to improve cashflow
and minimise chances of unfavourable decisions by the regulator.
Expectations for full-year pre-tax profits vary widely around Pounds 150m
but more important is the dividend. This is likely to be about 19.8p, giving
a yield of 5.7 per cent, about average for regional electricity companies.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames TV forecasts turnover in excess of
Pounds 100m next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television, which ceases to be an ITV broadcaster at the end of this
month, expects a turnover of more than Pounds 100m next year.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of the largest ITV company, outbid by
Carlton Television, made the forecast last night at the Royal Television
Society.
'We have moved within 12 months from team-player public service broadcaster
to sole television trader, whose job it is to please viewers through any
channels of any medium in any country,' Mr Dunn said.
Thames expects its television production business next year to bring in
between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m. Its international distribution arm should
have a turnover of Pounds 15m while Reeces, its US production arm, should
have revenue of Pounds 30m. Thames' studios at Teddington should bring in
Pounds 5m.
UK Gold, founded by Thames and the BBC would, Mr Dunn forecast, be worth as
much as all but the largest ITV companies by the end of the decade.
Mr Dunn admitted last night that he did not have high expectations in 'the
indiscriminate, unnecessary and destructive' auction for ITV franchises. 'We
bid the maximum the London weekday licence was worth to us, close to Pounds
33m per annum. I would not have bid any more,' he said.
Mr Dunn detailed how there were several series of talks for the sale of
Thames to Carlton but that each time discussions collapsed on price.
Mr Dunn said if Carlton had acquired control of Thames it would have had no
qualified rival in the auction and 'could have saved itself Pounds 43m per
year for 10 years'.

Of the loss, Pounds 2.2m related to Tavern Leisure, a subsidiary disposed of

loss of Pounds 1.99m arose on the disposal after deducting goodwill
previously written off.
Turnover in 1991-92 came to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 8.77m) and led to an

unchanged final dividend of 1.9p is proposed to maintain the total at
2.775p.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hill Samuel to halve stake in Macquarie
Bank in ADollars 53m sale
</HEADLINE>

HILL SAMUEL the UK merch-ant bank owned by TSB Group, will halve its stake
in Macquarie Bank, the Australian financial services group, to 15 per cent
in a deal worth almost ADollars 53m (Pounds 24m).
The sell down, in line with an undertaking to the Australian government in
1985 when Macquarie was granted a banking licence, would involve 16.3m
shares at ADollars 3.25 each.
Macquarie plans to buy back 7.7m of the shares with the remaining 8.6m going
to Australian institutions which have already expressed interest in the
deal.
The proposal is subject to approval by Macquarie shareholders but has
already been the go ahead by the Reserve Bank After the deal Macquarie will
no longer be classified in Australia as a foreign bank.
Macquarie said Hill Samuel had confirmed its intention to retain a 15 per
cent shareholding 'for the foreseeable future subject to price.' A Hill
Samuel representative will join the Macquarie board.
Mr David Clarke, executive chairman of Macquarie, said his bank's equity
base of ADollars 300m exceeded present requirements or likely future needs,
and the timing of the buy-back was appropriate.
He said Macquarie's overall capital adequacy ratio at September 30 was 12.57
per cent, and would have reduced to 11.69 per cent had the buy-back been
implemented at that date; the Tier I capital ratio would have been reduced
to 9.62 per cent.
These ratios compared with a Reserve Bank minimum requirement of 8 per cent
adequacy overall and 4 per cent for Tier 1 capital.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Move into eastern Europe helps Oriflame
leap 79%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LUCRATIVE eastern European market and the acquisition of Sweden's leading
pharmaceutical cosmetic brand helped to boost interim pre-tax profits at
Oriflame International, the direct sales cosmetics company, by 79 per cent
to Pounds 4.2m.
Sales for the six months to September 30 rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 37m.
Mr Robert af Jochnick, the chairman and one of two Swedish brothers who set
up the company 25 years ago, said the move into eastern Europe had been
'going like an absolute rocket'. Oriflame set up a group called Oresa as a
separate company in 1990 and holds a 25 per cent stake.
Oresa, which sells Oriflame products, contributed some Pounds 1m to the
overall operating return of Pounds 4.6m, compared with Pounds 1.4m.
The acquisition of Aco, the leading cosmetic brand with 75 per cent of
cosmetic sales in Swedish pharmacies, boosted the operating return by
between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m.
Purchased for about Pounds 10m in January, Aco had 'developed . . . beyond
our expectations,' said Mr af Jochnick. Oriflame planned to introduce the
brand into pharmacies in the rest of Europe with special emphasis on the
east.
In the direct sales division, Oriflame's core business, the main
Scandinavian market had remained 'very solid'. However, trading in the UK,
the group's second largest market, had been more difficult. Mr af Jochnick
said the group planned a shift in emphasis from a middle to up-market range
to a middle to lower market.
The mail order divisions in France and the UK had incurred minor losses and
were likely to be discontinued.
Mr af Jochnick said that in western Europe, the group still faced the
challenge of 'showing a continuing improvement in sales and profits' of the
core business. However, he was optimistic that Oriflame would show a 'very
healthy increase in sales and profits' this year, given the inclusion of
both Aco and eastern Europe.
The dividend was maintained at 4p, reflecting 'our determination to maintain
a strong balance sheet'. Earnings per share rose by 66 per cent to 6.8p.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ex-Spring Ram chiefs to launch new venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of ex-Spring Ram executives, led by co-founder Mr Bob Murray, has
got together to launch a home products company that will include kitchens
and bathrooms - the territories where their former employer has flourished.
Mr Murray, who resigned from Spring Ram Corporation in 1990, has gathered
four of his former colleagues in a company called Omega.
They are: Mr Francis Galvin, who was the main board director responsible for
kitchens; Mr Martin Croxen, ex-managing director of the property subsidiary
Ramfield; Mr Henry Johnston, ex-production director at Spring Bathrooms; and
Mr Newton Winfield, ex-managing director of Ram Bathrooms.
The four, who left between October last year and February this year, say
their departures were unrelated to problems that have since emerged at
another Spring Ram subsidiary, Balterley Bathrooms, causing considerable
damage to the group's share price in the past few weeks.
Because a dispute developed last winter over whether some of them should
serve out two years' notice, Mr Galvin and the others concerned are legally
bound not to sell products competing with Spring Ram until May 7 next year.
Meanwhile they are about to move from Leeds to an industrial park off the
M62 to continue planning the launch of various consumer products. The
portfolio of brand names acquired so far includes Hepplewhite Kitchens, Taps
UK, Thomas Hope, Thomas Sheraton and Leeds Pottery Company.
As with Spring Ram, building factories on greenfield sites will be part of
the formula. But they say Omega will be more diversified than Spring Ram and
'pan-European'.
Factory building is due to start next year and the first products are
expected to come to market in 1994.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALE TILNEY, the loss- making mini-conglomerate, is close to agreement with
its banks on a financial restructuring. The group's borrowings total about
Pounds 24.5m.
The deal is believed to involve a debt-for-equity swap which would dilute
existing shareholders. Any proposals will have to be put to shareholders but
the group's problems may give them little option but to approve the plan.
The group has interests in food, industrial products, insurance and
financial services. Its net liabilities at the end of its half year, May 27,
were Pounds 11.6m and it incurred a pre-tax loss in the period of Pounds
2.5m, after losing Pounds 4.45m in the year to November 29 1991.
A facility was agreed with its banks, led by National Westminster, in
January 1991 shortly after Mr Andrew Coppel joined the group as chief
executive. This facility expired on Monday, hence yesterday's announcement.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BSS feels the chill of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BSS Group's new position as the UK's second largest distributor to the
domestic heating market provided it with little insulation from the
recession in the half year to September.
Pre-tax profits tumbled 21 per cent to Pounds 4.08m (Pounds 5.16m). That was
in spite of a 7 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 112.5m (Pounds
104.8m) and a sharply reduced interest bill, down at Pounds 776,000 compared
with Pounds 1.07m.
Mr Alan Milne, finance director, said that Cadel - a rival loss-making
domestic heating supplier whose key assets BSS bought from the receiver for
Pounds 19.1m in June - contributed Pounds 14m in revenue in the quarter it
was under BSS management, but only Pounds 286,000 in operating profit.
Overall operating profit fell to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 6.23m).
Mr Milne said Cadel's integration with BSS's domestic heating and plumbing
division would be completed by March. The division would contribute at least
half of group turnover by next year. He said demand was weak in all the
sectors BSS served.
The purchase of Cadel had limited the impact of a 4 to 5 per cent fall in
domestic demand, and increased market share helped offset an 11 per cent
drop in industrial and commercial demand.
Mr Milne said: 'We are hoping for growth in 1993-94, but it is too early to
see any sign of an upturn yet.'
A 5.75p interim dividend is maintained. Earnings per share fell from 16.4p
to 11.44p.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Leeds 35% ahead to Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS GROUP, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer, reported a
35 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits. It is proposing to raise
its dividend by 13 per cent and make a 1-for-2 scrip issue.
For the year to September 30 profits increased to Pounds 5.53m (Pounds
4.11m) helped by higher sales in the Middle East and further growth in its
non-apparel business. Turnover grew by 31 per cent to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds
31.4m).
Earnings per share increased to 33.1p (25p) out of which the group plans to
pay a final dividend of 7.5p (6.75p) lifting the total to 11p (9.75p).
Mr Robert Wade, chairman and managing director, said all seven of the
textile operations posted increased profits. Although the UK retail sector
remained difficult because of weak sales, the group increased market share
in a number of areas.
'The need for us to maintain this improvement is paramount, as the pressure
on margins is relentless wherever we trade,' Mr Wade said.
Last month an arson attack at Walsden Printing damaged some of the printing
machines. Although it will be some weeks before full production can be
resumed, Mr Wade said the group was fully insured and there should be no
impact on profits.
Among the non-textile operations Leeds Leasing has been concentrating on
protecting its exposure to bad debt, and has reduced new business written by
9 per cent. However, the benefit of lower interest rates and the
disappearance of many competitors helped profits increase to Pounds 285,000
(Pounds 124,000.)
In March West Yorkshire Insurance had a 1-for-2 rights issue which resulted
in Leeds' stake falling from 34.7 per cent to 23 per cent. Leeds did not
take up its rights, allowing a fellow shareholder, CNA International
Reinsurance, which underwrote the issue, to increase its holding to 41 per
cent.
Mr Wade said the outlook for the group 'continues to be dominated by
difficult conditions in most world markets'. However, he added: 'While it is
harder than ever to anticipate the future, the new financial year has
started well, and prospects for the first half are not without promise.'
COMMENT
Leeds has maintained its reputation as a recession-buster. Its core textile
printing business has benefited from diversification away from the fickle
apparel business, with moves into printed furnishing fabrics, curtains and
military camouflage. The balance sheet is in good shape with the Pounds 2.5m
in cash at the end of the September almost exactly offsetting debt.
Meanwhile the group has reduced its exposure to the insurance sector by not
taking up the rights issue at West Yorkshire. Pre-tax profits should climb
to about Pounds 6m this year and earnings could reach almost 36p a share
producing a prospective p/e of about 14.3. This is a quality stock in an
unfashionable sector which, despite its run-up in the last two years, is
still a buy.

<TEXT>
PROSPECT Industries reported a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from
Pounds 3.53m to Pounds 4.44m in the year to September 30.
Prospect's shares climbed 10 per cent from 14 3/4 p to 16 1/2 p.
Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said the group, formerly an engineering
components supplier, had completed its transition 'from a company to being a
group serving the power generation and process industries'.
He noted that year-on-year comparisons were difficult because the results
included a 12-month contribution from its core operation Dunn International
bought for Pounds 13.4m in May last year; six months from Greenbank, a
pipeworks supplier, bought for Pounds 2.4m in March, and two months from
Davenport, acquired for Pounds 10.1m.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 30m), to which engineering services
contributed Pounds 34.4m and manufacturing Pounds 18m. Operating profit
increased to Pounds 5.03m (Pounds 4m).
A final dividend of 0.5p makes a total of 0.75p. Earnings per share were 2p
(2.68p).

Control Securities, the brewing, hotels and property group negotiating a
financial restructuring with its banks, has won an extension of the
standstill agreement on its borrowings until December 18. This allows it to
continue trading during the discussions.
The standstill is intended to cover the period when the banks' credit
committees are coming to decisions over the restructuring. The standstill is
likely to be extended again thereafter to allow time for documentation to be
finalised.
The group has debts of Pounds 259m. Its shares have been suspended at 16 1/2

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: APV chief gets restructure under way with
Pounds 56m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE Strowger, the new chief executive of APV, has launched his own
programme to restructure the food processing equipment maker with the sale
of a ventilation company to Smiths Industries for Pounds 55.8m in cash.
Mr Strowger, who was appointed in June, said the sale of Vent-Axia, a
manufacturer of hand drier and ventilation equipment, would 'unlock a lot of
value. With this headroom I can attack our business in a positive way.'
The company also announced a refinancing of its Dollars 250m multi-option
facility (Mof), which was originally due to expire in May, 1993. Mr Strowger
said the refinancing not only strengthened the balance sheet - with debt
maturing at between three and 10 years - but the loans were now more
flexible.
The need for a refinancing was partly due to the raft of acquisitions made
in the 1980s which had an adverse affect on the balance sheet by 1990. APV
had launched a restructuring programme that year, but Mr Strowger said
considerable work remained to be done.
Further non-core disposals or closures, representing less than 10 per cent
of APV's Pounds 874.4m turnover, were planned. Proceeds would be invested in
core businesses, with particular emphasis on the cash generative operations
such as components.
The sale to Smiths Industries represented an 'extremely attractive' price,
significantly above book value, Mr Strowger said. Last year Vent-Axia
contributed Pounds 5m in profits, and had Pounds 16.5m in net assets.
APV was likely to take an exceptional credit for the book value premium in
the year to end-December, although restructuring costs would be offset
against it.
Mr Russell Plumley, of Smiths Industries, said the acquisition of Vent-Axia
fitted into the company's plan to build up the industrial side of its
business. Smiths planned to increase Vent-Axia's share of the export market,
particularly the US and Germany.
In the last two years, Smiths has spent Pounds 200m on acquisitions, with
the majority in the lower technology industrial and medical systems
businesses.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Write-downs leave Trafalgar below City
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALLAN GORMLY, the new chief executive of Trafalgar House, said there was
an element of clearing the decks before reporting yesterday's full-year
results.
'We have properly taken a somewhat more conservative view of the accounts as
a result of recent management changes. It would have been surprising if we
had not looked at this in a different way.'
However, while the City expected poor results, the pre-tax loss of Pounds
30.3m for the year ended September 30 was worse than most analysts
predicted. Exceptional property write-downs of Pounds 138m were also bigger
than expected.
Of the total write-down, Pounds 70.7m was charged at operating level, Pounds
46m was reflected in results of associated companies and Pounds 21.3m was
included in the interest charge.
The loss after taxation rose to Pounds 80.6m because of the substantial
advance corporation tax write off of Pounds 40.3m. The group has not been
able to make sufficient profits to offset against its ACT.
Of the company's gross ACT surplus of Pounds 183.8m to be offset against
future UK corporation tax liabilities, Pounds 31.8m has been offset against
deferred taxation. Some Pounds 2.7m, arising from the final dividend, is
carried as a debtor in the balance sheet and the rest has been written over
to the profit and loss account over the past few years.
Exceptional write-downs and the ACT write-off reduced shareholders' funds
from Pounds 684.6m to Pounds 542.2m.
Engineering was the one bright spot. The division's operating profits rose
from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 89.4m on increased sales of Pounds 2.4bn (Pounds
1.5bn).
Davy corporation, which Trafalgar took over last year after it ran into
severe financial difficulties converting the Emerald producer oil rig,
contributed Pounds 30m. Midland and Scottish Resources, the original
customer for the rig, is leasing it from Trafalgar for Dollars 65,000
(Pounds 43,000) per day. But MSR had failed to meet purchase conditions for
Trafalgar to pay former shareholders in Davy their second takeover payment,
totalling Pounds 54m.
Overseas orders account for more than 60 per cent of the engineering
division's Pounds 2bn order book.
The construction division suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 16.9m to
Pounds 10.1m on reduced sales of Pounds 785.8m (Pounds 928.4m).
Profits from shipping and hotels fell from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 25.3m. The
group is still looking for a partner to help it restructure the shipping
fleet.
Trafalgar said the results should be considered in light of last year's
restated pre-tax loss of Pounds 38.5m.

ALLIED COLLOIDS, the speciality chemicals group, reported a 7 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 22.5m, in the half
year to October 3.
The group said its lack of dependence on the UK enabled it to sustain volume
growth.
Sales, up 9 per cent, from Pounds 124.6m to Pounds 136.3m, had increased in
all regions. Only 16 per cent of the group's turnover is based in the UK.
The company said: 'Although we can as yet discern little favourable change
in market conditions around the world, we nevertheless expect to be able to
sustain the improvement for the remainder of the year.'
Hydrolabs, the US speciality chemicals company supplying the textile
industry which was acquired last year for Dollars 18m, broke even after
start-up costs. The group is planning to expand this company in order to
market its products around the world.
The tax charge increased from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 8.2m after an
exceptionally low payment at the end of the last financial year. This was
because a provision for deferred taxation of Pounds 5m relating to
accelerated capital allowances was no longer required.
Earnings per share increased to 5.47p (5.17p). The interim dividend is 0.94p
(0.88p).

TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate, received acceptances in respect of
90.42 per cent of the 335.78m shares on offer through its rights issue to
help acquire Ranks Hovis McDougall.
The remaining 32.15m shares not taken up have been placed with shareholders.
The first payment under the rights became payable on Monday with the last
date for acceptance of the rights issue.
Tomkins Pounds 653m cash call is the third largest fully underwritten rights
issue in the London market, behind BT and Blue Arrow.
Tomkins shares edged 3 1/2 p higher yesterday to 232p - above the
see-through price at which its cash and paper offer for RHM is worth more
than its 260p cash alternative.
Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said he was 'delighted with the
level of support from shareholders'.
The first closing on its bid for RHM is on December 7 ahead of which the
company needs approval for the deal at an EGM on Friday.
The recent rise on the Tomkins share price means the share and cash offer
may be better value than the cash alternative and could leave the company
with low gearing, after payment of the second tranche of the rights issue.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Racal back in the black with Pounds 23m -
Shares fall 17p as turnround fails to meet company's expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RACAL ELECTRONICS, the data communications, radio and network services
group, yesterday reported the expected turnround but not to the extent
anticipated by Sir Ernest Harrison, its chairman.
Operating profits for the half year to October 9 increased by 28 per cent to
Pounds 26.8m while at the pre-tax level a loss of Pounds 2.4m was turned
into profits of Pounds 23.1m. Sales declined 6 per cent to Pounds 448m.
The interim dividend of 1.5p is 3.4 times covered and comes from earnings
per share up from 0.28p to 5.16p.
Racal-Redac, the computer-aided design systems business, lost Pounds 3m in
the first half after appearing to be on target for break-even at the time of
the demerger of Chubb.
The data communications division produced operating profits of Pounds 4.3m
against a loss of Pounds 1.78m. This was cut on sales of Pounds 173m (Pounds
178m) and included profits for the first time of Pounds 2m from the
Government Network Services arm.
Mr David Elsbury, chief executive, said the market had to remember that data
communications always enjoyed greater volume in the second half.
Radio communications improved its margin by two percentage points to 16 per
cent. Profits were Pounds 12.5m.
Following the demerger of Chubb Security the result included interest
receivable of Pounds 4.1m, an Pounds 11.6m swing from the Pounds 7.4m charge
last year. The group also took high exceptional charges of Pounds 7.78m,
covering redundancies, although it was half the figure for the same period
last year.
Net debt was reduced by positive cash flow from a pro-forma Pounds 61.2m, at
the time of the demerger, to Pounds 59.7m after Pounds 18m of capital
expenditure.
COMMENT
While these figures were broadly in line with expectations, the market
remains concerned that Racal's biggest division, data communications, has
still not convincingly turned the corner. And Redac again disappointed,
turning in a loss where break-even was expected. Yesterday's share price
fall - down 17p to 154p - has much to do with the shaving of full-year
forecasts that this triggered and some profit taking after a strong run up
in the share price. But earnings growth is still good and the possibility of
a bid - the prize being the potential for raising data communications'
margins - still cannot be ruled out. Even with shaved full-year forecasts of
Pounds 50m, giving earnings of 11.1p, Racal is still on a slight prospective
discount to the market and good value as it started its recovery from such a
low base.

IPounds 10m (Pounds 10.1m) to repay borrowings.
Mr Neil McCann, chairman, and Mr Carl McCann, group finance director, have
sold a total of 11m ordinary shares at 64p each, and a further IPounds 3m in
preference shares, which were held by Balkan Investment Co, the investment
vehicle of the McCann family.
The sale reduces the family holding in Fyffes to 9.3 per cent of the
ordinary share capital, down from 13.3 per cent.
Mr Carl McCann, said that the shares were sold to repay loans which had been
taken out to build a stake in Fyffes during earlier share placings.
He said: 'That was fine when interest rates were normal, but with the
current rates it created a situation we were not willing to continue with.'
One-month money market rates on the Dublin market are in the 40-60 per cent
range.
The sale took place at a four-year low in the Fyffes share price. 'It was
not very pleasant to be selling at that price, but . . . it was either now
or wait until next February,' he said.
Under Stock Exchange rules, directors are not permitted to make share
transactions in their own companies within two months before the release of
annual financial results.
Ordinary shares formerly held by Balkan, worth 7.7m, have been sold to the
Development Capital Corporation (DCC), a Dublin-based industrial and
financial holding company, which is 20 per cent owned by the Bank of
Ireland.
DCC has increased its stake in Fyffes through the purchase from 8.2 per cent
to 11 per cent. DCC began as a venture capital company in 1976, and has been
a strong supporter of the McCanns, helping to bring their FII company to the
Stock Exchange in 1981.
Mr Jim Flavin, the chairman and chief executive of DCC said yesterday: 'We
have no further intentions . . . to increase our holding. Fyffes is a very
cash-rich company, and it just seemed like a very good opportunity to buy.'

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sedgwick Pounds 19.5m share issue to fund
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEDGWICK Group, the second biggest insurance broker in the UK, is raising
Pounds 19.5m via a share issue to finance its first overseas acquisitions
since the mid-1980s.
It has purchased new businesses in France and the US, and is negotiating to
buy a regional broker in Germany.
It is paying Pounds 6.1m, comprising an initial Pounds 4.9m and two deferred
considerations of Pounds 600,000, to buy Cabinet Billet, one of France's
largest credit insurance brokers, and Dollars 10.5m (Pounds 7m) to acquire
Duncan Peek, a US broking and employee benefits consultancy.
The completion of the German acquisition is expected to take place early in
1993.
A total of 13.89m shares are being issued, of which 9.92m are being placed
through SG Warburg Securities. The expansion is the first by Sedgwick since
1986, when it acquired three regional US brokers - Crump Companies,
Armistead and Arthur L Owen.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said: 'The market has been in a trough. It
could be the right time to buy.' Both purchases also demonstrate that
Sedgwick is seeking to expand its product base by building niche businesses.
In France, where Sedgwick is already the fifth biggest property/casualty
broker, Cabinet Billet specialises in credit insurance. Similarly
Atlanta-based Duncan Peek has specialist expertise in sports insurance
broking.
Sedgwick has some Pounds 6.4m to complete its acquisition of a new German
operation.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Chubb margin rebuilding locked on course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHUBB SECURITY, which was floated off from Racal Electronics in October,
yesterday said its strategy of rebuilding margins and cutting costs is on
course.
The group reported pre-tax profits up 92 per cent at Pounds 26.9m for the
half year to October 9 on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 328.3m. Earnings
per share rose from 2.09p to 5.44p and the group is to pay a 1.5p interim
dividend.
Mr David Peacock, the chief executive who has overseen a rapid turnround in
the company's fortunes, emphasised that Chubb, like Racal, has a policy of
paying a dividend that is 2.5 to 3 times covered at the full year.
Mr Peacock said that he did not think the security market was growing, in
spite of rising crime rates. 'I think the market is still steady and our job
is to increase our market share but we must recognise we are in a
recessionary environment,' he said.
Chubb had a 3 per cent share of a world-wide market worth Pounds 23bn.
In the electronic security area, where the group sees most growth, the
intention was to increase the 7.5 per cent share of the world-wide market,
worth Pounds 5bn, by 2.5 percentage points over the next two years.
Chubb's tax rate came down from 56 per cent to 41 per cent and Sir Ernest
Harrison, the chairman, said he expected this to be 36 per cent 'over a
period of time'.
Net debt was reduced from a pro-forma Pounds 60m at the time of the demerger
to Pounds 38.6m, giving gearing of 24.9 per cent.
The group took an additional extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.9m to cover
costs of closure and disposal of businesses, including an additional charge
connected with the sale of Hoermann Sicherheitstechnik in Germany.
COMMENT
As one would expect two months after demerger, there were almost no
surprises in yesterday's figures, apart from higher than expected
exceptional reorganisation costs. The story of margin rebuilding and
introduction of new products remains compelling. And first indications
suggest that margins are indeed being re-built - up from 6 per cent to 10
per cent. But the shares, have had an exceptionally good run. Chubb's market
capitalisation is also now within a whisker of the value Sir Ernest Harrison
put on it during his successful defence of Williams' hostile bid last year.
Profits forecast for the year at about Pounds 60m, give 12.1p of earnings,
and a 19 times prospective multiple. It is hard to see much upside with the
shares on this premium to the market.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: MEPC profits and assets fall 23.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second biggest property company, yesterday underlined the
weakness of property markets across the world by announcing a 23.5 per cent
decline in net assets per share from 608p to 465p in the year to September
30.
Pre-tax profits fell by 23.5 per cent from Pounds 143.3m to Pounds 109.6m in
the period, which Mr James Tuckey, managing director, described as 'a
dreadful year for the property industry.'
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said that there was 'precious little
evidence of any improvement in our markets,' although he stressed the
resilience of the group, which has three quarters of its UK income secured
by leases running beyond the end of the century.
Sir Christopher sharply criticised the government's attitude to the property
industry concerning issues such as the levy of rates on empty buildings, the
proposed register of contaminated land and leasehold enfranchisement.
Taken together 'they further threaten the stability of the property market,'
he said.
The value of MEPC's properties fell by 12.5 per cent overall. The UK
properties, which accounts for four-fifths of the portfolio, fell by 12.6
per cent, while those in Continental Europe, Australia and the US fell by 15
per cent, 15.7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.
MEPC said 1992 was a year of consolidation, in which it completed its
development programme and reduced its worldwide vacancy rate from 19 per
cent to 8 per cent.
In particular, MEPC has found tenants for 60 per cent of Alban Gate, its
flagship development in the City of London. Concern that Chemical Bank, the
largest tenant in the building, might pull out of the development was
lessened this week when it began talks with MEPC about eradicating the break
clause which allows it to cancel its lease after one year.
Although rental income increased by 4 per cent, pre-tax profits fell as a
result of lower property trading profits and an increase in finance charges
from Pounds 79.7m to Pounds 107.0m.
Gearing increased to 82 per cent, despite investment sales of Pounds 127m.
MEPC yesterday confirmed that it has sold a building in London's Finsbury
Circus to DIFA, a German property fund, for about Pounds 73m.
Earnings per share fell by 22.7 per cent from 31.3p to 24.2p. An unchanged
final dividend of 14.75p net was proposed, making a total of 20p net for the
year.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hunters Armley seeks listing via placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hunters Armley, the Leeds-based web offset printing company which was
established in 1845, is seeking a full listing by way of a Pounds 10.8m
private placing of 11.96m shares at 90p each.
Based on the placing price, and its enlarged share capital base of 20.4m
shares, the group will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 18.3m.
Existing shareholders are selling 6.4m shares and 5.56m new shares are being
sold to raise Pounds 4.6m net of expenses, which will be used to wipe out
debt and fund continuing expansion.
Early in 1990 a team led by Mr David Bird, chairman, and Mr Brian Sugden,
managing director, backed by the Yorkshire Fund, organised a management
buy-out from Parkway (now part of Wace.)
Since then operating margins have risen from 6 per cent to 9 per cent and
pre-tax profits have grown from Pounds 898,000 in 1990 to Pounds 2.05m in
the year to September 30.
Dealings in the shares are expected to begin on Monday.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Trafalgar House reports Pounds 30m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the constr- uction, engineering and shipping group,
reported a loss before tax of Pounds 30.3m after exceptional property
write-downs of Pounds 138m to the year ended September 30.
Last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 122.4m were restated as a loss of
Pounds 38.5m in light of the Financial Reporting Review Panel's decision
that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and loss
account and not through reserves. The final dividend was held at 1.6p,
making a total of 6p. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said the group 'will
seek to establish a dividend level which can be sustained'.
He said he was keeping his options open as to what the group could afford to
pay in the future.
Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares fell by 6p to close at 89p and 86p
respectively.
Mr Gormly signalled his disapproval of the decision by Hongkong Land, the
Jardine Matheson-controlled Hong Kong property company, to enter into an
option arrangement with a financial house to buy a further 36m shares,
taking its Trafalgar stake above 20 per cent.
He said he had asked both the Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel to look
into the arrangement, but both said it was 'right and proper'.
Trafalgar is concerned that Hongkong Land will exercise a 'significant
amount of control' with a minority shareholding.
Group borrowings, including off-balance sheet debt, amount to Pounds 452.2m,
giving gearing of 86 per cent.
Exceptional property write-downs, and the advance corporation tax write-off
of Pounds 40.3m, reduced shareholders' funds by 21 per cent to Pounds
542.2m.
The group hopes to make a number of disposals. It said it had two
interesting offers for the Stafford and Duke hotels which are valued by
Trafalgar at Pounds 40m.
Sir Nigel Broackes and Sir Eric Parker, former chairman and chief executive
respectively, are to receive compensation of Pounds 1.9m arising from early
termination of their service agreements.
Sir Nigel is honorary president without a seat on the board while Sir Eric
remains a deputy chairman until he reaches 60 next June.
There was a loss per share of 17p compared with a restated loss of 19.9p.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Allied-Lyons increases profits by 2.5% to Pounds 283m in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, weathered depressed
trading conditions worldwide to raise first-half pre-tax profits 2.5 per
cent to Pounds 283m.
The result - broadly in line with market expectations - was achieved while
the group was refocusing on its core businesses.
Capital investment and marketing expenditure were increased to Pounds 326m
'to ensure long-term competitive strength', said Mr Michael Jackaman,
chairman.
Earnings per share declined from 19.1p to 18.5p, mainly because of an
increase in profits attributable to minority interests. The interim dividend
is up 4.5 per cent to 6.95p (6.65p).
Group trading profit during the six months to September 19 fell from Pounds
379m to Pounds 372m on turnover reduced 2.9 per cent to Pounds 2.57bn
(Pounds 2.65bn).
Translation of foreign currency trading profits had an adverse impact of
Pounds 7m; but the second half is expected to show compensating gains.
Hiram Walker, the spirits and wine division, was the group's mainstay,
raising trading profits 1.7 per cent to Pounds 175m. Overall volume was
ahead and the five leading brands - Ballantine's, Courvoisier, Beefeater,
Canadian Club and Kahlua - which contribute nearly half of profits, gained
share in many markets.
Overheads were cut, particularly in the US and UK, and staff employed in
continuing operations was reduced by more than 600. Profit per employee is
now 9 per cent higher than a year ago.
Retailing profits were unchanged at Pounds 118m in spite of the disposal of
500 pubs. Victoria Wine increased turnover 7 per cent; Dunkin Donuts sales
rose 11 per cent with 300 additional outlets in the US and rapid growth in
South America.
Baskins-Robbins' US performance was affected by the weather but expansion
continued in Thailand, Chile, Venezuela, Greece and Sweden.
Brewing and wholesaling profits were 6.3 per cent lower at Pounds 45m
because of a Pounds 4m increase in bad debt provisions. Beer volumes and
market share improved 1 per cent against a similar overall industry decline.
Major brands performed well: Tetley bitter volumes increased 8 per cent, and
Castlemaine and Skol gained 4 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 92 / DAF may pull out of van venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, is facing serious problems over the
future financing of its joint venture with Renault of France for the
production of a new range of light commercial vehicles.
DAF, which is in its third year of heavy losses, must decide soon whether to
press ahead with the planned investment of around Pounds 100m at its van
plant at Birmingham in the UK. No official decision has been made, but it is
understood that Renault is making contingency plans for DAF's withdrawal
from the joint venture, which could put at risk the long-term future of
DAF's Birmingham plant.
DAF and Renault formed a joint company, Van Technology, in 1990 to develop
and engineer a new generation of medium/heavy vans. Under the terms of the
joint venture the two companies were to make separate investments at their
respective van plants in Birmingham and at Batilly in eastern France for the
production of the new vehicle, which was due to start in 1994/95.
DAF insisted yesterday that vans remained a part of its 'core business
activity'. It said that reports in France that it wished 'to abandon this
market segment' were 'entirely without foundation'.
It said 'work on the joint van project with Renault is continuing as
scheduled. This involves a large team of engineers from both DAF and Renault
based in Birmingham.' The UK plant has a workforce of nearly 2,000 including
production workers and engineering staff. The scale of DAF's financial
problems has already forced it to seek a 'strategic alliance' for its
mainstream truck operations, with talks currently under way with
Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany and the
world's leading truck maker.
DAF said in the autumn that it hoped a new partner would provide fresh
equity.
This hope appeared to be dashed last month when Daimler-Benz ruled out any
move to take a shareholding in the Dutch vehicle maker.
According to DAF, the van project with Renault involves a total investment
of around Pounds 500m, of which some Pounds 250m comprises spending by Van
Technology on design, development and tooling.

The legal challenge brought by an individual shareholder to the planned
buy-out of Amstrad by its chairman Mr Alan Sugar has been brought forward to
tomorrow, writes John Mason. A High Court judge said the appeal by Mr Edward
Northcote, an accountant owning 1,000 Amstrad shares, should be heard this
week to avoid confusing shareholders about whether next Thursday's meeting,
when approval for the plan will be sought, would go ahead.

tells Tony Jackson there is no hidden agenda in his buy-out proposal
</HEADLINE>

Mr Alan Sugar has been talking to the newspapers a lot lately. This is not
in character, but he has his reasons. He has until next Wednesday to
persuade his shareholders to sell his company back to him. He is pretty sure
the institutions will play ball. He is a good deal less sure about his army
of private investors.
In spite of his supposed aversion to publicity, Mr Sugar is a master of the
media. The general press comes away with a portrait of Essex Man, aggressive
and profane. The financial press is confronted by the sober and thoughtful
businessman. However, either way, the main nagging question for shareholders
remains: why does he really want to take Amstrad private?
The answer seems in two parts. First, Mr Sugar is a proud man: if Amstrad is
finished, its demise will be a private affair. Second, he has an insatiable
thirst for cash: not wealth tied up in the business, but the stuff itself.
The first point is not as obvious as it looks. There is nothing diffident
about Mr Sugar. In spite of Amstrad's fall from grace, his self-belief seems
unshakeable. But he is deeply touchy about being beholden to anyone, the
City in particular.
It is revealing that throughout the weeks of argument over the buy-out, he
has not once visited the City to put his case to the institutions. 'I don't
want to convince anyone of anything,' he said this week. 'I don't want to go
down there and have to talk my heart out to them. They've got the figures,
they've got the money on the table, and they'll make their own minds up.'
But this is, after all, a straightforward commercial transaction. If it
involved the supply of electronics instead of shares, he would travel to
Taiwan or Hong Kong at the drop of a hat. The City is just 30 minutes from
his office by train. Is he too proud to ask? 'Maybe. But I'm not asking
their permission, I'm suggesting it to them.'
He is also prompted by a broader sense of ego. 'I don't want to be
considered one of the failing entrepreneurs of the '80s. I want to
gracefully bow out - temporarily, short-term, long-term or whatever.'
This suggests he is not necessarily turning his back on the City for ever.
This is where the thirst for cash comes in. As a public company, Amstrad has
made very little call on shareholders' money. But for Mr Sugar, this is not
the point. 'Being public was a great advantage for me. How? Because I've
sold lots of shares and made a personal fortune.'
But surely the company would have been worth as much private? Not to him, he
explains patiently. 'Look, in 1980 I had a company which was worth nothing.
I sold 25 per cent of it for Pounds 2m. So in the first year I had Pounds
2m, didn't I, which I didn't have before. Two years later I sold another
Pounds 2m worth, and two years after that I sold Pounds 4m worth, and a few
years after that I sold Pounds 25m worth, and then last year I sold Pounds
34m worth. That all went into my pocket.'
What did he want the money for? 'To buy property, for example. That's what
I've done in the past five or six years. That's a form of insurance in a
very stable and safe, boring investment: reasonably yielding, safe covenant,
freehold commercial properties.'
Mr Sugar's view of life begins to sound like that of a footballer or rock
star, squirrelling the money away while the good times last. 'I don't see
how you make that out,' he says. 'What's the point in owning shares in a
public company if you can't sell them?'
The question lies at the heart of the buy-out. 'I got criticised for selling
my shares, and now I'm getting criticised for trying to buy them. So I'm
stuck in the middle with 205m shares. What the bloody hell am I allowed to
do? You ask me why I want to do the buy-out. One of the major reasons is to
be able to realise my investment one day. OK?'
There is a seeming paradox here. At the offer price of 30p a share, his
one-third holding in the company is worth Pounds 62m. The remaining two
thirds will cost Pounds 113m. Thus, to realise Pounds 62m of assets the
debt-averse Mr Sugar is borrowing Pounds 93m and paying another Pounds 20m
of his own cash on top. But the paradox is easily resolved. More than half
the borrowing will be from Amstrad itself. The rest will be repaid next
summer, presumably through the partial liquidation of the business if
necessary.
This is the answer to shareholders who suspect that Mr Sugar has some grand
plan up his sleeve. When he goes private, he says, he will do little
different from now. 'Except, if I want to, one day I can close the company
down, liquidate it in a nice orderly fashion and put the money in the bank.
Or perhaps I can find someone to buy it off me in a couple of years' time -
not try to pass it on and make a quick buck, as people are accusing me of
now.'
The accusation plainly rankles. 'If the shareholders were to turn me down,
one has to take it quite bluntly that they think I've been lying to them.
I've told them it's best for them to get out. If they don't believe me, it's
because they think I'm trying to trick them. That's the most hurtful thing
at the moment.'
But if it did happen? 'I would have to protect my investment. I've said I
would sell today at 31p so long as someone offered all the shareholders the
same deal. If they turned me down, I'm not saying I would do the same in the
future.
'Suppose someone came along and offered me 30p for all my shares. It's
obvious that these people don't want 30p, so I might take it and go. No one
will ever tie me down to anything. At the moment, the shareholders come
first in my mind. They don't believe it, but they do. If the offer is turned
down, I come first.'
Since Amstrad is Mr Sugar, the idea of someone offering him 30p a share for
the company on its own seems unlikely. There is also rather an ugly air of
threat about the whole argument. But Mr Sugar's contention is only that he
is an honest man. Probably not even he would insist that he is a nice one as
well.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Racal and Chubb double dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Ernest Harrison yesterday demonstrated the value to shareholders of
breaking up large conglomerate businesses when he reported the first
separate interim profits from Racal Electronics and Chubb Security, which
demerged from the communications group in October.
After profit rises broadly in line with expectations, Sir Ernest, chairman
of both companies, announced a doubling of the combined interim dividend.
Racal shareholders, who were distributed Chubb shares at no cost, have
already seen the combined share price of Racal and Chubb rise from 58p ahead
of demerger to a price equivalent to 76p.
The demerger follows the demerger and flotation of Vodafone, the cellular
radio network operator, now capitalised at Pounds 4bn. It tended to obscure
the value of Racal's other businesses.
Yesterday Racal Electronics reported pre-tax profits in the six months to
October 9 of Pounds 23.1m, up from losses of Pounds 2.4m, and an interim
dividend of 1.5p.
Racal Chubb reported profits of Pounds 26.9m, up 92 per cent from the
pro-forma result for the same period last year. Chubb will also pay a 1.5p
interim dividend. Last year shareholders received one interim dividend
equivalent to 1.5p before share consolidation.
Both the demerger and flotation of Vodafone two years ago and the demerger
of Chubb emerged after bids or the threat of a bid. Sir Ernest argued that
Racal's value had not been adequately reflected in its market
capitalisation.
Mr David Elsbury, Racal chief executive, said the group was still on target
to achieve a 5 per cent return on sales for the year ending March 1994. At
this half-year, margins were below 2 per cent on sales that accounted for 38
per cent of group sales.
However, suspicion that these margin improvements are unlikely to continue
helped knock 17p - 10 per cent - off the Racal share price.
Mr Elsbury also announced the first commercial application of its Government
Data Network technology which is used to link 37 government departments.
The group has won a contract to supply a UK-wide service to Exel Logistics,
the Bedfordshire-based distribution and storage group.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Council tax appeal costs likely to outweigh benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT property val-uations for householders who wish to appeal against
council tax bandings are likely to cost more than the probable benefits of a
successful challenge, it emerged yesterday.
The government is budgeting for about a million such appeals, Mr Michael
Howard, the environment secretary, said.
Organisations of professional valuers expect a wave of valuation work once
people see how their homes have been placed in the eight property bands on
which the tax is based.
Although an independent valuation will not be obligatory for an appeal to be
made, professional valuers say that since the disputed figures will by then
be two years old, it will be difficult for a private individual to make a
sensible assessment. The structure of the tax, which limits the range of
bills set by any council, means that in the short-term for many people it
will not be worth incurring the costs of an appeal.
Estimates of costs ranged from about Pounds 50 for an initial check, to
around Pounds 150 for a more detailed assessment. The Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said that in the few cases which would require
representation at a formal valuation tribunal hearing, the bill could be
'several hundreds of pounds'.
The individual bandings have just become available to local authorities. The
prospect of independent valuations was raised by Mr Howard, who said people
were 'perfectly entitled' to get a valuation done on which to base an
appeal. The government had budgeted for about a million appeals, he said on
BBC radio.
No appeal can be made until April, and most councils said there was no
immediate stampede from people anxious to find out their banding.
The Tory-controlled Association of District Councils pointed out that,
taking transitional relief into account, the advantage of moving from one
band into the one immediately below would be only 25p a week for the first
year. An analysis by the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities
showed significant amounts at stake in the higher property bands in the
capital.
It estimated, for example, that a property in the top band in Greenwich
would pay Pounds 1,322 next year, while one in the band below would pay
Pounds 218 less.
During question time at the Commons, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy
leader, predicted that the 'chaos and injustice of the poll tax is likely to
be surpassed by the chaos and injustice of the council tax'.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Brussels shelves measures to harmonise drug prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to harmonise European Community drug prices have been shelved by
the European Commission.
Although such measures were desirable, they were not possible at present,
Sir Leon Brittan, Commission vice-president responsible for competition,
said yesterday. He suggested that subsidiarity, the principle of allowing
decision making at the lowest possible level, influenced the Commission's
decision.
The immediate effect of the decision is likely to be an increase in the
level of parallel imports - shipments of identical drugs from lower price
countries, outside manufacturers' official distribution channels. This would
work to the advantage, for example, of drugs wholesalers and big customers
such as the National Health Service.
Pharmaceuticals companies had feared harmonisation would force prices down
to the lowest levels in any EC country, hitting profits in what is intended
soon to be the world's largest unified market. Governments, however, had
been concerned that prices might be harmonised upwards, stretching already
limited healthcare budgets.
Sir Leon said drug prices in countries such as Portugal, France, Spain and
Greece were often half those for products in Denmark, Germany and the
Netherlands.
'With such disparate forms of pricing regulation, markets remain resolutely
national, and consumers are not able to reap the benefits of a free market.
Thus the present situation runs counter to the most basic objectives of the
Treaty of Rome,' he said.
Sir Leon said the Commission would now consider the best way to encourage
price harmonisation through an evolutionary process. There was a strong case
for abandoning all direct price control. Such controls were an ineffective
means of controlling healthcare expenditure because they did not limit the
volume of drugs prescribed by doctors.
The Commission, he said, was likely to recommend measures to prevent
national price-setting bodies favouring domestically manufactured products.
A much-delayed document on the means national governments use to set drug
prices is expected to be published before the end of the year.
Increased use of parallel imports was one means of encouraging competition,
Sir Leon said. Parallel trade presently represented only 2 per cent of EC
prescription drug sales. Sir Leon also stressed the need to substitute
branded drugs with cheaper unpatented generic products which he said was
common practice in the US.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Pension scheme attacks compensation proposal: Electricity
fund threatens to quit trade body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's second biggest pension fund, the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme,
has threatened to resign from the National Association of Pension Funds.
The fund vigorously disapproves of the trade association's support for a
compulsory compensation scheme for occupational pension funds.
In a strongly worded letter to NAPF, Mr Mike Cannan, chief executive of the
electricity scheme, said: 'There is widespread dismay that the NAPF would
appear to have problems in identifying whose interests it should be
representing. This issue has, in our view, greatly undermined the standing
of the NAPF.'
Mr Cannan said that, if the proposals were not withdrawn, the association's
council should propose a motion of confidence at the next annual general
meeting to prove its support among the membership. The 25-strong council is
elected from the membership of the association, a voluntary body which
represents the UK pensions industry.
The dispute follows the establishment of the government's Pension Law Review
Committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, after frauds committed by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell came to light. The Goode committee sent out a
questionnaire in September with 81 detailed questions for the pensions
industry, and invited responses by December 15. The association prepared its
own response, and sent it to members to gauge their reactions.
It is the association's proposal for a compulsory compensation scheme which
has angered the electricity fund, which has Pounds 10bn in assets and covers
employees of the power generation and distribution industry.
The association wants the pensions industry to pay compensation to fund
members however a shortfall in an individual pension fund occurred.
In his letter, Mr Cannan argued: 'To propound a view that the compensation
scheme should meet a shortfall in pension benefits irrespective of the
reason for that shortfall, and for the cost of any shortfall to be met by
levies on occupational schemes is fundamentally flawed from an
employer/trustee viewpoint.'
The electricity scheme wants any pension compensation scheme to be funded by
a combination of professional indemnity insurance, the existing Investors'
Compensation Scheme (run under the Financial Services Act) and the
government. The liability of occupational pension schemes would be strictly
limited.
Mr Mike Brown, director of information services at the association, said it
was considering members' responses. 'There is a lot of support for the view
that there should be a compensation scheme, but some members do not want to
go as far as the council,' he said.

FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all the new faces and upright accounting policies, Trafalgar House has
yet to demonstrate a really fresh approach. The Pounds 138m property
write-down in yesterday's full year figures looks like the sweep of a new
broom but, judging by the standards of other property developers, there
could be more to come. That Trafalgar ended the year only a shade above the
minimum net worth specified by its loan covenants simply adds to the
suspicion that it could have gone further.
With the earnings figure so muddied, the market might prefer to look at cash
flow. Trafalgar sees a balanced cash position this year at an operating
level. Equally there seems little scope for paying down debt without
disposals. Selling the mid-market cruise ships and the smaller London hotels
will help but that will only make a small dent in net debt over Pounds 450m
once guarantees to associated companies are included. The Ritz may prove
more of a problem. Trafalgar can comfortably fund capital expenditure in
engineering and its existing property commitments, but there seems little
hope of it finding the extra funds needed to develop its commercial property
assets.
As the company indicated yesterday, joint ventures could be the solution.
One can only trust Hongkong Land not to take advantage of its privileged
position to cherry-pick the best of these assets. But since Trafalgar has
cut the final dividend and left the way open for another reduction next
year, Hongkong Land's option to buy more stock at 85p is the only convincing
prop for the shares.

FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: MEPC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's second largest property company yesterday oozed caution after its
24 per cent pre-tax profits fall. Given that property is one of the lagging
sectors of the economy, MEPC suggested any recovery might be deferred until
at least late 1993. That looks at odds with the 54 per cent surge in its
share price since Black Wednesday.
The conventional explanation is that falling interest rates mean many
property companies now yield more than cash, so investors are prepared to
return to the better-managed stocks. Although MEPC sailed into the recession
with a dangerously over-extended portfolio, its management has steered away
from the shoals. Its development programme is now complete. It is raising
useful funds from asset disposals - witness yesterday's Finsbury Circus sale
 -and aggressive progress has been made on lettings. It would, however, be
dangerous to get carried away. Gearing has risen to 82 per cent and profits
were flattered by capitalised interest of Pounds 31m. That practice may soon
have to end. At 1.2 times, dividend cover looks tight.
MEPC hopes that property company shares will again become a safe haven for
those desiring exposure to bricks and mortar and argues that investors will
do better with shares than with real estate. But that would have its
downside too. If fund managers switched to buying property companies on that
basis, who would end up buying their developed sites?

FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If one judges Allied-Lyons simply by how it is surviving the recession, then
the company deserves some praise. To hold interim retailing profits
unchanged while reducing the number of tied outlets by 500 is good going. So
is the slight increase in brewing profits that appears after stripping out
an extra Pounds 4m in bad debt provisions. With a 1,200 staff reduction in
spirits and wine and the benefits of the Carlsberg venture yet to come, it
is tempting to assume that only weak demand is holding the company back.
Sadly, though, the truth may be more complicated. Allied says the beer price
has stabilised, but free trade supply agreements, which make up a rising
proportion of its total sales of beer, come at lower margins than sales to
its tied estate. Even after recovery starts, brewing's main hopes may be in
cutting costs. And it remains uncertain how food manufacturing - a
particularly weak performer - will fare.
Besides, recovery would benefit competitors, too, while Allied's Pounds 2bn
debt could prove a handicap. True the Carlsberg venture will shortly reduced
this by Pounds 135m, but the Chateau Latour disposal is proving slow to
materialise and it will take Allied a while to trade its way into a position
where gearing is less of a constraint. Until then its wine and spirits
division must carefully pick and choose the acquisitions, on which the
business heavily depends for growth. A large one would require a rights
issue - something that will doubtless keep the shares in check.

<TEXT>
The balloons and ticker tape which have greeted the better US economic news
of the last week may just be a little premature. True, the National
Association of Purchasing Managers' survey for November showed a distinct
improvement to 55 per cent yesterday and confidence is certainly up since
the election. But the revised figure of 3.9 per cent economic growth in the
third quarter owes much to rises in inventories, which have see-sawed
erratically over the past year. Equally, the change in sentiment greeting Mr
Clinton may not spark a charisma-led recovery any more than Mr Major's
triumph did in the UK.
Much of this year's fits-and-starts recovery has come from investment and
exports, while consumer spending has swung unpredictably. In part that may
be because savings are still low, so small bursts of additional spending are
the most that consumers can manage. That pattern is unlikely to change much
while unemployment continues to rise and, unfortunately, there is no real
sign that companies are hiring more staff. Indeed, the sharp rise in
information technology investment suggests they are finally reaping the
benefits of office automation.
While efficiency gains may help company earnings, economic growth may be
limited to 2 per cent in 1993, with the mooted fiscal boost from the
incoming administration adding another 0.5 per cent. Such an expansion would
be barely enough to maintain employment around current levels. Those looking
for straws in the wind might be encouraged that smaller companies are at
last reporting easier credit conditions. That may just provide an engine for
employment later next year.

Does Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary, really enjoy splitting hairs
with his EC partners at taxpayers' expense?
After chairing yesterday's meeting of EC interior ministers in London,
Clarke confessed, rather surprisingly, to an inexplicable relish for the
sort of fruitless debate which characterises many such gatherings.
Yesterday's discussion was on the far from frivolous subject of how to
combat drug-trafficking in the EC. But agreement on a co-ordinated policy
was stalled by a good old-fashioned ministerial dispute over where a
European drugs agency should be located. France, the Netherlands and Italy
are all rooting for their own favourite.
For once the UK was not being difficult and was prepared to go along with
any of those suggestions. But compromise was not possible. Instead, the
ministers passed the morning in the sort of discussion 'which would have
done justice to medieval schoolmen, dancing round the edge of hair-splitting
arguments on semantic issues,' says Clarke.

Still on the subject of PR, what are we to make of the latest bit of
house-cleaning by the Public Relations Consultants Association?
It has finally got round to blackballing the management buy-out remains of
Charles Barker and Georgeson - four months after the parent Corporate
Communications went into receivership - leaving its principal directors in
business and its past creditors substantially out of pocket. The PRCA says
that while former board members remain with the two companies, neither will
be considered as members. The Institute of Public Relations, the other
professional body, is still deciding on its response.
Martin Langford, the PRCA chairman, denies that the action was simply
designed to prop up the industry image and says there can be no further
action unless and until the DTI rules on the role of the directors in the
receivership.
Even so it looks like a toothless PR gimmick.

Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' former campaign director, is terrific at
public relations, and Burson-Marsteller is the world's biggest PR firm. But
becoming a full-time flack, albeit with a seat on the board, is hardly a
noble cause.
Wilson says that if he were just joining Burson to make serious money, he
would have done so long ago. It is hard to believe that a man who has done
everything from establishing Shelter to chairing Friends of the Earth and
campaigning very successfully for lead-free petrol, has run out of campaign
ideas.
But he insists that he has, and would have stopped two years ago if Paddy
Ashdown had not twisted his arm to take the unpaid job of running the
Liberal Democrat election campaign.
Wilson, 51, is said to have one of the biggest egos in the business, which
is not always an asset in the PR game. Indeed, some Liberal Democrat MPs
were livid that he crowded them out of the TV studios during the election.
However, even his critics admit that he is good at setting strategy and his
experience in mobilising grassroots opinion is second to none. And lest
anybody accuse him of selling his birthright for a mess of pottage, Wilson's
contract covers his concern that his contribution at Burson should be
consistent with his 'post-campaigning activities and publicly-stated views'.

However, with Simpson's increased responsibilities at BAe, and the

Her Majesty's offer to pay income tax has had some unexpected knock-on
effects in the outer reaches of her realm. Australia's governor-general Bill
Hayden and his six state governors, for instance, are finding to their
horror they may have to follow her example.
Hayden, who takes home ADollars 95,000 a year, has the use of mansions in
Canberra and Sydney, a fleet of limos, and gets to fly in the government's
VIP aircraft. These are perks which would normally be taxed under
Australia's loathsome fringe benefits tax. But compared with the cost of
running the Queen, Hayden's annual bill of ADollars 8m makes him a bargain.
Oddly, it is the conservatives who want him to pay up. Labor MPs have been
pointing out that there would be little point in taxing Hayden because he
would have to be paid more to compensate.
But there might be some interesting arguments about liability for fringe
benefits tax. The tax is normally paid by employers. But Hayden is
technically the government's employer, which might make him personally
liable for taxation on all those houses, aircraft and cars. Alternatively,
he might argue that the Queen should pay because she employs him to
represent her.
Either way, it looks like further ammunition for Australia's republicans.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Chambers of commerce missed an opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P J KENNEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Mr D P Roberts' letter 'New role of chambers of commerce'
(November 24). I am always rather amused when organisations that extol the
virtues of free enterprise suggest protectionism when it comes to their own
organisation.
Compulsory registration is an absurd suggestion. Indeed, such a suggestion
calls into question the credibility of the chambers of commerce.
The solution is simple; they must offer and effectively market services that
others want, and have the vision to grasp opportunities that various
government departments create from time to time.
I have no doubt that if chambers of commerce had been more dynamic and
forward thinking instead of lethargic and backward-looking then they could
have been doing the job of the training and enterprise councils. The
chambers of commerce were ideally placed but failed to exploit the
opportunity that was theirs for the taking.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Higher taxes are not a vote loser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES DICKENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Lonely ride into sunset' (November 27), Joe Rogaly claims that
proposals to raise income tax to finance improvements to welfare benefits
are a 'proven vote-loser'. This is not so. Despite the serious
misrepresentation in the Tory tabloids, Labour and the Liberal Democrats
received a clear majority of the votes cast - 53 per cent - for precisely
this proposition at the last general election. These voting intentions were
not translated into a parliamentary majority because the opposition parties
are split. Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system therefore produced
a minority Tory government with only 43 per cent of the vote.
It is a complete misreading of the election result to claim that parties of
the left and centre-left should abandon the case for higher direct taxation
of the wealthy.
Mr Rogaly also quotes from Professor Galbraith's recent lecture in London.
But he curiously omits any reference to Galbraith's declaration that Labour
must not abandon its commitment to income re-distribution: 'A firm stand for
a more equitable sharing of income must be strongly a part of our platform.'
I would, however, agree with Joe Rogaly that tax policies should, in future,
also cover environmental protection and road financing. However, these new
taxes should be in addition to, and not a substitute for, a much more
progressive income tax on the higher paid.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Real competition would save coal from being
marginalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ROST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles ('Coal on his Christmas list', November 30) quotes our
evidence to the trade and industry select committee: 'What we need is price
decreases, not price increases.' The threat to ICI's chlorine production is
evidence enough.
But why do we assume that saving UK coal by increasing its share of the
energy market would raise prices to consumers or cost taxpayers?
Sufficient evidence is available confirming that coal, under private-sector
management, could not only under-price the 'dash for gas' but compete with
imports. If coal had been privatised before electricity, no fix would now be
required. The industry should be offered for sale immediately, with a
transitional government 'dowry' while productivity is improved further.
Second, the electricity market should be liberalised, not stitched up even
further. Overcapacity, as in any other market, should be reflected by
downward pressure on prices. In a genuine competitive market, only the
lowest cost power would sell. The economics of gas versus coal would then be
subjected to the market test.
Deferring the extension of the contract market below 1MW from the 1994
timetable would be unacceptable. Large multiple site users such as
retailers, banks, hotels, and local authorities - organisations with many
sites each below 1MW but, in total, large electricity consumers - look
forward to shopping around.
The solution of Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is to
establish the genuine competition in coal, gas, nuclear and electricity,
which government promised but has so far failed to provide. Energy policy
would then not be 'in a mess', our coal would not have become marginalised
and prices to consumers would be lower.

<TEXT>
Sir, Last Tuesday I travelled on the 17.50 from Paddington to Oxford in one
of the new-style Network SouthEast trains. There was no smoking compartment.
On enquiry I was told that this was 'the new policy'. Since when, may I ask?
Affecting which services? Arrived at by what process of reasoning or
consultation? I can find nothing about it in the Citizen's Charter, nor is
it the way to woo traffic back from road to rail. I am a smoker, sir, and do
not wish to be reformed by stealth, certainly not by BR who call me
'customer' to my face but decide behind my back what I should not have. What
a relief it was to return to the squalor of the old smoking carriages (ca.
1948) plying between Charing Cross and Ashford, Kent, where the beer cans
gently roll as the train sways from side to side, and cigarette butts float
in the dregs.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Foreign Affairs: The force of history - The Palestinians
face a familiar dilemma in peace talks with Israel which resume on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When one says that 'ethnic cleansing' must not be allowed to succeed in
Bosnia-Hercegovina because of the precedent that would set for other parts
of Europe, the argument may sound far-fetched. Will Slovaks or Romanians or
Azerbaijanis really pause, in the heat of their own bitter ethnic conflicts,
to ask whether the Serbs got away with it?
I believe the answer is yes. 'Ethnic cleansing' is apparently a new phrase,
coined either by Serbs or about them to describe their policy of expelling
non-Serbs from areas they are determined to control. But it is not a new
phenomenon. And it does not consist of purely spontaneous outbursts of fear
and hatred. It is a systematic procedure, requiring a deal of organisation,
which needs to be planned by strategic thinkers. We may find their thought
perverted but it is not unsophisticated; and it certainly involves a
calculation about the relative strengths of various forces, the attitudes of
great powers, and the likelihood of their intervention.
That view is supported by a recently published book, Expulsion of the
Palestinians: the Concept of Transfer in Zionist Political Thought,
1882-1948 (Institute for Palestine Studies, Dollars 11.95). The author, Nur
Masalha, is an Israeli Arab and a graduate of the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. He shows, using documents from the Israeli archives, that the
flight of the Arab population from what became Israel in 1948 - which
Israel's first president Chaim Weizmann hailed as 'a miraculous clearing of
the land' - was in fact 'less of a miracle than the culmination of over a
half century of effort, plans, and (in the end) brute force'.
What is particularly interesting is that in discussions among themselves
Zionist leaders repeatedly cited the precedent of the exchange of
populations between Greece and Turkey which followed Ataturk's defeat of the
Greek invasion of Anatolia in 1922. Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the founder
of 'revisionist' or more extreme Zionism and mentor of Menachem Begin,
alluded to this 'transfer' in several articles during the 1920s and 1930s.
He described it as a brutal, coercive action, imposed by the victorious
Turks yet ultimately beneficial to the Greeks as well (since it made both
states ethnically homogeneous). David Ben-Gurion, the leader of the
mainstream Zionists and later Israel's first prime minister, replied in 1936
that the precedent was not applicable to Palestine because 'we (the Jews)
are not a state and Britain will not do it for us'.
'The possibility of a large-scale transfer of a population by force was
demonstrated,' Ben-Gurion admitted in 1941, 'when the Greeks and the Turks
were transferred.' But this had been the result of a crushing Turkish
military victory. One could not assume that a victorious Britain would take
'the responsibility of forcibly transferring the Arabs of the land of Israel
merely for the benefit of the Jewish people'. Only in 1948, when Israel
became a state and was in the process of defeating the Arabs, did Ben-Gurion
come to see the Turkish-Greek precedent as fully applicable.
It may seem tasteless to drag this up now, when Israelis (among others) are
disturbed by signs of resurgent anti-Semitism in Germany, and when Israel,
under a new moderate government, is trying to negotiate peace with its Arab
enemies, including the Palestinians. But I am not seeking to establish any
'moral equivalence' between Serbia and Israel, or between Ben-Gurion and
Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia. Whatever the Jews did in Palestine
has to be seen in the context of what was done to the Jews in Europe, though
why Palestinian Arabs should pay for crimes committed by Germans and other
Europeans is something neither the Palestinians nor I have ever understood.
Even the Palestinians now accept that the events of 1948 cannot be undone,
and that the land occupied by the Jews in that war has become, irrevocably,
the state of Israel. But that history has to be borne in mind when one
considers the current peace talks, which are to resume in Washington next
Monday.
The Israeli Labour party, which returned to power in elections last June, is
historically the party of Ben-Gurion. Its present leader and now prime
minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was a military commander in the war of 1948 and
played a personal role in the expulsion of Arabs, as he has recounted in the
Hebrew edition of his memoirs. He was also minister of defence, responsible
for public order in the occupied territories, when the Palestinian uprising
(intifada) broke out in December 1988. It was Rabin who gave the notorious
order to Israeli soldiers to break the bones of demonstrators as a method of
riot control. It was in large part thanks to this tough reputation that he
won this year's election, since floating voters could feel confident that he
would take no chances with Israel's security.
Mr Rabin is tough, but he is also intelligent and pragmatic, not dedicated
ideologically to holding all of biblical Israel as was his predecessor,
Yitzhak Shamir. He seems sincerely convinced that Israel can now achieve
security through peace rather than war. His strategy, however, is not to
seek a direct reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. Rather it is
to reach an accommodation with Arab states, leaving the Palestinians no
option but to accept what they are offered.
That is suggested by the fact that he has kept on the hardline negotiator
with the Palestinians, Elyakim Rubinstein, appointed by his predecessor,
while putting in a new and more flexible negotiator, Itamar Rabinovich, to
conduct the talks with Syria (and now to be ambassador in the US as well).
Mr Rabin has brushed aside as unacceptable the Palestinian proposals for a
'Palestinian interim self-governing authority' (PISGA), calling them 'a
blueprint for a state'.
In the past few months the Israeli-Palestinian talks have focused, mainly in
'informal discussion groups', on two documents outlining Israel's ideas for
'interim self-governing arrangements' (ISGA). And the further they have gone
into these arrangements, the more restrictive the Palestinian negotiators
have found them.
The Israeli settlements and the land cordoned off by Israel for security
reasons (comprising between them about 30 per cent of the West Bank), as
well as the whole of East Jerusalem, would be completely outside the scope
of the ISGA. Even in the remainder of the territories Israel would retain
some say in almost every sphere of administration, through a complex network
of 'liaison committees'.
Nabil Shaath, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, has described this
arrangement as 'Swiss-cheese Bantustanisation', implying that the areas of
limited Palestinian authority would be like the holes in the cheese.
Although it would be formally only an interim arrangement, leaving the final
settlement still to be negotiated, the Palestinian negotiators inevitably
fear that by accepting it they would lose the status of occupied territories
in international law, and allow Israel's occupation of the areas excluded
from ISGA to become accepted as irreversible, just as the 1948 conquests
have been. Such a deal would be hard to sell to an increasingly
discenchanted public opinion within the territories.
Yet if they refuse, the Palestinians risk being blamed for the failure of
the talks and left with nothing at all. It is a painfully familiar dilemma,
from which only the active involvement of the US might save them - something
they could perhaps have expected from a re-elected Bush administration, but
which is unlikely to be so high on Mr Bill Clinton's list of priorities.

<TEXT>
Sir, Tales of the treatment of the taxpayer by Customs and Excise are
becoming legendary. The following is a case which we feel quite exceptional.
A client company had only one director. Unfortunately the director, although
only young, died of a sudden illness. At the time of death he was not in
default with Customs and Excise. When we received the various papers to
finalise the company's affairs some time afterwards, we also received a
notice of assessment and surcharge. We wrote asking that this be suspended
until the executors were in a position to deal with the situation.
Subsequently we dealt with the final return and deregistration.
We have now received a further surcharge notice in the sum of Pounds 52.31.
After telephoning and reiterating the facts, we have been informed that we
must appeal in writing. What does constitute reasonable excuse? Death, it
would appear, does not qualify.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Taming the overmighty boss: The Cadbury report hopes to
makes UK companies better run, but will it make them more profitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching the members of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance file
into their press conference yesterday - all men, all middle aged, all
wearing grey suits - it was easy to understand the air of mild
disappointment that greeted their first conclusions, six months ago.
Worthy enough stuff, no doubt, said the world - but how much good would it
do in practice? Where was the magic bullet that would rid the world of
future Robert Maxwells? And wouldn't the specific proposals the committee
had in mind lead to the creation of two types of directors - 'the doers and
the checkers', as Peter Morgan of the Institute of Directors put it?
The committee has reacted to these specific criticisms by watering down some
of its proposals. On the face of it, that might lead you to expect the final
draft to be more disappointing than the earlier one.
Reading the report, however, gives rise to a rather different impression,
somewhat at odds with the committee's air of cautious incrementalism. The
proposals could well mark a watershed in the relationship between the boards
that supervise the activities of UK quoted companies and the managers who
run them day to day.
Companies that comply fully with the spirit of the Cadbury report will find
themselves establishing a markedly more structured, formal role for the
board. For the very largest companies, this may not come as a great
surprise; for the typical mid-sized UK company, the change will be much more
noticeable.
Suppose that, a few years hence, you are just about to join the board of
MidCo plc, as a non-executive director. This entirely ordinary mid-sized
company has embraced the Cadbury principles fully. You have thus been chosen
not because you bumped into the chairman on the golf course, but through a
selection procedure dominated by existing non-executive directors.
At your first meeting, you are given a list of subjects reserved for a
formal decision of the full board. The list includes any acquisitions or
divestitures material to the company, along with investments, capital
projects, treasury policies and risk management policies. This should mean
that before the bright young man the corporate treasurer hired from
Megabank's dealing room commits the company's entire net worth to a short
position in the Omani riyal, you'll hear about the procedures in place to
stop him - and get a chance to decide if they're strong enough.
Because you're an independent director - you have no involvement with the
company except your fees - you are rapidly pressed into service on the audit
committee. That means choosing the auditors, supervising the audit process,
keeping an eye on internal controls, and getting a once-a-year private
meeting with the auditors at which you and your fellow non-executives all
eye each other nervously. Eventually, though, it becomes clear that the
eager new audit partner - just rotated into the task, in line with Cadbury -
isn't going to accuse the management of looting the company, and you all
breathe a sigh of relief.
Times have been hard for MidCo, and you've had your doubts about next year's
cash flow. That means that the last few weeks before the annual report is
signed off are rather nerve-wracking. You must satisfy yourself that the
business will still be afloat at the end of the new financial year, and then
put your name to a statement to that effect which the auditors will comment
on. Eventually, after a lot of agonising, the board agrees on an unqualified
'going concern' statement, and the auditors concur - but you decide to keep
a closer eye on cash flow in future.
When it comes to approving the words that accompany the annual results, you
manage to make your first small impact on the company. The narrative
presented by the executives rather glosses over that nasty business when the
widget subsidiary lost a bundle on a Nigerian export contract. Picking up
your battered copy of the Cadbury report you read the following sentence
into the board minutes. 'Balance requires that setbacks should be dealt with
as well as successes,' you quote - and the next draft of the narrative comes
a bit cleaner on just what went wrong.
Each of these changes is a small one, and some of them reflect policies that
are already being carried out on the best boards. But as a whole, and taken
together with recent changes in accounting standards and the growing mood of
interventionism among institutional investors, they add up to a significant
strengthening of the board's formal role.
This strengthening will take place even though the final Cadbury report
makes some concessions to critics who accused it of going too far. Both
versions of the report say that, in principle, it is a good thing to
separate the jobs of chairman and chief executive. The two versions differ,
however, on what should happen if the jobs are combined. The draft called
for a senior non-executive director to play a formal role in representing
shareholders' interests; that has become noticeably weaker in the final
report.
The suggestion in the draft that the chairmen of the audit and remuneration
committees should speak as of right at a company's AGM has also been watered
down; it is now up to the chairman to pass them relevant questions.
And the final report stresses the shared obligations of both executive and
non-executive directors, to head off criticisms that the draft went too far
to create two classes of directors - 'the goodies and the baddies', as one
company chairman called them.
Now that the final report is published, two big questions remain: will its
recommendations actually get put into effect, in the spirit as well as the
letter? And if they do, will it make any difference?
On the first question, opinion is divided. Sir Adrian Cadbury believes that
the existence of the new checklist of procedures and policies will give
ammunition to shareholders and board members. The requirement, to be imposed
by the London Stock Exchange, that companies state in their annual reports
which bits of the Cadbury code they apply, and which ones they don't - and
to explain the omissions - will act, Sir Adrian says, as an effective stick.
Others are less optimistic. 'When I've talked around among captains of
industry,' said one well-connected critic, 'they all say 'we're doing it
already' or 'it doesn't make much difference anyway'.' That means, he said,
that the code might only be given lip-service. The good boards will continue
to put shareholders' interests first; the bad boards will let strong-minded
chief executives go off on the rampage.
Another influential financial figure, who has had personal experience of
trying to restrain a dominant chief executive, was more sanguine. Cadbury
rules would have made it easier to mobilise the board to act as an effective
check on the management, he said; it was the absence of strong
non-executives which had created much of the problem.
But where are the strong non-executives to play the new, more onerous role?
Significantly, one member of the Cadbury committee has recently turned down
an offered board position, because he felt the company's management style
might give it problems in complying with the spirit of the new code. Yet
such boards are precisely the ones that need strong non-executives. Sir
Adrian talked rather hopefully yesterday about non-executives from among the
divisional managers of large companies; and perhaps from public service and
the universities. Still, the non-executive gap may not be easy to fill.
Even if the gaps are filled and the procedures in place, will this add a
single penny to the earnings of UK quoted companies? 'Yes, absolutely,' said
Sir Adrian yesterday, quoting the benefits of tighter internal controls for
improving efficiency. One of his supporters among the corporate community
talked, perhaps more realistically, about the way in which the report would
lessen the downside, rather than increase the upside. 'It is more a set of
safety nets to protect a company from disaster, rather than something that
would enhance performance,' he said.
But even this view was regarded as optimistic by Sir Owen Green, chairman of
BTR. 'I don't think it will change the number of failed or failing
companies,' he said.
One committee member supplied his own criteria by which to judge the success
of the venture. 'Does this report pass the 'M' Test?' he said yesterday.
'Would it have stopped Robert Maxwell? No.' But, he said, that was not
really the right question to ask: Maxwell-proofing the UK probably required
such a high level of oversight and scrutiny that the financial system would
have buckled under the strain.
A more relevant question, he said, is: 'Does it pass the 'L' Test?' - would
it have brought Lonrho more into line with accepted norms of corporate
governance. Judged by that test, he said, the report would probably pass.
Lonrho is an unusually vivid example of a not-so-unusual phenomenon: it is
dominated by a powerful chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who has presided
over successes as well as recent setbacks.
In the end, however, shareholders will care little whether such
larger-than-life characters become rarer. Their concern will be whether the
average British company will be more consistently profitable. It is hard to
judge; just as it is hard to say whether the current interest in proper
procedures, good governance and involvement by institutional shareholders
will outlast the memory of the excesses of the 1980s. At the moment, the
shortage of takeover bids means that institutions feel trapped in
underperforming UK companies, and can only raise share prices by improving
the companies' management. This enthusiasm for involvement in companies'
affairs may last no longer than the recession.
The real verdict on whether Cadbury will improve the performance of UK
industry will therefore come in the upswing. If boards, by then bristling
with powerful, newly confident non-executive directors, can avoid even a
10th of the mistakes that companies made in the 1980s, shareholders and the
public will have reason to thank Sir Adrian and his team. And even if, when
the time comes, the Cadbury recommendations fail to pass that test, they
will certainly change the way many boards run in the meantime.
KEY POINTS OF CADBURY REPORT
Companies to say whether they comply with Cadbury code, and if not why not
Division of responsibilities at head of company
Strong non-executive directors, most truly independent
Key matters reserved for full board decision
Audit committee composed solely of non-executives to scrutinise figures and
appoint auditors
Board to monitor company's internal controls
Directors to say publicly each year that company is a going concern, with
qualifications if necessary
Auditors to report on 'going concerns' statement
Legislation needed to limit directors' contracts, strenghthen internal
controls, let auditors blow whistle on possible fraud

FT  02 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Cadbury's code
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS appropriate that the final version of the Cadbury report on the
financial aspects of corporate governance should have been published on the
same day as Trafalgar House disclosed that its after-tax results for 1990-91
had been rearranged to show a loss of Pounds 99.4m instead of the originally
claimed profit of Pounds 44.9m, while receivers were appointed to Rosehaugh,
famous exploiter of murky off-balance sheet financing.
In important areas of accounting and reporting the sins of the past are
being exposed and the impetus of self-regulation is being restored. The
emphasis of the Cadbury report is that these advances should be consolidated
by establishing a more formalised and consistent board structure embracing
chairman, executive and non-executive directors.
Since the first draft was published last May the recommendations on
non-executives have been refined: there must be a minimum of three such
directors, a majority of them independent.
Companies must state whether they have applied the Code of Best Practice,
and justify any departures from it. But the available sanctions are scant;
in practice, any shortcomings in governance will be corrected by a company's
shareholders or not at all.
The determination of institutional shareholders to enforce the code may
therefore decide the ultimate success of this approach. The whole emphasis
on non-executive directors largely reflects the unwillingness of fund
managers to take a direct proprietorial role. One doubt is whether enough
non-executives 'of calibre' can be found. Another is whether they will be
backed in practice by the institutions: the latter are now recommended to
disclose their policies on the use of voting rights, but this does not go
far enough.
The ability of entrepreneurs to flourish in such an environment must also be
questionable. Many of them look to a board for loyal support and
encouragement rather than for criticism and policing. However, at least the
Cadbury approach allows for more flexibility in such cases than would a
statutory definition of roles.
The Cadbury committee's code marks an important advance in that it will
force directors to think clearly about their roles and responsibilities.
Whether in the long run it will adequately fill the proprietorial gap which
has resulted from the growth of impersonal institutional share ownership is
more doubtful.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Personal View: Life's rich rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When people think about the UK social security system, they think of a
more-or-less efficient 'Robin Hood' device for moving money from rich to
poor. Yet that is not the only or even the main effect of social security.
Today's 50th anniversary of the Beveridge Report on 'Social insurance and
allied services' is a good moment to reflect on the other main effect -
redistribution not between people, but across the same person's life cycle.
For Lord Beveridge the aim was to achieve a 'better distribution of
purchasing power . . . as between times of earning and not earning, and
between times of heavy family responsibilities and light or no family
responsibilities'.
In other words, we all pay into the system through taxes or contributions at
times when we can afford to, but get something out at times when income is
low relative to the rest of our lives.
This 'smoothing out' of the ups and downs of income over the life cycle
happens in two ways. First, through the insurance aspect of social security;
we all pay in, but only some of us suffer unemployment which the insurance
covers. Second, through a savings bank mechanism; we pay in during our
working lives, and receive pensions later.
If the system works well, poverty is reduced across the lifetime - what we
each pay in equals what we each take out. Indeed, Beveridge suggested that
poverty could be eliminated by redistribution within the working class, with
no net transfer from the middle classes.
Given that social security serves both 'Beveridge' and 'Robin Hood' aims,
how can we tell which is more important? Here, there is a problem.
Government surveys tell us how much people pay in tax, and how much they
receive from different kinds of social security. But these surveys are just
a snapshot of a single year. Relatively poor pensioners will be receiving
more from social security than they pay in tax. Relatively well-off people
in work will be paying more in tax. But this gives us little clue as to
whether - looking across complete lifetimes - people pay for their own
benefits or end up as net gainers or losers.
Even if we had a survey following the same individuals since 1900 - which we
do not - we would only get information about the overlay of changing tax and
social security systems through which they had lived. It would not answer
questions about the lifetime effects of today's systems.
To answer such questions the London School of Economics has devised a
computer simulation of the complete life histories of 2,000 men and 2,000
women.
These people live their entire lives under conditions as they were in the UK
in 1985. For instance, the proportion going to university reflects the
proportions of 18 and 19-year-olds who did so in 1985. Wage levels for a
given age and qualifications reflect the range in 1985.
The 4,000 people in our computer simulation are a better educated lot than
the actual 1985 workforce, with 17 per cent having been to university or
polytechnic. They also live to an average age of 75.
But other features of the 4,000 are more alarming. A third divorce and 37
per cent of women become single parents, an important factor in lowering
living standards.
On the basis of family circumstances and incomes in every year of their
lives, we can calculate how much income tax each pays, how much they receive
from child benefit, the state pension, etc. This enables us to tot up
lifetime gains and losses from the welfare state.
The model is still being developed, but the preliminary results are
fascinating. On average, each of the 4,000 receives more than Pounds 60,000
(at 1985 prices) from the social security system over their lifetimes.
Between 55 per cent and 65 per cent of these receipts represent returns to
the same individuals of amounts they themselves have paid for. The exact
proportion depends on benefits assumed to be financed by income tax and
national insurance or from a share of general tax revenues, including VAT.
Less than half of the Pounds 60,000 represents money moved between different
people.
This suggests that the 'savings bank' side of social security is, if
anything, more important than the more commonly discussed Robin Hood aspect.
Should this worry us? Not necessarily. A prime motive for Beveridge's idea
of 'national' insurance was the failure of the market to deliver
cost-effective insurance and pension coverage for all. A particular concern,
for instance, was the door-to-door sale of insurance contracts to poor
families. Under this system, most of the premiums disappeared in selling
costs.
There are good economic reasons why insurance markets may still 'fail'. We
may also think it wrong for people to suffer in old age the consequences of
decisions made when they were younger. 'Life cycle redistribution' is a
rational aim of a state social security system. Beveridge might not
recognise the details of today's system, but he would certainly not allow us
to forget this aim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING MADE a unique and exemplary postwar recovery as a land cleaved in
two, Germany is now navigating a unique and less-than-exemplary passage as a
reunited nation. One feature of this passage has been a spate of attacks on
foreigners, culminating in last week's firebomb murder of a Turkish woman
and two young girls in a north German village. The German people, and their
neighbours, are right to be concerned, not least because the thugs behind
the latest outrage signed off their telephone message to the police with the
words 'Heil Hitler'. Germany has a problem which requires a strategy. This
must extend beyond short-term law-and-order measures into a domain to which
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has thus far refrained from according much attention:
an overall policy which aims both at improving controls on immigration and
achieving genuine integration of the 4.5m foreign residents in Germany's
midst.
'This republic is not Weimar,' Mr Kohl declared - rightly - last week.
German security experts have been warning for months that right-wing gangs,
some led by shaven-headed youths mouthing ideologies which everyone hoped
had gone for good in 1945, have been gaining strength in both east and west.
Yet the danger is neither that German democracy will tumble into the abyss,
nor that the country is succumbing to excessive nationalism. Rather, there
are three risks - all of them definable and containable. First, the
perpetrators of the disorder may become branded abroad as epitomes of the
new Germany. This would greatly harm Germany's image and eventually its
economy. Second, the spectre of politicians expressing futile alarm at
extremists' misdeeds will damage the stock of the country's leadership, at a
time when Germany needs effective government. Third, if assaults on
foreigners continue, the spore of insecurity will spread. The left-wing
terrorism which afflicted Germany during the 1970s and 1980s was mainly
aimed at selected establishment targets. The new neo-Nazi groupings are less
discriminating. They seek their victims not behind the portals of bankers'
villas, but on suburban railway stations.
The reasons for resentment against people with dark skins are manifold.
Perceptions that foreigners are responsible for crime, unemployment or
social security fraud have increased with the rise in asylum seekers
entering Germany, and in the strains engendered by unification. Brutality is
not a purely German phenomenon. Germany registered 2,427 'criminal acts
against foreigners' last year, against 246 in 1990. In England and Wales,
the Home Office counted 7,780 'racially motivated attacks' in 1991, against
6,559 in 1990. The German experience is exceptional not simply because of
the acceleration since 1990, but because of the country's history -
including its lack of success in integrating foreigners.
One positive move is that Mr Kohl is now on track for a deal with the
opposition Social Democrats on amending the constitution to prevent abuses
of Germany's liberal asylum law. Although it is unedifying that politicians
act under the pressure of Molotov cocktails, this is a welcome step. But it
will serve little purpose unless more is done elsewhere. Naturalisation
procedures for foreigners need to be made less onerous - crucially,
permitting long-stay Gastarbeiter and their offspring to vote in elections
and become German citizens. These would-be new Germans need full rights
under the law, buttressed by the sort of initiatives which have helped other
societies absorb ethnic minorities. Germany needs a multiracial police
force, and banks and department stores which give jobs mainly to Germans
should hire more German-speaking foreigners. The violence is a challenge not
simply for police and politicians, but for Germany's civil society. If the
policies and determination are there, it will pass the test.

MR CHRIS PATTEN has never pretended it would be easy to persuade China to
consider his plans for political reform in Hong Kong. But he may not have
expected, in putting forward his proposals nearly two months ago, that
Beijing would move so swiftly, and with such force, to thwart him.
China's threat to repudiate commercial agreements after June 1997 already
appears to be having the desired effect of damaging financial confidence in
the colony, and fuelling unease about Mr Patten in the business community.
No doubt China has further weapons to unsettle the markets, and the
governor, in coming weeks.
Worrying as its threats may be, however, they do not constitute an argument
for changing course. For one thing, they are still largely rhetorical. In
saying that it will, after the handover, reverse reforms and refuse to
honour contracts, Beijing is underlining that, notwithstanding the
Sino-British deal on Hong Kong's future, it will be in charge and will do as
it pleases. The hope must be that in practice its policies will be shaped by
an economic self-interest based on the status quo in Hong Kong.
For another thing, Mr Patten's ideas for improving democratic accountability
still enjoy - so far as can be gauged - overwhelming support from the Hong
Kong people. His proclaimed object is to ensure that they have a say in
their destiny. So long as they, and their representatives in the colony's
Legislative Council, continue to express the wish for greater political
freedom, that is what he should be striving to provide, even if the price is
friction with China and financial instability.
Nothing in recent events has undermined Mr Patten's basic judgment that
trying 'in a modest way' to accommodate the Hong Kong people's aspirations
is the best way to promote political stability. Indeed, China's rulers would
be wise to consider the relevance of that notion in their southern
provinces, where rapid economic growth may also spawn rising political
expectations.
It may be that the communists in Beijing will refuse to accept this,
preferring to confirm their own absolute power rather than to nurture Hong
Kong's economic miracle; that, in other words, they remain determined to
snuff out Mr Patten's 'contagion' even if it means inflicting serious damage
on the colony. But if so, and if the cost to Hong Kong of Mr Patten's
political blueprint eventually seems too high, Hong Kongers themselves, not
their colonial masters, should be the judges.

If this is to be a slump in front of the box evening you could do worse than
switch on BBC2 at 7.40 and stay with the network until midnight. Open Space
(7.40) is about lighthouse keepers, those romantic figures who symbolise the
qualities of the prince in the fairy tale tower, the religious recluse on
his pole, and the man with the lamp. It seems that the number of tower rock
lights out at sea manned by Trinity House is now down to only three.
Bookmark (8.10) records the passing of an oral storytelling tradition in
Rajastan which has survived six centuries but is dying out now that 'The
Epic of Pabuji' is being written down for the first time. MASH (9.00)
sustains a standard of script writing which, in British comedy, is achieved
only during short runs by single writers. Pigeons are coming home to roost
in Nice Town (9.25), the dormitory suburb where Joe so altruistically
provided the wherewithal for his sister in law to have a baby. This is the
last episode. Newsnight remains the most civilised, intelligent wrap-up of
the day's events (10.30) and The Late Show is still the only daily culture
magazine on British television (11.15).

FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Don't let Auntie take a retrograde step - Christopher
Dunkley writes an open letter to Peter Brooke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dear Mr Brooke,
When you presented your green paper on The Future Of The BBC to Parliament
last week you called for a wide ranging debate and invited listeners and
viewers to write to you. My first suggestion is rather personal. You must
have heard of the pillow-banging method of auto-persuasion, you know,
thumping your head on the pillow just before going to sleep and saying 'I
will not overspend my credit card' or whatever. Since you are now the key
person as regards the future of the BBC, I think you should establish a
little bedtime routine which goes 'The status quo is an option', thump, 'The
status quo is an option', thump, 'The status quo . . . ' Surely that should
not be too difficult for someone who is supposed to believe in conservatism?
To me it looks urgently necessary because it seems that all the most
important parties, including yourself and the BBC, have already accepted,
before the debate has even started, that, whatever else may happen, the BBC
must be transformed. In your foreword you say 'The BBC cannot remain
unchanged', section 1.1 says 'we should be ready to contemplate radical
changes', and the BBC describes its own discussion document, Extending
Choice, also published last week, as being 'about adaptation and change'.
Clearly it would be absurd to suggest that this one organisation should be
set in amber and preserved forever as it is today.
However, the danger seems quite the reverse. Having persuaded yourselves
that change is inevitable as a reaction to predicted developments in the
broader world of broadcasting, the BBC looks set to pre-empt its competitors
and make retrograde changes which will then, but only then, create precisely
the hostile conditions anticipated. For example, the people at the top of
the BBC seem to have resigned themselves already in extraordinarily
fatalistic fashion to losing about one third of their audience in the next
few years.
They talk about the advances being made by satellite and cable predicting
that most households will have access to 20 television channels and 15 radio
stations within seven years. I doubt the inevitability of that, given that
all the billions spent so far on satellite and cable have produced an
audience share of less than six per cent. But one way to help bring it about
is for the BBC to start planning now for a reduction in its audience from a
45 per cent to a 30 per cent share which is precisely what it is doing. Not
only does that depress the staff, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Throughout Extending Choice the tone suggests a willingness to move wherever
commercial media barons or market forces may push, rather than setting out
determinedly to lead from the front. Anything that cannot be judged
'distinctively' BBC will be abandoned to the commercial sector. The current
police drama series Between the Lines on BBC1 is excellent but is there
anything 'distinctively BBC' about it? How do the programmes in BBC2's
social affairs series Public Eye differ 'distinctively' from ITV programmes
on the same subjects? It looks as though your predecessors in the Thatcher
years were so successful in their attacks on the traditionally diverse
centres of influence in this country (the universities, trade unions, local
councils and so on) that there is nobody left, not even the supposedly
arrogant BBC hierarchy, with the confidence to dissent. Everywhere 'the
market' is accepted as rightfully triumphant.
Why is everyone so insistent that such great changes must be made to the
BBC? If it was a crumbling organisation, making programmes that nobody
wanted to hear or see, out-shone by its commercial competitors, pumping out
old fashioned material, disliked or ignored by the public, it might be
understandable. But the fact is that British broadcasting is one of those
rare things in Britain at the end of the 20th century, a national success
story, and to a large extent the BBC is responsible for that. In all areas
the BBC has repeatedly proved its expertise and its appeal, from
Attenborough's Life on Earth to Only Fools and Horses, from Bookmark to Have
I Got News for You. Does it really make sense to set out so resolutely to
fix it when it ain't broke? The British consume more broadcasting than their
continental neighbours, and virtually all of them turn to the BBC at some
time every week.
Most of them believe, as they always have, contrary to the assertions of
certain political ideologues, that the licence fee delivers good value for
money. Of course it may be that you do not really want to change Auntie very
much, that your green paper is mostly a formality and that, after a suitable
show of public tussling, matters will proceed pretty much as before.
Certainly there are people who have read your paper and are complaining
heatedly about your lack of 'zeal'. They are making bitter comparisons with
the radical treatment so recently handed out to ITV. It is clear that you
are better disposed than some towards the BBC. Yet to assume that the ideas
in your paper were mere debating points - slimming the BBC, restricting its
output to material which will not make a profit for commercial broadcasters,
cutting its television channels to one and its radio networks to three -
would, I suspect, be a terrible mistake.
The most powerful argument on the side of the BBC is that it has proved
itself over decades, and shown that a large multi-purpose broadcasting
organisation with a big 'critical mass' of talent, can and will produce
programmes throughout the spectrum, from highbrow to mass appeal, from
Civilisation to Steptoe and Son, from Clarissa to Waiting for God, in a way
that commercial broadcasters will not unless you force them by law. Since
your party has recently arranged to introduce far greater commercial
pressure to ITV and simultaneously reduced the regulatory impositions on ITV
to a 'light touch', we are going to need the BBC more than ever before, not
less.
Under the rules your party has introduced, commercial broadcasters are not
going to be able to afford to cross-subsidise programmes of a highbrow or
minority nature. Who gives us an excellent late-night run-down on the day's
events? The BBC in Newsnight and not the commercial services. Who gives us a
culture magazine four days a week? The BBC in The Late Show and not the
commercial services. Which channel manages regularly to get special interest
series on topics such as science, cookery and driving into its Top 10 with
audiences of four or five million? Not Channel 4, but BBC2.
And what has that got to do with making EastEnders? Everything. If you fall
back on the old shibboleth 'Do what you do best, old boy' and insist that
the BBC merely fill in the gaps where commercial broadcasters cannot turn a
quick penny - educational programmes, Shakespeare, serious current affairs
and minority interests - you will transform the BBC into a British version
of America's Public Broadcasting Service. And you know better than I do that
as soon as that happens your colleagues in Parliament will refuse to sustain
the licence fee: QED BBC RIP.
The BBC must remain in popular broadcasting if we are to continue to benefit
from its specialist broadcasting. If it can sustain its popularity while
ridding itself of Australian soap operas, embarrassment series and the more
gormless game shows (which is what John Birt, the director-general in
waiting, seemed to be suggesting last week) well and good.
In the end the BBC stands or falls according to its abilities as a public
service broadcasting organisation, a concept which some members of your
party seem to find utterly baffling. All it means, surely, is an
organisation with the sole purpose of providing a broadcasting service for
the public. Commercial broadcasting has as its first object the payment of
profits to shareholders, as its second object the delivery of audiences to
advertisers and, as a means to those two ends, thirdly the creation of
programmes. Remember: 'The status quo is an option', thump . . .
Yours sincerely

FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: West Side Story - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To see two West Side Stories within a week, and Annie Get Your Gun in
between, prompts some reflections on musicals in general. West Side Story no
longer looks like the radical breakthrough it seemed when it was first
performed in 1957. Indeed it would be perfectly possible to dismiss it now
as another piece of American sentimentalism, or to say that it has none of
the inventiveness and originality of a much more recent musical: Assassins.
The trouble with the latter argument, however, is that the lyrics for both
West Side Story and Assassins are by the same man: Stephen Sondheim. The
conclusion I draw is that fashions change, and so they they should, but that
the basic pattern remains much the same. What seems daring at the start soon
becomes conventional. A musical is theatre with song; at its best, it is a
marvellous formula which still has a long way to run.
None of that is to disparage the performance of West Side Story at the
Leicester Haymarket. Leicester has emerged among the foremost of our
regional theatres with an enormous range of productions. It has chosen West
Side Story as its Christmas show, and on Saturday evening the theatre was
packed.
One can see why people like the piece. It has song, dance and drama, a
passing similarity to Romeo and Juliet and a sociological theme in the
conflict between Puerto Ricans and whites. The direction by Paul Kerryson
makes the most of it all. There is an impressive set of tall New York
tenement buildings designed by Charles Cusick-Smith, but still plenty of
room to display the choreography which came originally from Jerome Robbins.
The songs are terrific, of course, and the production worth travelling to.
Yet I wonder if Leonard Bernstein's music and the whole set-up really are so
much superior than what went before. It just seemed so at the time. With
hindsight, there is a lot of Cowboys and Indians in West Side Story and
sentimentality is never far away.
The other West Side Story, performed by the admirable Pimlico Opera, was at
Wandsworth Prison with inmates playing some of the parts. This was a smaller
affair, partly no doubt because space is restricted. It had the virtue of
drawing more attention to the orchestra and, under the conducting of Wasfi
Kani, Bernstein's music sounded better in the prison than at Leicester. The
song that went down best was, for understandable reasons, 'Gee, Officer
Krupke'.
Many of the audience had not seen the show before and it was plainly a great
success. I muse about the psychological effect of giving the inmates the
excitement of rehearsal and performance then sending them back to their
cells until the next show, perhaps in a year's time. They should do it more
often. Yet a piece that can serve a prison as well as being the Leicester
Christmas show has surely joined the repertorie of established, even
old-fashioned musicals.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Rare musical treats from 'Tender is the North' /
Review of Lindberg and Sandstrom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With two weeks still to run, the Barbican's Scandinavian festival is already
a hands-down success. The idea of mounting a month's worth of music (and
much else besides) from the Northern lands was wildly risky: all
music-lovers know Grieg and Sibelius, and some Nielsen, but only a tiny
fraction know anything else. There is a great deal more, as Barbican
audiences are happily discovering; but it has been a colossal feat of
planning both to lay on all these rich, obscure menus and to persuade
audiences to come and try them.
Friday's concert by Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony was a bold test-case.
Surely a Magnus Lindberg premiere and a new trombone concerto by Jan
Sandstrom were fare for a few hundred devotees in the Queen Elizabeth Hall?
 -and what about that second half, given over to a long Serenade by Wilhelm
Stenhammar (1871-1927)? Yet it all drew a large, enthusiastic house, duly
rewarded by performances as keen as could be.
Lindberg's Corrente II, a BBC commission, owes its 'II' to having developed
from a shorter Corrente for just 16 players. Though 'Corrente' is Italian
for the old courante dance-form, it literally means 'running'; and indeed
this piece races breathlessly through most of its 20-odd minutes. Oliver
Knussen's Coursing offers a succinct parallel - and so do the quickest
movements of Berg's Lyric Suite, the original models for every atonal moto
perpetuo since.
In tonal music, a virtuoso torrent of even-notes may be almost too swift to
follow, but slower-moving harmony will pin it down for the ear. Atonalists
have to contrive different aural markers for their audiences: dramatic
eruptions along the way, or radical contrasts of colour and weight. Here
Lindberg (Finnish, b. 1958) has opted for a tight range of recurring chords,
elaborated but not 'developed' in the hectic instrumental flow.
On this first hearing the result sounded purposeful and consistent enough,
with a nice appreciation of orchestral colour, but not so gripping as to
fill up its length with drama. When the race was momentarily suspended - for
a cadence from Purcell's 'Funeral Music', for example - we heard mere
pauses-for-breath, not shifts to a new level; and by the end we knew the
basic chords excessively well. Further hearing may discern extra dimensions,
but this time Corrente II seemed to present a flatter profile than other
recent pieces by Lindberg, despite its elegant figurations.
Sandstrom is four years older, and Swedish. His Concerto was most
specifically conceived for the remarkable trombonist and performance-artist
Christian Lindberg (no relation to Magnus, as far as I know), who led the
pictorial journey from mythical Greece through the Florida Everglades and
Provence to aboriginal Australia with lusty motorbike fanfares, and in a
biker's well-worn red leathers.
Mutatis mutandis, we were hearing a contemporary equivalent of Ferde Grofe's
Grand Canyon Suite. Lindberg himself was grossly engaging; there were
inventively funny episodes, and celestial white-note inserts in Hollywood
style. The audience enjoyed it all hugely. Johan Jeverud's programme-note
assured us that Sandstrom's concerto is less 'eclectic' than any of his
other recent music. That may be true, but the real charm of the thing lay in
its playing-out of the mysterious Scandinavian sense of humour: rigidly
deadpan but deeply silly, with rude noises. One can warm to that.
Andrew Davis lavished sympathetic care on both those works, and even more on
the opening and closing pieces. Nielsen's Maskarade Overture sang and
fizzed; those of us who missed Opera North's first British production of the
opera, 80 years late, kicked ourselves yet again.
The marvel of the evening, however, was Stenhammar's expansive Serenade
(1914, revised 1919), a Northerner's idyllic vision of Italy. Were it not
Scandinavian, we should all have known it by heart long ago. Each of its
five movements is enchanting, lit up by eager, well-schooled imagination and
by judicious orchestral hints from Berlioz and Wagner. Davis made it
irresistibly fresh. For jaded critics, there are few pleasures to compare
with discovering that a piece you expected to be efficient and period-bound
actually sends up live, heartfelt sparks. It deserves to make a bestselling
CD.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Verdi Requiem - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the dark, holy surroundings of Westminster Cathedral it is easy to let
one's mind drift back in time. Recordings do not exist from 1874 and so it
is left to the imagination, supported by a thorough reading of contemporary
reports, to form an idea of what the first performance of Verdi's Requiem
might have been like.
With this concert on Monday the issue has come alive. John Eliot Gardiner,
the hare among the period performance specialists, has left the tortoises
well and truly standing by racing ahead to the later years of Verdi. The
keenness of intellect that he has focussed upon Handel and Mozart in the
past was here turned on music that equally excites the physical senses.
Whatever doubts it may have raised, the result was an important and
compelling evening.
Nothing in it was slack; nothing was done without deep thought and
preparation. The biggest surprise came in the solo music, where the
disciplinarian Gardiner melted to allow his singers a measure of freedom - a
malleable, sensitive, yet still precise style. The choruses were thrilling,
tingling with energy, every part phenomenally clear from the Monteverdi
Choir (including a couple of male altos, which would have given Verdi a
surprise).
From a seat near the front the Requiem's extreme contrasts sounded
tremendous, not least when the strident period trumpets pealed out from the
cathedral galleries to announce the day of judgment. Unfortunately, the
acoustics at Westminster were too resonant to let us hear the instruments of
the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique (all as close to 1870s Italy as
possible) in any detail - though the pastoral oboe at 'Inter oves' was a
singular success.
It was with the four soloists that the problems arose. We know from accounts
of early performances that the original soprano was renowned for the power
and intensity of her top C, which rode over the climax of the final chorus,
while the mezzo was so deep in tone as almost to be mistaken for a tenor.
Excellent artists though they are, Luba Orgonasova and Anne Sofie von Otter
are not those kinds of singer. Orgonasova's exquisitely delicate soprano
could not be heard at the big top C, or in much of the rest; von Otter's
light mezzo has no tenor leanings, whatever her other virtues. The
sensitive, Italianate Luca Canonici and long-breathed Alastair Miles were
nearer the mark, though even they have relatively small voices. Too often
the whole quartet simply disappeared from audibility.
What Gardiner did here was to take some of the singers from his Mozart team
and transfer them to the music of a century later. Logic dictates that they
cannot be 'authentic' in both. Still, on the forthcoming recording they may
well be more successful, while the exemplary technical standard of the
music-making will carry all before it.

FOR THE last 11 months Bill Slowikowski has been submitting himself and his
colleagues to what he calls 'trial by fire'.
The 49-year-old American has been running the second largest chemical
division of Monsanto from Brussels, in the heart of the European Community,
instead of from its long-standing base at the group's St Louis headquarters,
deep in the US Midwest.
Slowikowski's move, along with half his 13-strong team at the head of
Monsanto's Dollars 700m (Pounds 460m) resins division, puts the group in the
same league of pioneers as IBM, Unilever, Siemens and ABB.
Since the late 1980s each has moved the head office of at least one global
division out of the parent company's home country, either to be closer to a
key foreign market, or to foster international thinking and staffing. A step
of this kind would have been heresy just a decade ago, so strong was the
traditional assumption that the 'brains' of all a multinational's businesses
should be based 'at home'.
Like most of these other moves, Monsanto's was both obvious and overdue. The
resins division's largest business by far is the vinyl which goes into
laminated vehicle windscreens and some architectural glass; using the brand
name Saflex, Monsanto is twice as large as its closest rival.
Only 40 per cent of Saflex sales are made in the Americas, against 50 per
cent in Europe and 10 per cent in Asia - both of which are expanding faster
than the US.
Not only that, but the vast proportion of the division's customers are
global glassmakers - St Gobain, Pilkington, PPG, Asahi and others - most of
which are headquartered outside the US. Thanks to the German car and
building industries, and the Japanese, many of the most innovative customers
are also outside the US.
Yet until the Brussels move, which took effect in January, Slowikowski says:
'Quite frankly we had an organisational set-up that forced us to focus
primarily on North America' - at the expense of product and market
opportunities elsewhere. 'Supposedly, we watched around the world. But we
didn't really look at it properly.'
'We're having a hell of a time going global,' confirms Martin Kallen, a
Dutchman who chairs Monsanto Europe but knows St Louis well. 'The mindset in
the US and the company's structure suggest that we put a fair amount of
obstacles in our way. Being in the Midwest is a limited view location.'
In resins, that has now changed. 'In the last few months the time spent
strategy-making for north America has shrunk by a factor of probably 10,'
says Slowikowski. The senior manager below him is no longer a man who - in
an arrangement typical for Monsanto and other US multinationals - carried
the title of 'worldwide business manager', but had direct control over only
North America.
Instead Slowikowski has created a more balanced international structure in
which north America has been given the same regional status as Europe and
Asia.
With a largely new management team, nearly half of whom are non-Americans,
Slowikowski says he is now 60 per cent of the way towards creating what he
calls 'a global mindset' in resins. The attitude he is trying to foster is
that the division's HQ 'might just as well be on a barge somewhere -
globalisation is a state of mind'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lynton Jones, the new chief executive of OM London, part of the Swedish
futures and options exchange group, has persuaded an old friend from stock
exchange days, Peter Cox (right), to join him as director of business
development.
Cox, 45, has been at the London Stock Exchange for a total of 16 years, and
is best known as the founder of SEAQ International and, more recently, for
masterminding the introduction of on-line trade confirmation service SEQUAL.
He had been head of business development for the past year, a post he says
will not be directly filled, but he is unwilling to discuss his reasons for
leaving. The Exchange adds that it expects to make an announcement in the
next fortnight concerning the reorganisation of the market development area.
'While there had been a natural break after the SEQUAL project, we tried
very hard to make sure there was a role for him elsewhere in the exchange' a
spokeswoman said, who acknowledged his departure was a big loss.
Jones, who was at the London Stock Exchange himself between 1983-1987, and
who has been brought in to extend the range of products and exchange
linkages at OM London, says he worked alongside Cox on the strategic plan
for Big Bang. Later, when Jones was running the London outpost of Nasdaq,
the two were again in frequent contact.
'Peter is an ideal choice; the only thing he doesn't have is direct
experience of derivatives' says Jones, who adds he is also looking for a
marketing director 'who will not come from the Stock Exchange'.

Sir Christopher Benson yesterday announced plans to step down from the
chairmanship of MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, in July 1993
after nearly 20 years on its board. The new chairman will be Lord Blakenham,
who is also chairman of Pearson, the media and industrial group which owns
the Financial Times. He has been on the board since 1990, and his will be a
non-executive position, in contrast with Sir Christopher, who describes his
role as having been a 'part-time executive' one.
Sir Christopher said he was leaving the company when he reached the age of
60, which is MEPC's retirement age. He is also chairman of Boots, the
retailer and a director of Sun Alliance, the insurance group.
His departure from MEPC, like his arrival, coincides with a severe downturn
in the property market. 'Much has happened since I joined the board in
January 1974 and the company has successfully ridden out three major
economic hurricanes,' he said.
Ian Irvine, deputy chairman of Reed International and chairman of Capital
Radio and Jonathan Taylor, chief executive of Booker, have also joined the
MEPC board.
Sir Christopher is a chartered surveyor who began his career in the navy
before moving into the property industry in the late 1950s. He became
managing director in 1976 and became chairman in 1988.
He was chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the body
charged with regenerating London docklands, from 1984-1988.
*****
John Macomber, 64, a former chairman of the US Eximbank and ex-McKinsey
management consultant, has rejoined the board of Pilkington, the world's
largest glass manufacturer. He served as a non-executive director between
February 1988 and July 1989 when President Bush gave him the job of running
Eximbank.
Macomber, who was chief executive of Celanese Corporation, until it was
acquired by Hoechst in 1987, is one of two new faces on the Pilkington
board. The other, George Simpson, 50, is deputy chief executive of British
Aerospace and chairman of Rover. They are replacing Lord Croham, a former
head of the home civil service who has been on the board since 1978, and Sir
Peter Thompson, president of NFC, who has been on the board since 1985.
Pilkington has been hard hit by the recession and is often touted as a
takeover target. But the recruitment of the two new non-executives to a
boardroom which includes Deustche Bank chief Hilmar Kopper, shows that the
firm has little difficulty recruiting talented independent directors. George
Simpson is credited with helping to revamp the fortunes of Rover and is now
a rising star in the British Aerospace boardroom, while Macomber played a
leading part in building up the European practice of McKinsey &amp; Co.

FT  02 DEC 92 / People: Imro after Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Nunneley has accepted a permanent appointment as chairman of Imro,
the investment managers' regulator, after working as acting chairman since
George Nissen's resignation in June.
Nunneley now has the delicate task of steering Imro through the remaining
after-effects of the Maxwell scandal, which led to Nissen's resignation.
He should certainly command sufficient respect within the industry to do so.
An old Etonian, Nunneley is deputy chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings,
where he has worked for 30 years. He is also deputy chairman of the Clerical
Medical &amp; General life assurance society, as well as being a director of
Monks Investment Trust and Macmillan. He is a former chairman of the
Institutional Fund Managers' Association.
He is clear about the job ahead of him: 'The chairman's immediate tasks are
to continue the process of restoring Imro's reputation and organisation
post-Maxwell, which I sincerely hope is in the process of completion now,
and of steering it through the investigation into the whole system of
regulation which Andrew Large and others are conducting.'
He added: 'Maxwell exposed in a cruel way the sort of weaknesses you might
expect in any system which was developing. I think, before Maxwell, Imro was
in many ways a very effective regulator. The process of examining our navel
has been extremely useful and it's allowed us to do in six months what might
otherwise have taken 18.'

experience of a group of Monsanto 'spear-carriers' in moving from the US to
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

There could be no clearer evidence of the pain involved in uprooting
organisational structures, procedures and attitudes than this year's
4,500-mile move by the headquarters of Monsanto Resins. Yet multinationals
must take similar steps if they are to become better at managing their
various global businesses in a flexible way that best suits the market and
technological characteristics of each business.
Bill Slowikowski, boss of the resins division, calls the move a 'trial by
fire' mainly because of his role as a spear-carrier for the sort of global
management and information systems - as well as attitudes - that the rest of
Monsanto's chemical businesses will need in the future. If he had not been
so keen to play this role, the task might well have fallen to his
counterpart in either the plastics or rubber chemicals divisions, both of
which are nearly as international as resins.
An immediate aspect of 'trial' was the shock experienced within the US side
of resins, and elsewhere at St Louis, when the Brussels move was announced.
'It caused tremendous anxiety,' says Gustaaf Francx, general manager of
Monsanto Chemicals for Europe-Africa, whose responsibilities included the
European side of resins until Slowikowski's arrival in January.
The US resins organisation 'had always felt close to the powerhouse - they
were dominated by it - but all of a sudden the powerhouse was moving away
from them,' says Francx. He sees this as a painful but real benefit for the
people involved in terms of the extra delegation to them. 'Now we finally
have a US organisation that has to learn to stand on its own feet, without
being watched over constantly by senior management,' he says.
Surprisingly, perhaps, the least troublesome aspect of the move has been
face-to-face communication. Slowikowski will have travelled to the US only
seven or eight times by the end of 1992. This is not so much to see his
boss, the head of the whole chemicals group, as because he still has half
his team there.
The director of the Saflex business (a Briton) is located in Brussels, along
with the director of one of the two smaller resins businesses, and the
functional heads of manufacturing, planning, control and information
systems. But the director of the other small resins business - which is
purely American - is still in St Louis, as are the heads of human resources
and technology. The latter is a Briton based near Boston, where most resins
research and development is done - both Francx and Martin Kallen, head of
Monsanto Europe, see the location of most Monsanto R&amp;D in the US as a very
sore point.
Communications between these people, and between their subordinates, have
been eased considerably since the Gulf War by the introduction of extensive
in-house video conferencing across the US, Europe and Asia. This has limited
the need for long flights to meetings, although Slowikowski remarks that 'if
you can't handle jet lag, this is no organisation to be in'.
A different aspect of communication has been a real trial, however: the
litany of technical computer problems which have beset Slowikowski and co.
'The St Louis people said you could get the same data in Brussels as in the
US, but it wasn't true,' he says ruefully. All sorts of incompatibilities
had crept unnoticed into the division's systems on the two sides of the
Atlantic.
These resulted, for instance, in total chaos when, in order to do an initial
quarterly forecast before Brussels had been set up to do it, the new HQ
tried early this year to down-load its files into St Louis. 'There was data
all over the place,' recalls Slowikowski. Other such problems, including
altering St Louis computer maintenance times to suit Brussels working hours,
took six months to sort out.
Worse difficulties have been encountered in trying to start the worldwide
consolidation and control of orders, production flows and inventory. 'We're
looking at major systems changes,' says Slowikowski. 'They wouldn't have
been done from the US.'
But these technical changes are minor compared with the challenge of
changing people's attitudes and ways of working, from what Slowikowski calls
'vertical to horizontal'. In the past, everyone in the division identified
their interests with their region, discipline, and department, and took
decisions accordingly - whether about work on research projects, new product
development, production, pricing or anything else. Decisions and actions
which needed co-ordination had to be referred up each of these 'silos', as
Slowikowski calls them, and then transferred across to the next silo at
senior level, before being referred downwards again.
Now Slowikowski and his lieutenants are 'breaking down the silos to work as
a worldwide team', as he puts it. This involves getting people at all levels
to manage horizontally, across disciplines and regions. That, in turn,
requires each management procedure and system to be re-thought or, in
today's fashionable jargon, 're-engineered'. This process is being aided by
a review already under way across all the Monsanto chemicals divisions.
Working as a global team also requires retraining and motivation programmes,
so that people at all levels understand their new roles and how they are now
supposed to relate to each other. Resins is making extensive use of teamwork
psychologists to help train its people, and influence their real readiness
to work in the new style, rather than just their expressed acceptance. One
technique is to use 'sensitivity training' to get people to understand their
own prejudices.
In R&amp;D, for example, Slowikowski says: 'People are 'coming over' one at a
time, and starting to think completely differently' about working in
flexible, inter-disciplinary project teams. 'It's really exciting, but it
takes a hell of a time.'
A key example of the need for new systems and attitudes is in manufacturing,
where global co-ordination is seen as increasingly vital. In order to
optimise production continually on a worldwide basis, processes for product
categorisation and labelling, capacity planning, working capital and
production loading will have to be redesigned and integrated between the
various plants in Europe, the US, Brazil and Asia. 'Instead of making 2,000
product categories in each plant, why not source 1,000 each from two plants
worldwide?' asks Slowikowski.
As with information technology, unexpected problems can arise. 'We have not
supplied sheet resin successfully across regions in the past,' says
Slowikowski. He cites one case where an order was switched from one factory
to another and a boat load dispatched, only to find that one plant had
changed its product specification slightly without telling the rest of the
organisation. The replacement load was therefore unsuitable for the
customer. 'Our people are going through a lot of things which we need to
co-ordinate on a worldwide basis,' says Slowikowski.
The resins boss, who clearly thrives on working abroad, emphasises
repeatedly that the human side of going global is at least as important as
redesigned systems and procedures. 'Trial by fire' is, after all, more of a
human than a technical experience.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Starting on a new track - An
Italian industrial landmark that escaped demolition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half-way round the steeply-banked curves of Fiat's roof-top test track at
its former Lingotto factory in Turin, you begin to regret having chosen the
gorgonzola sauce rather than the salad for lunch.
From the passenger's seat of an Italian sports car, racing along the
one-kilometre track is for many people a dream come true. Millions of
youngsters must have imagined themselves behind the wheel on the
extraordinary oval circuit, five floors above ground.
Like many contemporary industrial wonders, however, Lingotto reached the end
of the road. Built by Fiat between 1917 and 1920, it was for decades the
biggest car factory outside the US, and an object of wonder even for
architectural gurus like Le Corbusier.
But what do you do with one of Europe's biggest empty spaces, encompassing
250,000 square metres, much of it in two narrow parallel blocks, and 350,000
square metres of ground, once production has stopped? And how do you protect
such a site from environmental damage and vandalism?
That was the challenge posed by Fiat to 20 architects in 1984, including Sir
Denys Lasdun and Sir James Stirling of the UK, Austria's Hans Hollein, and
Richard Meier from the US. Three of Italy's best-known architects, Renzo
Piano, Aldo Rossi and Gae Aulenti, also took part.
Many suggested transforming the big press shop into an exhibition space.
Ideas for the two 500-metre spines were more varied, although theatres,
hotels and conference centres often featured. And all retained the famous
test track.
That is roughly the mix of activities now under development in the L600bn
(Pounds 285m) project for Lingotto, which recently marked an important
turning point with the opening of the first big exhibition devised entirely
by the new company running the site.
Designed along Henry Ford's assembly line principles, the plant was
conceived by the architect, Giacomo Matte-Trucco, to maximise output in the
minimum space. Construction costs were kept down by using a rigid modular
system.
Surprisingly, Fiat's decision to pull out of Lingotto in 1982 was an
industrial rather than an environmental choice. Ceiling and under-floor
clearances were inadequate for modern motor production. All around the
world, industrial mammoths like Lingotto were falling victim to new,
single-level factories with huge, column-free spaces and high ceilings.
With the old press shop having been partly demolished and rebuilt as
exhibition space, Lingotto's five halls, covering 90,000 square metres, are
now nearly complete. The whole project, masterminded by Piano, best known
for the Pompidou Centre in Paris, has capitalised on natural light from
existing skylights to provide a much less claustrophobic space than in most
exhibition centres. Elsewhere, typical Piano touches like long multi-storey
escalators and brightly painted pipework abound.
But it is finding uses for the rest of the plant which has posed the biggest
challenge for the sponsors. In a complex deal, Fiat sold Lingotto for L35bn
payable in installments, to a consortium in which it will hold 37 per cent.
Partners include Turin's chamber of commerce, and two local banks and an
insurance company, which have 36 per cent between them.
A sister company, owned by private and public-sector interests, will run the
exhibitions. It will manage the halls and associated services for shows
organised by third parties, such as Turin's book fair and the bi-annual
Motor Show, which this year - the first at the restructured Lingotto -
received 540,000 visitors. But to make a profit, the company must also
devise new functions.
One spin-off already under way is a series of Lingotto-branded products, to
be manufactured under licence. A Piano-designed halogen lamp, based on the
original 1920s light fittings and now installed in many parts of the
building, is to be marketed by one of Italy's leading lighting
manufacturers.
Piano's plans for the rest of the site include a flexible 2,200-seat concert
hall being dug out of the bowels of the building, which will have an
adjustable roof, allowing it to adapt acoustically to the needs of
conferences as well as concerts.
Another area will be occupied by a 250-bed luxury hotel, while a row of
shops will run along both spines. Further civic uses will be guaranteed by
re-housing the science faculty of Turin University at the northern end of
the building, with an additional wing.
The plans include a three-storey business centre, while an 'incubator' for
budding new companies near the university complex will complete the circle
between basic research and commercial applications of new technology.
The whole project, so far only slightly behind schedule, should be finished
by 1995, when the university moves in. In the meantime, the hotel and
congress centre are due to open next September, followed by the shops at
Christmas and the innovation centre in 1994.
Will it work, especially in a recessionary Italy? Many companies are already
scaling down spending plans, while Piano himself earlier this year attended
the opening of an equally big conference centre he designed in an old cotton
warehouse in Genoa.
The Torinese themselves are delighted that one of their city's most famous
landmarks is being revived, even if there is concern about the cost. If
Lingotto takes off, such caution will probably be cast aside by visitors
strolling around the test track, which will be open to the public. If not,
Lingotto's sponsors could find themselves with an impressive white elephant.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Recruitment: Slaves to the competitive unconscious -
Readers' replies raise disturbing question about the personalities who tend
to rule the roost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the whole of six days the Jobs column has been waiting . . .waiting . .
.waiting. And since the expected event is an acid test, I now know how
nuclear physicists feel when, after theorising that a certain particle must
exist, they sit fidgeting by their accelerators praying it will actually
show up.
In my case, no apparatus is required to test the theory. All it needs is for
someone to ask to borrow the book I wrote about a week ago. For the replies
from you readers to that article pose a problem which . . . .
But before going on, I'd better recapitulate lest any of you here today
weren't present last week. The book* is called Neanderthals at Work and its
main author, American psychologist Albert Bernstein, has a theory. It is
that organisations' workforces can be divided into three broad types of
people, of whom only one type characteristically win promotion to the very
top. The three are:
Rebels - Often creatively intelligent as well as technically expert, they're
indispensable in crises. The snag is that, although willing to work without
stint at things that give them a personal *John Wiley, Pounds 12.95.
buzz, they have little time for routine tasks, however necessary, and still
less for people problems. They therefore hardly ever climb far up managerial
hierarchies.
Believers - Embodiments of the work ethic, they spare no effort even at
tasks they dislike. Moreover, being fair-minded and straight-forward in
their dealings, they make the kind of managers under whom other people give
of their best.
Believers' strength, however, is also the root of their weakness. They draw
their motivation from their faith that diligent discharge of their
prescribed duties will be duly rewarded - a faith they hold so strongly as
to be blind to any evidence to the contrary. Consequently, they rarely rise
beyond the middle ranks.
The type who do get to the top are the Competitors. They are quick to learn
how the company system really works as distinct from the way the official
rules ordain, and they then manipulate it to serve their own ambitions.
Since their motivation is the urge to win personally, they take it for
granted that their way is best and so never question whether or not what
they are doing is in the best interests of the company.
Now, last week's report on Dr Bernstein's theory produced a large but
uncounted number of replies from readers, most of whom identified themselves
as of one type or the other. They also included several people known to me,
some of whom I have reason to believe operate as competitors.
The odd thing was that neither they nor any of the rest admitted as much.
The whole lot claimed to be either rebels or believers - which set me
thinking.
At first I decided it was just typical competitors' behaviour: they could
hardly be expected to show their true colours, after all. But then I was
struck by an awful thought.
Could it be that competitors don't know they're competitors?
Hence my idea of a test. What else besides hiding behind disguises would
competitors inevitably do, I wondered. One that occurred was that they'd
surely never buy a book if they could get it on loan. So I settled in to
await a would-be borrower, whom I could then confront with the evidence and
grill to find whether he or she was masking being a competitor, or simply
unconscious of the fact.
Alas, no one has asked for the loan. What's worse, now I've revealed the
trap I was setting, the whole scheme is blown - which is a pity. For the
un-consciousness or otherwise of competitors has a bearing on another of
Albert Bernstein's theses which this past week fortunately has seen
confirmed.
In his view, a big drawback of having competitors in command, is that their
typical deviousness about the ways they manipulate company systems tends to
stymie useful developments. 'The only way to make meaningful change in a
corporate culture is to be very specific about what that culture actually is
and how it works,' the book explains. 'The problem is that the people who
could write the explicit rules don't think it is in their best interest to
do so.'
Confirmation of the truth of those words has come from Pam Pocock of the
Strategic People consultancy of Chertsey, Surrey. Among its activities is
helping outfits whose top management wants them to change to meet new
demands, which necessitates identifying the values that make up the present
culture, and adjusting them as required.
In the process, besides putting out questionnaires and so on, the
consultancy uses a board game it has devised called Dilemma. In it, staff
acting the part of promotion-seeking managers are faced, in turn, with
ethical problems taken from real organisational life. For example, what do
you do if, while searching an absent colleague's desk for some important
data, you accidentally find a hidden pile of neglected work? The player
concerned then has not only to decide on an answer, but persuade the others
that it's the best one, before being awarded promotion further up the board.
What often if not usually emerges, says Ms Pocock, is a cultural picture
which differs from the one given by the initial questionnaires. First
inquiries about the things staff think their ultimate bosses value tend to
elicit lists headed by Teamwork, Quality, Customers and the like.
By contrast, deeper dredgings into the outfit's workings come up with terms
such Traditional, Bureaucratic and Hierarchical. The Dilemma game shows that
many employees are aware of the contradiction. Often the player choosing the
solution will have no difficulty in persuading the rest that it's productive
as well as ethically right, only to be sunk by the objection: 'But it just
wouldn't work in this firm, as you very well know.'
'It's hard to avoid thinking a good many company leaderships are saying one
thing and doing another,' Pam Pocock adds. 'In which case, if the workforce
is to act differently, there must be real change right at the top.'
In the Jobs column's view, however, the problem may well be deeper than
that. Even if the competitors' behaviour is merely deliberate as distinct
from un-conscious, it is nevertheless highly contagious for people of an
ambitious bent. Indeed, once the cult of winning personally has taken hold,
it is apt to skewer itself through the organisation from head to foot,
serving as a management training system all the more effective for being
recognised only by a few. At which point it might defy the most determined
as well as enlightened leader's efforts to cut it out.
So the best hope for companies bedevilled by the cult of winning might lie
in the other possibility - to wit, that competitors are not competitors
deliberately, but are simply unconscious of the fact. If so, there may be a
chance of awakening them not only to their real identity, but to recognition
of their destructive effects and the need to change their ways.
How to bring about the transformation is alas something else again. After
all, at least since Confucius 2,500 years ago sages have been telling
competitors how to behave more productively without as yet turning the
trick. But if readers have any better ideas, I'll be delighted to pass them
on.

FT  02 DEC 92 / EC seeks user-friendly single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NETWORK of officials across each EC country will be given the task of
making the single market more user-friendly at next month's European Council
in Edinburgh.
The officials will be expected to keep in close touch with one another to
try to ensure that the single market works properly.
Many of the main subjects for discussion at the EC summit are looking
increasingly hard to resolve. But the UK government is relieved that in
trying to make the single market more user-friendly, it seems to have
carried European opinion with it.
The move will mean a sharp increase in contacts between officials as they
try to resolve issues before they are raised more formally through embassies
or in EC committees.
One aim is to sort out more readily business difficulties which arise from
misunderstandings rather than from breaches of EC law.
Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said: 'I'm not starry-eyed or
euphoric, but I do think that it is the substance of something that will
work.'
UK ministers and officials are conscious of the belief among British
businessmen that there will still be informal barriers to trade after the
single market comes into effect on January 1.
One minister said: 'There are going to be problems, no question. You only
have to look at the outcry here if it looks as if a foreign company is going
to get any infrastructure project.'
Nonetheless, the Department of Trade and Industry is confident that the plan
will make a significant difference in resolving practical difficulties.
A system of national co-ordinators has been established to deal with
difficulties over the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The
new network of officials may develop similarly over a wider field.
There will also be annual discussions on how the market is working and
further efforts to agree European standards in areas where national
standards still apply.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Report sets out an ambitious remit for self-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENORMOUS painting of Henry VIII in the Barber-Surgeon's Hall in London
hung uneasily yesterday behind the members of the Cadbury committee
preaching the message of greater power-sharing in corporate boardrooms.
After 18 months, Pounds 160,000 in expenses and countless hours of committee
time, the final version of the report on the financial aspects of corporate
governance offered an ambitious and perhaps last chance for self-regulation
to work.
At the heart of the document is the code of best practice, which encompasses
boards of directors, non-executive directors, executive directors and
reporting and controls of companies.
The annual reports of all quoted companies from June 30 next year must
include a statement saying they comply with the code, or spec-ifying any
divergence from it.
In addition to the code there is a detailed series of recommendations on
good practice which are powerful but not enforceable.
Non-executive directors: Boards will require a minimum of three
non-executive directors, at least two of whom should be independent.
When they first join, directors should be given a schedule of matters
reserved for decision by the full board, which should lay down rules to
determine any transactions that are considered material.
To ensure their independence, non-executive directors should not participate
in share-option schemes nor receive a pension from the company.
They should be selected by a nomination committee, which should have a
majority of non-executive directors and make a proposal to the board. On
appointment, non-executives should receive a letter setting out their
duties, term of office, remuneration and its review.
Board sub-committees: The remuneration committee's membership should be set
out in the directors' report, and its chairman should be available to answer
questions at the annual meeting.
Audit committees should be formally constituted as sub-committees of the
main board, be given written terms of reference and normally meet at least
twice a year. The external auditor and the head of internal audit should
attend, as should the finance director. Membership should be disclosed in
the annual report.
There should be at least one audit committee meeting with the auditors each
year - without executive board members present - to discuss any unresolved
issues of concern. It should be able to obtain outside professional advice,
and full access to information to investigate any matters within its terms
of reference. Financial reporting: The report and accounts should contain a
coherent narrative of the company's performance and prospects alongside
suitable figures. Setbacks should be dealt with as well as successes.
Directors' responsibilities: There should be a statement covering the legal
requirement for directors to prepare financial statements each year that
give a true and fair view; and their responsibility to maintain adequate
accounting records, safeguard assets of the company, prevent and detect
fraud, and consistently apply suitable accounting policies and standards.
The committee's main recommendations are:
Boards of all listed companies should comply with the code of best practice.
There should be a statement about their compliance and any reasons in areas
of non-compliance in accounts for years after June 30 1993.
The statement of compliance should be reviewed by the auditors before
publication, where the statements can be objectively verified. The Auditing
Practices Board should consider issuing guidance.
All parties concerned with corporate governance - particularly institutional
investors - should use their influence to encourage compliance. The
committee's sponsors should appoint a new committee by the end of June 1995
to examine how far there is compliance and implementation of the other
recommendations, and consider wider issues of corporate governance.
The Companies Act should be amended so directors' service contracts should
not exceed three years without shareholders' approval.
Interim accounts should include information about balance sheets and they
should be reviewed by auditors. Regulations under the 1991 Companies Act
should be reviewed to ensure the disclosure of the company's audit and
non-audit fees paid to the audit firm.
The accountancy profession should draw up guidelines on the rotation of
audit partners.
Directors should report on the effectiveness of internal controls, and the
auditors should report on that statement. The accountancy profession should
draw up criteria for assessing the systems.
Directors should state in the report and accounts that the company is a
going concern. Accountants should develop guidance on that. Legislation
should be considered to back reporting on internal controls.
The government should consider extending to auditors of all companies the
protection given to those in the regulated sector so they can report
reasonable suspicion of fraud freely to the authorities.
The accountancy profession should consider the question of illegal acts
other than fraud, and how to improve standards and procedures to strengthen
the standing and independence of auditors.
Institutional investors should disclose their policies on the use of their
voting rights. The committee's successor body should consider issues
including the application of the code to smaller listed companies;
directors' training; disclosure of directors' remuneration; the inclusion of
cashflow information in interim reports; procedures for putting forward
resolutions at general meetings; and developments on the nature and extent
of auditors' liability.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Reservations underlie welcome for Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS, MICHAEL CASSELL and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was almost universal support throughout the City and the UK's
boardrooms yesterday for the final Cadbury report on the way companies are
run - at least on the surface. Underneath, however, there remained nagging
concerns, particularly from companies.
Mr Charles Nunnelly, managing director of Robert Fleming Asset Management,
said: 'You can't be against it. You have to be for it.
'The danger is that while the reaction is lovely and warm, no one will do
anything about it.'
The warm words - flavoured with disaffection about the way the report might
interfere with the relationship between companies and shareholders - were in
abundant supply yesterday. They could even be heard coming from the
Confederation of British Industry, which previously condemned the
requirement for companies to comply with the Cadbury code of conduct as a
condition of a Stock Exchange listing. Yesterday the CBI toned down its
criticisms.
An official said: 'A code of best practice which can be reviewed and updated
is better than wholesale intrusion by the law, which would be inflexible and
slow to change. Moreover, the report makes it clear that individuals and
companies will need to follow the code in the light of their own
circumstances.'
The Institute of Directors, which had also voiced criticism of the draft
report, gave its 'strong support' to the final document, which it said went
a long way to meeting the organisation's reservations.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said the original emphasis on the
separate roles of executive and non-executive directors had damaged the
belief in unitary boards. He said most concern had been largely allayed by
the tempering of 'divisive proposals' concerning non-executive directors.
The IoD backed the statement of compliance and, like the CBI, welcomed the
committee's decision to restrict the remit of auditors in reviewing the code
of compliance, although it warned that the audit function would place a
'particularly heavy burden' on smaller quoted companies.
Mr Morgan said the committee's recommendations, with the development of new
accounting standards, would help to restore falling public confidence in
corporate governance.
Institutional investors, meanwhile, were also generally happy that
recommendations they had made after the interim report appeared to have been
taken up in the final version. The Institutional Shareholders' Committee,
the umbrella body representing various groupings of investors, said it would
meet to discuss its reaction within a fortnight, but there were signs
yesterday that its members welcomed the new paper.
The National Association of Pension Funds said: 'We will play our part and
encourage our members to play their part as well.' It said it believed in
the division of responsibility between chairmen and chief executives of
public companies, and would continue to press for a strict separation of the
two roles.
Institutional investors also appeared happier to take on a more central role
in enforcing the code of conduct. 'I think that's fair enough. From our
point of view, we try to stand up and do our bit,' said Mr Barry Southcote
of CIN, investment manager for the Coal industry pension funds.
There was general support for the new recommendation that investment
managers should disclose their policy on voting at companies' annual
meetings - although several pointed out that this could cause difficulties
for fund managers who needed shareholder approval before voting.
While the debate on corporate governance is the topic of the moment, it may
have little impact in the long term. As Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The great pity is that corporate governance is a
cyclical activity. It's topical now, but in a recession mavericks lie low.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday launched a consultation document on whether the May
Day bank holiday should continue in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr
Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said there had been criticism of the
grouping of holidays between mid April and late May, with the lack of a bank
holiday between late August and Christmas.
The consultation document invites views by 28 February 1993. Any change to
the May Day bank holiday would be unlikely before 1995.
The government has made clear that any change would not apply to Scotland.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Building industry calls for rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT IN interest rates of a further 1 percentage point is needed to
stimulate recovery in the construction industry and to prevent further job
losses, the government was warned last night, Andrew Taylor writes.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, the
industry's biggest trade association, said: 'The construction industry faces
a long haul before output reaches a level where the rise in unemployment
will first be checked and then reversed.'
Sir Brian was speaking at the confederation's annual dinner in London. He
added: 'Another cut in interest rates of 1 per cent would provide a further
vital component in the government's engine for growth.'
More than 400,000 jobs are estimated to have been lost in the industry since
the summer of 1989. Company failures, job losses and plant closures are
expected to continue, even if construction output stops falling next year.
Sir Brian said the housing market needed improving if the economy was to
recover and people were to be encouraged to start buying consumer goods
again.
In spite of government measures announced in the Autumn Statement, there
remained significant anxiety about housing. Barely 800,000 house sales are
expected this year, compared with 1.3m a year in the 1980s.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Pellerin Cezannes sell well: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN Cezannes from the collection formed by Auguste Pellerin went under the
hammer at Christie's in London on Monday evening. All of them sold - one
immediately after the sale - almost all at the lower end of their published
estimates.
Only 'L'Homme a la Pipe', the most impressive of this important but uneven
group, exceeded expectations by selling for Pounds 3.52m. It is the only
surviving study for the figure of the pipe-smoking spectator who features in
the monumental Cardplayers series.
A fiercely expressive self-portrait, which once belonged to the artist's
friend, the novelist Emile Zola, tipped Pounds 1m. What was hailed as the
star turn, a painting of five male bathers, fetched Pounds 3.025m.
Pellerin was one of the earliest and most passionate collectors of Cezanne.
Between 1895 and 1925 he amassed more than 100 works by the master - many
now hang in leading museums.
The sale demonstrates that there is still demand for exceptional works of
art - particularly those with a distinguished provenance. It also witnesses
a new discrimination among buyers.
A watercolour drawing of another of Cezanne's favourite motifs, the Mont
Sainte-Victoire, also sold well, realising Pounds 1.43m. A large oil and
distemper 'intimiste' interior by Vuillard made Pounds 1.54m.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  The board should meet regularly, retain fill and effective control
     over the company and monitor the executive management.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2  There should be a clearly accepted division of responsibilities at
     the head of a company, which will ensure a balance of power and
     authority, such that no one individual has unfettered powers of
     decision.  Where the chairman is also the Chief executive, it is
     essential that there should be a strong and independent element
     on the board, with a recognised senior member.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3  The board should include non-executive directors of sufficient
     calibre and number for their views to carry significant weight
     in the board's decisions.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4  The board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically
     reserved to it for decision to ensure that the direction and
     control of the company is firmly in its hands
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5  There should be an agreed procedure for directors in the
     furtherance of their duties to take independent professsional
     advice if necessary, at the company's expense
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6  All directors should have access to the advice and services of the
     company secretary, who is responsible to the board for ensuring
     that board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and
     regulations are compiled with.  Any question of the removal of the
     company secretary should be a matter for the board as a whole.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1  Non-executive directors should bring an independent judgment to
     bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources - including
     key appointments - and standards of conduct.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2  The majority should be independent of management and free from
     any business or other relationship which could materially
     interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment, apart
     from their fees and shareholding.  Their fees should reflect the
     time which they commit to the company.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3  Non-executive directors should be appointed for specified terms
     and reappointment should not be automatic.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4  Non-executive directors should be selected through a formal
     process and both this process and their appointment should be a
     matter for the board as a whole.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                         EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1  Directors' service contracts should not exceed three years without
     shareholders' approval.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2  There should be full and clear disclosure of directors' total
     emoluments and those of the chairman and highest paid UK director,
     including pension contributions and stock options.  Separate
     figures should be given for salary and performance-related
     elements and the basis on which performance is measured should be
     explained.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3  Executive directors' pay should be subject to the recommendations
     of a remuneration committee made up wholly or mainly of
     non-executive directors.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      REPORTING AND CONTROLS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1  It is the board's duty to present a balanced and understandable
     assessment of the company's position.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2  The board should ensure than an objective and professional
     relationship is maintained with the auditors.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3  The board should establish an audit committee of at least three
     non-executive directors with written terms of reference which
     deal clearly with its authority and duties.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4  The directors should explain their responsibility for preparing
     the accounts (in a note) next to a statement by the auditors about
     their reporting responsibilities.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5  The directors should report on the effectiveness of the company's
     system of internal control.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6  The directors should report that the business is a going concern,
     with supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Soley hearings on press under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MP Mr Clive Soley stepped up his campaign yesterday for a statutory
body to handle complaints against newspapers when he held the first of a
series of parliamentary public hearings on freedom and responsibility of the
press, Jimmy Burns writes.
Evidence was submitted by victims of inaccurate press reporting to a
cross-party committee as part of a privately funded inquiry into the likely
impact of Mr Soley's bill.
Mr Soley said there was a 'growing consensus' that the statutory provision
of the right to correct inaccuracies in newspaper reporting was the only way
of making the newspaper industry 'acknowledge the failure of
self-regulation'.
Those giving evidence yesterday included a former maid of Princess Anne
wrongly accused of having stolen her employer's private letters, and a
former Northern Irish journalist who gave evidence in camera because his
life had been threatened as a result of a misleading newspaper report.
Mr Soley's Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill has its second
reading in the House of Commons on January 29 and the committee will take
further evidence from newspaper editors and the Press Complaints Commission.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM 'was unaware' of Matrix probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major emphasised yesterday that he had been unaware of the
government's investigation into exports of machine tools to Iraq by Matrix
Churchill until after the invasion of Kuwait, Philip Stephens writes.
In a parliamentary answer to Mr George Robertson, the Labour foreign affairs
spokesman, Mr Major said he was first told of the investigation in October
1990.
The prime minister also revealed that Mr Richard Ryder, now the chief whip,
had been the Treasury's representative at a ministerial meeting in July 1990
that decided to relax the guidelines restricting defence-related sales to
Iraq. Mr Major said his preoccupation at that time as chancellor was with
the annual public-spending negotiations.
His answer said he had seen a minute in August 1990 referring to Matrix
Churchill but he had 'no recollection' of seeing earlier papers copied to
the Treasury referring to the company's activities.
The implication of the answer - although it was not spelt out in the reply -
was that as foreign secretary during 1989 he had not seen any papers
relating to the exports.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht debate dominated by
treaty's critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS SETTLED into the marathon debate over the detailed provisions of the
Maastricht treaty legislation in the Commons last night at a pace that will
please the Euro-sceptics and confirm the worst fears of those seeking an
early agreement.
Insisting on painstaking attention to procedure and detail, the treaty's
opponents dominated the floor from the outset, taking the first hour and 32
minutes entirely on points of order.
But MPs were assured a relatively early finish on this first day of the
committee stage, when the government chose not to force a trial of strength
by moving that the debate continue beyond 10pm.
When proceedings wound up on the stroke of ten, Mr Bill Cash, the arch Tory
Euro-sceptic was still speaking, having risen nearly two-and-a-half hours
earlier. A Conservative whip provoked mass hilarity by formally reporting
'the committee has made progress.'
Of the 45 initial interventions, barely half a dozen were from supporters of
the bill. Several prominent anti-Maastricht MPs - including Mr Bill Cash, Mr
Tony Marlow, and Sir Teddy Taylor spoke three times. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a
key critic of the treaty, topped the scoring with five interventions.
Both Labour and Tory MPs repeatedly sought clarification from the chair as
to how they could ensure that the Commons was given the right to debate
whether a referendum might be held on the treaty.
Arguing for a referendum amendment to be taken, Sir Teddy Taylor said: 'I
fear that this bill has been drafted in such a way as to prevent members of
the House of Commons in expressing a view.'
Government claims to have isolated Britain from any federalist developments
in the European Community were disputed by both supporters and opponents of
the treaty.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister in charge of the European
Communities (Amendment) Bill which seeks to embody some provisions of the
treaty in UK domestic law, was caught in a withering crossfire from the
government and opposition benches.
Sir Russell Johnston, spokesman for the Liberal Democrats and an
enthusiastic advocate of a federalist Europe, urged the government to drop
its attempt to disguise the federal implications of the treaty.
He moved an amendment seeking to include in the bill a provision of the
treaty which the government had deliberately excluded.
Mr Bernard Jenkin (C Colchester North) asked: 'Are you suggesting that the
government is seeking to sell the treaty on a somewhat false prospectus?'.
After a momentary hesitation Sir Russell replied: 'I can pretty nearly say
yes.'
He repudiated ministerial assertions that the inclusion of the so-called
subsidiarity principle had strengthened the position of national governments
and parliaments. Sir Russell insisted that the majority of Britain's
community partners took a 'significantly' different view of subsidiarity
believing it to be an instrument for use in a federalist structure.
Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches agreed with Mr Tony Benn (Lab
Chesterfield), a consistent opponent of Britain's membership of the EC, that
by omitting some provisions of the treaty from the bill the government was
hoping to prevent the British people knowing the 'enormity' of what was
involved.
Mr Garel-Jones maintained that the purpose of the bill was to bring into
British law those elements of the Maastricht treaty not involving amendment
of the Treaty of Rome under which the EC was established.
He appealed to Sir Russell to withdraw his amendment.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs trawl for pearls of wisdom -
How backbench members use written questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS among the most potent weapons in every backbencher's arsenal. But, as
Iraqgate has underlined, it is best deployed with foresight and with
stealth.
The written question is the mechanism through which the most humble MP can
most frequently demand at least a scintilla of ministerial attention.
Although they get relatively few opportunities to speak in parliamentary
debates or to question ministers face-to-face in the Commons chamber,
backbenchers can fire off written questions like rounds from a Gatling gun.
Literally tens of thousands are tabled every year on subjects ranging from
the central tenets of foreign and economic policy to the prevalence of
fish-eating ducks in Northern Ireland.
The 'written question champ' in the 1991-92 parliamentary session was Mr
Paul Flynn, the bearded and garrulous Labour MP for Newport West, with a
personal quota of 441. That statistic emerged - where else? - in a written
answer. But as new MPs quickly learn, they will seldom glean anything
worthwhile from simply jotting down the first question that comes into their
head and tabling it.
Squadrons of civil servants are used by government departments to field
questions as they come in, to analyse them for pitfalls and to draft a
suggested response or a menu of options. Extracting pearls of wisdom usually
entails outwitting these ministerial 'minders'. If all else fails,
departments can fall back on tried and trusted obstructive formulae such as:
'This information is not centrally held'; or 'This information can only be
supplied at disproportionate cost.'
Past masters of the question-poser's art such as Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour
MP for Linlithgow, speak of the need for extreme tenacity if an answer of
substance is to be elicited on a sensitive subject area.
'Part of the reason (my questions) are effective is that I then use them in
oral debate,' Mr Dalyell says. Experienced backbenchers will submit written
questions to get a ministerial comment 'on the record'.
Some of the criticism the government has endured as the arms-to-Iraq saga
has unfolded has been on the basis of written answers that seemed
unremarkable at the time that they were tabled.
Some of the previously classified documents released during the Matrix
Churchill trial appear to consist of civil servants' advice to ministers and
others regarding specific written questions.
One of the documents deals with a question tabled in November 1989 by
Labour's Ms Marjorie Mowlam, asking what investigations the Department of
Trade and Industry had undertaken into Matrix Churchill and the
'possibility' that it was supplying parts to Iraq 'which could be used in
ballistic missile development'.
The answer - 'All export licence applications are examined carefully. I have
no reason to believe that the company has contravened UK export controls' -
was deemed 'a firm reply' by the DTI official who proposed it.
It did not spell out - as the official's background comments made clear -
that some of Matrix's export licence applications to ship products to Iraq
had been 'the subject of Ministerial exchanges before licences were
granted'.
An answer supplied at about the same time to Labour's Mr Dale
Campbell-Savours seems to give an even less complete picture of official
views on the subject addressed, although it is no doubt factually correct.
The question concerned what representations the foreign secretary had
received as to 'the activities of Dr Sadel Jawed Kadhum in relation to Iraqi
intelligence matters'. The answer by Mr Francis Maude, then foreign office
minister - was: 'None.'
A page of notes released in the Matrix trial marked 'secret' but whose
precise provenance is not clear, refers to 'Mr Campbell-Savours' questions'
and notes: 'Circumstantial evidence . . suggests that (Dr Kadhum) may well
have links with Iraqi intelligence activities.'
Answers supplied to two further questions by Mr Campbell-Savours asking
first whether the foreign office had ever given anyone else information
about Dr Kadhum's relationship with Iraqi intelligence and second whether it
had ever met him to discuss Iraqi intelligence matters were respectively
'No' and 'No.'

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over Lamont's legal fees
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR kept up the pressure on the government over Mr Norman Lamont's
personal legal costs yesterday by demanding that the prime minister should
consult parliament over new guidelines on the use of public funds.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, argued that the decision by the
National Audit Office, the independent watchdog on government spending, to
hold an investigation into the payment, and the fact that the NAO had not
been told specifically about it, meant that there was an urgent need for new
ministerial guidelines.
In a letter to the chancellor Mr Brown also said that Mr Lamont should have
consulted the law officers before taking action last year through his
private solicitors, and asked for a note of what their advice had been. The
rules for ministers stated that the law officers should be consulted before
ministers' own solicitors, so that they could express a view about how far
the public interest was involved or take charge of the proceedings, he said.
The row arose from Mr Lamont's action last year to evict a self-styled 'sex
therapist' from his London home.
Mr Brown also queried what information was provided to the National Audit
Office. The NAO's investigation into the Pounds 4,700 government
contribution to the Pounds 23,000 legal bill was announced on Monday.
The National Audit Office said yesterday that the terms of its inquiry were
into 'the basis behind the payment; how the amount was apportioned; and the
way the money was accounted for'.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour-union link strained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party's relations with the trade unions came under further strain
yesterday, with the AEEU craft union's dissent against the outline final
report of the party committee reviewing union links. It said it would, if
necessary, produce a minority report to the National Executive Committee.
Mr Nigel Harris, the AEEU official who sits on the union links committee,
said the union strongly objected to dropping the idea of one-member-one-vote
for the election of leader and deputy leader and for the selection of
parliamentary candidates.
The union links committee report instead backed the idea of a new category
of 'registered supporter' - union members who want to do more than pay the
political levy but do not want to be full members - who would have a role in
the elections for the leadership and for local candidates.
That idea is backed by several members of the committee, by the GMB general
union and Nupe the public-services union, and by senior Labour party
officials.
Mr Harris said it was unworkable and undemocratic. He also said it would
revive the spectre of 'entryism' and provide ammunition for Conservatives
who are keen to force unions to change to a system of 'contracting in' to
the political levy.
Mr Harris said that several other members of the committee, including Mr
Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, rejected the idea of registered
supporters and also pointed to the public support for one-member-one-vote
from Mr John Smith, the party leader.
The issue threatens to create a new fault-line within the party, but a new
draft of the final report due to be presented to another meeting of the
links committee today is unlikely to include any fundamental change.
Mr Harris says, though, that if the final report, to be sent to the NEC in
January, does not include the option of one-member-one-vote, those who
support the idea will produce a minority report.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Shephard firm on Tec funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULTIES in imple-menting the government's guarantee of a job or a
training place for all school leavers arose from a lack of capacity among
employers in some areas and not lack of central funding, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, employment secretary, told the Commons yesterday.
Insisting that there was no shortage of resources, she said they were
sufficient to provide 244,000 places while demand was estimated at 216,000.
Mrs Shephard said she had written to Mr Ron Leighton, the Labour chairman of
the Commons employment committee, explaining how the guarantee was being
met.
Miss Joan Lestor (Lab Eccles), highlighted the difficulties caused in
implementing the guarantee in the Salford area by the growing number of
company failures.
When Mr Stephen Milligan (C Eastleigh) said 1,000 people in Hampshire were
unable to get a training place, Mrs Shephard acknowledged the difficulty
faced by employers in some areas.
'They will be helped to meet the guarantee by the end of this month,' she
said.
Mrs Shephard also emphasised that there was always a 'surge of demand' in
the autumn, when young people sought training places.
Reaffirming that the government stood by the guarantee, she said adequate
resources were available to training and enterprise councils (Tecs) and
their Scottish equivalents (Lecs). She undertook to examine any complaints
that adequate funds were not available and said the local initiative fund
which allowed Tecs and Lecs to develop new ideas in support of training and
business growth would be increased by Pounds 12m in 1993-94.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Regulator accuses British Gas over
sale to generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES MCKINNON, the gas industry regulator, yesterday accused British
Gas of selling large quantities of gas to power generators at below the cost
of new supplies, so precipitating the 'Dash for Gas'.
In strongly-worded evidence Sir James told the trade and industry committee
that British Gas underestimated the likely demand from power generators in
1990. In its keenness to win a share of the power market British Gas set the
first of its two pricing schedules for generators too low.
While the average cost of North Sea gas delivered to the shore to British
Gas in 1990-91 was 18.2p per therm, the company set its first schedule for
generators at 16.1p per therm. Compared with the later, 'more
market-orientated' price schedule of 19.6p, Sir James said, it could be
argued that the initial price represented an 'opportunity cost to the
company of 3.5p per therm'.
'On the 1bn therms sold at 16.1p per therm over 15-year contract lives this
represents a cost to British Gas of some Pounds 525m,' he said.
'British Gas set a price . . . which was lower than the delivered cost of
new gas supplies and hence considerably lower than appropriate to balance
supply and demand . . . The pricing policy of British Gas thus created
demand for gas for electricity generation that might not otherwise have been
economically justified.'
British Gas told the committee last month Sir James had forced it to supply
four more power generating projects than it wanted to, by compelling it to
lower its second price schedule, which it had set artificially high to try
to choke off excess demand from generators.
Sir James said Ofgas had merely fulfilled its legal obligations, following
guidelines issued by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after its
investigation into the industrial gas market in 1988.
'It was British Gas that decided to enter the power generation market, and
set the price at incorrectly low levels. Ofgas, as regulator, simply ensured
that British Gas then treated all customers the same despite its attempt to
revert to the discriminatory policies it practised before 1988.'
British Gas said last night it had not had time to study Sir James's
evidence and could not comment. It suggested that his comments demonstrated
the lack of understanding between British Gas and the regulator and
justified the decision last August to refer the UK gas market to a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Scottish success paves the way to N-power privatisation: The
atomic energy industry's balance sheets look healthier north of the border
James Buxton discovers
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVES AT Scottish Nuclear have reason to be irritated by criticism of
Britain's nuclear generating industry over the past few weeks. The words
most commonly used are 'loss-making' and 'heavily subsidised'.
It is true that Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company operating nuclear
plants in England and Wales, received a Pounds 1.2bn subsidy last year from
the 11 per cent levy on electricity bills in England and Wales. Without
that, its operating profit of Pounds 482m in 1991-92 would have been a loss
of nearly Pounds 800m.
But Scottish Nuclear, which runs Scotland's nuclear power stations, is
neither loss-making nor subsidised. There is no nuclear levy in Scotland.
The government wrote off Pounds 1.3bn of Scottish Nuclear's debt in 1990,
but Nuclear Electric was launched without debt. In 1991-92 Scottish Nuclear
made a small profit and it aims to be sufficiently profitable to be saleable
by about 1996.
Scottish Nuclear started with several advantages. Nuclear Electric needs the
levy to pay for the decommissioning of its Magnox stations, while Scottish
Nuclear already has provisions to cover its one Magnox plant - Hunterston A
in Ayrshire, which is closed. Thanks to government grants, the cost of
decommissioning Hunterston A is excluded from Scottish Nuclear's
profit-and-loss account.
Furthermore, of Scottish Nuclear's two advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR)
plants, Hunterston B has long been the most productive AGR station in
Britain, while Torness in East Lothian achieved its design output in record
time after opening in 1989. They supply about 40 per cent of Scotland's
electricity under 15-year contracts with ScottishPower and Scottish
Hydro-Electric.
Since Scottish Nuclear was formed from ScottishPower in 1989, with the
businessman Mr James Hann becoming chairman, the company has played a
leading part in rehabilitating the image of the nuclear industry. Television
advertisements and posters proclaim the environmental friendliness of
nuclear power. Last year the company took 20,000 visitors through its
stations.
Although Torness has had difficulty in commissioning its refuelling system
and Hunterston B is undergoing mid-life maintenance, total output, which had
reached 14m gigawatts an hour in 1989-90, is moving upwards again, reaching
12.7m GWH last year, with 14.2m GWH expected this year.
according to Mr Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive who joined Scottish
Nuclear from ScottishPower in March, the recovery in output helped the
company to move from a net loss of Pounds 32.5m in 1990-91 to last year's
profit of Pounds 13.7m on sales of Pounds 477m. This year's target is a
profit of Pounds 20m.
In the medium term, Scottish Nuclear's financial performance should gain
substantially from one of Mr Hann's main initiatives. Last year he said the
only instructions he received when appointed by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then
Scottish secretary, were 'to give hell to those bloody Sassenachs
(Englishmen) at BNFL' which supplies and reprocesses SNL's fuel.
Mr Hann questioned the need for the expensive reprocessing of spent AGR
fuel. Now, in a break with British nuclear industry practice agreed with
BNFL his year, SNL will end reprocessing and store spent fuel at its
stations for at least 50 years.
SNL should save Pounds 40m a year when the stores, each costing about Pounds
15m, enter service in 1995 and 1996. A public inquiry into the Torness store
began yesterday but most local opinion is favourable.
SNL will also try to persuade the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to
extend the theoretical life of its stations from 30 to 35 years, reducing
the annual Pounds 65m depreciation charge. That should be achieved during or
before the next financial year.
To improve efficiency, the company has set up 30 employee groups to find
better ways of doing things, and aims to lower its cost per unit of
electricity (before accounting for historic liabilities) from last year's
figure of 3.21p to 3p this year - comparable with coal - and to 2.5p by
1994-95. Mr Jeffrey says: 'This is a very aggressive target but it is
realistic. We want consistently to achieve an 80 per cent load factor' -
last year Hunterston was on 66 per cent and Torness on 55 per cent.
SNL hopes to cut controllable production costs in 1992-93 from Pounds 133m
last year to Pounds 123m. It expects between 200 and 300 of its 2,000 staff
to take voluntary early retirement in the next year or so.
If things go according to plan, and SNL does not encounter any costly
technical snags, Mr Jeffrey believes the company would be fit to enter the
private sector by about 1996, either through flotation or a trade sale.
'We could be the pathfinder for the privatisation of the nuclear industry,'
he says. 'We are a much more straightforward company to float than NE. But
to make it happen the government would probably have to retain ownership of
Hunterston A, which we would then decommission under contract.'
SNL hoped the review of the nuclear industry, which the government promised
for 1994, would pave the way for privatisation. Now, with energy policy
under review by the Department of Trade and Industry after the climb-down on
pit closures, the nuclear industry's future is uncertain.
SNL says the government needs an energy policy to meet the resource and
environmental constraints the world will face next century.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Labour doubts on sale of PSA arm to Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR YESTERDAY expressed concern over the sale of the Property Services
Agency's projects division to Tarmac, the construction and building
materials group.
Mr Doug Henderson, a local-government spokesman, has tabled a series of
parliamentary questions requesting details of any meetings that may have
taken place between Tarmac and the PSA board before the sale took place.
The issue has arisen because of concern about what the government agreed to
pay Tarmac to take over the projects division, which had a number of problem
contracts and was in danger of closure.
Mr Henderson said in a letter to Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, that the government had disclosed that Tarmac had been paid or
guaranteed Pounds 120m of public money to take over the division.
He requested information on whether an additional Pounds 130m had been
promised to Tarmac in settlement of disputes arising from the construction
of the Trident base at Faslane, in Scotland and Howell Grange Prison in
Leeds.
Tarmac said that the responsibility for managing the Trident contract had
been left with the Ministry of Defence as part of the sale agreement. Any
settlement, therefore, would be the responsibility of ministry and not
Tarmac.
It also denied that it would receive Pounds 120m from the purchase. It said
that that had been made clear in a parliamentary answer given Mr John
Redwood, environment minister, on November 25.
'Initially we will receive Pounds 54.9m to cover unpaid bills owed by the
PSA and to meet the cost of putting the business on a commercial footing. A
further Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m could be paid to cover contingencies such
as redundancies for some of the workers taken on under the sale.'
Confusion has arisen because the government also has to meet the cost of
redundancies of former PSA workers who have not been taken on by Tarmac. The
company will take on 850 of the division's 1,900 workers.
The cost of redundancies of workers not employed by Tarmac has been
estimated by Mr Redwood at between Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m. In addition,
the government has agreed to guarantee future redundancy payments of former
PSA workers in the unlikely event of Tarmac going bust in the next five
years.
Ministers have also agreed to provide money to bring pension-fund benefits
for former employees in line with what they would have received if they had
remained in the public sector.
Tarmac emphasised that none of that money would be coming to the group and
was entirely the responsibility of government.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Machine-tool exporters act over customs delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S machine-tool industry is seeking urgent talks with the government
to discuss growing concerns that customs delays are hurting the industry's
exports.
The Machine Tool Technologies Association has written to Mr Richard Needham,
trade minister, to express concern that machine tools have been delayed at
docks even when they have had the correct customs documents.
The association's plea underlines the suspicions of some machine-tool
companies that in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair, exports to some
countries in the Middle East and Asia are being singled out for delay.
One industry source said: 'There certainly seems to be a connection. Customs
are very touchy about anything that says 'machine tool' on it.'
In recent weeks Mr Keith Bailey, the chairman of BSA Tools, and Mr Iain
Exeter, the joint managing director of Wickman Machine Tools, have both
complained publicly about delays in receiving export licences for selling
machine tools to Iran.
Wickman went into receivership in September, and Mr Exeter blamed that on
customs delays.
Mr Bailey is waiting for approval for a potential Pounds 150m UK-Iran joint
venture to produce UK lathes under licence in Iran.
The association says some of the equipment being held up by Customs and
Excise does not require an export licence.
It is worried that UK machine-tool makers will be unable to give guarantees
to customers that deliveries will not be held up. This might cause them to
miss vital export opportunities in the middle of a recession.
The association's letter does not specify the export markets involved or the
individual exporting companies.
On Friday, the DTI said again that its revised special licensing procedures
for countries such as Iran and Pakistan, which were introduced in October,
would lead to extra delays in processing export licences.
UK machine tool exports to Iran slipped to Pounds 2.3m in the first half of
this year from Pounds 3.8m a year earlier.
Italy's exports to Iran nearly trebled to L35.8bn (Pounds 17m) from L13.2bn
during the same period, according to Ucimu, the Italian machine tool
association.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Pensions charter group launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE union-backed Charter for Pension Fund Democracy was launched formally
yesterday at a meeting of 300 pension fund trustees. The meeting was held to
debate the charter's evidence to the Goode committee on pension fund reform,
set up in the wake of the Robert Maxwell affair.
The charter has called for a new Pensions Act that would require the
majority of trustees of any occupational scheme to be elected by members of
the scheme and would prevent contribution rates and benefits from being
unilaterally altered by companies.
Ms Anne Simpson, one of the charter leaders, said that many of the
difficulties faced by the 11m members of pension schemes did not stem from
fraudulent activity but from the current legal framework 'which puts all the
cards in employers' hands'.
Professor Ray Goode, chairman of the Goode committee which is due to report
in June, attended the conference with several members of the committee. The
deadline for submissions to the committee is December 15.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said pension scheme
members had alarmingly little control or protection over what was an
important part of their pay.
He added: 'But employers have a battery of resources at their command and a
very strong vested interest in maintaining the status quo, as do the
so-called 'independent experts', who are often neither independent or even
competent, let alone expert.'

<TEXT>
TALKS have started between two of the largest Civil Service unions about
closer co-operation that might lead to a merger.
The leaders of the 50,000-strong Inland Revenue Staff Federation and
100,000-strong National Union of Civil and Public Servants insist that the
talks are not formal merger discussions.
The core membership of the NUCPS is in Customs and Excise and, combined with
the Inland Revenue employees, a merged union would cover almost all
government revenues. The biggest obstacle is that the Inland Revenue would
not approve of it and might de-recognise a combined union.
The two unions have different political traditions. The IRSF has a moderate
leadership and the NUCPS has, until recently, been dominated by left-wing
Labour and Communist sympathisers.
NUCPS, unlike the IRSF, has been losing members heavily and is carrying a
large deficit.
All Civil Service unions face upheaval because of the contracting out of
government work and devolution of pay bargaining. Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF
leader, yesterday predicted that within five years all Civil Service unions
would be in a single federation.
A federation in which unions retain their independence but share certain
functions such as research and media relations was launched yesterday by the
IPMS Civil Service union, the CMA postal managers union and the STE telecom
managers union.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Sheerness dockers vote for strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of the 600 dock workers at the Port of Sheerness, on the
Thames, the country's largest car and fruit port, yesterday voted to strike
over a new contract of employment that will reduce their earnings by up to
10 per cent.
The new contracts are designed to preserve jobs by making pay cuts rather
than redundancies, which is the method most companies use if forced to cut
their wages bill.
Worst affected at Sheerness will be the 200 former registered dock workers
who will lose up to Pounds 2,500 a year on salaries that were more than
Pounds 20,000 a year.
Their revised contracts at the port replace a two-shift system, which
carried extra shift payments on basic pay, and introduces a more flexible
roster obliging them to work 39 hours a week and to be available for work
between 6am and 10pm for five days a week.
Mr Steve Swords, a shop steward, said most workers objected to the new
hours, which he said 'restored Victorian conditions'.
Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive of Medway Ports, said: 'Everybody is
taking a pay cut, including me. We have a highly skilled and productive
workforce. We want to retain them but we have to be competitive.'
It is understood that Medway Port's management has contingency plans to keep
the docks open if there is a strike.
Medway Ports was created in a management buy-out in March this year. The new
shareholders included two thirds of the workforce.
Cuts in pay have been relatively rare, even during the present recession,
but in recent months radical changes in terms and conditions have resulted
in reductions in pay for several groups of workers.
Among these are:
About 30 per cent of employees at London Underground will have their pay cut
over the next few years under a new working plan.
Staff at the new retail arm of South West Electricity will have their pay
reduced when their terms of employment are switched from those negotiated
centrally in the electricity supply industry to terms similar to the retail
industry.
Ninety workers at Middlebrook Mushrooms, a subsidiary of Booker, the food
group, will have to work longer hours for no increase in pay, which the
unions say is effectively a pay cut.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Gulf war bill expected to top Pounds 1.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NET cost to Britain of the Gulf war early last year is expected to
exceed Pounds 1.4bn, in spite of more than Pounds 2bn of financial
assistance from other countries.
A report by the National Audit Office, parliament's public-spending
watchdog, includes estimates of up to Pounds 850m the Export Credits
Guarantee Department may have to pay on insurance claims connected with
events in the Gulf in 1990-91.
The watchdog notes that the Ministry of Defence's accounting and forecasting
systems did not always readily provide the information it needed to compile
the report, saying the final costs are 'still subject to uncertainties'.
It puts the net military cost at a minimum of Pounds 615m, although at one
stage it seemed that the ministry might register a profit from the campaign.
The total military cost of Britain's participation in the campaign is put at
Pounds 2.64bn. That includes a bill of Pounds 529m for replenishing stocks
after the war and Pounds 200m worth of aircraft and munitions the ministry
decided not to replace.
It also includes an estimated Pounds 336m worth of savings the ministry lost
by having to defer cuts planned under its Options for Change programme.
Against those costs, a total of Pounds 2.15bn has been received in cash
contributions from allies, principally from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Germany and Japan.
Almost Pounds 1bn was spent on procurement for the campaign, including
special armament purchases, repairs and modifications to equipment.
Transport of personnel and supplies alone cost Pounds 270m, and the forces
ran up a Pounds 24m telecommunications bill.
The watchdog says 19 of the 1,200 civilian vehicles leased or hired during
Operation Granby - the British contribution to forces in the Gulf - have
still not been traced.
It acknowledges that the armed forces were faced with 'an enormous task' in
planning and managing deployments on such a scale.
It says that many early contracts in Saudi Arabia were 'drawn up by service
personnel inexperienced in contractual issues and under operational
pressures.' That included paying 'very large annual rents' totalling some
Pounds 35m to secure property requirements.
Ministry of Defence: The Costs and Receipts Arising from the Gulf Conflict.
Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. HMSO. Pounds 5.95.

THE Unit Trust Association has called for proposals on unit trust disclosure

withdrawn. It says they will confuse investors and add unnecessarily to
costs.
Lautro was required to produce unit trust disclosure rules as part of the
Securities and Investments Board's review of retail regulation. The review
has already devised exhaustive disclosure rules for life assurance products.
The association says the proposed rules are appropriate for life assurance
but inappropriate for unit trusts and 'will take an essentially simple

FT  02 DEC 92 / Forecast of Lloyd's US losses attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR UNDERWRITERS at Lloyd's of London have described independent
estimates of the insurance market's potential losses from liabilities for US
pollution and industrial diseases as 'grossly misleading', Richard Lapper
writes.
Chatset, the company that analyses Lloyd's results, said on Tuesday that it
might cost Lloyd's Pounds 5.3bn to settle claims on the market's 162 'open
years' - which occur when a syndicate cannot close its accounts because of
uncertainty about future claims.
Mr Richard Youell, an underwriter, said Chatset's assessment of his own
syndicate's open year of 1989 was 'wholly contrary to our views on the
syndicate's future development'.
Mr David Foster, of the Lloyd's pollution committee, said Chatset's figures
had 'no scientific basis'.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Scrapyard no longer end of the road for cars: How BMW's
recycling plant is opening in the face of uncertainty from the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW AND a vehicle salvage company specialising in the German executive cars
yesterday jointly opened the UK's first dedicated car dismantling and
recycling plant.
The plant is relatively small - it has a capacity of 2,500 cars a year  -
but BMW says it is the most advanced in the world and is a potential model
for the car and materials reclamation industries to undertake systematic
recycling of the 14m cars scrapped annually in Europe.
The plant at Bolney, West Sussex is intended to be the first of a network of
about 15 that BMW wants to develop in the UK with a number of partners.
Before the end of the decade it should be processing most of the 16,000 BMWs
scrapped in the UK annually. A second plant is to open next year and a
further five in 1994.
The plant is opening when the obstacles faced by European legislators and
carmakers in seeking a harmonised approach to recycling are becoming
increasingly apparent.
Rover Group is the only UK-based manufacturer to have announced a full
recycling research programme in Britain. It is co-operating with Bird Group,
one of Europe's largest materials reclamation and recycling concerns, on
dismantling and recycling trials at Bird's headquarters near
Stratford-upon-Avon. They expect a demonstration facility to be operating
next year.
Like Fiat of Italy, however, Rover believes efficient plants will need to be
much larger than the BMW-style ones and to be capable of dismantling all
makes of vehicle if satisfactory economies of scale are to be achieved.
Volkswagen, Mercedes, Fiat and some other European manufacturers have set up
or are preparing recycling ventures on the Continent in the expectation of
EC-wide legislation governing car scrapping and recycling by 1995.
Fiat this week emphasised its unease at what it sees as the haphazard manner
vehicle recycling is advancing in the absence of a clear lead from Brussels.
Mr Paulo Cantarella, chief executive of Fiat Auto, said some recycling
initiatives 'could produce systems that are both costly and inefficient
since they are based on insignificant volumes'.
Such criticism was rejected yesterday by BMW executives and Bolney Motors,
BMW's partner in the venture.
They see it and subsequent facilities as offering a practical means of
tackling vehicle disposal.
For parts and materials reclamation partners such as Bolney Motors, it is
seen as a significant commercial opportunity. EC legislation is expected to
require disposal certificates for every car produced to ensure that they end
their lives only at an authorised dismantling and recycling centre.
There is now little regulation of the way vehicles are scrapped, with only
50 per cent finding their way to authorised scrapyards. The Bolney plant
will help take the industry closer to its target of being able to recycle
nearly 100 per cent of each car, unlike the average of about 75 per cent now
and the 82 per cent BMW claims for its latest 3-Series, largely as a result
of greater use of plastics which can be easily recycled.
Cars arriving for disposal are hoisted aloft in a purpose-built bay where
fluids are drained and the battery removed. From there, they undergo a
progressive dismantling process.
Parts and materials that cannot be sold through Bolney Motors' normal
used-parts sales channels are sent to specialised companies for recycling.
Since last year, BMW (GB) has been sending used or damaged plastic bumpers
and catalytic convertors back to Germany for recycling.
Following traditional trading patterns, many engines and transmissions are
remanufactured for re-supply through BMW's dealer networks.
The stripped body shell is cut up for delivery to a conventional shredder
facility prior to recycling.
Dismantling takes between two and seven hours, representing a Pounds
40-Pounds 140 cost in time alone. With transport and investment costs added,
BMW is assuming an average disposal cost per car of Pounds 175.
Thus while EC legislation is expected to place the onus on manufacturers to
ensure that vehicles are effectively disposed of, the industry is arguing
that owners should share the responsibility because the worst-kept cars
could have a negative value.
That might mean a car's final owner paying for disposal, according to Dr
Wolf.

It did not rule out buying empty new houses or repossessed homes.
The trust added that repossessed homes were often in a poor state of repair
because of the financial position of former owners.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Eurotunnel warns it may sue over rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, yesterday warned that
his company would consider suing the government if railway privatisation cut
the amount of rail traffic expected to use the Channel tunnel.
Sir Alastair said he feared that the privatisation plans in their present
form were in danger of driving rail freight on to the roads and cutting the
investment needed to build new lines.
The result was likely to be less rail freight going through the Channel
tunnel and insufficient capacity for increases in the number of Channel
tunnel expresses, so cutting Eurotunnel's revenues.
Sir Alastair was speaking in advance of today's meeting of the Commons
transport committee, where he is due to appear as a witness on railway
privatisation.
He said Eurotunnel would hold the government liable if its revenues suffered
through changes in the conditions under which the Channel tunnel concession
agreement was drawn up in 1986.
Since privatisation was not on the government's agenda in 1986, that
constituted a change in conditions - and Sir Alastair said he was convinced
the effects would be adverse.
Although British Rail and SNCF, the French national railway, have undertaken
to buy 50 per cent of the Channel tunnel's capacity, part of the fees
Eurotunnel receives will depend on how many trains pass through and how much
they carry.
Sir Alastair said BR's plans to create a track-owning body and to introduce
track charges for freight and passenger trains would price most freight
traffic off the rails.
He also feared that privatisation would lead to a fall in railway
investment, so worsening the prospects of action to relieve the capacity
shortage on railway lines to and from the tunnel.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Barclays defends lending policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank firmly rejected criticism of its small-business lending
policies yesterday, although it admitted that it has widened the average
margin on small-business loans from 2.9 percentage points to 3.4 points over
the past 18 months.
The bank published extracts from evidence to the renewed inquiry on lending
to small businesses by high street banks which is being conducted by the
Treasury and the Bank of England. It said the increased margin was needed to
cover losses.
Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of Barclays' banking division, said the
figures showed that the bank had acted responsibly during the recession.
Losses in lending to small businesses meant that it had to widen margins.
'The increases have been modest, particularly bearing in mind the fact that
the bank has passed on all base-rate cuts in full to its customers,' said Mr
Gordon.
Barclays said the report it passed to the Treasury showed that only a third
of the bank's business customers borrowed.
The typical margin for loans to businesses with turnover up to Pounds
250,000 was now 3.4 percentage points above base rate.

reaches retirement on December 22, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Mr Rangarajan, 60, was deputy governor of the Reserve Bank for 10 years

He rejoins amid controversy that the bank failed to exercise regulatory
controls on Indian and foreign banks involved in the Rs35bn (Pounds 820m)
Bombay financial scandal.
The role of the central bank in the scandal is being investigated by a
parliamentary committee which questioned Mr Venkitaramanan last week, but
failed to establish allegations by MPs that he had been personally involved
in the scandal.
Mr Rangarajan, an academic before he joined the bank in 1981, is widely
regarded as a monetary expert and has been associated with India's economic
reforms.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Hong Kong business cools on democracy plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT among Hong Kong's business community for Mr Chris Patten, the
colony's governor, is rapidly evaporating in the face of the concerted
opposition from Beijing to his proposals for more democracy in Hong Kong.
Many business people were alarmed by China's effective halt of the future
development of the colony's container port by its threat last week not to
honour the Hong Kong government's proposed plans for expansion of the port.
This concern was heightened on Monday when Beijing said that all agreements
entered into by the Hong Kong government would be invalid after 1997 if not
agreed to by China. Business people took little comfort from China's
assurance that it continued to welcome foreign investment in the colony.
Business people believe that Mr Patten is acting precipitately in his
attitude toward China and has embarked on a quest that has little or no
chance of success. China, they claim, may compromise on economic issues when
it is in its interests to do so, but not on matters of politics.
Influential figures among the British business community in Hong Kong fear
that Mr Patten has gone about dealing with China in a confrontational way
which has succeeded only in hardening Beijing's resistance to his ideas for
limited democracy in the colony.
'Confronting China head-on is not the way to deal with the Chinese,' said
the head of one large diversified trading company. 'He has given them no
room for manoeuvre.'
Few business leaders, either British or Chinese, will speak publicly about
their disquiet. In private, however, many are concerned about possible
Chinese retaliation which could affect their business interests in Hong Kong
and their prospects in China.
According to the finance director of one local electronics company: 'I'm not
sure that Mr Patten knows what he is doing. If you look at what has been
happening in China it is helpful to business. Why change Hong Kong now?
There is no need to.'
Mr John Mulcahy, head of research at Peregrine, a local brokerage, said: 'I
do not believe the position he has adopted is winnable. He has taken the
risk and I think he has failed.
'There has not been a mood as divisive and anxious in Hong Kong as prevails
today since the early 1980s. If that is what he has set out to achieve then
he has achieved it.'
This view is not, however, universally held. Nor is opposition to Mr Patten
total among business people.
Some leading members of the business community have welcomed his open style
of leadership and the way in which he has brought the political problems
facing Hong Kong to the public's attention.
'It is better for Hong Kong that the issue of democracy and the colony's
relationship with China is settled once and for all,' said one taipan.
Another top executive of a large Anglo-Chinese company said: 'We have to
back the governor. Those who are criticising him now are the ones that have
done well out of the colonial system and fear change.'

FT  02 DEC 92 / Thais halt UN flights from Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND has cancelled an arrangement for United Nations flights to and from
Cambodia, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) said
yesterday. The Thai move will inconvenience rather than cripple the Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) operation to bring peace to Cambodia, but it underlines
Thailand's extreme reluctance to impose economic sanctions against the Khmer
Rouge.
In its latest resolution on Cambodia, the UN Security Council on Monday
banned the sale of fuel to the Khmer Rouge, which gets its supplies from
across the border in Thailand, because the Khmer Rouge has refused to abide
by the Cambodian peace accords signed in Paris last year.
The resolution also endorses a ban on Cambodian timber exports from next
year and threatens further measures against the Khmer Rouge.
'We cannot in effect fly any of our aircraft to and from Bangkok,' said Mr
Eric Falt, the Untac spokesman in Phnom Penh, adding that emergency medical
flights would still be allowed free passage by the Thais.
UN officials believe that the Thai armed forces, which have close links with
the Khmer Rouge, are behind the move.
The arrangement cancelled by Thailand allowed Untac, which operated about
three return flights a week between Bangkok and Phnom Penh for passengers
and cargo, to present the Thais with a monthly flight schedule. The December
schedule was approved, but subsequently the approval was withdrawn.
Thailand has done nothing to disguise its distaste for sanctions against the
Khmer Rouge, an organisation long regarded as a useful buffer against the
influence of Vietnam and the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Where Cambodia's peace deal does not reach: Victor Mallet
visits the north where the annual dry-season battle with the Khmer Rouge is
under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Lieutenant Yang Souphat, an officer in the Cambodian government army
guarding the road north of Kompong Thom, very little has changed since the
signing of the Paris peace accords a year ago.
The rains have ended, the swampy ground is beginning to dry out, and it is
time for the annual battles against the guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge.
Already there is fighting with artillery or small arms almost every day.
'Khmer Rouge activities are on the increase,' says the lieutenant. His
troops show off an anti-tank mine found that morning under the dirt road
known as Highway 12; the only vehicles moving now are bicycles and heavily
laden motorcycles re-supplying the troops further north.
But what about the ceasefire? 'There is no success with this,' replies Lt
Yang Souphat, 'because the Khmer Rouge still keep their weapons.'
Across Cambodia, the refusal by Khmer Rouge leaders to adopt a ceasefire,
disarm their forces or participate in an election due next May - all of
which they agreed to do last year - is undermining both the peace plan and
the Dollars 2bn operation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac) which was supposed to implement it.
In the area around Kompong Thom, UN troops are monitoring a non-existent
ceasefire.
Lt Yang Souphat, recently supplied with a new multiple rocket launcher from
down south, is more concerned about the grid references of incoming
artillery rounds than the ins and outs of the UN peace plan.
UN military observers agree that the various Cambodian factions have started
to manoeuvre their forces through Cambodia's forests, rubber plantations and
swamps in their attempts to seize more territory. Numerous skirmishes are
breaking out; they are usually between the Khmer Rouge and the government,
but the forces of Funcinpec, the royalist party, are also occasionally
involved.
'As it starts to dry out, there is an awful lot of factional military
activity,' says Colonel Mark Walton, the British operations officer for the
military observers in the area.
Even more serious than the seasonal outbreak of fighting is a drive by the
Khmer Rouge to disrupt the registration of voters for the election.
Last week, two days after military observers had distributed election
posters and radios (so that the villagers could listen to Untac radio) in a
village in Kompong Thom's Sambur district, Khmer Rouge guerrillas entered
the village, burnt the posters and - according to some reports  - took away
the radios.
A more ominous incident, also last week and in the same district, occurred
in another village where civilian UN officials had already registered
voters. Khmer Rouge guerrillas seized the registration cards at gunpoint and
cut them in half, keeping the halves bearing the names of the inhabitants.
Elsewhere in Kompong Thom province, two people were injured when six rockets
were fired at a registration centre; and in yet another part of the province
a Khmer Rouge general has ordered out UN electoral staff and demanded the
removal of a cantonment site for Funcinpec soldiers.
Near Kompong Cham a UN electoral officer came across the body of a man
floating down the Mekong river. He had been tortured, burnt and tied to a
stake.
Not all the violence is attributed to the Khmer Rouge. Government officials,
accustomed to a one-party political system, are suspected of grenade attacks
on newly established Funcinpec offices and other targets in and around
Battambang in the west.
Untac insists there is no evidence yet of a systematic attempt to disrupt
the election - indeed some Khmer Rouge guerrillas have registered themselves
 -but many UN electoral officials, Cambodian and foreign, are frightened by
the intimidating tactics of Khmer Rouge and government forces.
Indonesia's 2nd battalion in Kompong Thom has called in reinforcements from
Phnom Penh. The original idea, says Major Safzen Noerdin, was to accompany
electoral officials only in 'high-risk' areas. 'But now almost all the teams
ask us to provide security,' he says.
Mr Reginald Austin, the Zimbabwean who heads the UN's electoral taskforce,
is delighted at the high levels of voter registration so far  - about 2.7m
people out of an estimated eligible population of 4.5m to 5m - although he
believes the voting itself in May will be far easier to disrupt than the
long process of registration.
'I think we probably will achieve a very high level of registration in spite
of the fact that there is a lot of flak around,' he says. The seizure of
registration cards does not deprive those affected of the right to vote,
since they will still be on the list. He (the voter) belongs to us, provided
he's got enough guts on the day,' says Mr Austin.
'We didn't expect to be registering in an armed environment. But we either
register in an armed environment or we don't register at all.'
Mr Ung Huot, Funcinpec's election campaign manager, believes that the Khmer
Rouge must be made to comply with the peace accords if they are to succeed.
'Otherwise the mission of Untac is a failure,' he says. 'Otherwise the
election doesn't mean anything. Cambodia would be divided into Khmer Rouge
and government areas and there will be no peace.'
For the likes of Lt Yang Souphat, there is not much peace even today. North
of Kompong Thom it is business as usual, and the usual business in Cambodia
is war.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Mexico City suffers worst air pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO City has the most polluted air of any large city, according to a
report published yesterday by the World Health Organisation and the United
Nations Environment Programme (Unep). The report, which looks at 20 of the
world's 'megacities' with populations of about 10m says London, New York and
Tokyo have the least air pollution.
The UN estimates that by the year 2000, 47 per cent of the world's
population will live in urban areas. 'Air pollution is now an almost
inescapable part of urban life throughout the world. WHO guidelines are
being regularly exceeded' in many cities, it says.
According to the study, which draws on 15 years of research, traffic fumes
are the single biggest cause of air pollution in nearly half the cities. The
UN expects the the number of vehicles in the world - 630m - will double in
the next 20 to 30 years.
The WHO and Unep warn that air pollution directly affects breathing and
circulation, and can bring 'increased deaths, disease and disability'. They
add that 'some of the 'megacities' have approached the same massive air
pollution levels of the notorious London smogs of 40 years ago'.
The study looked at six pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO) mainly from
industry and power generation; dirt particles in the air from domestic
fires, power and industry; lead and carbon monoxide (CO), mainly from
vehicles; and nitrogen dioxide and ozone, caused by the combination of heavy
traffic and sunshine.
In Mexico City, levels of SO, CO, lead, airborne dirt and ozone were more
than double WHO recommended levels.
Airborne dirt was also a serious problem in 11 other cities: Bangkok,
Beijing, Bombay, Cairo, Calcutta, Delhi, Jakarta, Karachi, Manila, Seoul and
Shanghai.
Cairo and Karachi also had particularly high lead levels and Los Angeles,
Sao Paulo and Tokyo had serious ozone problems. Although ozone present in
the middle regions of the atmosphere protects people and crops from harmful
ultraviolet radiation, when present near the ground it can cause breathing
problems and headaches.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Buthelezi threatens to form new state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday
issued a veiled threat to declare the unilateral independence of the KwaZulu
black homeland and the white province of Natal from South Africa.
His move, on the eve of important constitutional negotiations between the
African National Congress and the government, appeared aimed at influencing
the talks rather than raising an immediate prospect of secession.
The Inkatha leader, who is chief minister of the KwaZulu 'homeland', said he
would seek to hold a referendum to test the popularity of a new multi-racial
state called KwaZulu/Natal, formed by unifying white Natal province and the
black homeland. The state would have autonomous powers within a federal
South Africa.
He published a draft constitution for the new state, which would include
protection for minorities and special representation for 'cultural
formations', which in many cases would be the same as racial groups.
Chief Buthelezi claimed that the Joint Executive which now administers some
aspects of government in KwaZulu and Natal together, would have the
authority to call an all-race referendum on the proposed constitution.
'Once ratified by the electorate of KwaZulu/Natal, the new constitution will
stand in force, regardless of the direction taken by the constitutional
process in South Africa,' Chief Buthelezi said, a threat that the new state
would in effect secede if its demands for regional powers are not granted.
Though such a constitution would have no legal force under the current South
African constitution, popular backing - if it could be achieved, which is
far from certain - would put pressure on the ANC to grant strong powers to
regions such as KwaZulu/Natal.
So far, the ANC has insisted on only limited devolution of power to regions,
while the ruling National party seeks greater regional devolution. Inkatha
goes one step further than the National party, demanding full-fledged
federation.
Chief Buthelezi's announcement brings to the fore the issue of regional
devolution, which is likely to prove the most difficult question in the
constitutional talks soon to begin.
Government officials yesterday rejected his plans and indicated Pretoria
would bring pressure on Natal authorities to prevent a referendum.
Officials said they did not believe Chief Buthelezi was contemplating
secession from South Africa but that he would do so if he could not
guarantee strong regional powers through negotiation.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday suspended official accreditation of two foreign
correspondents - one American and one British - for publishing stories which
the authorities said should first have been submitted to the military
censor.
In theory almost all stories on military and Arab-Israel affairs have to be
submitted before publication. But in practice it is left to journalists to
judge what to submit.
Yesterday's case arose from an incident last month when five Israeli
soldiers were killed in an accident during training. Later it emerged that
Lt Gen Ehud Barak, the Chief of Staff, and other top officers were present
at the time.
The military censor was accused by Israeli newspapers of co-operating in a
cover-up of serious army misconduct by initially barring publication of
these details. As the issue escalated, foreign newspapers began reporting on
the incident, including an assertion by the Miami Herald that the training
exercise was a practice run for the planned assassination of the leader of
Lebanon's Hizbollah Islamic fundamentalist movement.
Ms Carol Rosenburg, the Herald's correspondent, had her accreditation
withdrawn, as did Mr Ian Black of the Guardian of London.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is suffering from an excess supply of labour for the first time for
almost five years, according to government figures published yesterday.
These suggest the official unemployment rate will soon rise if the economic
downturn continues.
The ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to 0.96 last month from 1.01 in
September, which means that for every 100 job seekers there are only 96 job
offers.
This is the ratio's lowest level since April 1988 when the Japanese economy
was recovering from the downturn provoked by the rapid appreciation of the
yen in the mid-1980s. The ratio has fallen from a peak of 1.47 in March
1991.
Although the official unemployment rate was unchanged at 2.2 per cent, the
sharp decline in job offers suggests unemployment may begin to rise.
Job offers in October were 18 per cent down on last year, mainly because
offers of temporary and part-time work were 68.7 per cent lower.
Manufacturing job offers were 28.9 per cent down on a year before, 6.8 per
cent in finance and 12 per cent in the rest of the service sector.
The gathering depression in the jobs market means that consumer spending
will remain stagnant for several months yet.
However, it seems increasingly unlikely that the government will stimulate
the economy significantly through tax cuts or higher public spending in next
year's budget.
Only a determined political intervention from the ruling Liberal Democratic
party is likely to overturn the Finance Ministry's opposition to tax cuts in
the light of the continuing steep fall in tax revenues.
Finance Ministry officials disclosed that public revenues for 1993 will be
about Y71,700bn (Pounds 381bn), with tax revenues Y1,200bn down on the
initial budget for 1992. Expenditure is likely to be Y74,800bn. The
officials said the revenue shortfall may require modest increases in taxes
on alcohol and tobacco as the ministry is opposed to increased borrowing to
fund the shortfall.
Vehicle sales in Japan last month were 12.3 per cent down on November 1991
at 434,100. Sales of large trucks, which were 28 per cent down at 9,224 and
large cars which were 20.8 per cent down at 61,331 were particularly badly
hit.
Mazda and Nissan lost market share to Toyota, Mitsubishi Motors and Honda.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Bank defends Australian Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian Reserve Bank intervened yesterday to defend the currency
after the government announced sluggish growth figures and a sharp rise in
net foreign debt in the September quarter. After touching a five-year low of
67.8 US cents, the Australian dollar recovered to 68.25.
Gross domestic product grew only 0.5 per cent in the quarter, confirming
that the economy is recovering more slowly than forecast. The government
said the figures, combined with revisions to earlier quarters, showed the
economy had grown by 2.1 per cent since September 1991, when the recession
ended.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said the economy was growing
relatively strongly by international standards. He forecast accelerated
growth towards the end of the financial year in June.
However, economists said leading indicators suggested that growth would
decelerate in the December quarter because of a reduction in stocks and a
lower contribution from net exports.
Balance of payments figures issued on Monday showed that Australia's current
account deficit is likely to exceed the government's ADollars 15bn target,
mainly because exports have continued to grow more slowly than imports.
Net foreign debt grew by 8.6 per cent to ADollars 163bn (Pounds 73.7bn)
equivalent to 42 per cent of GDP, compared to 36.5 per cent in September
1990. The increase is likely to prompt a review of Australia's debt rating
by credit agencies.
However, economists said Australia was unlikely to be downgraded because of
an improved ability of the economy to service the debt, as measured by the
ratio of interest payments to exports. The ratio fell to 15.4 per cent from
16.5 per cent in June and 19.1 per cent in September 1991.
Part of the increase in the Australian dollar value of the debt is likely to
have been caused by a devaluation of the currency by more 13 per cent in
trade weighted terms over the past year.
The poor economic figures suggest that the government may fail to achieve
its target of 3 per cent GDP growth through the financial year. Growth of
less than 3 per cent is unlikely to be sufficient to reduce unemployment
significantly from its 11.3 per cent level.
The figures are a blow to the Labor government, which is hoping for evidence
of substantial recovery before the federal election, due by June.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL and private sector organisations in the US yesterday reported more
evidence of sustained growth in the economy, with leading indicators and the
purchasing managers' index showing upturns.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators, a composite of
11 statistics designed to predict the overall trend of economic activity,
rose by 0.4 per cent in October.
It was helped mostly by lower claims for unemployment insurance and higher
manufacturers' order books.
At the same time the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) said
its November index rose to 55.0 per cent, compared with 50.6 per cent in
October.
An index reading above 50 per cent indicates that the manufacturing sector
is expanding.
'Vigorous growth significantly slowed the decline in employment in the
manufacturing sector, while inflation was kept at bay. With inventories at a
very low level and new orders at a high level, the renewed growth could well
spill over into December,' said Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's
business survey committee.
The statistics were slightly stronger than financial market economists had
predicted, reinforcing the prospect that the US economy might now be on its
way to sustained growth.
However, few economists believe that the underlying rate of US growth is
anywhere near the annualised rate of 3.9 per cent reported for the third
quarter by the Commerce Department last week.
Until now, growth has not spilled over into the jobs market and economists
are watching closely to see if Friday's employment report confirms the
impression of a stronger economy.
President-elect Bill Clinton said last week the stronger growth might affect
his short-term judgment on the need for fiscal stimulus, but his economic
advisers say that he does not want to lock himself into any plan until it is
clearer where the economy stands.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Canada forced to avoid fast lane for growth: Bernard Simon
previews a mini-budget that has expansionary hopes amid restraining
realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S politicians were in rare agreement after the constitutional
referendum in October that their highest priority was to rev up the sluggish
domestic economy.
The federal government immediately began preparing its strategy for
recovery, with a multi-billion dollar infrastructure renewal programme as
its centrepiece.
Prospects for growth were strengthened last night when the Bank of Canada,
the central bank, reduced its key lending rate from 8.82 to 8.27 per cent.
In its wake banks moved to cut their prime lending rates, with the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, one of the six leading banks, lowering its rate
by half a point to 9.25 per cent.
However, in the five weeks since the referendum, worries about the elusive
business recovery have shared the headlines with a currency crisis and
mounting concern about the state of government finances. Politicians and
bureaucrats who favoured a strong dose of stimulation in the mini-budget
have found their plans blocked by others urging tighter fiscal and monetary
discipline.
When Finance Minister Don Mazankowski delivers his mini-budget in the House
of Commons today, therefore, expansion is likely to be tempered by the need
for fiscal restraint.
The Canadian Imperial Bank noted in an economic forecast released last week
that 'any fiscal package, unless financed through expenditure cuts, will
have to be modest'.
Mr Paul Darby, director of forecasting at the Conference Board of Canada,
adds: 'It looks as if (the mini-budget) will turn into more of a restrictive
exercise than an expansionary exercise.'
Even Ontario's social-democratic government, which came to office two years
ago promising public-spending initiatives, is tightening its belt.
Ontario last week announced austerity measures which include cuts in
transfer payments to hospitals, schools and municipalities, a 7 per cent
jump in university tuition fees and a three-year delay in implementing a
scheme promising equal pay to men and women for work of equal value. Without
these measures its budget deficit would have soared from a projected
CDollars 8.1bn (Pounds 4.1bn) to CDollars 12.3bn.
On the federal level, the Progressive-Conservative government has been
dogged by over-optimistic fiscal planning since it came to office in 1984.
One budget after another has promised to bring down the budget deficit and
reverse Canada's spiralling debt. In practice, however, the Finance
Department's forecasts have invariably erred on the bright side.
In last February's budget, Mr Mazankowski pledged that 'despite the economic
slowdown, we will hold the deficit to CDollars 31.4bn' in the fiscal year to
March 31 1992. He predicted that, based on gross domestic product growth of
2.7 per cent in 1992, the shortfall would dip to CDollars 27.5bn in the
current year, and that the government's borrowing needs would shrink to nil
by 1995-96. But the 1991-92 shortfall came to CDollars 34.5bn, the second
highest ever.
With growth unlikely to exceed 1-1.5 per cent this year, the 1992-93 deficit
is now expected to be CDollars 33bn-CDollars 34bn. Hopes of eliminating the
borrowing requirement within four years have all but disappeared.
Financial markets have become increasingly jittery about Canadian
governments' appetite for debt. Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm,
predicts that federal and provincial borrowings will reach CDollars 60bn in
the 12 months to next March, almost double the level five years ago.
Some foreign institutions, in particular, are nearing the limits of their
portfolios earmarked for Canadian debt.
News of the latest budget shortfalls contributed to a sudden run on the
Canadian dollar. In the past three months the currency has slumped from 84
US cents to less than 78 cents.
It now appears to have stabilised at about 78 cents and it was this which
permitted last night's lowering of interest rates. Until then, the central
bank had sought to smooth the currency's fall by pushing up interest rates.
This rise in borrowing costs might have delayed the long-heralded business
recovery. Mr Leo de Bever, chief economist at Nomura Securities in Toronto,
predicts an 'extremely weak' fourth quarter.
The Conference Board has already lowered its 1993 GDP forecast from 3.2 per
cent to what Mr Darby calls 'the high twos'.
Just as missed budget targets have prompted calls for fiscal restraint from
some quarters, the prospect of delayed recovery has led others to urge that
Mr Mazankowski give top priority to reflation.
The prospect of a stimulatory fiscal package from the Clinton administration
in Washington has strengthened the hand of those calling for similar
measures in Canada.
Canada's unemployment rate is over 11 per cent and hardly a week passes
without news of another big corporate retrenchment. Dofasco, the country's
biggest steelmaker, announced last week that it plans to close a mill with
the loss of 2,000 jobs. Canadian National, the state-owned railway company,
plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or almost a third of its workforce.
The political argument in favour of stimulation may be most persuasive of
all. The Conservatives are languishing at rock-bottom in public opinion
polls, and have been banking on a business recovery to improve their
popularity before the general election next year.
Torn between the equally forceful calls for growth and for fiscal prudence,
Mr Mazankowski is expected to steer a middle course in the mini-budget
today.

THE UN Security Council appeared last night to be moving towards approval of
the use of force to safeguard deliveries of desperately-needed food and
other emergency aid to millions of starving civilians in Somalia.
A key question was whether to accept, and if so on what terms, a dramatic US
offer of up to 30,000 troops to form the mainstay of such an operation.
The US yesterday said it had prepared the first draft of a possible
resolution for consideration by the UK, France, Russia and China, the other
permanent members. If they were in general agreement the resolution would be
submitted to the African and other third world delegates but a final draft
was not expected to be ready before the end of the week.
While acknowledging that there now was 'no alternative' but force to stop
the rival Somali warlords and their clans from blocking aid deliveries, Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, still favoured employing
troops under total UN command and control. However, the US offer disclosed
last week was contingent on it maintaining control over its forces even if
the UN formally authorised the operation.
With more than 52,000 UN troops on duty on four continents, Mr Boutros Ghali
said his staff were 'already overstretched in managing greatly enlarged
peacekeeping commitments'. In his report to the Council he admitted that he
did not have the capability to command and control an enforcement operation
of the size and urgency required by the Somali crisis. Therefore, he
suggested, that states contributing troops would have to provide not only
field commandos but 'considerable staff' for headquarters service in New
York.

FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: The sticky issue of a bowl of Japanese
rice - Import ban is more than economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Kyoko Mochizuki will never forget how, in the devastation that followed
the second world war, her mother would sort through her kimonos to decide
which to take into the countryside to exchange for rice.
Urban Japan's dependence upon the rice farmers in those desperate years has
left a deep imprint on Japanese society.
A rural root system runs through urban, industrialised Japan. Village homes
have a residual symbolic significance in the cities. For several days each
August Tokyo becomes a ghost town as families return to the rural homes of
their ancestors.
So the decision about whether Japan should allow rice imports to help
complete the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
about more than economics.
Japan has to negotiate an accommodation with its rural heritage. The ruling
Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has to renegotiate its vital electoral
alliance with the farmers at a time when its public standing has been
battered by scandal and economic downturn.
In past crises the LDP has rallied the agricultural vote for stability,
giving farmers an inordinately powerful electoral voice. Now for the first
time since the war the LDP risks antagonising farmers during a gathering
domestic crisis when it most needs their support.
The Japanese rice market has been regulated and subsidised by a patchwork of
laws since 1942.
The government pays the farmers a high price for their rice and subsidises
its sale to consumers. The combination of these subsidies, with an import
ban and appreciation of the yen, has pushed Japanese producer rice prices to
about eight times the international level.
Consumers pay about six times what they would if they could buy imported
rice.
The subsidies, which by 1987 had reached a peak of Y3,130bn (Pounds 16.5bn)
for rice, out of total subsidies of Y5,070bn, slipping back to Y2,483bn in
1991, out of total subsidies of Y4,230bn, spread distortions through the
rest of the economy.
Japan is the world's largest net importer of food. Yet the subsidies allow
farmers to use land for rice production which would be better used for other
crops which are imported.
The agricultural subsidies help to inflate residential land prices beyond
the reach of most industrial workers because, by maintaining rice
production, they restrict land available for building.
In Tokyo about 13 per cent of the city is classified as farmland, worked by
30,000 families. Yet nearly half have no taxable income from agriculture,
while 14 per cent have sales worth less than Dollars 1,000 a year. About
half a million new homes could be built on Tokyo's agricultural land.
That Japan is prepared to pay the cost of these distortions is testimony to
the political power of the farmers: local agricultural co-operatives are
formidable political machines in an electoral system in which
sparsely-populated rural areas are heavily over-represented in the
parliament.
The co-ops recently engineered the electoral downfall of 15 LDP Diet members
in key agricultural districts over the liberalisation of beef and orange
imports.
Yet the idea that politics is deeply rooted in Japan's peasant past is
largely a myth, as much a post-war creation as the nation's manufacturing
industry.
In the 1920s and 1930s intermittent starvation was not unheard of in rice
growing areas as the government, supported by big business, allowed rice to
be imported from Japan's then colonies. Rice imports reached a peak of 28
per cent of consumption in 1933.
The conservative's alliance with agriculture was forged after the war in
response to crises which threatened conservative rule.
The shocking example of the Chinese revolution of 1949 made the
conservatives fear the Japanese countryside might fall to communism, at a
time when they needed to secure food supplies to shore up their weak urban
support. Between 1949 and 1953 agricultural subsidies trebled.
The rice price rose by 43 per cent between 1960 and 1964 in the wake of the
conflict over the renegotiation of the security treaty with the US.
And it leapt by more than 30 per cent in the early 1970s when the LDP was
fighting to maintain its popularity in the wake of the recession caused by
the first oil shock.
The average Japanese farm is a labour-intensive 1.2 hectares, one-hundreth
the size of the average North American farm.
In spite of the latter's huge productivity advantage, Japanese farm
household income in 1984 was about 19 per cent higher than in the US.
However, the agricultural vote is not a distinct bloc. In 1970 about 41 per
cent of the rural workforce was employed in agriculture. Now in rural areas
about 42 per cent are employed in the service sector, a third in
manufacturing and a quarter in agriculture.
There are three groups of farmers. About 500,000 are full-time, probably
efficient enough to withstand a sharp fall in rice prices brought about by
imports. A further 750,000 are part-time farmers who derive most of their
income from farming.
Then there are 3m 'class-B' part timers - that is, about 70 per cent of all
those involved in farming - who derive most of their income from other
sources. In the mid-1950s most farms were run by full-time farmers; the
class B part-timers were just 28 per cent of the workforce. Now class B
farmers are the main beneficiaries and staunchest supporters of subsidies.
Without the subsidies their farms would make huge losses because they spend
most of their time - and earn most of their incomes - in factories or
offices.
About 60 per cent of Japan's integrated circuit production is concentrated
in largely rural areas. Factories there employ many part-time farmers whose
income is being subsidised by the state.
So the electronics workers who stand most to gain from an open world trading
system are often the part-time farmers who have most to lose from the
withdrawal of rice import protection.
Thus the LDP speaks in several different voices while it gropes for
compromise.
It wants to send a signal to its international partners that it is prepared
to replace the outright ban by a system of tariffs, possibly as high as 700
per cent at the outset, to help finalise the Gatt round. But it does not
want to risk a revolt among the farmers in the run up to elections next
year.
The party will not budge until foreign pressure is irresistible, and only
then after winning concessions in exch-ange - perhaps on stricter
anti-dumping rules, which the EC and US have used with particular fickleness
against Japanese exporters.

LAND ROVER, the subsidiary of the Rover group, said yesterday there had been
some 'slippage' in its plans to set up an assembly plant in Brazil, writes
Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor.
The company had intended to begin producing vehicles in 1993, but a
spokesman said yesterday the schedule had been set back largely by a
trademark dispute, now settled in the company's favour.
Mr Gilberto Mestrinho, governor of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, is due
to meet officials from Land Rover today for talks about the possible siting
of an 18,000-vehicle-a-year assembly plant in Manaus, the state capital. Mr
Mestrinho said that a variety of tax advantages were available in the
free-trade zone in Manaus.
Land Rover said yesterday that several sites in Brazil were under
consideration.

FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Thousands march in protest at EC farm deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRASBOURG yesterday witnessed a spectacular display of international
solidarity for French farmers' opposition to the European Community deal
with the US on farm subsidies.
However, while most of the 50,000 demonstrators heeded organisers' plea for
calm, more than 20 were hurt in clashes with police. One farmer lost a hand
as he picked up a tear gas grenade, according to police, and two policemen
were taken to hospital, one with a broken leg.
The protesters gathered at mid-morning around a bonfire in the Place de
Bordeaux before setting off on a 6km-march around the outskirts of the city,
in what must be one of the largest ever pan-European labour demonstrations.
Every EC member state was represented, and several outside the Community,
including Switzerland, Austria, Japan and South Korea. Britain's National
Farmers' Union, however, fearful of being blamed for the UK's part in the
deal, sent an even smaller delegation than did Japan. By far the biggest
non-French presence was an 8,000 strong contingent of Germans.
The demonstration began with a festive atmosphere, but when a band of 200 or
so marchers, including German and Belgian farmers, veered off-route towards
the European Parliament they were met by a line of black helmeted riot
police. The marchers uprooted trees, ripped up paving stones and flung rocks
and metal bars at the police, who responded with tear gas. Several people
were injured on each side before the farmers returned to their agreed route.
Clashes erupted for a second time at the end of a mass rally in a soccer
stadium, when about 100 farmers fought with riot police by a railway track.
Police had been under orders to keep a low profile, and to avoid trouble,
even at the cost of some damage to public property. As the marchers passed
through mainly deserted streets and shuttered shops, they pushed over
parking signs, burned tyres and smashed bus shelters, car windows and cash
machines. Police said damage was less than expected.
Union leaders' speeches against the deal were drowned by a barrage of
fireworks, which lasted throughout the demonstration. Adding to the din was
the clanging of cow bells by Swiss, German and French Alpine farmers, the
howl of an air raid siren, brought by the Dutch delegation, and the braying
of hunting horns.
Members of a 130-strong Irish delegation did their best to disavow Mr Ray
MacSharry, the Irish European Commissioner who helped negotiate the Gatt
deal for a reduction in subsidised EC exports. But marchers' anger appeared
directed at several targets, of which the controversial Gatt accord was but
one. A multilingual forest of banners and signs variously criticised CAP
reform, the European Community, Germany and the US.
As one banner confusingly proclaimed: 'Gatt: One Mercedes to the US equals
one less European farmer. Danke Schon, Helmut.' Others included
'Gatt-astrophe,' and 'EuroDisney, IBM, Coca-Cola, John Deere, go home.'

FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US 'flouting the rules' in steel dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission said yesterday it was 'shocked' at Monday's
imposition by the US of provisional countervailing duties on flat-rolled
steel from six EC countries, accusing Washington of flouting international
trade rules to protect its steel market.
But Brussels strenuously avoided suggesting any link between this new round
in the transatlantic steel contest and the Uruguay Round world trade reform
process, rekindled by last month's EC-US settlement of a long-running farm
trade dispute.
'The Uruguay Round remains an absolute priority for us,' a Commission
spokesman said.
The punitive US duties follow anti-dumping and subsidy complaints against EC
producers by the six big American steelmakers, and the failure to conclude a
multilateral steel agreement (MSA) after the voluntary export restraint
accord the EC had with the US expired in March after 10 years.
But whereas in April Brussels threatened to respond vigorously to any US
action against EC steel exports, yesterday officials would not be drawn on
the possibility of reprisals. 'Naturally we will be looking at the
appropriate response,' was as far as a Commission spokesman would go.
The duties cover 2m tonnes of EC flat products, worth nearly Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 657m) last year, and range from just over 1 to nearly 60 per cent.
They affect Belgium (4.9 per cent countrywide but 30.2 per cent on Cockerill
Sambre, the main producer); France (26.5 per cent); Germany (from 0.6 per
cent on Thyssen to 17.3 per cent across the country on plate steel); Italy
(58.8 per cent); Spain (56.3 per cent); and the UK (19.1 per cent for
cut-to-length carbon steel plate).
The Commission says the US is responding politically to the domestic
difficulties of its steel producers by effectively closing its market to
Community steel exporters.
But it was not confident enough of its position yesterday to allow the
arguments produced by its steel experts to be attributed in any way to the
Commission itself or the EC, prompting a press boycott of its briefing on
the controversy.
Before yesterday, however, these experts had said US anti-dumping action had
been the prelude to 'bombing' rival steel producers into accepting voluntary
quotas on exports to the US. Some European steelmakers, especially those on
long-term contracts, they admit, could 'technically' be dumping in the US
market because of weakness in the dollar.

<TEXT>
JAPAN and the European Community appear to be heading for a clash over
automobile trade after failing to reach agreement during two days of talks
in Tokyo on the expected outlook for new car demand in Europe next year.
Japanese officials said Tokyo expected a slight improvement in the market,
while the EC believed the market would decline slightly.
European officials refused to comment in detail on the talks, which ended
yesterday, but described them as technical in nature and said there were no
negotiations on the level of Japanese exports to Europe next year.
The two sides agreed to meet again in Brussels in January to try to resolve
their differences.
However, the difference in forecasts for automobile sales will make it
difficult for the two sides to reach agreement on the level of exports.
Last April, in view of the weak demand for cars in the EC, Japan agreed to
cut 1992 exports to Europe by 6 per cent, from 1.26m vehicles. Japanese
automobile companies have seen profits decline sharply this year because of
weak markets at home and abroad and will be unhappy to see the level of
exports reduced again.
Japan and the EC have agreed to a monitoring procedure until 1999 aimed at
limiting Japanese exports to Europe and giving European car makers time to
improve competitiveness.
In the meantime, however, car production by Japanese companies in Europe has
begun to rise sharply.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Bundestag to vote in favour of Maastricht: Treaty approval
has sting in tail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundestag will today vote overwhelmingly for ratification of the
Maastricht treaty on European union. Only a few individuals, and the former
East German Communists, are expected to vote against.
In spite of this show of solidarity, which many Germans hope will persuade
the waverers in Denmark and Britain to drop their doubts over the treaty,
there are several sharp stings in the tail of the German ratification
process.
The two houses of the German parliament, the directly elected Bundestag, and
the Bundesrat representing the 16 federal Lander (states), have decided that
they must reinforce their national democratic control over the process of
European integration.
They have also inserted a strongly-worded resolution insisting on their
right to inspect the precise pre-conditions for European economic and
monetary union (Emu) before the final phase of a single currency and a
single European central bank comes into effect.
They are also greatly increasing the direct involvement of the 16 Lander in
the EC negotiating process, requiring close co-operation and respect for
their views from the central government, and even the right to take the
government's place in Brussels discussions. The co-operation must take place
on all subjects for which the federal states have a domestic responsibility
 -which clearly includes questions of the EC budget.
Although the amendments, both to the German constitution and in the shape of
amplifying legislation, are intended to enhance the process of European
integration, many senior officials in the government, and President Richard
von Weizsacker, the state president, have expressed the fear that they will
make it more difficult.
In Brussels and other EC capitals, the changes are also regarded with alarm,
as likely to lead to far more complications in all negotiations with
Germany, both on day-to-day initiatives and on substantial transfers of
national sovereignty to a European union.
All moves involving sovereignty will require a two-thirds majority in both
houses of parliament. Moreover, the European union must be as defined in the
amended German constitution: committed to the principles of democracy and of
a law-based, socially-oriented, federal state. For Germany that means a
significant strengthening of the European parliament before any further
integration will be possible.
Full details of the laws and constitutional amendments, as approved by a
special ratification committee of the Bundestag, were published yesterday.
They will be put to the vote in the lower house today and in the Bundesrat
on December 18.
Mr Karl-Heinz Hornhues, deputy leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU) in
the Bundestag, said the parliament had made two key moves in an effort to
reassure an increasingly hesitant German public opinion about the progress
towards European union.
The first is the insistence on a second debate on Emu - although he insists
this does not amount to a British-style 'opt-out clause'. The second is a
'European union committee' in the parliament, which will require the
government to consult it in detail before embarking on any negotiations in
Brussels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YUGOSLAV Prime Minister Milan Panic said yesterday he would stand in the
Serbian presidential elections on December 20 and launched his campaign with
a scathing attack on his rival, Mr Slobodan Milosevic.
'Under Milosevic we have become isolated internationally and have become the
victim of crippling sanctions,' he said. 'War rages out of control and yet
Milosevic has done nothing.'
Mr Panic faces an immediate challenge on Saturday when Serbia's electoral
committee is due to rule whether the Belgrade-born US businessman is
eligible to run. Belgrade radio, controlled by Mr Milosevic, said Mr Panic
might not qualify as he could not provide proof of one year's residence in
Serbia. Mr Panic, who returned to Serbia from California in the summer,
dismissed this.
This latest attempt to block Mr Panic reflects nervousness among Serbia's
ruling Socialists that he could beat Mr Milosevic at the polls.
Named prime minister in July, Mr Panic has won popularity for promising to
save Serbia. A western diplomat called his decision to run 'courageous',
saying he was the only candidate who could beat Mr Milosevic.
Meanwhile in Bosnia yesterday the UN suspended the Sarajevo airlift after a
US relief plane was hit by small-arms fire.
In Brussels, Nato said it planned to tighten an oil and trade embargo on
Yugoslavia by despatching warships to the coast of neighbouring Albania.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, criticised the WEU and Nato for
sending separate naval task forces to enforce the embargo. He told the WEU
assembly in Paris the two overlapping forces were failing to achieve
results.

WEST German companies will reduce capital investment by a real 7 per cent in
1993 following a 6 per cent cut this year, according to the Ifo economics
research institute in Munich.
Industry, which originally planned a small increase in spending for this
year, has progressively cut budgets as business conditions have
deteriorated, the institute said.
The investment boom of the last few years greatly increased industrial
capacity, and the current slowdown in spending was more a result of this
development than general economic conditions.
Despite the economies, made mostly by the smaller companies among the 2,400
surveyed, total investment this year is expected to be almost DM100bn. Only
35 per cent of the sample planned to spend more in 1993.

CLAIMANTS seeking compensation for property confiscated in the former East
Germany will be limited to a maximum DM300,000 (Pounds 123,456) per
claimant, Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said yesterday.
Pay-outs will not be made immediately, however, because the government has
no funds to meet the tens of thousands of compensation claims. The decision,
which is likely to upset many former owners because the maximum compensation
will be far less than the current value of property, follows two and a half
years of debate in the government commission set up to examine compensation
costs and other issues.
A finance ministry official said that the draft proposal, which must be
discussed by the Lander, or states, is likely to be accepted.

BRITISH proposals on EC financing received a chilly reaction in Madrid
yesterday.
After a two-hour meeting with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister,
his British counterpart, Mr John Major, defended his plan to limit Community
funding and to reduce transfers, in the form of cohesion funds, to its
poorer partners. He said it was a 'compromise' between criticism from 'some
that it is not generous enough and criticism from others who say it is too
generous'.
Mr Major, on a whistle-stop tour of European capitals in search of a basis
for agreement at next week's Edinburgh summit, added that when his proposals
were studied in detail 'many will have a different view'. Failure to reach
agreement would be damaging both for the Community itself and for the
economies of the member states.
Mr Gonzalez gave little or no ground, however. He termed the proposal on
Community's budgetary resources as 'insufficient' and its spending package
as 'minimal'. He added that he had arrived at these conclusions after 'a
technical study' of the proposals.
Mr Major bravely rode the Spanish premier's punches. He said that he was
seeing EC heads of government in order to 'identify areas of difficulty' and
he conceded that in Madrid 'the areas of difficulties have become sharper'.
He admitted that Edinburgh was building up to be 'more complex than any
other EC summit for a long time'.
Peter Wise adds from Lisbon: In Portugal, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime
minister, said he had explained his country's opposition to Britain's EC
budget proposals in several hours of discussions with Mr Major. But he
refused to be drawn on numbers.
'We consider this is not the right moment to deepen our differences. Mr
Major is working for a solution that is acceptable to all the Community and
that will result in a successful outcome at the Edinburgh summit,' he said.

THE Ukrainian government, which last month announced its conversion to
market reform, has kicked off its programme this week with a flurry of
decrees on price liberalisation, privatisation and trade.
Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, the Ukrainian economist who is drafting the reform
programme, said decrees expected today will liberalise prices for most of
its goods, including energy, and require local officials to privatise 25 per
cent of small businesses within the next four months.
Parliament last month granted Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new prime minister,
wide-ranging authority to govern the economy by edict. 'For the first time I
believe that reforms can take place in Ukraine,' Mr Savchenko said. 'It is
clear that Mr Kuchma wants to make a start although, frankly, I do not know
if he will have the strength to succeed.'
Price liberalisation will not please Ukrainian consumers whose purchasing
power has fallen sharply over the past year. Mr Savchenko anticipates that
prices in state stores will leap by 300 per cent for bread, 200 per cent for
milk and 500 per cent for butter.
However, a sign of the new reforming mood came last week in the western
Ukrainian city of Lvov when the city council bowed to government pressure
and endorsed an International Finance Corporation pilot programme for
small-scale privatisation. The central government says its new and ambitious
25 per cent privatisation target will force reluctant regional governments
to turn state property into private hands, and specifies that all
small-scale privatisation will be done by auction. Officials who block
privatisation will be sacked.
In a separate decree, published yesterday, the government forbade
enterprises from exporting without bank proof of pre-payment from their
foreign companies, or letters of credit. The idea is to curb Ukrainian
enterprises' habit of exporting to other republics with no guarantee of
payment.
A group of Ukrainian economists, working closely with World Bank officials,
is meanwhile drafting a programme to reduce Ukraine's inflation from its
current monthly rate of 30 per cent.

<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary, sounds more than usually smug
these days.
'There's no member state actually proposing to remove all its frontier
controls (on people) during 1993,' he said after Monday's meeting of EC
interior minister - their last gathering before the single market deadline
of January 1.
For Britain, which has always opposed lifting controls on people, the
unwillingness or inability of more enthusiastic countries to abolish
passport checks is a relief.
It reduces the risk of embarrassment on December 31, when, as president of
the EC, the UK will be duty-bound to declare the single market open.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, has long since shelved
threats of legal action against countries which retain controls. There is
still nothing to stop federalist MEPs or free-travel zealots taking the UK
to the European Court for retaining passport checks and breaking EC rules on
free movement of people - but Britain claims it will not be alone in the
dock.
The nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all the EC countries
except the UK, Denmark and Ireland - are unlikely to abolish their controls
before the middle of next year. They are worried because agreements to
strengthen external EC frontiers are not yet in place, and their own
information system - linking immigration authorities - is not ready.
EC airports, which have to rebuild terminals to separate international and
EC flight arrivals, have been given until December 1993 to get ready for the
new regime.
Denmark and Ireland, for different reasons, will retain checks at borders at
least until the continental EC countries have completed their free-travel
zone, if not longer.
So as far as passport controls are concerned, what will change on January 1?
The short answer is nothing. In practice, travellers across most land
borders on continental Europe will not have their passports checked; air
travellers will. British controls at air and sea borders will be unaltered.
A two- or three-speed Europe, in which passport controls are lifted only
gradually, seems inevitable.
But Mr Clarke's intransigence has still angered Britain's EC partners. At
Monday's meeting, he refused to endorse a compromise proposal which would
have pledged EC countries to remove 'systematic' border checks during 1993.
Afterwards he said there would be no point in talking about border controls
again until other member states had made further progress.
They point out that Mr Clarke's claim that nobody is ready to lift controls
obscures one basic difference between Schengen and Britain. Schengen
countries are still determined to abolish passport checks. But the most
Britain will do is move to a minimal system of controls on EC travellers at
sea-ports,
which would still be unacceptable to the Schengen countries.
For all Mr Clarke's smugness, it is clear that the question of border
controls has only been delayed, not solved.
Plans for EC-wide co-ordination of the fight against drug trafficking were
blocked yesterday by a dispute between interior ministers about where a
European drugs unit should be located. The ministers, meeting in London,
decided to pass the issue on to the Edinburgh summit.

A PASTRY-MAKING company called 'Bolshevik' will be among the first to point
the way to the privatised economy, Russian officials said yesterday.
It will be one of six large companies to be put on the market this month to
provide an example to citizens of how to use their Rbs10,000 privatisation
vouchers, expected to be distributed to all by the end of the year.
Some 5,000 big enterprises, worth an estimated Rbs1,500bn are to be sold off
from January 1, according to Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister
in charge of privatisation. Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy head of the
privatisation committee, said yesterday that 'it's hard to tell whether the
(enterprises) are future giants or if they're bankrupt, because of the
unstable situation in the market'.
However, the first large enterprises will come to the market within two
weeks in Moscow, St Petersburg, Vladivostok in the Far East and Perm in the
Urals. They have been carefully prepared by the government and foreign
advisers. The most famous, for Russians, is Bolshevik, a 2,200-employee
cake-maker which makes some of the sweetest products on the market.
Mr Oleg Shumanov, Bolshevik's managing director, said the workers and
management had chosen to privatise their company by taking 51 per cent of
the shares - with the remainder being offered for auction to citizens for
their vouchers. The company has been working with Credit Suisse First Boston
on a system which will allow voucher holders to come to a Moscow sales
centre from December 9 to apply for shares - the price of which will be set
by demand.
Mr Boris Jordan, a CSFB executive in Moscow, said Bolshevik had been chosen
for its brand recognition, its size, the fact that it was in Moscow and its
enthusiasm to be privatised.
Together with the other plants, the experience of the sale of Bolshevik will
be analysed for use in the mass privatisations by the government in
consultation with its financial advisers.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Yeltsin demands new powers to ease reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday confronted the Russian Congress of
People's Deputies, the supreme legislative authority, with a catalogue of
its failures and a demand that it ceases to interfere with the course of
reform.
In a barely-applauded speech, laden with foreboding of violence and
intimations of the fragility of the new institutions, he offered a
compromise immediately derided by his opponents as insufficient and
characterised even by his supporters as risky.
The compromise, aimed at strengthening the presidency and dividing more
exactly the overlapping powers of the various levels of Russian power,
consisted of an offer to renounce his extraordinary powers to introduce
decrees and to allow the Supreme Soviet, or permanent legislature, to
examine his economic legislation within 10 days.
In return, he asked the Congress to deal only with the constitutional
matters, including deciding on the new constitution itself; for the supreme
Soviet to give up most rights in the sphere of economic reform to the
government and the president; for a prolongation of his unqualified right to
choose the government, except for the premier whom he would allow to be
approved by the Congress; and a postponement of adoption of a new law on
government until a new constitution is agreed.
This demand for fuller powers for a 'stabilisation period' of between 12 and
18 months was necessary, he said, given a society where extremists were
forming fronts and even armed groups and deputies thought not of the
country, or of fulfilling decisions of the Congress but of how to push
through their own will. Furthermore, neither political parties nor a settled
division of responsibilities had yet taken root.
In Mr Yeltsin's account, the deputies themselves were part of the problem of
a society on the brink: quoting Pushkin he said :'God grant you never see a
Russian uprising - without sense or mercy.'
However, a large part of the hour-long speech was concerned with the less
apocalyptic tasks of laying out the basis for an economic programme that he
hopes will appeal to the Civic Union group which claims the support of 30-40
per cent of the 1,040-plus deputies and which he needs to avoid a series of
defeats at the hands of the shifting alliance of factions and uncommitted
deputies which make up the Congress.
In this plan, foreshadowed last week by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime
minister, industry would be subsidised, 'sensible protectionism' would
shield Russian industry, contracts would be awarded to Russian consortia and
more assistance to Russian agriculture.
Above all, the state would be greatly strengthened to play a guiding,
interventionist role in the reform process - a process which the president
described as 'treading the golden path between the free market and the
state's role as regulator'.
In one of the few mildly popular parts of his speech, he proposed that the
state do a great deal for its citizens at once - by indexing their savings,
now being reduced by inflation. This was much more generous than the offer
made on Monday by Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, to pay 60 per
cent interest on them while the central bank lending rate stood at 80 per
cent.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the subtle speaker of the parliament, appeared in a
later speech to call for the resignation of the government when he said that
the new economic course demanded new ministers - but then qualified it by
saying that 'we (the deputies) are doomed to co-operate with them'.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, however, leader of the Democratic Party and one of the
leaders of the Civic Union, took Mr Khasbulatov's call as one for
resignation, and supported it.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Maastricht looks good deal to business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAASTRICHT treaty is supported by a large majority of top European
executives. British respondents are most sceptical.
Most businesses take a highly pragmatic line on how governments should cope
with the treaty's ratification difficulties. They see the need for national
flexibility rather than rigid Community-based policies in running the
exchange rate mechanism.
And, as further evidence of a strongly pragmatic streak, there is strong
support for national solutions in employment legislation.
Most company chiefs would prefer to renegotiate or redraft Maastricht rather
than to go ahead without Denmark, which rejected the treaty by a narrow
margin in its referendum in June.
On the question of where to place an institution meant to take a central
role in the Maastricht arrangements - the European central bank -
Euro-idealism appears to take a back seat. Executives show distinct
preference for sites in their own countries. Among German companies, 73 per
cent supported Frankfurt, while 59 per cent of the British favoured London.
Among Belgian corporations, 44 per cent preferred Brussels, while 16 per
cent of Spanish business people wanted Barcelona.
In employment law, 55 per cent of European companies believe such
legislation should be drafted, passed and implemented by individual
countries, with only 43 per cent saying this role should be played by the
EC.
This is felt most strongly in Britain: 83 per cent, with only 16 per cent
arguing in favour of an EC role. Next comes Germany: 67 per cent and 32 per
cent respectively.
Concerning the question of Maastricht acceptance, 79 per cent of executives
in the seven countries say they would - or (in the case of France) did -
back the treaty in a referendum. Only 16 per cent declared opposition. UK
executives are most cautious about Maastricht, only 55 per cent saying they
would vote in favour in a referendum, and 38 per cent declaring they would
vote against. Eighty-two per cent of French executives say Yes to
Maastricht, with only 12 per cent rejecting the treaty. The approval rating
is even higher in Italy (93 per cent), Belgium (88 per cent) and the
Netherlands (87 per cent).
Although the treaty is supported by 77 per cent of business people in
Germany, a sizeable majority (21 per cent) say they are against it. A
majority in each country surveyed (including France) said, however, they
believed referendums were unnecessary to allow the treaty to be ratified.
The survey shows clear divisions on how to operate the ERM.
An overall majority of 63 per cent to 33 per cent believes countries should
tailor interest rates to their own needs rather than to maintaining ERM
parities. This figure masks a sharp split within the EC, corresponding to
the 'hard' and 'soft' currency groups in the ERM.
In businesses in Belgium and the Netherlands, large majorities (61 per cent
and 63 per cent respectively) think ERM rates have to be maintained even at
the cost of higher interest rates. A strong minority (39 per cent) backs
this notion in France.
However, among the 'soft' currency countries which have recently devalued or
left the ERM, companies support a more flexible policy.
In Britain, 81 per cent of respondents thinks interest rates must move in
line with countries' economic requirements rather than to maintain exchange
rate stability.
This view is backed by 73 per cent of companies in Spain and 64 per cent in
Italy, as well as by 64 per cent of those in Germany, whose central bank,
the Bundesbank, is the dominant institution managing the ERM.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Europe's executives expect gloomy year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING European companies forecast a gloomy new year of low growth and
rising inflation and unemployment, according to a survey of business opinion
in the seven biggest European Community economies published today.
Only 38 per cent of leading European business executives believe their
company's prospects will improve during the next 12 months, while 19 per
cent think the position will worsen.
The survey - the UPS Business Monitor - was conducted for the US-based
delivery company United Parcel Service by Harris Research. Interviews were
carried out in seven countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain and the UK - after Europe's September currency upheavals.
The findings show how concern over flagging economic dynamism and the
faltering pace of European integration has forced companies to lower their
sights for 1993.
There has been a sharp rise in pessimism since the spring. When surveyed in
February and March, 55 per cent of business leaders thought their company
would do better during the coming 12 months, and only 6 per cent believed
the position would get worse.
This means that the 'optimism index' (the gap between optimistic executives
and pessimistic ones) fell from 49 points in March to 19 in the autumn.
Business chiefs across the continent foresee a small increase in inflation
next year in all countries except the Netherlands. Unemployment is expected
to rise by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points in most countries, while no country
is thought likely to experience growth of more than 1.9 per cent.
Companies in Spain, the UK, Italy and Germany all forecast growth of 1.2 per
cent or less in their countries' economies next year. Companies in the
Netherlands and France are slightly more optimistic, expecting expansion of
1.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.
Executives in Germany are most gloomy about next year's prospects, with 22
per cent saying their company's position will improve in the next year, and
33 per cent forecasting deterioration. There has been a striking decline in
German optimism since March, when 36 per cent saw an improvement against
only 11 per cent forecasting deterioration.
In spite of the restrained outlook for British growth, UK executives are
most optimistic about an upturn in prospects, reflecting the view that the
two-year recession in the UK may be about to end. Of British executives
surveyed, 60 per cent said they thought their companies would do better
during the next 12 months, while only 8 per cent said they would fare worse.
However, this relative confidence marked a decline in optimism since March,
when 74 per cent foresaw improvement and only 4 per cent deterioration.
Across the other EC countries, business confidence has also registered a
steep fall since March. The 'optimism index' fell from 39 to 6 in Belgium,
from 57 to 25 in Spain, from 49 to 14 in France, from 51 to 19 in Italy and
from 39 to 17 in the Netherlands.
Although German companies are the most pessimistic about the next 12 months'
prospects, the medium-term outlook is seen as much brighter - particularly
by respondents outside Germany. Seventy-one per cent of companies tipped
Germany as likely to show strongest growth during the next three years,
while 48 per cent believed France would be in this position, putting it in
second place behind Spain. There was virtually unanimous belief (among 91
per cent of respondents) that Germany can overcome the challenges of
reunification.
The UK businessmen display much more confidence in British prospects than do
their competitors abroad. Among UK respondents, 33 per cent expect Britain
to show strongest economic growth during the next three years, while only 12
per cent of their counterparts on the continent agree.
Italy is expected to show weakest economic growth during the next three
years, according to 51 per cent of all respondents, and 54 per cent of
Italian business people.
The UK came second among the countries judged to face poorest growth
prospects, ranked in this position by 48 per cent of all respondents, but by
only 30 per cent of the British.
One factor underlying optimism among businessmen is the advent of the single
market. European companies hope to benefit as the single market comes into
effect next year, in spite of doubts about ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
However, 45 per cent of respondents forecast that customs procedures and
controls at borders will not disappear in 1993. Although this indicates that
hopes about the precise impact of next year's changes have been scaled down,
a large majority (67 per cent to 21 per cent) believes that movement of
goods within the EC next year will become easier.
Support for the single market is uniformly strong among the countries
surveyed, but there is scepticism about whether single market directives are
being implemented equally in all member states. Italy is viewed as the worst
offender.
EUROPE'S FUTURE:
The second UPS survey is based on 1,485 interviews carried out by Harris
among EC business leaders between September 21 and October 30, 1992.
Respondents were selected from Europe's top 15,000 businesses by revenue.
The following countries were included: Belgium (104 interviews), France
(255), Germany (255), Italy (256), Netherlands (106), Spain (251), UK (258)

FT  02 DEC 92 / BBC's finance chief to leave next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ian Phillips, the BBC director of finance, is to leave the corporation at
the end of February.
Announcement of the departure comes a few days before the BBC governors are
expected to publish a detailed report on a serious projected overspend at
BBC television.
The BBC has admitted that the possible overspend is about Pounds 20m. The
final figure, however, is likely to be as high as Pounds 60m.
The corporation said last night that Mr Phillips, who is 54, was leaving the
corporation to 'pursue a range of other activities'. It insisted that it was
'pure coincidence' that the announcement of Mr Phillips' departure and
publication of the report occurred at about the same time.
The report is being produced by a governors' audit committee chaired by Lord
Barnett, vice-chairman of the governors and a former chief secretary to the
Treasury.
Senior figures at the BBC declined to comment further on the reason for Mr
Phillips' unexpected departure. Mr Phillips, who joined the corporation in
1988 from the British Railways Board, would have had responsibility for the
finances of the corporation but would not have been in day-to-day charge of
the finances of BBC television.
The signs are that Lord Barnett has been conducting a thorough investigation
of the reasons for the possible overspend, which has apparently been caused
by a number of factors coinciding, such as over-optimism on co-production
revenues and the transition costs of moving towards 'producer choice'. This
is the system allowing producers to buy services from outside the BBC.
The financial problems come at an embarrassing time for the BBC. It launched
its policy for the future last week, following the government's green paper
on the BBC. Both documents emphasised the importance of efficiency in the
BBC's handling of licence payers' money.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Schlesinger criticises ERM: D-Mark gains as Bundesbank chief
denounces 'incentive for speculation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH uncertainty was cast over the future of the European exchange rate
mechanism last night after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the
Bundesbank, the German central bank, said one of the system's key mechanisms
was 'a powerful incentive for speculation'.
In a development likely to put further strains on some of the ERM's weaker
currencies Mr Schlesinger repeated that the conditions for the Bundesbank to
cut interest rates in the near future had still not been met.
Mr Schlesinger's comments came at the end of a tense day on currency markets
in which the D-Mark gained ground against the dollar and the Bank of France
was forced to intervene heavily to support the French franc against the
German currency.
The D-Mark gained 1 pfennig against the dollar on Mr Schlesinger's comments,
as investors switched funds into the German currency on the grounds that the
Bundesbank was unlikely to cut interest rates for some time.
Mr Schlesinger, who has always put combating inflation in Germany ahead of
support for the ERM, denounced the way in which central banks are obliged to
intervene to support weak currencies in the European Monetary System as
ineffective and a powerful instrument for enriching speculators. Citing the
case of a speculator who made Dollars 950m (Pounds 618m) during the recent
turbulence over sterling, he said: 'Unlimited obligatory interventions . . .
make no contribution to the stability of the system. On the contrary, they
are a powerful incentive for speculation.'
In an unusually outspoken address to university economists in Cologne, Mr
Schlesinger said there was no need for a fundamental reform of the EMS, but
'details' should be reconsidered with the aim of hardening the system.
Central banks had suffered heavy losses. 'This is not only expensive for the
taxpayer, but in the final analysis purposeless.'
He also appealed for central banks still under government control to be
given their independence in the interests of exchange rate stability.
In some countries, exchange rate policy was bound up too much with political
prestige, he said. While he could appreciate the political problems,
independence for central banks could help 'stabilise the expectations of
financial markets'.
He also said he found it hard to detect signs that the Bonn government was
commited to cutting public spending, and rejected charges that the
independent central bank ignored other countries' needs in its policymaking.
In response to repeated appeals from mainly non-German political leaders for
easier German interest rates, Mr Schlesinger claimed that to bring moral
pressure to bear on a country which had a strong currency, but which lacked
the conditions necessary to allow it to soften its policies, reinforced
doubts about monetary union.
The dollar fell as low as DM1.5705 in New York before finishing at DM1.573.
It closed in London at DM 1.580, from a close on Monday of DM1.5935.
The French franc was quoted at FFr3.4105 against the D-Mark, within 2
centimes of its ERM floor, after European trading had ended. Earlier, it had
come under heavy selling pressure.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Patten defiant on HK reforms as shares plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday announced a timetable for
his controversial plans to introduce more democracy in Hong Kong in defiance
of stiff opposition from China.
As Mr Patten spoke, share prices registered a steep decline on the Hong Kong
stock exchange in active trading that bordered, at times, on panic selling,
brokers said. Investors dumped Hong Kong equities as concern mounted about
the growing gulf between Britain and China on the constitutional development
of the colony.
Mr Patten plans to bring his plans before the local legislature in February,
he told the colony's Legislative Council yesterday.
By setting a date, he underlined the government's determination to press
ahead with reforms in defiance of opposition from China, which on Monday
issued a challenge to Britain's governance of Hong Kong.
Beijing is threatening not to honour any Hong Kong government agreement that
it does not approve of - a move seen as an attempt to undermine confidence
in the economy of the colony.
The Hang Seng index, the barometer of the local market, ended the day 308.92
points, or more than 5 per cent, lower at 5,501.71. It had fallen by up to 7
per cent when the governor was speaking but recovered as bargain hunters
stepped in, traders said. The index fell another 100 points in early trading
today.
Yesterday's drop in share prices was the biggest one-day decline since the
market fell by more than 8 per cent in August last year, on news of a coup
to topple former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev. The governor's
comments, before a packed legislature, did nothing to calm investors and
business people that Mr Patten had engaged China in a fruitless battle of
wills over his plans.
His, and the British government's, refusal to withdraw the proposals - which
would broaden the franchise for 40 of the 60 seats to be contested in
elections due in 1995 - have angered China and led to a virtual cessation in
official dialogue.
Mr Patten said in the Legislative Council that he would not withdraw his
plans which he said had twice been given general council approval since he
unveiled them on October 7.
The governor said he was prepared to discuss them with China at a time and
venue of its choosing. He would consider any alternatives that were fair,
open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
The view among political analysts in the colony yesterday was that Mr Patten
can still secure a majority in the Legislative Council in support of his
proposals.
Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor, writes: Britain yesterday made it clear
that it had no intention of being 'derailed' by the Chinese campaign aimed
at undermining Mr Patten's policies. The UK backed the reforms, but the
final decision on their implementation would be taken by the Legislative
Council, Foreign Office officials said. In the meantime, British policy
would be 'to batten down and carry on' under the now daily onslaught from
Beijing.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Stock Exchange to monitor action on corporate code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH quoted companies will next year be required by the Stock Exchange to
show whether they are complying with a code of corporate governance.
The move was confirmed yesterday at the launch of the Cadbury committee's
final report. The committee on the financial aspects of corporate
governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, will also require a company's
auditors to scrutinise for accuracy many of the details in the statement of
compliance.
The code says some non-executives should be independent of management,
appointed for specified terms and selected through a formal process.
The code also says directors' service contracts should not exceed three
years without shareholder approval and all their emoluments should be
clearly disclosed. Their pay should be subject to review by a remuneration
committee dominated by non-executives. Boards should have an audit
committee, report on the effectiveness of internal controls and state
whether the business is a going concern. Sir Adrian said: 'Boards must be
free to drive their companies forward, but to exercise that freedom within a
framework of effective accountability.'
He said the code was based on two planks. One was the need for disclosure so
all those with an interest in a company had the information they needed to
exercise their rights and responsibilities; the second was for checks and
balances to guard against undue concentrations of power in the boardroom.
Institutional investors are expected to apply pressure to bring about
reform. 'We are relying on market forces to turn our recommendations into
action,' Sir Adrian said. He expected the share price of those companies
which complied to improve, if only in response to the recommended
strengthening of internal controls.
The Cadbury report updates a draft issued by the committee last May, and has
been amended following substantial public debate and submissions from 225
organisations and individuals.
The committee has strengthened the tone of the document, and clarified its
view that non-executive directors should work as part of a unitary board
with the executives.
It has diluted from the draft its recommendation that the role of chairman
and chief executive should be separated and that there should be a senior
non-executive director formally representing shareholders' interests.
The report calls for amended legislation to limit directors' service
contracts to three years without shareholder approval; to show clearly the
audit and non-audit fees received by a company's auditor; and to extend to
auditors of all companies the protection to report fraud currently in place
for regulated industries.
The Stock Exchange's continuing listing rules will require companies to
provide a statement showing they are complying with the code - or
highlighting areas and reasons where they do not - in their annual reports
from June 30 next year.

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Uni Storebrand, the troubled Norwegian insurer, looked
uncertain yesterday following a rejection by Uni's biggest creditor, West
Deutsche Landesbank, of a plan to recapitalise the crippled group.
The board appointed by the Norwegian government to administer Uni said that
it would seek a new solution to strengthen the group and did not rule out
disposals.
The most saleable unit is the non-life insurance business which has an
estimated 40 per cent domestic market share. But a disposal of this unit
could be disruptive for the life business, which is the biggest investor in
the Oslo bourse.
The failed recapitalisation plan called for, among other things, 70 per cent
of NKr4.5bn (Dollars 690m) of debt to be converted to equity and a share
issue to raise NKr1bn in fresh capital, but it relied on the backing of
Uni's creditors.
The administration board said it would work to achieve a solution by next
summer. West Deutsche Landesbank, which holds NKr1bn in Uni debt, has also
suffered heavy currency losses on the debt.
The bank scuppered the recapitalisation plan - also rejected by numerous
small creditors - and demanded cash reimbursement instead of payment in
shares.

<TEXT>
VEBA, the big industrial conglomerate based in Dusseldorf, has warned that
net profits for the full year will probably fall by 14 per cent.
Mr Klaus Piltz, chief executive, made no comment on the likely outcome for
pre-tax profits, which fell by nearly 20 per cent in the first nine months
to DM1.2bn (Dollars 753m). Net profit for the whole of last year was
DM1.22bn, fractionally above the previous year's result.
The dividend will be held at DM12 per share, Mr Piltz confirmed. Veba was
one of the few big German companies to raise its dividend last year, and its
decision to hold this year's pay-out may not be matched by other German
chemical groups.
Mr Piltz said Veba planned to cut 7,000 jobs by 1993, 5,000 of them from the
chemicals sector, saving DM400m to DM500m a year.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Chiefs fail to settle Western Sahara poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UN efforts to hold a referendum on the future of the Western Sahara suffered
a further setback in Geneva yesterday when the UN special envoy, Mr
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, failed for the second day running to convene a meeting
of tribal chiefs from the territory.
The meeting, scheduled to start on Monday, was intended to define criteria
for deciding who is entitled to vote on the future of the sparsely-inhabited
territory. A former Spanish colony, valued mainly for its fisheries and
phosphate deposits, it was annexed by Morocco on Spain's withdrawal in 1976.
The Algerian-backed Polisario Liberation Front contested the annexation, and
fought a desultory guerrilla war against the Moroccans until a UN-brokered
ceasefire came into effect in September 1991.
Under the UN peace plan, this should have led to a referendum in January
this year, with an electoral roll based on the Spanish census of 1974, which
showed a population of only 73,500. But after accepting the plan, Morocco
produced a list of a further 120,000 people who it said were entitled to
vote, claiming they were left out of the census because they or their
families had fled from Spanish colonial rule to Morocco proper, and that
this should not prejudice their right to a say in the territory's future.
In December last year Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the outgoing UN Secretary
General, accepted the argument that 'people who fled colonial rule cannot be
deprived of the right to decide on the future of the territory to which they
belong', and said this applied also to the children of such people. But, he
added, 'in order not to widen excessively the scope of this provision, it
has been restricted to one generation only'.
Morocco agreed to co-operate on this basis, dropping its insistence on the
full list of 120,000. But the Polisario rejected the instructions, saying
Morocco would use them as a pretext to import voters who had no real
connection with the territory.
The idea behind the Geneva meeting, to be attended by 19 chiefs from each
side, was that, since Saharan society is essentially nomadic and tribal,
tribal chiefs were best placed to know who belonged in Western Sahara and
who did not. But at the last minute Polisario objected to seven of the
chiefs nominated by Morocco, on the grounds that their names did not figure
on a list given to both parties by Mr Perez de Cuellar in 1990.
The Polisario leader and president of the self-proclaimed Saharan Arab
Democratic Republic (SADR) Mr Mohammed Abdelaziz, admitted during a visit to
London last week that he himself does not figure in the Spanish census (he
was born in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh), but insisted that a blanket
inclusion of anyone whose parents had ever lived in the Western Sahara would
be too wide.
Politically, neither side can contemplate losing the referendum, which means
neither is likely to let it happen except in circumstances where they feel
confident of victory. The United Nations observers in the desert have taken
on a thankless task.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO members of Abu Nidal's extremist Palestinian Fatah Revolutionary Council
(FRC) were killed by their own bomb yesterday in the southern Lebanese city
of Sidon, bringing to 25 the number of Palestinians killed in a six-month
vendetta between Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, and the FRC.
A series of bombings and gangland-style murders, carried out with submachine
guns and silenced pistols in marketplaces and cafes and on the sea-front
promenade, have terrorised the residents of Sidon. Abu Nidal has demanded
that the PLO release 62 FRC members it is holding in Sidon.
The 19 year-old conflict between the two groups has been exacerbated by the
Middle East peace talks.
The FRC accuses the PLO of betraying Palestinians by accepting the talks
should take place. PLO officials in Lebanon claim the Abu Nidal group seeks
to ruin Lebanese-Palestinian relations and force Lebanese authorities to
disarm the refugee camps. The Lebanese army surrounded the camps in July
1991 and seized heavy weapons, but allowed guerrillas inside the camps to
keep their guns.
Walid Abu Tarboush and Hassan Dib, the two men who died yesterday, were
planting a bomb near a PLO office in the Ein el Hilweh refugee camp when the
device exploded.
The feud began on June 8 when Mr Atef Bseiso, head of security for the PLO,
was gunned down in Paris. The assassination campaign moved to Sidon with the
murder of Fatah's Ein el Helweh commander. Fatah then went on the offensive,
assassinating three FRC members in July, including Mr Walid Khaled, the
group's leader in Lebanon.
Israeli security forces shot dead a 12-year-old boy and wounded 30 people
during clashes with Palestinians yesterday in the occupied Gaza Strip,
Reuter reports from Gaza. Arabs said the violence began when troops charged
into a wake for a Palestinian stone-thrower killed last week.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Jordan's fledgling democracy takes wing: Fundamentalists to
exert big influence in new parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN's 80-member lower house of parliament reconvened yesterday,
effectively marking the start of a four-month campaign for next year's
multi-party general elections, the first since 1956.
The parliament was elected three years ago in the first poll since 1967 but
candidates were not allowed to organise themselves into political parties.
Now, with a question mark hanging over the health of King Hussein, who says
he is committed to democracy, the power struggle between government and
parliament, and factions within the house, is expected to be intense, with
parliamentarians determined to achieve a real share of power.
Some of the more contentious issues likely to be debated are the Middle East
peace process, a law banning alcohol, and amendments to the controversial
state security court law, used while parliament was in recess to try two MPs
for treason.
Moreover, with the recent legalisation of political parties, the session
will provide the last chance for MPs to forge a cohesive opposition to
Moslem fundamentalists who form the house's largest bloc, of 30 seats, and
have made significant gains in local council elections.
For most MPs, yesterday's inauguration ceremony and king's speech could not
have come soon enough. The extraordinary security court trial of two
deputies accused of plotting to overthrow the king with the intent of
creating an Islamic state, remains firmly fixed in their minds. The case was
seen by many as an attempt by certain circles in government to clip the
wings of Jordan's democracy, and many MPs privately consider the case
against the two MPs to have been contrived.
Although King Hussein succeeded in diffusing tension between parliament and
government by granting an amnesty to the two MPs, whom the court found
guilty and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour, the effect of the trial on on
MPs will be the most closely-watched test of the next session.
One of the two accused, Mr Leith Shbeilat, who was more vocal than most MPs
in his pursuit of government corruption and democratic change before the
trial, almost decided to abandon his political career.
Potentially, the most damaging issue for the government will be a debate on
the peace process. With nearly half the house, fundamentalists and leftist
groups, fervently against the talks, many believe that a motion of no
confidence in the cabinet is inevitable.
Parliament cannot prevent the government from conducting the negotiations,
but such a motion would be destabilising, especially as the king has
committed himself to the talks.
The crunch, however, would come if an agreement with Israel were to
materialise, since this would need parliament's endorsement.
According to one Moslem MP, parliament would reject a peace accord.
Another stormy issue, already scheduled for debate, is a draft law proposed
by the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood to prohibit the sale and
consumption of alcohol. As one parliamentarian said: 'The Islamicists know
that just as it is difficult for any MP to vote for peace as Arabs, they are
unable to vote for alcohol as Moslems. They would never be re-elected.'
The strength of the fundamentalist bloc in parliament and the wave of
fundamentalism which is influencing local as well as national centres of
power through the ballot box is causing growing concern to the government.
Islamic groups are the most organised and active popular political forces in
Jordan, and their opponents fear that they will benefit substantially in
next year's election from the shifting alliances and factionalism which
characterises other groups.
For this reason, and given the ripples felt within Jordan's government from
this year's aborted Algerian election, some government sources consider that
the election, due in November, may be postponed to allow infant political
parties more time to organise - a move which lies within the powers of the
King.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S plans for its first multi-party elections since independence in 1963
are 'seriously flawed' and may be tilted in favour of President Daniel arap
Moi, according to a report issued yesterday by the International Human
Rights Law Group, Reuter reports from Washington.
The Washington-based organisation said President Moi's government has shown
its willingness to use its powers to influence the outcome of the voting,
scheduled for December 29.
President Moi, under pressure from domestic groups and countries providing
aid, agreed to the elections last December.
The rights group's fact-finding team, made up of representatives from
Britain, Chile and Denmark praised the openness of political discussion, but
found a number of problems.
Opposition parties, the report said, had been denied access to government
television and radio and had trouble organising campaign rallies.
Some parties were unable to register, the report added, citing the
government's refusal to let the Islamic Party of Kenya and the Green Party
to take part.
The representatives said that with about a month before the elections, the
Electoral Commission, had yet to decide on the number of polling places and
the logistics and systems to be used for polling.

FT  02 DEC 92 / EC to renew calls for growth push: The Community will grow
by just 1.1% this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Henning Christophersen, the EC economics commissioner, will today press
plans for a growth stategy in both western and eastern Europe to revive
slumping public investment and give hope to the emerging democracies in
Poland, Hungary and the Czechoslovak Federation.
Mr Christophersen is expected to reveal that the Community will grow by
barely 1.1 per cent in 1992. Growth next year is likely to be between 1.0
per cent and 1.5 per cent, with a threat of near stagnation of output.
In an interview yesterday, Mr Christophersen called upon EC governments to
work more closely on co-ordinating economic policy, boosting public works
programmes and 'reorienting resources' by scaling back state aid to industry
or curbing public sector salaries, notably in Germany.
The Danish commissioner also issued a plea to the Community to look
favourably upon the requests for membership made by Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. He called too for more east-west infrastructure spending on
roads, railways and telecommunications to correct what he identified as a
north-south bias.
As Danish minister of foreign affairs and then EC Commissioner in 1985, Mr
Christophersen was intimately involved in negotiating the terms of
membership for Greece, Spain and Portugal. Although he stopped short of
offering a firm timetable, the Commissioner said the EC should not be
narrow-minded. They should tell Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia that 'you
are on your way to becoming EC members'.
Mr Christophersen's views on enlargement are not widely held in the EC, but
his comments reflect unease that the Community is so preoccupied with its
internal problems over the Maastricht treaty that it is not paying attention
to its eastern neighbours.
Mr Christophersen has been working with Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission President on a new growth strategy to be presented at the EC
summit in Edinburgh next month.
Britain broadly supports the Brussels initiative, particularly plans to set
up a new European Investment Fund which would provide loan guarantees under
the auspices of the European Investment Bank.
But UK officials are anxious about Community plans to borrow up to Ecu5bn
(Dollars 6.2bn) on the capital markets which could feed into budget
deficits. Mr Christophersen stressed yesterday that his plan consisted
mainly of 'supply-side' measures which in no way undermined the need for
fiscal discipline.
The UK is also worried Mr Delors might 'hijack' the summit with a
high-profile growth package, distracting attention from other pressing
issues.
Mr Christophersen explained yesterday that he had not as widely reported -
called for a Ecu50bn investment package to revive the EC economy. He had
noted only that EC investment had fallen from 4 per cent in 1991 to a
negative  3/4 per cent in 1992. The figure of Ecu50bn was the amount of
investment needed to 'move' the EC economy and prevent an increase in
unemployment, he said.

deal disappointment

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES drifted lower yesterday after losing ground at the close of the
New York market on Monday. North Sea Brent crude for January delivery was
down 50 cents at Dollars 18.60 a barrel in London trading.
Oil traders say the price weakness reflects the market's disillusion with
the agreement reached at last week's meeting of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. 'The market took a good look at this
agreement and decided it didn't add up to much,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head
of energy trading at Smith Barney in London.
Market traders believe Opec's agreement, which does little more than
formalise existing production levels, does not go far enough to support
prices.
The planned production cuts should take overall oil output to 24.58 barrels
a day from November's production of about 25m b/d. But the ceiling does not
include a production level for Ecuador, which has left the organisation.
Without Ecuador, the organisation was pumping at a rate of 24.7m b/d which
implies a cut of just over 100,000 b/d.
Nevertheless, the meeting did allocate production quotas to individual
members without official dissent. This is the first time this has happened
since the Gulf war and was meant to avert a price collapse.
'To Opec watchers this looks constructive, but the market is looking for
something more,' one trader at an international oil company said.
At the same time, demand for oil products is weak in Europe and North
America as the weather remains unseasonally warm. Refining margins have been
squeezed to the level where it is becoming difficult to make a profit in the
downstream sector.
Mr Mehdi Varzi, industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London estimates
that European refining margins for Brent crude are at Dollars 1.70 a barrel
from a high of almost Dollars 2.50 a barrel October to November.
Some commentators believe that the Brent price will remain stuck in a range
from Dollars 18.50 to Dollars 19.50 a barrel until the end of the year
unless colder winter weather provides a boost.
Fina Italiana, the Italian subsidiary of Belgium's Petrofina, has confirmed
an encouraging oil find in southern Italy near Potenza, and is seeking a
concession to exploit the discovery, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The find is in a step-out well from an initial discovery made in 1989. It is
at a depth of over 800 metres and has a flow rate of up to 3,470 b/d. Fina
is operating in partnership with Lasmo and Enterprise Oil of the UK, the
latter having a total stake of 44 per cent in the venture.
Italy imports 73m tonnes of oil a year to complement modest local
production, including gas, equivalent to 4.3m tonnes. ENI, the state oil
concern, has already two exploration wells in the same area.

SUTTON PLACE, one of Canada's best-known luxury hotels and part of the
Kempinski world franchise, has gone into receivership.
The owners are German investors in limited partnerships managed by Lehndorf,
a Toronto property group which is trying to restructure heavy borrowings.
The 33-storey hotel, a Toronto landmark, carries about CDollars 30m
(USDollars 23.3m) in debt, partly held by a banking group led by Fuji Bank
Canada.
Sutton Park will continue to operate normally and has two potential buyers,
Lehndorf said.

COLUMBIAN Chemicals, the industrial chemicals subsidiary of Phelps Dodge of
the US, yesterday announced a Dollars 55m joint venture in Hungary to
produce carbon black, the material used in manufacturing rubber and car
tyres.
Columbian is taking a 60 per cent stake in Columbian Tiszai Carbon, the new
entity, in partnership with Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat (TVK), Hungary's largest
chemicals company, which will hold the remaining 40 per cent.
The Dollars 55m planned investment will be part-financed with a Dollars
33.5m loan package involving Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US
government investment promotion corporation, and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the London-based multilateral institution
aiding eastern Europe.
The joint venture partners said that the new carbon black factory on TVK's
Tiszaujvaros site in eastern Hungary would use by-products from existing
refining facilities at the same location and so enjoy substantial savings on
transport costs. Excess gas from the plant would in turn generate steam for
TVK's other operations.
Columbian, the world's second-largest carbon black producer, said that half
of the planned 50,000 tonne annual production would go for export to help
meet west European demand.
The company added that it expected to benefit in the longer-term from the
influx of car companies into Hungary, which executives expected would be
followed by an investment by a leading international tyre manufacturer.
Columbian investigated existing carbon black plants in eastern Europe but
decided to avoid involvement because of the cost of bringing the old
facilities, which have a terrible reputation for pollution, up to acceptable
environmental standards.
Cabot of the US, the world's largest producer of carbon black, took a
different route in forming a joint venture earlier this year with Deza, an
established producer of the material in the Czech republic.

PLUTONIC Resources, the Western Australian gold miner, yesterday continued
the trend towards rationalisation in the gold mining industry by bidding
almost Dollars A81m (USDollars 55.3m) for rival mining group Forsayth NL.
Plutonic is bidding 25 cents cash a share for Plutonic and has already
reached agreement to buy an 18.4 per cent interest in the company from FAI
Insurances at the same price.
However, Forsayth shares quickly moved above the bid price, gaining 3 cents
to 26 cents on Australian stock exchanges yesterday.
Forsayth directors advised shareholders to take no action on the offer.
Plutonic plans to fund its bid mainly through its Dollars A70m cash
holdings, built up through proceeds of the rich Plutonic mine.
The company is one of the few cashed-up and debt-free West Australian gold
miners and has been looking for acquisition targets for some months.
In contrast, Forsayth is recovering from a string of losses, returning to
the black with a Dollars A5.6m net profit in the latest year.
FAI Insurances directors said yesterday that the company had made a profit
of more than Dollars A8m on its sale of Forsayth shares to Plutonic.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA today will carry out its largest privatisation to date when it
sells off Gas del Estado, its state-owned gas company, for more than Dollars
2bn.
The government is expecting bids from consortia comprising companies ranging
from British Gas to a clutch of regional North American operators, all
allied with local companies. Each consortium is competing for control of one
of 10 independent business units which will make up the privatised and
deregulated gas industry.
Argentina has already sold the national airline, telephone network,
manufacturing companies, plus part of its electricity industry and railway
system. Next year, it will begin privatising YPF, the oil company, valued at
Dollars 8bn.
The 10 gas units include two transmission companies and eight local
distribution companies, the largest valued at over Dollars 1bn and the
smallest at under Dollars 50m. Each unit will be awarded to the consortium
with the largest offer - in cash or debt instruments - over the minimum cash
price.
Together, the 10 units' minimum price totals Dollars 680m. The successful
bidders will also have to take on Dollars 947m in short and long-term debt
and promise to invest at least Dollars 550m in the companies over five
years.
The government is selling 60 to 90 per cent of each unit, and will later
float its shares, averaging about 20 per cent in the companies, on local and
international equity markets, while the rest will be held in trust for
employees.
An independent regulator will oversee the industry and enforce competition
between companies.

FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pirelli gives minorities more
time on rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday bowed to pressure
from minority shareholders in its Amsterdam-listed Pirelli Tyre Holding
(PTH) subsidiary by amending the terms of its proposed rights issue
announced in October.
Under the proposal, disclosed at a shareholders' meeting yesterday, Pirelli
is giving minorities in PTH more time to decide to subscribe to new shares
being issued by the use of warrants.
The scheme will allow the timing for the rights issue, which will double
PTH's share capital by raising Fl 465m (Dollars 259m), to remain unchanged
while meaning that minority shareholders have much more time to decide to
subscribe.
The original proposal for a one-for-one rights issue at PTH's nominal share
price of Fl 10 was criticised by minorities, which own 21 per cent of the
company. Brokers complained the terms obliged them to subscribe to the new
stock or see their holdings diluted.
The announcement of the original plan triggered a 45 per cent fall in PTH's
share price as minorities dumped shares ahead of the deal. Shares in PTH
were sold at Fl 54 on flotation in June 1989.
The decision to revise the terms gives minority shareholders a six-month
breathing space to decide whether to subscribe after the rights issue takes
place next January. Pirelli will underwrite the entire transaction and offer
minority shareholders warrants, excercisable over a six-month period
following PTH's annual meeting in June 1993, at a price equal to the shares'
nominal value of Fl 10 each.
Minority shareholders will have time to assess PTH's financial performance
throughout 1993 before committing themselves to buying new shares.
Meanwhile, PTH will benefit from urgently needed new funds as soon as the
rights issue takes place next January.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew in Pounds 46.5m Nivea sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare and toiletries company, has sold its share of
the Nivea skincare product brand to its joint venture partner, Beirsdorf of
Hamburg, for Pounds 46.5m.
The UK-based company will continue to distribute Nivea products in the UK,
South Africa and Commonwealth countries where it owns the brand and it will
continue to manufacture in Australia and South Africa where Beirsdorf has no
production facilities.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said that because profits from Nivea were
relatively low, the interest on the sale proceeds combined with the profits
from distribution would be greater than the profits stream from ownership of
its part of the brand.
'This is part of a wider strategy to focus on our healthcare businesses and
yet maintain our critical mass in the consumer business in the UK,' Mr
Robinson said.
Smith &amp; Nephew's Nivea sales were Pounds 20m last year. Beirsdorf had sales
of over Pounds 300m in the rest of the world.
Mr Robinson said the sale represented a p/e multiple of 29 times and his
company was also retaining an income stream.
Smith &amp; Nephew's consumer products division, which includes its Nivea
brands, was hit by recession in the UK. This division helped restrict the
increase in pre-tax profits to only 6 per cent. The group sees its greatest
potential in its core orthopaedic and wound bandaging healthcare division.

FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Restructured Andrews Sykes jumps to Pounds
0.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Andrews Sykes Group, the specialist industrial services
company, grew to Pounds 802,000 in the six months to September 30 compared
with Pounds 519,000.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the results represented 'significant
progress' given that the poor summer weather and lower air conditioning hire
revenues had exacerbated underlying weak demand from the group's traditional
construction industry customer base.
Turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 27.7m (28.1m) and the profits gain
mainly reflected the group's efforts to contain costs and a reduction in
interest costs, which fell to Pounds 992,000 (Pounds 1.16m), offsetting
redundancy costs of Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 6,000).
The group has undertaken a substantial restructuring in the past two years,
aimed at reducing overheads and improving productivity. The number of depots
has been cut from more than 50 to 35, and staffing has been reduced by 25
per cent resulting in a Pounds 3m pa saving on overheads.
Earnings per share in the latest period were 1.7p (nil) out of which the
group is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 1.4p per share.
Mr Hubbard said the company was 'encouraged by the results for the first
half and are confident that actions to improve productivity will continue to
benefit the group.' However, he added, 'we do not foresee any early upturn
in demand'.
Two months ago the company rebuffed an attempt by Mr Jacques Murray, the
dissident shareholder who holds a 29.2 per cent stake in the group, to
unseat Mr David Hubbard and take control of the board.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: A hard nut to crack -
Eco-friendly business ventures which pave the way for sustainable
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ben Cohen of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream company says it all came to him at a
rainforest benefit hosted by the Grateful Dead. Eager to help nature but
also to make a profit, Cohen saw green when he came across a (legal) organic
commodity at the concert: the Brazil nut, a renewable Amazon resource
extracted by the Kayapo Indians.
Three years later, the US company buys Dollars 1.6m (Pounds 1m) of Brazil
nuts from the Kayapo to make its popular Rainforest Crunch ice cream, a
vanilla-caramel concoction.
Eco-business ventures are a growing though still limited field. They usually
follow a two-pronged approach. First, companies source raw materials from
ecologically threatened areas around the globe to promote the use of
sustainable resources which provide indigenous peoples with foreign capital.
Direct investment in the Amazon, for instance, ties the Indians' welfare to
the welfare of the rainforest, prompting them to protect it against
destructive cutting and burning by developers.
Second, businesses can capitalise on the public relations boost in a market
where most things 'green' are popular. The firms also often support
conservation efforts organised by environmental groups which work with the
people.
This shift in attitude follows years of distrust. Many businesses are
involved in such projects, and no longer stand accused of 'window dressing'.
Meanwhile, conservationists now work closely with the local population, who
were once considered the problem, to develop products and sell them to
interested firms.
Cultural Survival, the US non-profit foundation which sold Cohen on the
Brazil nut, tries to find buyers for products made by indigenous groups with
little access to western markets. The group acts as a trader for 15
commodities from 11 countries to make 125 products. Sales to businesses with
'socially responsible' sourcing practices reach Dollars 2m annually with
clients such as The Body Shop, the cosmetics chain, and retailers like
Macy's and the Nature Company eager to foster a progressive image.
Jason Clay, director of Cultural Survival, acknowledges the trade volume is
scant compared with the Third World's development needs and has barely
scratched the hidden potential. But he expects his nascent operation,
started in 1988, to reach sales of Dollars 50m in five years.
Cultural Survival also benefits directly from the sales. Companies agree to
pass on 5 per cent of their premium to fund the group's programmes. These
include getting indigenous people titles to their land so they will protect
it against ruin; and resource management programmes, needed to raise
standards of living.
Working with local groups to expand commercial opportunity was pioneered
during the 1980s by Chico Mendes, the Brazilian rubber tapper murdered in
1988. The Mendes spirit is in evidence in Ecuador's Esmeraldes region where
the locals produce tagua, an ivory-like palm nut, that can be used to make
buttons. With assistance from Conservation International, another non-profit
body, sales to retailers such as Smith-Holkin, LL Bean and Esprit have
generated Dollars 75,000.
On the surface, this may seem more like charity than business, but the group
says its presence has given conservationists needed leverage in local
politics. For example, Esmeraldes now has a land-use plan and it
successfully opposed a banana plantation development on protected land. The
new thinking has also led environmentalists to reassess their staple
programmes, such as the popular debt-for-nature swaps which have been
criticised for stirring inflationary pressures and creating a market for bad
debt that should be forgiven, not bought.
Conservation International, which pioneered debt-for-nature swaps in 1987,
is using this tool to promote eco-business ventures in Guatemala. Its
Dollars 1.4m debt-for-nature swap funds, for the first time, commercial
extractive activity.
The programme is run in the Maya Biosphere Reserve, a 1.75m-hectare region
in the nation's northern Peten province. The local population of some 15,000
Mestizo people, part Spanish and part Indian, depends on the forests'
natural endowment. But over-harvesting and deforestation has depleted the
forest.
Local people are taught proper harvesting techniques that maximise
sustainable use of the reserve's three primary non-timber products. 'If they
look out over the forest and see their economic future, and the economic
future of their children, they become allies in the ecological conservation
of their forests,' says Jim Nations of Conservation International.

CIVIL WAR and the spread of Aids in many third world countries must be
reduced if improvements in economic development are not to be reversed,
according to a western government study published yesterday.
'We are very concerned that unless conflicts like that in Somalia are put to
rest, (western) governments will have to devote a larger proportion of their
official development assistance to emergency needs,' Mr Alexander Love,
chairman of the 20-country Development Assistance Committee (DAC), said. He
welcomed current discussions in the United Nations about the possibility of
using military means to get food and medicine into Somalia.
Following the annual meeting in Paris of the 20 donor members of the DAC, Mr
Love also expressed worries that recent real increases in western official
aid, running at an average 1.7 per cent over the past five years, would tail
off under the pressure of domestic budgetary constraints and new needs in
eastern Europe.
Aid from Arab countries had declined since the Gulf war, while the ex-Soviet
Union had turned from a net aid donor to recipient. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have become recipients.

FT  02 DEC 92 / Water leaks may influence pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, said
yesterday he would be 'looking very closely' at the costs of water companies
and their leakage rates when - in 1994 - he sets the formula for price rises
in the second half of the decade.
According to a report issued by Ofwat yesterday, nearly a quarter of mains
water leaks away before it gets to the customer.
The loss of more than 22 per cent of water carried in mains and pipes -
more than 3.8 billion litres a day, enough to fill 48,000 baths - may
add to water bills, the report warns. It puts the average cost of water
at 50p per 1,000 litres, equivalent to 4p for a bath.
The water industry has for months warned that the high costs of treating and
supplying water may cause water bills to double in real terms by 2005.
Some southern companies are insisting on fitting meters to houses to
encourage customers to use less water, in spite of recent torrential rains
and the industry's comments that the long southern drought has ended.
Ofwat's report, compiled from the annual returns in July of the 33 water
companies of England and Wales, shows for the first time that costs vary
widely.
The most expensive is South East Water at 86p per 1,000 litres and the
cheapest Portsmouth Water at 33p.
The report says a wide range of prices should be expected as companies
responsible for sewerage and beaches bore a large share of the industry's
capital spending. But Mr Byatt added: 'Those companies with high unit costs
will need to convince me that their costs are justified.'
Ofwat says some leaks are inevitable and it is not always worth the expense
to find and plug them.
The lowest leakage rate was 6 per cent in the Bristol Water, and in
Bournemouth and West Hants, where the cost of treating water is high. The
highest was about 36 per cent for North West.
The Water Services Association and the Water Companies' Association -
representing the 10 large water and sewerage companies and 23 water supply
companies in England and Wales - said 'low costs do not necessarily signify
the most efficient company'.
They added that companies were already spending large sums in dealing with
leakages and estimates of the cost were not precise.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Insurance Names to act against 77 agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY lossmaking Names at Lloyd's of London yesterday forced the withdrawal
of proposals which could have earned hundreds of thousands of pounds for
representatives pursuing legal action on their behalf.
Some 500 Names approved legal action against 77 agents which placed them
with the lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates. Some 2,000 Names will support
the action.
The Names, whose capital backs the insurance market, also agreed to raise
Pounds 2.8m to pay their legal fees in what could be a complex and long
drawn-out legal action.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group,
bowed to overwhelming pressure from his members by agreeing to withdraw an
'incentive package' which could have been worth up to Pounds 300,000 for
each of 12 members of the action group's committee.
The Names will seek to recover Pounds 248m in losses, about 10 per cent of
the total suffered by Lloyd's as a whole in 1988 and 1989, in an action
which will allege negligence by the agents. However Mr Doll-Steinberg said
that it would have been 'divisive' to put the plan to claim 'success fees' -
which would have been separate from legal costs - for recovering losses to
the meeting.
'There seems to be a certain groundswell,' said Mr Doll-Steinberg. 'The word
obscene is being used over and over again. If you could find another epithet
I'd be grateful.' added Mr Doll-Steinberg, who said new proposals would be
put to another meeting in January.
'I wish you would express your feelings equally strongly to the people who
lost you the money in the first place,' he added.
Although many Names accepted that committee members might need some
remuneration, many questioned the scale of the promised success fees.
'Most people believe it is obscene that you should, having decided to serve
on a voluntary basis, then ask for Pounds 300,000' said Mr Claud Gurney.
'There is no point in appointing lawyers and then negotiating yourself, '
said Mr Alan Navaratil. 'You are keeping a dog and barking yourself.'
'We're not against you, but the goalposts are being moved during the game,'
added another Name, who said that the division would 'gladden the hearts' of
the members' agents against whom the Names were fighting.
Earlier Mr Paul Marland, MP, who was one of three new Gooda Walker Names
elected to the action group's committee, said he was hopeful about the
prospects for a negotiated settlement but that the group 'must arm itself.
We intend to keep our legal tanks full of fuel.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at a steelrolling mill at Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, yesterday
rejected a deal to end a five-month strike.
Production at Spartan Redheugh, part of GM Firth, the steel stockholding
group, has been at a standstill since July when management took steps to
sweep away a bonus system it described as 'archaic' and introduce more
flexible working practices.
The strikers, members of the AEEU electricians' and engineering workers'
union and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, claim they were faced
with pay cuts of up to 25 per cent. Acrimony increased when the company
advertised for a new manual workforce. Nobody has so far been recruited.
The proposed package of terms and conditions was negotiated between the
unions and management with help from Acas, the conciliation service. The
strikers said they had rejected the proposal because it would mean 45
redundancies and included unacceptable preconditions.
Mr Peter Scarff, director of operations at Spartan Redheugh, said the plan
would have meant no more than 15 redundancies and would have given the
manual workforce a minimum wage of Pounds 6.50 per hour. In exchange the
company wanted to introduce new working practices, he said. Union officials
are understood to have believed that the package was the best obtainable.

LORD Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, warned last night that civil unrest
could break out unless more money was put into the justice system.
Cost and delay were two 'blots' on the system, and to deprive it of adequate
funds 'endangers the very framework of our society,' he said when delivering
the BBC's Richard Dimbleby Lecture.
The backlog of court cases threatened to become a national disgrace.

REYNOLDS Metals is to take a Dollars 827m charge to 1992 earnings as a
result of changes in accounting methods for taxes and medical and other
non-pension post-retirement benefits. Part of the charge, announced
yesterday, represents additional environmental and restructuring costs.
The company said the benefits accounting changes, required under new US
accounting standards, would amount to charges of Dollars 610m.
Previously-reported results for the first three quarters of 1992 will be
restated to include higher charges for post-retirement benefits, said Mr
Richard Holder, chairman.
Mr Holder said the charge for the year would be Dollars 34m after taxes,
distributed evenly over four quarters. Another Dollars 30m in charges for
changes in income tax accounting would be reflected in the 1992 results, Mr
Holder said.
Of the Dollars 827m total charges, Dollars 97m are provisions for
environmental remediation requirements.
Restructuring costs comprise Dollars 56m of the total. Part of those charges
stem from an early retirement programme that the company will offer to up to
800 employees.
A company spokesman said the restructuring was part of a major cost-cutting
effort.
For the first nine months of 1992, Reynolds reported net income of Dollars
67.2m, or Dollars 1.13 a share, compared with Dollars 130.4m, or Dollars
2.20, a year earlier.

SENIOR US navy officials have recommended that the captain of the US
aircraft carrier Saratoga and seven other crewmen be disciplined for the
missile firing on October 2 that killed five Turkish sailors, defence
officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
They said any punishment in the accident would probably be short of a court
martial for the officers and enlisted men but could effectively end the
careers of the eight, including Captain James Drager, the ship's commander.
The navy will release its report today on the accident, in which the
Saratoga fired two Sea Sparrow missiles at the Turkish destroyer Muavenet,
killing the captain and four crewmen and injuring 18 others.
In Ankara, the Turkish navy blamed poor training and discipline on the
Saratoga for the accident. It said poorly trained crew on the Saratoga took
about 15 minutes to realise the aircraft carrier had fired missiles at the
Turkish destroyer.
A Turkish officer, intrepreting scenes from Saratoga's on-deck cameras, said
about four minutes passed before the carrier became aware it had launched
the missiles. Another 12 minutes went by, he said, before the US ship was
able to identify the Muavenet. The two vessels were about three nautical
miles apart.
The US defence officials said the incident in the Aegean Sea during a Nato
exercise resulted from confusion aboard the Saratoga and that several senior
officers were found to be responsible.
Pentagon sources said last Friday that the missiles were fired because some
of the Saratoga's crew, awakened at midnight for a drill, thought their ship
was under attack.
One defence official said Admiral Henry Mauz, commander of the Atlantic
Fleet, recommended that six of the Saratoga's senior officers and two
enlisted men face so-called non-judicial 'mast' hearings to determine their
punishment.
While such hearings often result only in formal letters of reprimand and no
reduction in rank or pay, those letters usually preclude promotion. Senior
officers often leave the service after receiving a letter of reprimand.

<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council has 'no alternative' but to authorise the use of
force to secure international relief operations in famine-stricken Somalia,
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, told members last night.
Among five options he proposed was a Gulf war 'Desert Storm'-style operation
not under UN command and control but 'undertaken by member states acting
with the authorisation of the Security Council.' The US last week offered to
send up to 30,000 troops to Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people
have died from starvation as civil war continues - but only if US commanders
were in control of the force.
As the country now has no government that can request and allow the use of
outside force, the Council would have to determine a threat justifying
forceful measures to maintain international peace and security, Mr Boutros
Ghali said. He was responding to a Council request last week for his views,
even before the US offer was disclosed.
The Security Council is expected to decide within a week whether to accept
US proposals and, if so, how to employ the troops alongside a small UN
operation that has proved woefully inadequate.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUERTO RICAN fears that the island's export markets in the US will be
damaged by Mexico's participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta) have been eased significantly.
Instead, there are clear indications that the impending trade pact could
bring significant benefit to the island.
Puerto Rico sold goods to the US last year valued at about Dollars 17bn
(Pounds 11.1bn), accounting for 85 per cent of its total exports. But
government officials and economists in the US Caribbean possession had
feared that earnings would be reduced because of direct competition from a
more cost-efficient Mexico in Nafta.
A study commissioned by the island's development bank, however, has
concluded that, if Nafta were to be implemented, Puerto Rico would have a
clear advantage over Mexico in the US and Canadian markets in
pharmaceuticals, electronic components and accessories, professional
instruments, electronic computing and rum distilling.
This conclusion, said the study by US consultants KPMG Peat Marwick, is
based on comparisons of the return on investments in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
'In pharmaceuticals, the estimated rate of return to a Puerto Rican
investment. . . . is about 65 per cent, whereas after Nafta the rate of
return to an investment in Mexico making the same product for the US market
is about 32 per cent,' said the study.
It suggested, however, that Puerto Rico would be hard put to compete
successfully with Mexico in some sectors. In clothing, for example, the rate
of return on investments in Mexico would be 50 per cent with the
implementation of Nafta, while the rate in Puerto Rico would be 30 per cent.
There would be similar disadvantages for textile, tuna and leather footwear
industries.

Beyond conventions - The city recognises tourism's economic power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO'S muscular beauty has the power to stagger the first-time visitor.
Instead of the dull, industrial city with little eye-appeal that many fear,
it surprises with unexpected physical charm and lots of cultural
sophistication.
The city makes the most of its location on Lake Michigan, with a series of
clean lakefront parks and beaches, and its modern architecture - including
the world's tallest building - is impressive. The development that has
lately come along the Chicago River, which cuts through the city, has also
won urban planners' applause.
The city can claim a world-famous symphony orchestra, a highly acclaimed
opera, a first-rate art museum, a vast array of excellent and ethnic
restaurants, America's best blues clubs and richest theatre life outside New
York.
It is odd, then, that it has promoted itself little as a tourist
destination. But that is changing.
Until now, given its central location in the US, it has built its travel
fame on conventions, trade shows and business meetings. These brought over
3.35m visitors and Dollars 2.5bn in spending to the city last year. Although
the number of visitors is expected to fall marginally this year, expenditure
is projected to reach Dollars 2.7bn.
Chicago hopes to expand this business further with a Dollars 987m expansion
of McCormick Place, its premier convention and trade show location: 1.2m
square feet of exhibition and conference space will be added to the current
facility. The expansion, to be completed by 1997, is slated to bring in an
additional Dollars 1.6bn annually in revenues to the state of Illinois.
Chicago hoteliers can hardly wait. Occupancy rates have dropped to a
painfully low 60-65 per cent, after the addition of eight large, new hotels
since 1990. The construction spree began in the late 1980s after a period of
relative shortage of hotel space.
Since 1988, 5,551 rooms have been added in downtown Chicago. Of these, 2,086
have been added during the past year alone by Stouffer, Sheraton and
Marriott. Nearly 25,000 rooms are available in the city itself, and there
are 64,000 within the metropolitan area.
But the additional rooms came on line just as the American economy slowed
and the convention business began to shrink. Although the attendance at
trade shows in Chicago has increased slightly over the past five years,
convention attendance is down from a high of 538,000 in 1988 to 333,000 last
year. But projections are up for 1992, and the hope is that 1993 will bring
an economic upturn.
Yet while the city continues to focus on the lucrative convention and
trade-show business, it has begun to see the economic power of tourism. It
has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in the past 20 years, and has
little hope of attracting major industrial projects to restore them. Chicago
thus finds itself pinning its economic hopes increasingly on the travel and
tourism industry.
The most striking example of this shift is Mayor Richard Daley's fight for a
controversial Dollars 2bn casino complex (described on this page).
Further evidence of Chicago's attention to tourism is its expenditure of
Dollars 150m to renovate Navy Pier, a 1916 naval installation that juts
directly from the city centre into Lake Michigan.
It has been used for many purposes over the years, including trade shows and
art exhibits. But the renovation, to be completed by 1994, will be directed
primarily at tourism. It will include a children's museum, a botanical
garden, a pavilion for performing arts, retail shops, a multi-purpose
170,000sq ft exposition space, and a destination restaurant overlooking the
lake.
While it already receives nearly 12m visitors a year, Chicago wants to
increase that number. It would particularly like to draw more international
tourists, who numbered roughly 1.5m last year, according to statistics for
the state of Illinois. It is due to complete the construction next summer of
a new international terminal at O'Hare airport, one of the world's busiest
civil aviation hubs.
This will especially help to handle traffic when Chicago hosts the opening
of the soccer World Cup in 1994.
A Dollars 10bn third international airport proposal was shelved earlier this
year, after Mayor Daley had failed to win approval for the project from the
Illinois legislature. Many speculate, however, that the proposal has simply
gone on the back burner until the mayor finds a propitious moment to revive
it.
With the rising importance of the travel, tourism and the hospitality
industry, the Chicago of the 1990s little resembles the gritty steel and
meat-packing town that gained fame in the early part of this century as Carl
Sandburg's 'city of broad shoulders'. But with era of heavy lifting gone
from America, it cannot be faulted for failing to try to change with the
times.

First-world economy, third-world slums - Laurie Morse describes the other
side of the US's most racially segregated city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE sniper-shot in October accomplished what decades of social
benefaction could not. It galvanised the public against the crime and
neglect that plagues the city's poor.
The shot killed Dantrell Davis, a seven-year old boy, as he crossed, with
his mother, the few yards between his public housing apartment and his
ghetto school.
The violence has forced the city to acknowledge the failure of its public
housing system, and to address, however briefly, the evils bred by a system
that for decades has dealt with its poor by warehousing them in dilapidated
high-rise blocks and isolating them from the rest of the community.
Chicago, like large cities around the globe, has its share of poverty and
its attendant crime, homelessness and hopelessness. However, the magnificent
wealth of the urban area, its natural resources, and its progressive
business community form a foil to the city's grit; and the contrast, deepest
at the city's core, strikes even a casual visitor.
The starkest contrast is the geographic and economic separation between
black and white citizens. Sociologists have measured the division, and
report that Chicago is the most racially segregated city in the US. In his
book American Apartheid, Doug Massey, professor of sociology at the
University of Chicago, makes a compelling argument that segregation is the
cause of urban poverty.
The city is one of minorities. The 1990 census counted 2.7m city residents.
Of these, 1.3m were white, 1.1m black, and slightly more than half a million
of Hispanic origin.
Despite growing political activism by black and Hispanic voters, Chicago's
deeply ingrained separatism has been slow to change. Friction between these
two minorities impedes progress, and the city's history of political
patronage often short-circuits reform efforts.
The two worlds that make Chicago - its first-world economy and its
third-world slums - co-exist in extremes. Two of the worlds' most highly
regarded private universities - Chicago and Northwestern - abut what is by a
variety of measures the nation's worst public elementary and secondary
education system. World-renowned private libraries and museums serve the
city's elite, while the new central public library, a Dollars 144m pile of
brick and mortar named after Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington,
is starved of books and operates on a reduced schedule.
From the windows of amenity-stuffed lakeshore condominiums, one can glimpse
the high-rise blocks where Chicago's desperate poor are stacked in a
decades-old public housing nightmare. And on the streets are an estimated
49,000 people who have no housing at all.
Repeatedly, in conversations with the city's corporate and civic leaders,
the costs of racial and economic divisions are counted in terms of lost
human capital, poorly prepared workers, and quality-of-life issues like
crime, drugs, and homelessness.
A recent study by the SRI Center for Economic Competitiveness, of Menlo
Park, California, and Data Resources, the economic forecasting firm, cites
declining workforce quality as one factor eroding Illinois' global
competitiveness. It said vital co-operation between industry, government and
education, needed to tackle the problem, was lacking.
Chicago's public school system is an example. Forty-six per cent of children
entering its public high schools in 1986 failed to graduate with their class
in 1990. The drop-out rate for boys topped 50 per cent, and for some
minorities, particularly young Hispanic men, it approached 70 per cent.
Achievement levels for children who stay in school are well below national
averages. Only a quarter of the city's elementary students can read at their
grade levels, and the statistics are equally dismal for mathematics
preparation.
This wasteland has not been ignored by the corporate community. Industry
pours hundreds of thousands of dollars into school improvement programmes
annually, and landmark school reform legislation, crafted by an unusual
partnership of politicians and corporate leaders, was enacted in 1988. The
reform was aimed at dismantling the school system's politically-charged
central bureaucracy and putting control of the city's 560 schools in the
hands of parents and local communities.
Three years later, the experiment is foundering. Special interests divide
the effort; the Dollars 2.5bn school budget continues to face annual crises;
and the massive school bureacracy has clung to power, frustrating local
school councils. The latest casualty of the struggle is the city schools
superintendent, Mr Ted Kimbrough, who was hired to implement the school
reform plan.
In announcing that he will not renew his contract, Mr Kimbrough told the
Chicago Tribune that he was defeated by politics. A veteran of political
school wars in his previous post in California, he said: 'The difference in
Chicago is the intensity of the politics. The magnitude of it, how it is
part of the culture. . . It cripples everything.'
Meanwhile, the city's corporate leaders, political elite, even its public
school teachers, attend to a separate system, and send their children to
private or suburban schools.
Housing activist Mr Alexander Polikoff says the failure of Chicago's
leadership successfully to address racial and economic divisions is not
unique. In fact, he says, the city's wealth has enabled it to avoid crises
like those seen in St Louis and Los Angeles.
A private consortium of corporate trusts provided Dollars 2.5m to community
groups this summer for a jobs programme, aimed at heading off tensions that
followed the Los Angeles riots. Longer-range jobs programmes are under
consideration in the private sector, and small but promising efforts to move
poor families out of public housing are gaining praise.
Since the shooting, Chicago's housing deputy, Mr Vincent Lane, has renewed
his effort to use federal housing dollars earmarked for building renovation
for construction of new, low-density housing outside the ghettos' borders.
Even the violent street gangs that control the Cabrini-Green project where
Dantrell Davis was killed have been jarred into calling a truce. However,
their pact offers a challenge to Chicago's mayor. The peace, gang leaders
say, will last only if jobs are provided, and robbing and drug-dealing
become less essential for survival.

Gambling for jobs - A casino? The stakes are high, the decision is near /
Barbara Harrison discusses a plan that would bring a massive gambling
operation to a large metropolitan US city for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a sign of the times and of Chicago's fiscal fortunes. The city, whose
job base has dramatically shifted away from manufacturing to services, is
backing a controversial proposal for a Dollars 2bn casino complex as its
next best hope for economic development.
The plan, if approved, would mark the first time that a massive gambling
operation has been established in a major metropolitan US city.
The project was proposed earlier this year by three of the gaming industry's
biggest players, Circus Circus, Caesars World and Hilton Hotels, all
publicly traded companies. But in order for the project to go ahead, it must
win approval in the Illinois legislature. The vote, in a special session, is
due in the coming week and is expected to be close.
The project's promises are sweeping. It would theoretically create over
35,000 permanent jobs, provide annual tax revenues of Dollars 500m for the
state and the city, and increase tourist spending by over Dollars 5bn.
These estimates are enough to seduce many a city, and Mayor Richard Daley
knows that if Chicago does not win approval for the project, another will
gladly accept the investment. No tax incentives are involved.
Gambling is being used increasingly in the US to raise tax revenues.
According to Mr Owen Youngman, assistant managing editor for financial news
at the Chicago Tribune: 'It is foolish to pretend that it won't come to
major cities.'
Moreover, if the spread of gambling cannot be contained, analysts say there
is value, with tourism in mind, in being the first large city to have a
casino complex.
But the project has provoked spirited opposition. Its most important
opponent, however, is Illinois governor Jim Edgar, a Republican. Mr Edgar,
no fan of gambling, says there is enough of it in the state already, what
with horse racing, river-boat casinos and a lottery. These gambling
interests are against the casino as unwanted competition.
Among the arguments of other opponents is that gambling tax is a regressive
taxation, preying on those with the least to lose. Some also feel that the
casino business is alloyed with organised crime and its unsavory trades like
prostitution.
Chicago, once a mob mecca, has spent years living down that reputation, and
many Chicagoans do not want it revived.
Yet the state's largest business organisation, the Illinois Chamber of
Commerce, has backed the casino plan, as has one of Chicago's most
prestigious clubs of chief executives, the civic committee of the Commercial
Club of Chicago.
Mr Daley has helped win Chicago business support with a pledge to phase out
its onerous head tax of Dollars 5 a month on every employee. He also
attempted to sweeten the deal for state legislators with the suggestion of a
Dollars 1bn bond offer to improve state schools.
While these ploys may win some supporters, a single fact has convinced many
others: such large-scale private investments in older cities are scarce. Mr
Daley said he tells casino opponents: 'If you have an alternative, I'll
listen.' But he adds: 'No one has walked through my door.'
If Mr Daley loses in the legislature, no other large project that would
create as many permanent jobs seems to be waiting in the wings. Last summer,
he lost a bid for legislative approval of the other major project for the
city, a Dollars 10bn third international airport. It is conceivable that
this could be revived at a future date, though the mayor is giving no hints.
Job-creating investments, particularly larger-scale manufacturing, are not
easily attracted to the city. They are discouraged by a 7.3 per cent
corporate income tax, the city's heavy union presence and the scarcity of
large land parcels. Most sites are on the small side, and many have daunting
environmental liabilities.
Chicago, with a population close to 3m, has been haemorrhaging manufacturing
jobs for two decades. Between 1970 and 1990, the city itself lost half of
its manufacturing jobs, some 219,000. The loss was nearly double that in the
metropolitan area, which includes the surrounding counties and the city with
a total population 6m.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago predicts that, between 1990
and 2000, metropolitan Chicago will have suffered an additional loss of
12,000 to 15,000 manufacturing jobs, with makers of electrical machinery
especially hard hit.
But in economic terms, there is little reason for gloom. While manufacturing
jobs have evaporated, productivity gains have kept the gross product rising;
and that trend, too, is expected to continue through 2012. Moreover, the
decline in manufacturing jobs has been largely offset so far by increases in
service jobs, and, during this decade, the Fed predicts a further
substantial increase in service employment.
Diane Swonk, regional economist for the First National Bank of Chicago,
warns, however, that the new service jobs that are being created are not for
the low-skilled. 'That's the biggest challenge for Chicago, the mismatch in
jobs and skill levels,' she said.
Mr Daley believes the casino project would help the city to ease
unemployment among the lower skilled. He may be right, but many hope,
nonetheless, that the casino is not symbolic of where the city is heading.

The pro-business mayor 'could be there for life' - Politics: The force of
the Daley mantle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYOR Richard M. Daley sits in his shirtsleeves, chomping on a fat cigar.
But the cigar is unlit, in what seems to be one of many concessions to new
social views and values by a man who was raised in the old school of
big-city politics.
Mayor Daley is the son of the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ruled
rather than governed the city for two decades. Mayor Daley the elder, who
died in 1976, was the last boss of a big city Democratic party political
machine.
Although the party remains dominant in Chicago politics, 'Richie', as the
current mayor is widely known, now governs with the help of only a shadow of
that powerful machine. But the inheritance of the weighty Daley mantle gives
him unusual force.
He was re-elected last year with a solid majority, lending credence to the
notion, voiced when he was first elected to office, that, if he wanted to,
he could be mayor for life.
'The feeling is that he's going to be here for a while,' said Mr Ed Noha,
chairman of the big Chicago-based CNA Insurance Companies and also recently
named chairman of the Chicago Economic Development Commission, a mixed
public and private group to promote the city's economy.
'Businessmen trust the mayor,' added Mr Noha.
Mr Daley, like his father, holds a pro-business, big-project vision of the
city. The elder Daley was responsible for building O'Hare airport, one of
the world's busiest, and a web of crucial highways.
Today, the mayor is overseeing a near-Dollars 1bn expansion of McCormick
Place, already the largest permanent exhibition space in the country, to
attract greater convention and trade show business. He will also inaugurate
a new international terminal at O'Hare next summer. And, having failed to
win the Illinois legislature's approval for a third Dollars 10bn
international airport in the city, he is undertaking improvements at O'Hare
and Midway, the city's other major airport.
Although he is also working on a fistful of other projects, his most
controversial proposal is for a privately financed Dollars 2bn casino
complex which also requires legislative approval (see page 4 of this
survey). To win that approval, Mr Daley is throwing all his political weight
into the battle. The project promises some Dollars 500m a year in tax
revenues and 35,000 jobs.
While all his big-ticket projects promise to leave a legacy at least as
large as his father's, Mr Daley cannot count on the same kind of federal and
state largess. Such assistance has shrunk markedly in recent years. Yet he
hopes that the Clinton administration will follow through on campaign
promises to help rebuild and improve America's infrastructure.
However, all federal monies go to the states first, and the states then
distribute them to cities and towns. This leaves Mr Daley to wrangle for the
city's share with the state, whose governor, Mr Jim Edgar, is a Republican.
While it seemed that Mr Daley and Mr Edgar were heading earlier this year
for a political partnership of sorts, that broke down with the defeat of the
mayor's third-airport proposal at the hands of Illinois Senate Republicans.
Mr Edgar had favoured the site chosen by the mayor, but he could not, or
would not, control his Senate co-partisans.
New tension in the Daley-Edgar relationship has arisen over the casino
project, which the governor opposes. Mr Daley is pressing hard for the
investment to be approved in the current special session of the legislature.
If he loses, he is likely to shelve it, as he did with the third-airport
proposal.
Although the mayor could look terribly empty handed, having lost the
political battles for two of his most important public projects, he is
expected to denounce the Illinois Republicans for wrecking the possibilities
for tens of thousands of new jobs.
Some believe that Mr Daley is, in fact, paving his way for a governorship
bid in 1994, though he denies it. 'I was in Springfield eight years (as a
state senator),' he said. 'No, I have no interest.'
If that is true, the Daley dynasty may be set to last until Richie tires of
it. 'You can continue to be mayor if you really want it in your heart and
mind,' he said. And, though his public approval dipped after several
infrastructural disasters during the past year (like the downtown flood in
ageing freight tunnels), it seems he retains enough popularity to keep his
spirits up.
But he will not go unchallenged. Mr Daley represents the old white,
Irish-American leadership of South Chicago and, unlike in his father's day,
the city is now nearly 60 per cent black and Hispanic.
The last mayor elected before him was Mr Harold Washington, a charismatic
black politician who died suddenly during his second term. Had Mr Washington
lived, he would probably still be mayor.
The black political analyst, Mr Grayson Mitchell, who was an aide to Mr
Washington, says Mr Daley 'walks on eggshells' to avoid doing anything that
will ignite black political anger. Indeed, Mr Daley is careful, tipping his
hat to minorities with blanket statements, such as: 'You have to break down
racial, religious and ethnic barriers.'
But according to Mr Mitchell, who also leads a successful marketing firm,
minority feelings are seething under the surface, because 'we've gone back
to the social apartheid system of before'.
Curiously, it may not take a black or minority candidate to unseat Mr Daley,
according Mr Bruce DuMont, a nationally syndicated political commentator. If
he sets the black community against him, its votes could easily go to, say,
Mr Jack O'Malley, the Cook County prosecutor and a Republican who has
established a reputation for competence and honesty. Mr O'Malley was
re-elected earlier this month to a second term with a significant portion of
black votes.
Chicago has always been a heavily segregated city, and even though the edges
have softened on that segregation today, it is still starkly apparent. Thus,
Mr Daley, even if he continues to want the mayorlty in his heart and mind,
faces a battle with demography and, some would say, history.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (4):
Brawn underpins services - Investment: diversity provided stability during
the volatile 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHICAGO WAS founded on the brawn of meatpackers and steelmakers at the
conjunction of the nation's biggest rail and water corridors. The
meatpackers have gone and the steel mills are struggling, but good transport
and proximity to the raw materials of agriculture and basic industry remain
the mainstay of corporate activity.
The commodity and stock exchanges, early outgrowths of midwest agriculture,
have made Chicago the financial centre of the region, and given it an unique
international flavour. Deals linking trade with London, Sydney and Tokyo are
frequent front-page news.
Economists say the diversity of the city's economy is what saved it from the
dramatic ups and downs seen elsewhere during the boom and bust of the 1980s.
Despite its heavy industry, the area avoided rustbelt rot. That's not to say
there hasn't been a slowdown. Many leading company's have seen their growth
stalled, and others, already lean, are downscaling further.
Values in Chicago's residential real estate market dipped only slightly in
the past two years, in part because they never really experienced a
speculative buying frenzy. As with the rest of the US, Chicago's commercial
real estate market is overbuilt, and financing for some of the city's
downtown showplaces is now quietly under renegotiation.
Chicago was one of the last cities in the US to stop building skyscrapers,
and so, analysts say, will be among the last to digest the excess.
The city's agriculture and heavy industry base saw a regional recession very
early in the 1980s, suffering from international competition and a strong
dollar. The experience forced serious cost restructuring, and the companies
that survived, according to Mr Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern
Trust, are competitively positioned for the expected global economic
recovery.
These companies include the state's metal-benders like its biggest exporter
Caterpillar, Navistar (formerly International Harvester), Deere (which makes
agricultural machinery), and an array of small businesses that process steel
and manufacture parts for the auto and trucking industries. Stock gurus
think the companies read like a shopping list for president-elect Bill
Clinton, who has promised to revive the flagging economy by rebuilding the
country's infrastructure.
At the south end of the city, a small revival is occuring as companies
employ the cheap property and skilled labour left by the cutbacks in
manufacturing there. Australian-owned Welded Tube Company of America is
undergoing a Dollars 40m expansion in the Lake Calumet area, and other
companies are also retooling. However, the area's recovery was dealt a blow
when a plan to site Chicago's third airport near Lake Calumet failed this
summer.
Favourable exchange rates supported exports and revived moribund companies
like Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker and the area's largest exporter.
Illinois, including the Chicago area, had Dollars 16.5bn in exports in 1991,
the bulk of it heavy equipment, chemicals, and agricultural goods. Had they
been included in the export accountings, Chicago would have ranked near the
top of the country in the export of financial services and trading
technology. Canada, Japan and Mexico are the state's biggest trading
partners. Goods shipped to Mexico jumped 23 per cent in 1991, reaching
Dollars 1bn, and offsetting small export declines to the UK and Japan.
While Illinois exports hundreds of thousands of tonnes of crops annually,
the city gains most of its agricultural profits from processing. Downstate
giant Archer Daniels Midland and its competitors have plants in the Chicago
area that produce high-fructose corn syrup, ethanol, starches, animal feed
and vegetable oils. The processed materials supply Chicago's big food
companies like Quaker Oats, Sara Lee and United Biscuits' subsidiary
Keebler. ADM alone exports about Dollars 3bn in farm products annually.
Foreign direct investment in Chicago and its surrounding counties levelled
off in 1992, after growing dramatically in the previous decade. KPMG Peat
Marwick's 1992 survey of inbound investment in Illinois counts 617
foreign-owned companies headquartered in the state, up from 173 a decade
ago. Most are located in the Chicago area. Of the 312 companies that
responded to the survey, 132 were Japanese, followed by Britain with 47, and
Germany with 41. They represent combined employment of 30,417, and capital
investment of Dollars 1.9bn. Fourth-five per cent of those surveyed said
they planned to expand.
Brawny industry is just the underpinning to a strong service-based economy.
The city boasts the greatest number of Fortune 500 corporate headquarters
outside New York. Drug and high-technology companies dot Chicago's suburbs.
Multinational giants like McDonald's, Waste Management, United Airlines and
Motorola are based there, though their operations and workforces are
scattered around the globe.
Although the November issue of Fortune magazine named Chicago as one of the
nation's top 10 cities for business, not all of the city's corporate
citizens would agree.
Chicago's bad public school system and the pull of a better-prepared
suburban workforce has begun to drain corporate interest from the downtown
area. Sears, the financial and merchandising giant, is relocating its
36,000-plus Chicago workforce from its trophy mid-town office tower to a new
campus in suburban Hoffman Estates. The decision was made in advance of this
summer's news that Sears plans to break up and spin off many of its
operations in order to concentrate on its retailing core.
High taxes, heavily organised labour, and limited availability of suitable
land parcels for expansion are forcing some companies out of the area
entirely. Spiegel, the retail and catalogue giant, will pull its
127-year-old operation out of Chicago in early 1994, and relocate the 2,200
jobs to Columbus, Ohio. It already has a non-unionised facility there, where
there is an adequate site for expansion.
In an effort to stem the outflow, the city last summer floated a Dollars
160m bond issue to finance infrastructure improvements. One of the first
projects to benefit will be a planned relocation of the city's vital South
Water Street produce market to a 62-acre facility on the west side. City
planners say the site offers more viable truck routes as well as modern
facilities.
Improvements are also under way at O'Hare, which is in a tough battle with
Houston to keep its place as the country's premier airport. A plush new
international terminal is scheduled to open next summer. The new
construction, first priced at Dollars 470m, has experienced cost overruns,
and may leave the city holding a bill for Dollars 600m. Air France recently
opened an Dollars 18m cargo-handling facility at O'Hare, a nod to the
fastest growing segment of the airport's business.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (3):
Back to profitability but the neighbours are muscling in - Banking: the big
two are not having it all their own way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO IS the banking centre of the Midwest, but its banks, handicapped by
archaic state banking laws, have not experienced the healthy growth of some
of their regional competitors.
While the city's two biggest banks, First National Bank of Chicago and
Continental, are returning to profitability, they are losing out in a battle
for regional market share to more muscular bank holding companies in
neighbouring states.
Continental Bank, once a flagship of Chicago's investment community, was
grounded by energy-related credit problems in 1984. Since then it has
reshaped itself as a regional corporate bank, downsized significantly, and
last year became a fully public company again, when the government sold the
last of its Continental stock holdings, ending a Dollars 4.5bn bail-out.
Continental last year had assets of Dollars 24bn, about half of its 1981
peak of Dollars 47bn. It incurred a Dollars 76m loss in 1991, but has had
three profitable quarters in 1992.
'Continental is a brand-new bank now, run by new people,' says Mr Kenneth
Puglisi, a Chicago Corporation bank analyst, 'It is really very focused.'
Continental has shed its primary dealership in government bonds, divested
most of its futures operations (though it still provides financial services
to Chicago's many exchanges and brokerage firms), and sold off its retail
accounts to its old rival, First Chicago. A lavish remodelling of the lobby
of its LaSalle Street building replaced teller windows with upmarket
clothing boutiques and coffee shops. Many older Chicagoans are still
surprised that they can buy a pizza in the Continental concourse, but they
can't open a cheque-book account.
Analysts praise Continental's chairman, Thomas Theobald, for successful
pursuit of the corporate banking strategy. While the bank still needs to
bolster its credit ratings, the analysts say it has taken the lead in
pricing corporate loans, and is using its focus to regain profitability.
A few blocks away, Chicago's other big bank, First Chicago, has taken a
different tack. Like other money-centre banks in the 1980s, First Chicago
was battered by non-performing loans to developing countries, by the ups and
downs of highly leveraged transactions and, most recently, by credit
problems in its commercial property portfolio.
In 1991, the bank earned only Dollars 116.3m on assets of Dollars 47bn, down
from Dollars 221.1m in 1990. Losing patience with the slow bleeding of
profits, and seeing little near-term improvement in the US property market,
First Chicago took decisive action this summer.
The bank announced the sale of Dollars 2.1bn in foreclosed properties and
problem loans, valuing them at about 54 cents to the dollar. The sales and
write-down left First Chicago with a Dollars 625m charge to earnings, but by
taking the hit all at once, the bank is now free to move beyond the problem.
Unlike Continental, First Chicago's strategy for survival in the 1990s is to
focus on its retail franchise. The bank recently bought a smaller rival,
American National Bank, to strengthen its retail base, and caught the
outflow when Continental closed its teller windows. It still provides cash
management and other services to corporate accounts, but its profile has
become much more of a regional bank than a money-centre presence.
In that role it faces stiff competition. The Chicago banking scene, with its
many small but very profitable properties, is an attractive grazing ground
for outsiders. Regulatory changes, some as recent as 1991, have opened
Illinois to out-of-state banks, and now allow expansion through acquisition.
Until recently, bank holding companies and branch banking were prohibited in
Illinois. That regulatory twist spawned more than 12,000 independent banks
in the state. Now, with profitability boosted by a year and a half of low
interest rates and a generally resilient Midwest economy, the myriad small
banks are the focus of aggressive regional consolidation.
'Illinois is now wide open to multi-bank holding companies,' said Mr Michael
Sammon, senior vice-president for banking at Chicago-based Howe and Barnes
Investments, 'However, since the state was so late in making changes,
Illinois banks were not in the capital position to take advantage of them.'
Regional giants like Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One have been massing bank
holdings in their home states, and have ample capital to stage Chicago
acquisitions. Banc One has bought a series of Chicago-area banks this year
and NBD, a Detroit bank holding company, has been equally aggressive in
Chicago's suburbs. Tending their own wounds, First Chicago and Continental
have barely participated in the buying spree.
Mr Sammon predicts that the consolidations and holding company purchases
will continue through the next five years, although plenty of small
independent banks will remain.
Foreign banks are also on the prowl for acquisitions, and prefer to serve
the international financing needs of the futures-exchange-dominated loop
community. ABN Three years ago, ABN (now part of ABN Amro, the biggest bank
in the Netherlands) bought Chicago's fifth-largest bank, LaSalle National.
This year ABN Amro used LaSalle as the base to purchase Tallman Home
Federal, a troubled but profitable savings and loan. The combined assets of
Tallman and LaSalle top Dollars 12bn and have leap-frogged ABN Amro into
third place in Chicago's bank ranking.
Harris, now Chicago's fourth-largest bank, was purchased by The Bank of
Montreal in 1984. The Canadian bank takes a very low-key role in the city,
and has not had ABN Amro's bent for expansion.
Not to be overlooked in Chicago's banking community is the stolid, and
solidly independent Northern Trust. Led by conservative management, Northern
avoided most of the credit pitfalls of its LaSalle Street neighbours and
maintains a successful niche administering trusts, particularly corporate
pension funds, and providing banking services to high net worth individuals.
A perennial pick of bank analysts, Northern has assests of Dollars 14.3bn
and last year earned a record Dollars 127.4m or a Dollars 3.41 per share, a
10 per cent gain over 1990.
While its bottom line makes Chicago's fifth-largest bank a sweet acquisition
target, Northern Trust, the management says, is not for sale.

After-hours Globex has yet to live up to its promise - Volumes continue to
expand, but the growth of the two huge futures exchanges has been dwarfed by
foreign rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD's two largest futures markets, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), have put the city on the world's
financial map.
The two exchanges have experienced over 200 per cent growth during the past
decade; and, along with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the
world's largest options market, they account for the largest portion
anywhere of international trade in exchange-traded derivatives.
In the process, they have attracted financial firms from around the globe,
and generated thousands of jobs and millions of dollar in revenue for the
city.
While their volumes continue to expand, their growth has been dwarfed by
foreign rivals. Global competition and maturing markets are denting the
exchanges' margins, and have forced them to initiate new product strategies.
Chicago exchanges still trade commodities, but their bread-and-butter is
financial instruments. Their foreign currency, debt, and stock index futures
cater for a profession of financial engineers who specialise in risk
management. Managed money, in the form of pension funds, mutual funds and
investment portfolios, is the lifeblood of the pits. That money follows the
best returns at the lowest cost, and is indifferent to geography or whether
the trade is made on an exchange or over the counter.
As managed money sloshes around the globe, more and more of its is settling
in overseas futures markets modelled on Chicago. While the CME saw 27.8 per
cent volume growth in the first half of 1992, and the CBOT 11.1 per cent,
the London International Futures Exchange (Liffe) expanded its trading by
83.9 per cent, and the new Deutsche Terminborse had a 142.8 per cent volume
increase.
The size of the futures pie grows with each new exchange that opens, but
Chicago's share is dwindling. Five years ago, the two Chicago giants
commanded 80 per cent of the world market. In 1992 that share is down to
about 40 per cent. Chicago's long-awaited global trading weapon, Globex,
opened in June after a five-year incubation. The electronic after-hours
system, developed as a partnership between the CME, CBOT, and Reuters
Holdings, has yet to live up to its promise. Traders ignored the system
during Europe's August currency crisis and hurled their trades into Europe's
exchanges, generating record volume at Liffe and not even a blip on Globex.
On average, daily volume bumps along below 10,000 contracts. At that rate,
it will take years for Reuters to recover the estimated Dollars 70m
investment it has made in the system.
The CBOT has been more direct about answering the foreign incursion. Since
1987, it has run a second shift of bond trading in the evenings, bridging
the gap between the regular US and Japanese trading days. Preferring open
outcry to screen trading, CBOT executives are negotiating with Liffe for
rights to trade UK, German and Italian debt futures in its evening pits.
Chicago's exchanges are also domesticating their new competitors' products,
with mixed success. The CME's dollar-denominated version of the Nikkei-225
stock index generates about 14,000 contracts a month, but its new FT-SE 100
product has been slow to catch on. The CBOT's stab at a Japanese yen bond
contract failed entirely.
Closer to home, the CME and the CBOE are betting that new index products,
aimed at institutional money managers, will generate business. Sector
investing is a hot property on Wall Street. The CBOE recently launched
options on a small-stock index called the Russell 2000, and plans an entire
portfolio of industry sector indices. The first of these, an index of
biotechnology stocks, is already being traded.
The CME has created a stable of indexed futures, starting with its S&amp;P 500
futures contract, two foreign stock indices and a new mid-cap index of US
stocks. This year it also launched futures on a commodity index compiled by
Goldman Sachs and used by some traders to track inflation.
The CBOT is branching out in two new and untried lines of business with its
proposals to trade futures on emission control permits to be issued by the
US government under new clean-air legislation, and its planned catastrophe
insurance futures. The first of the insurance futures contracts will be
launched on December 11.
New regulations governing US futures trading, passed last month, are
expected to give the Chicago exchanges additional opportunities to expand
the types of product they trade, and the way in which they trade them.
In addition to the CBOT, the CME and the CBOE, the city has three other
exchange entities that are often overshadowed by their more visible
counterparts:
The Midwest Stock Exchange, formed in 1882 as the Chicago Stock Exchange, is
second only to New York in stock trading volume. An average of 10.5m shares
a day pass through the exchange, with about 43 per cent of those block
trades of 2,000 shares or more. In addition to stock trading, the MSE has a
healthy business clearing trades and providing equity-related trust
services. The MSE is also the authorised clearing house for the US
mortgage-backed securities industry. Like Chicago's futures exchanges, the
MSE sells its trading technology to developing markets overseas.
The Options Clearing Corporation, first created to process trades for the
Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973, is now the world's largest clearing
organisation for derivative instruments. It matches and guarantees stock
options trades and provides high-tech communications to its members. It is
jointly owned by the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock
Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the Pacific Stock
Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, for whom it provides clearing
services.
The Chicago Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, owned by, but independent
of, the Chicago Board of Trade, provides trade clearing and processing
services to the futures exchange.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (1):
Exchanges defend their world title - Diversification has helped to insulate
the city from the worst of the economic downturn, writes Barbara Harrison,
introducing this portrait of the 'no boom, no bust' capital of the US
Midwest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO, big, brash, and very American, has a runner-up complex that compels
it always to try harder.
As the third largest US city, it wants to prove that it is as good as New
York for business and finance, and as culturally up to the minute, if more
high-minded, as Los Angeles. The phrase 'second to none' rolls off
Chicagoans' lips remarkably often.
Thus the capital of the great Midwestern swathe known as America's heartland
is competing increasingly against the two US coasts for international
attention.
Over the past decade or so, the international prominence of the city has
surpassed the dreams of most Chicagoans. Thanks largely to the remarkable
growth of its futures and options markets, Chicago now figures on the maps
of every major financial institution in the world.
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME),
the world's two largest futures exchanges, and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the world's largest options exchange, have ridden the crest of a
global derivatives trading wave. On many days, more money - measured in the
value of derivative products - passes through Chicago's hands than New
York's.
This new world role has allowed Chicago to temper, if not bury, its old
gritty image as a steel and meat-packing town - the poet Carl Sandburg's
'city of broad shoulders.' And the view of Chicago as Al Capone territory
has also faded. While organised crime and corruption still exist, they are
nowhere near the blown-up dimensions of Hollywood's version of
Prohibition-era Chicago.
The city's futures markets have also had to contend with a negative image.
The CBOT and the CME have waged a public relations battle against those who
view futures trading as just a half step away from gambling. The efforts of
the exchanges were, however, set back by the 1989 scandal, in which 47
traders were indicted for fraud following an undercover investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Since then, reforms of trading practices have helped to quieten criticism,
and the increasing use of electronic trading devices is expected to provide
further protection against fraud.
Yet the meteoric rise in the international financial importance of Chicago's
futures markets was not lost on other countries. During the past few years,
new foreign futures markets, led by the London International Financial
Futures Exchange, have been eating away at Chicago's once dominant world
market share of futures trading. Together, the CBOT and CME now claim only
40 per cent of the world's trading volume for futures.
The greatest challenge to the CBOT and CME during this decade will be to
keep their market share from dropping further. They are fighting back by
launching more products with international appeal and with Globex, the
round-the-clock electronic trading system.
On the positive side, the explosion of derivatives trading has brought a
tide of financial investors to the city, including many foreign banks and
brokerage houses. All of the major Japanese banks and brokerages, for
example, have opened Chicago operations. Overall, some 70 foreign banks are
present. The markets, with their accompanying investments and jobs, have
helped fuel an extensive retooling of the local economy over the past 15
years. In the mid-1970s, Chicago was still heavily reliant on manufacturing.
Some 35-36 per cent of its jobs were in manufacturing then, whereas today
manufacturing accounts for only 17-18 per cent - similar to the national
figure, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
The shift from manufacturing was helped by the collapse of the local steel
industry at the start of the 1980s. A general industrial restructuring that
came in the wake of the 1982-83 recession pushed it along further. That
recession, which hit the Midwest particularly hard, and the painful
retrenchment after it kept the region from experiencing the giddy 1980s boom
that occurred on both US coasts.
Chicago plodded through the 1980s with slow growth; but it increasingly
diversified, creating jobs in financial services, telecommunications,
transportation, insurance, real estate, distribution, food and health. The
number of service jobs roughly offset the losses in manufacturing, leaving
city employment to hover at the 1.2m mark since 1977.
Diversification helped insulate Chicago from the worst effects of the
1990-91 economic downturn. Regional economists are fond of attributing the
relative economic health of the city and the Midwest to 'no boom, no bust'.
Despite many lay-offs by Chicago area companies during the past two years,
particularly in banking and real estate, evidence of the local economy's
resilience is seen in the fact that unemployment is running at just 6.8 per
cent, compared with 7.4 per cent for the nation.
Metropolitan Chicago's economy is helped by the presence of several dozen
Fortune 500 companies. Powerful multinational companies such as Sara Lee,
Amoco, Sears, McDonald's, United Airlines, Inland Steel, Quaker, Waste
Management and Motorola call metropolitan Chicago home. Local boosters like
to tout the fact that two thirds of US gross national product is generated
within a 500-mile range of Chicago.
Foreign companies have also bolstered the city's fortunes, with jobs and
capital expenditures, and raised its international profile. According to a
1992 study, by KPMG Peat Marwick, of inward investment to Illinois, the
state is home to 617 US headquarters of foreign-owned companies, most of
which are in the Chicago area. For the study, such companies were defined as
being at least 50 per cent owned by a foreign entity.
Of 361 companies that responded to the survey, 58 per cent were in the city
itself or Cook County, in which Chicago is located. Another 31 per cent were
in the metropolitan area, or 'collar counties'. Notably, 68 per cent were
start-ups and 52 per cent of their workforce was in manufacturing.
Democratic Mayor Richard Daley, who was re-elected to a second term last
year, is unabashedly pro-business. But he contends that big tax concessions
ought not to be made in order to encourage investment.
He is currently trying to win the Illinois legislature's approval for a
controversial Dollars 2bn casino project. It would receive no tax incentives
and be an entirely private investment. But, despite backing for the project
from top business associations, Governor Jim Edgar, a Republican, is
opposed. No one is willing to predict the outcome of a vote, which is
imminent.
Yet, even with Chicago's successful economic diversification, the city faces
many challenges.
Economists predict that it will continue to lose manufacturing jobs.
Its infrastructure has deteriorated severely, as the disastrous downtown
flood showed earlier this year.
Its substantial airport facilities, which constitute one of the biggest
attractions for business, need expansion in order to keep up with demand
into the next decade.
While Mayor Daley is attempting to address these issues, the city also faces
a host of social problems typical of America's urban landscapes. As the
crack and heroin trade has moved more heavily into the city, over the past
year or so, violent crime, largely from gangs, has mounted.
Local business leaders are worried, too, about the quality of the local
workforce. The Chicago school system ranks as one of the worst in urban
America, despite attempts in recent years to reform it. The city's publicly
subsidised housing for the poor is also in horrifyingly bad condition and
infested with gangs.
In addition, racial tensions have bubbled. Black leaders criticise Mayor
Daley for inadequate attention to their community's needs. This complaint
could spell a significant political challenge to Mr Daley when he runs for
re-election in 1995.
Meanwhile, the mayor hopes that, with president-elect Bill Clinton - a
fellow Democrat whom he strongly supported - in the White House, some
federal support for the city's problems could be forthcoming. But even with
that support, Chicago's political and business leadership will have to draw
on its stores of dynamism, inventiveness and vision to find solutions to the
city's difficulties - a test that will also be 'second to none'.

RELATIONSHIP MARKETING
by Regis McKenna
Century Business Pounds 20, 241 pages
REGIS McKENNA is a leprechaun among California-based management gurus.
Spritely but not mischievous, his writing has an iconoclastic quality that
never descends into the dull, prescriptive grooves that deaden so many
management texts.
Relationship Marketing, however, is a management text but disguised as a
series of anecdotes about Silicon Valley and the growth of the personal
computer business. Much of it is about Apple Computer, for which McKenna has
worked as a consultant. He was involved in the launch of the revolutionary
Apple Macintosh personal computer which introduced windows, icons and mice
to the world.
The burden of his argument - that successful marketing depends on building
enduring relationships with customers - is finding ready acceptance in the
computer business and in other fast changing industries where a company's
position in the market place can change overnight.
'Standard approaches to positioning don't work in the new customer-centered
environment of the 1990s,' McKenna writes. 'A company that is Number 1 today
has no guarantee of being Number 1 tomorrow. New technologies can turn a
seemingly solid position into a fragile one almost overnight. No amount of
advertising can prevent that from happening'.
McKenna is hard on advertising, which he argues serves no useful purpose and
is becoming obsolescent. The proliferation of advertising messages has
already resulted in overkill where consumers are unable to distinguish one
product from another - 40 per cent of those asked identified EverReady's
ever-marching rabbit as an advert for Duracell.
'The new marketing requires a feed-back loop', Mckenna argues. 'It is this
element that is missing from the monologue of advertising but that is built
into the dialogue of marketing. The feedback loop, connecting company and
customer, is central to the operating definition of a truly market-driven
company: a company that adapts in a timely way to the changing needs of the
customer.'
Apple is McKenna's model. The Macintosh, at its birth, was innovative but
underpowered and inflexible (and had a black and white screen). But it was
easy to use and had a user group prepared to advise the manufacturer on
improvements: 'It was this feedback loop that brought about change in the
Mac, which ultimately became an open, adaptable and colourful computer. And
it was changing the Mac that saved it.'
Relationship Marketing is also a plea for the enlightened use of IT to
facilitate dialogue between customer and vendor. In particular McKenna sees
great potential in 'experiential marketing' or 'try before you buy'.
McKenna concludes by arguing that in the next century the marketing and
sales professions will be held in the same esteem as the science and
engineering professions today. It is hard to understand why that should have
much appeal in the UK. Perhaps things are different in California.

A BIOGRAPHY OF JOCELYN HAMBRO
by Andrew St George
Printed by Cambridge University Press, available on request from J O
Hambro Ltd
'MERCHANT bankers aren't supposed to be conventional bankers; merchant
bankers are supposed to be risk-takers, as opposed to joint stock (clearing)
bankers who never take a risk but manage to lose money all the same.'
Whether an insight - or a spirited aside about his profession - it reflects
the quintessential Jocelyn Hambro style which permeates this short,
fascinating biography by Andrew St George.
Banking is obviously in the blood, but it is the 'fringe activities'
expansionist moves initiated under the stewardship of Jocelyn and his cousin
Charles which created the real excitement. Were they ahead of their time,
diversifying into unit trust management, venture capital, insurance broking,
investment management, Eurobonds, corporate finance, forming trading
companies and the first consortium bank in London and becoming involved in
various forms of banking business worldwide?
Jocelyn was 46 and had worked in the bank for 20 years when he took over as
chairman in 1965, remaining fairly active until the late 1980s. People liked
dealing with him. He was also a good picker and delegator. But in spite of
his privileged background and what must have been an enormously satisfying
career, there were many tragic phases. His two brothers died young. The
mother he adored drowned when he was 13. He was not happy at school, even
less so at Heidelberg just before the war, during which he was seriously
wounded. His first two wives died of cancer.
Silvia, his first wife and mother of his three sons, must have been a
character and a tower of strength. She forbade any business discussion at
home. At Christmas she shopped in bulk for their 26 godchildren at the
Houndsditch Warehouse. Silvia's death left the family devastated. Her
parents, the Roland Muirs, were clearly a great comfort. Roland Muir had
teamed up with the late Anthony Fisher who created Buxted Chicken which
Hambro floated and also founded the Institute of Economic Affairs.
A wide circle of banking and business friends, fellow sportsmen, wartime
colleagues and charities he worked for with dedication will relish this
biography of a distinguished and innovative banker, a witty character, the
head of a closely-knit family yet a charming, modest and unassuming man.

HOW TO BECOME DEAD RICH
by Howard Hodgson
Pavilion Books, Pounds 13.99,
168 pages
BRITAIN IN the 1980s was the place to be if you were young, enterprising and
out to make a fortune. The heady atmosphere of the times was particularly
conducive to growing businesses based on clever ideas and succeeding even on
limited capital - even if the line of work was in funerals.
Howard Hodgson, fifth generation in a family of funeral directors, made his
fortune in the late 1980s by providing quality services for the dead. How to
Become Dead Rich is the story of the rise of Hodgson from the young owner of
a struggling funeral business about to fall into the hands of the receivers
to a semi-retired multi-millionaire with enough wealth to 'keep his family
in riches for generations.'
Hodgson recounts, in a light, conversational style, how at the age of 25, he
bought his father's loss-making funeral business for Pounds 14,000 and in 15
years built it up into a listed company worth Pounds 90m. He did so through
a series of ambitious takeovers, rationalisations and the introduction of
modern business practices to an industry that had been for decades ruled by
convention and plagued by fragmentation and inefficiency.
It also took the ambitious, entrepreneur 15 years of hard work,
extraordinary drive and self-confidence to achieve what he did in such a
short time span.
However, identifying a good business opportunity and capitalising on it are
only half the story. In his narrative Hodgson implies that much of his
success stems from his own qualities. A school report describes him as
'pompous, arrogant, self-opinionated and inclined to think he is always
right.' But he also 'hates to be thwarted in his desires,' and is
'courageous.' The reader gets the impression that it is those qualities
which combined to create an unshakeable faith in his own actions that was
crucial to his success.
Hodgson, nevertheless, acknowledges that he was also helped by the
particular business environment of the latter 1980s. He describes how he was
able to expand his business on the back of the rising UK stock market. 'As
Thatcherism and the bull market rolled on, Hodgson Holdings rolled with
them. The personal and corporate publicity I received in abundance was of
great benefit in keeping the Hodgson share price on the boil.'
Hodgson knew how to take advantage of his company's surging share price.
'With my own shares on multiples in the 40s and 50s I was able to swallow
others on multiples in single figure thus further enhancing my own earnings
per share and consequently my share price.' In the 12 months to the end of
October 1988, the company acquired 64 businesses.
The book provides an entertaining insight into the conditions and personal
qualities which enabled an ambitious and resourceful youth to create
enormous wealth by shaking up an industry that was ripe for consolidation.
Unfortunately, the story of Hodgson's years as an entrepreneurial
undertaker, by far the more interesting part of the book, is marred by
tiresome chapters of 'how to' advice which is supposed to help the budding
entrepreneur on his road to wealth.
The guidance he has to offer ranges from the basic - 'Listen to what people
have to say and be objective.' - to the bizarre: 'When choosing your
management team avoid people who make a lot of noise about being sworn
socialists. Such people are often either well-intentioned, old-fashioned
hypocrites or badly intentioned rather clever hypocrites.'
The book also disappoints in its failure to set the winning qualities he
points to against the somewhat different economic and business climate
currently prevailing in the UK. While business opportunities exist in any
age for the truly enterprising, the frenzied deal-making atmosphere of the
go-go 1980s has evaporated in the recession.
The 'enfant terrible' of funeral directing sold his stake and conveniently
retired from the business in 1991, just as the party was coming to a
disastrous end. Hodgson is building up a second business, this time in
financial services, while the funeral business he sold has recently had to
turn to its shareholders for money to reduce borrowings left over from years
of profligacy.

EUROPEAN CORPORATE STRATEGY: HEADING FOR 2000
by Oliver L Landreth
Macmillan Press, Pounds 35
THE KEY corporate battleground is now clearly that of Europe. Politicians
hum and haw about the political and monetary future of Europe, but its
economic future is already being shaped to a substantial extent by company
policies and processes.
The question of what strategies companies should follow has been the subject
of academic treatises since the Single Market appeared on the horizon. What
strategies companies are following is the question this book investigates.
Landreth selects nine companies from the industrial, services and consumer
goods sectors, originating from all over Europe (Portugal and Italy in the
south, Scandinavia in the north). There is also a chapter on how the
European truck manufacturing industry is being restructured. The two largest
and best-known companies profiled are CMB Packaging and SAS: middle-sized
companies are the focus, though the lessons drawn from these cases apply
even to the largest multinationals.
What are the challenges and opportunities for European companies? First, the
elimination of traditional competitive advantages, such as protected access
to technology and markets; then, ever-more sophisticated and
internationally-oriented consumers. Internally, companies need to improve
logistics, consolidate brand image, centralise R&amp;D, and promote innovation
on a Europe-wide and indeed global basis. Contrarily, there is the challenge
of handling cultural diversity and attempting product customisation.
Landreth does not go as far as his research should take him, and continues
to talk about the need for 'clearly-defined country strategies . . . (and)
national sales, service and distribution plans': if these do not already
exist, there is not much hope for any company; but, on the other hand, these
national groupings will increasingly be replaced by language-groupings. The
book is also marred by its prose, which is neither stylish nor clear:
'Economies of scale are now being acquired through mergers and acquisitions,
as are the effects of the learning curve.'
However, because Landreth has not followed the usual path of studying only
Fortune 500 type companies, he has put together an unusual book which will
be useful to a wide range of companies.

accountancy
</HEADLINE>

ACCOUNTING HARMONISATION IN EUROPE, VOLUME II
by Christopher Nobes
Financial Times Business Information, Pounds 160
IF BRITISH standards-setters had bothered to glance across the English
Channel a few years ago before they started investigating an approach to
replacement cost accounting, they could have saved themselves considerable
trouble: Philips, the electronics group based in the Netherlands, had
already developed a version which it had been using in its published annual
accounts since 1951.
The incident is just one example of the many differences and barriers to
change in financial reporting and auditing standards across Europe,
highlighted in Christopher Nobes' book on EC accounting harmonisation.
There are many ways of classifying accounting patterns in the EC states,
says Nobes, professor of accounting at Reading University, and a committee
member of the Federation of European Accountants.
One clear-cut distinction is between the so-called Anglo-Saxon model -
including the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands -
and the Continental model - such as France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and
Greece. The Anglo-Saxon countries tend to use English law, have a
significant equity market, and a strong, long-established accountancy
profession.  The Continental versions are very different. The former are
oriented towards shareholders, disclosure, professional standards and
substance over form in printed accounts; the latter play towards creditors,
are tax-dominated and enshrined in law.
In a useful review of current legislation, he shows how EC company law
directives are bringing about changes while still leaving room for great
differences in presentation, measurement, publication and audit.
There are some frustrations with the book. While he tantalisingly touches on
the fall of the Iron Curtain and the westernisation of former the Communist
countries at the start, Nobes does not explore how financial reporting
practice is developing. He is also not always entirely sure whether his
function is to provide a textbook or a rather more opinionated commentary.
But the result is a valuable introduction to a topic which receives far too
little serious consideration.

INVESTING WITH YOUR CONSCIENCE: HOW TO ACHIEVE HIGH RETURNS USING
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING
by John C Harrington
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Dollars 24.95,
276 pages
THE IDEA of ethical investing is not new; only the ethics have changed. As
the 1960s generation reaches its wealthier middle age, it seems likely that
the issue of 'making money morally' will grow in importance.
Harrington's book deals with the market's development in the US, where
ethical investment has had its biggest impact. Conditions in America have
certainly been conducive; there is both financial sophistication among the
pollution and a plethora of single issue pressure groups.
After briefly mentioning the free market view that companies should make
profits for their shareholders and let others worry about ethics,
Harrington's book makes the assumption that readers will share the view that
ethical investing is 'a good thing'.
The book is thus very much a 'how to' rather than a 'why should I' manual,
and since it largely restricts itself to the US market, is likely to be of
little use to the international reader. But it does illustrate how the
agenda of ethical investing is constantly on the change. South Africa was
the big issue of the 1980s; the environment has become the subject of the
1990s. But green investing is not an easy matter; some companies making big
profits from waste disposal are themselves accused of being polluters.
The great problem is that few people's ethics are exactly the same and in
some areas - where the religious right clashes with the liberal left - one
man's morality is another man's wickedness. Constructing ethical funds that
meet the needs of everyone is probably beyond the wit of any fund manager.
Ethical investment may be a growing field, but it will also be highly
fragmented.

ANATOMY OF SCOTLAND
Edited by Magnus Linklater and Robin Denniston
Chambers, Pounds 15.99 431 pages
THE NICE THING about Scotland is its manageable size. Its population is
concentrated, with 4m of its 5m people living in the 70-mile-long central
belt. Its principal companies and its institutions, financial and otherwise,
are few. for You frequently go to gatherings at which a good selection of
the top people in the country are all together.
Above all, Scotland is different. Scots feel themselves to be a distinct
nation within the UK and do many things differently from England. Scotland
therefore lends itself to a book like this, which describes the different
sectors of public life in the country, its distinctive organisations and
economy.
The editors, Magnus Linklater, editor of The Scotsman, and Robin Denniston,
a publisher, also promise to tell how the country 'works,' who runs it and
how those people exercise their power.
The title emulates Anthony Sampson's famous Anatomy of Britain which first
appeared in 1962. Like Sampson's book, this has chapters on such things as
the law, the aristocracy, politics, the civil service, the church, business,
economic quangos, the arts and sport.
It is all useful stuff, fascinating and entertaining in parts, and the book
should be on the shelf of anyone who needs to know about Scotland. It is
remarkably free of inaccuracies, the sub-section on the financial community
being an exception.
But unlike Sampson's Anatomy of Britain this book is written by ten authors,
mostly Scottish journalists such as George Rosie, Alf Young or Peter Jones.
This is not the exploration of an outsider who comes in to meet the key
people but rather the view of writers with distilled knowledge of their
subject.
As a result there is no overall judgment on Scotland, its strengths,
weaknesses or its future, and the broad questions posed by the editors never
really receive an answer. How is that a country with a very small ruling
group (perhaps only about 2,000 people, many of whom appear fleetingly in
this book) rarely succeeds in defining a big objective, then combining to
achieve it? Scots often express their frustration at this.
Linklater says in his introduction that although the lines of influence of
leading Scots 'cross and criss-cross,' it is hard to talk about a Scottish
'Establishment.' England, he thinks, has a much more obvious ruling class.
He may be right (I disagree) but in a book on how Scotland works it deserve
more than a paragraph.

REFLECTIONS ON MONETARISM
by Tim Congdon
Edward Elgar Publishing,
hardback Pounds 45, p/back Pounds 14.95,
287 pages
TIM CONGDON is currently enjoying one of his purple patches, having been a
prominent member of the Liverpool Six group of monetarist economists which
campaigned for some 18 months for the UK to leave the European exchange rate
mechanism. Congdon's gloomy predictions about the prospects for the British
economy within the ERM ('there will never be a recovery') have been
fulfilled and interest rates have been sharply cut according to his
recommendation. A phase of fairly rapid growth and low inflation could now
lie ahead, he thinks.
But as this book of his collected writings makes plain, the lot of a British
monetarist is not a contented one. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s
the monetarist prescription was largely accepted, culminating in the
adoption of the medium term financial strategy by Sir Geoffrey Howe. But
monetarism was abandoned again as the Conservative government in the
mid-1980s embarked upon an amazing re-run of the Barber boom of the early
1970s. The book analyses all this in terms that are easily accessible to the
layman, and Congdon observes that 'many non-economists will be puzzled and
dismayed by the story that the book tells'.
Perhaps so, but the ups and downs of monetarism are not so difficult to
explain. The trouble was that although inflation came down under the MTFS,
unemployment continued to rise, essentially because economic growth was not
fast enough to satisfy political objectives, and monetarism does not have
much to say about growth. Monetarists began arguing among themselves over
the significance of narrow and broad money targets. Moreover the attempts to
control monetary growth unexpectedly generated a bill 'mountain' which was
extremely inconvenient for the Bank of England. Nigel Lawson impatiently
dropped the monetary targets in 1985, and though disaster duly followed, it
took until 1988 to become evident, a long time in political terms.
Tim Congdon was taught conventional British-style economics at Oxford, and
his conversion to monetarism came through his exposure to the alarming
inflation of 1974 and 1975 while on the economic staff of The Times (where
Peter Jay was also influential). His dogged pursuit of the truth reflects
his ability to focus on his objectives with far more consistency and
endurance than any politician. But when the politicians become bored with
controlling inflation they also tend to become bored with monetarism.
Congdon has been proved right, but it is easy to see how he might become
sidelined again as he was in the late 1980s. Still, this book is an
essential guide to the reasons for the repeated failures of British economic
policy over the past 20 years.

WOMEN AND JAPANESE MANAGEMENT: DISCRIMINATION AND REFORM
by Alice Lam
Routledge, Pounds 35, 240 pages
IT WOULD NOT be difficult for a stranger to Japan to discern that there is
widespread discrimination against women in the Japanese working environment.
It is not so much that women employees in Japanese companies are ill-treated
in such an obvious way that might attract widespread criticism. The
discrimination is so subtle and so ingrained in the Japanese way of life
that those who are guilty of discriminating against women are quite likely
to be unaware of the crime.
Alice Lam does well to identify the socio-cultural roots of this
discrimination in Japanese management practices in her study. Dr Lam, who
spent several years in Japan studying the role of women in Japanese
corporations, points out that women have long provided a convenient and
flexible workforce in a country where the rigid demands of lifetime
employment practices place considerable pressures on corporations when
changes in the economic climate call for expansion or reduction of the
labour force.
She also rightly pronounces that despite the introduction of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Law in 1985, and recurring prophesies of the eventual
collapse of the traditional employment system in Japan, things have not
really changed that much.
Women are still mainly employed in specialised areas or for specific
purposes, such as to identify and develop products likely to appeal to
housewives. They are still employed in such a way that the male-dominated
management system of lifetime male employment can be perpetuated.
The introduction at some Japanese companies of a career conversion system,
whereby women in clerical positions are given an opportunity to apply to the
managerial career route, itself 'formally legitimises total segregation of
men and women.' Even for the most ambitious and dedicated women employees,
the importance of informal clique networks and patronage by senior staff,
who will invariably be male, create strong barriers to advancement.
Dr Lam concludes that in order to further improve women's position in the
Japanese labour market and bring equal the country's opportunity standards
to the level commonly accepted in the west, 'major legal reforms and
stronger policy interventions are necessary.'
The book is a rich source of information not only on the conditions for
women in Japanese corporations but also on Japanese management practices in
general.
Unfortunately, the dry, academic style Dr Lam employs is likely to
discourage many prospective readers. Although it may not have been
appropriate for the academic study which Dr Lam has written, a few anecdotes
would have helped to enliven the narrative. It is also a disappointment that
Dr Lam has not really discussed the issue of sexual harassment which is a
real, though difficult to identify, phenomenon in a male-dominated
environment. However, for the student not only of Japanese management but of
women's studies generally, the book offers some helpful insights.
Dr Lam concludes that: 'If Japanese women are to achieve full and real
equality, it cannot be on men's terms. The male work norm will have to be
changed and the Japanese management system will need to be challenged.' The
same could be said for women in even the most liberal societies.

by Roberta Cava
Piatkus Books, Pounds 8.95, 182 pages
PART of the corporate hangover of the 1980s is the immense quantity of
business books now cluttering bookshops and airport bookstalls. Many must
have been planned and commissioned in the late 1980s, which is one good
reason for regarding them with a healthily jaundiced eye. If these guys are
such hot shots, if capitalism and corporate management are so accessible and
describable - how come we're in the mess we're in?
At a guess, the amount of harm done to companies by stuff printed in
business books must be colossal. The trouble is: how can you know which
managers or underlings have been indoctrinated by which version of which
cock-eyed theory or numbskull extrapolation? Answer comes there none.
Not that I would stop anyone reading The Virtual Corporation, which is
subtitled Structuring and Revitalising the Corporation for the 21st Century.
It has strong entertainment value. It may even be sensible. For a start, it
should appeal to all sci-fi fans - a broad church, numbered in millions -
while its general approach is excitingly pre-millennial.
'Virtual' corporations, we learn, will sell 'virtual' products and services,
defined as those that adapt in real time to customers' changing needs.
Typically, customers will participate in the design and creation of what
they buy.
We are talking 'co-destiny' relationships between corporations of the 21st
century and their suppliers, distributors and retailers. We are talking
commitment to do almost anything necessary to keep customers for life. We
are talking new, flattened corporate organisational profiles that eliminate
middle management and greatly empower line-workers.
With luck, several thousand chief executives will read this book, shudder,
bang themselves between the eyes - and start to raise their games.
They can skip Life Cycles, Money Cycles. It is said to be aimed at the
'beginning investor,' and to contain unique and useful insights. True, there
are spots of good advice. One of them: beware stockbrokers' recommendations.
'At best, a broker's advice is no better than your own good judgment.'
Possibly that is true. But the book contains so much unintended humour that
you may have to ask for it at the comedy counter.
Not so Successful Team Building, which is abysmally po-faced and likely to
interest only the most wretched tiers of middle management: the folk who
will be swept from the building about seven years from now if The Virtual
Corporation knows what it is talking about.
Conversely, I enjoyed Dealing With Difficult People. I have been called a
prima donna, though on weasely, scatterbrained evidence. Be that as it may,
this book has vaulted me two steps ahead in the corporate rat race. Now I
know why I am difficult. And I know how to deal with me.

THE UGLY JAPANESE: NIPPON'S ECONOMIC EMPIRE IN ASIA
by Friedemann Bartu
Longman Singapore Publishers (Pte), SDollars 29.90, 287 pages. UK rep.
Longman Group UK
THOSE WHO instinctively recoil from Japan-bashing would probably do well to
remember how in 1990 Nicholas Ridley, then a Conservative minister, was
vilified for a public bout of German-bashing, and how today - after the
humiliating retreat of sterling before the Bundesbank and an outbreak of
fascist demonstrations in Germany - even his critics concede that he had a
point.
Like Germany in Europe, Japan in south-east Asia is a formidable economic
power and its expansionist 20th century history conjures up images of
wartime atrocities in the minds of the region's elder statesmen.
This year, for the first time since the war, Tokyo has sent Japanese troops
abroad, to serve with the UN peacekeeping force in Cambodia. The mission is
being undertaken with caution and reluctance, but Japan's persistent refusal
to apologise for, or in many cases even acknowledge, its imperial adventures
in Asia has angered Asians from Korea to Singapore.
On the economic side, the flood of Japanese investment into south-east Asia
since the mid-1980s by companies relocating their factories in response to
the rise of the yen has been crucial for the success of the region's
export-led economic growth.
Bartu argues that 'the Ugly Japanese' - a phrase coined by an unusually
frank Japanese diplomat - has replaced 'the Ugly American' in the role of
loud-mouthed, high-spending tourist and would-be economic and cultural
imperialist.
The increasingly visible Japanese presence in south-east Asia certainly
means that the strategies of Japanese governments, the intentions of
Japanese corporations and the reactions of non-Japanese Asians are fruitful
subjects for investigation; by the time I was nine pages into the book I had
already heard two advertisements on Thai radio for Japanese department
stores in Bangkok.
But Bartu, the economic and financial correspondent of the Swiss newspaper
Neue Zurcher Zeitung, who describes himself as 'a strong believer in the
power of 'karma', has failed to find enough anti-Japanese ammunition to
match the book's dramatic title or to satisfy the aspiring Japan-basher.
Most of the sticks with which he beats the Japanese in this anecdotal survey
of Japan in Asia are old ones and could equally be applied to their
commercial competitors: the language of Japanese business, he writes
scathingly, is the language of war and conquest, but Bartu himself later
volunteers the statement that both western and Japanese managers are
'warriors competing in a global market'; he describes transfer pricing as
'this old Japanese trick' as if it were unknown to European or US companies.
He deplores the use of foreign aid for commercial advantage, as if it were a
form of leverage exerted only by the Japanese, and provides a fascinating
account of how Japan and NEC fought dirty to win a big telecommunications
contract in Indonesia. Yet at the same time he suggests that the US fought
back to help AT&amp;T by secretly tapping high-level telephone conservations
about the contract between Tokyo and Jakarta.
Bartu damns the Japanese in south-east Asia for working too hard, and then
damns them for playing golf. There is not enough space for golf in Japan, he
says, so 'the Japanese should collect stamps and play table tennis, mahjong
or chequers.'
In spite of the occasional gratuitous insult Bartu is ultimately defeated in
his attempt to sustain an anti-Japanese polemic by his own fair-mindedness.
He tries to show that south-east Asia is drifting into the Japanese sphere
of influence, but concedes that Japanese cultural influence is 'remarkably
shallow'; he tries to portray the Japanese businessman as a ruthless samurai
warrior, but ends up feeling sorry for the lonely Japanese husband who has
left his family in Tokyo.
Wading through his 20kg of newspaper cuttings on the Japanese in Asia, Bartu
allows himself to be diverted into such intriguing but peripheral topics as
the rise of Japanese feminism, leaving too little space for serious analysis
of his central theme.
The reader is left wanting to know more about the notorious reluctance of
Japanese companies to transfer technology to south-east Asia or to promote
locals to senior management positions (there is a good chapter on the
evolution of Mitsubishi's Proton Saga car factory in Malaysia), more about
the challenge to Japanese dominance being mounted by investors from Taiwan
and Korea, and more about the consequences of Japan's failure to provide
leadership on issues such as the environment, human rights and world trade
negotiations.
Bartu concludes lamely that Asians do not want to be forced into a Pax
Japonica, but acknowledges that this a concept for which 'even most Japanese
themselves are still ill-prepared'. If the Japanese are indeed ugly, the
case is not yet proven.

THE NEW PALGRAVE DICTIONARY OF MONEY AND FINANCE
Edited by Peter Newman, Murray Milgate and John Eatwell
The Macmillan Press, Pounds 350 for three-volume set
A GOOD NEW dictionary must fulfil three functions. It should inform, it
should entertain, and it should stimulate new ideas by the freshness of its
presentation and approach. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money &amp; Finance, a
three-volume heavyweight checking in at more than 2,500 pages, scores highly
on the first two counts, and rather less certainly on the third.
In the short time that it has been on my shelves, I have startled strangers
with the depth of my recently acquired knowledge about the history of the
Federal Reserve System. I have politely corrected a normally much better
informed colleague about the record of the Super Bowl stock market
predictor. I have found the answer to questions about the workings of
monetary policy which I was too embarrassed to ask 20 years ago.
The dictionary is built round more than 1,000 substantial essays written by
more than 800 authorities from around the world, covering both the domestic
and international aspects of money, banking and finance.
As well as theory and doctrine, it also covers more empirical matters such
as institutional analysis and the workings of financial regulation, together
with the history of institutions, events and ideas.
It is out of the same stable, and has the same editors, as the New Palgrave
Dictionary of Economics published five years ago. The main geographical
focus is on North America and the US, with two thirds of its contributors
coming from the former region and a fifth from the latter. But efforts have
been made to cover the monetary and financial systems of about 30 other
countries, and Japan gets thorough treatment.
When it comes to entertainment, the new dictionary is too big and too
expensive for bath time reading. And some of its entries are daunting: the
explanation of intertemporal portfolio theory and asset pricing, several
pages long and laced with equations, is one of quite a few entries which are
not for the faint hearted.
But it is a real pleasure to browse through these volumes and come
unexpectedly across an elegant essay on money by James Tobin, a sour piece
on financial zoos by First Boston's Albert Wojnilower, or a full profile of
the Bank for International Settlements by Alexandre Lamfalussy.
Most entries are followed by a bibliography and there is a useful series of
cross references to send readers to relevant essays elsewhere in the text.
But will the dictionary achieve more than this? The editors' big idea is
that it will help to bring together the study of the subject 'money'  -
usually located in departments of economics in faculties of arts or social
sciences - with that of the subject 'finance', which is more usually to be
found in the universities' professional or business management school.
They recognise that the subjects have converged in recent years with, for
example, monetary theory being strongly influenced by an improved
understanding of the workings of efficient financial markets. But the
process has further to go. Only belatedly did the UK treasury come to
understand that the process of financial deregulation had played havoc with
the assumptions on which it had attempted to manage monetary policy during
the 1980s.
Perhaps the new dictionary will help. The editors hope at a minimum that it
will make financial economics more important in the training of general
economists. But it seems unlikely that such a densely structured work will
have a broader impact on the thinking of policy makers, academics and market
participants.

   EUROPEAN SALES PROMOTION
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT CAMPAIGNS IN ACTION
by Alan Toop Kogan Page, Pounds 28, 208 pages
WHAT MAKES more and more blue chip companies spend a growing proportion of
their marketing budgets on sales promotion?
When Heinz runs a scheme offering customers prizes of 100 cars and Nescafe
in France offers free sample sachets of a new coffee to 10m households
(achieving an impressive 7. per cent acceptance rate) and even Sainsburys
takes part in BA's Air Miles bonanza, sales promotion has become serious
business.
Indeed, a good deal of the creative excitement which used to be associated
with advertising has switched to sales promotion, which makes it surprising
that literature and case material on the subject are still scarce.
Twenty-five years ago, as Alan Toop, one of the few serious commentators,
points out in this authoritative study: 'Most sales promotions were in
support of fast moving consumer goods: toiletries, soaps, detergents,
packaged goods, petrol and oil, beers, wines and spirits and tobacco . . .
Today the list includes cars, household appliances, furniture and
furnishings, clothing, airlines, railways, hotels, even banking and
insurance.'
More multinationals are running promotions in individual European markets.
Can it be long before pan-European promotional campaigns make their mark?
This is one of the issues Toop examines with insight. At the same time his
selection and dissection of campaigns in action shows how many leading
companies selling across national frontiers increasingly use sales promotion
as part of their marketing mix.
What determines the use of these techniques, often to complement rather than
replace media advertising? The short answer is sampling in the case of a new
brand, or to stimulate repeat purchasing or strengthen retail distribution
and display.
Sales promotion techniques are claimed in some cases to cost less than other
marketing tools, hence a large switch of expenditure towards promotion over
the years. Opportunities resulting from the growth of mass retailing in
Europe and pressures for short-term results are also contributing to the
demand for quick sales boosts.
The likely benefits of a well-planned promotion can be seen from one of the
many European case studies discussed by Toop. In Germany, Goodyear has a
chain of tyre and car service centres, but more motorists needed to be
induced to try the service. A 'Goodyear is looking for Winners' promotion
increased turnover in participating outlets by an average of some 25 per
cent during the promotion; the winning centre recruited 457 new clients; and
awareness of the service rose from 12.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent.
We are not told the cost of the promotion, but the results here, as for many
of the campaigns described, indicate why companies such as Unilever,
Coca-Cola, Range Rover and many others now use these techniques.

THE GUINNESS UK DATA BOOK
Guinness Publishing, Pounds 9.99,
192 pages
VITAL SIGNS - THE TRENDS THAT ARE SHAPING OUR FUTURE
Earthscan Publications, Pounds 9.95,
144 pages
BENJAMIN DISRAELI (or was it Mark Twain) is reputed to have observed: 'There
are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.' But these two
books attempt to dispel such cynicism.
The Guinness UK Data Book is a notebook-sized reference source which will
have instant appeal for trivia addicts, researchers and others fascinated by
the minutiae of life in Britain in the 1990s. It is packed with 'essential
facts and figures' which are intended to surprise as well as inform, and
covers everything from geography and religion to sport and social trends.
Fortunately it also comes with a reasonable index.
For example, it is possible to discover that almost 30 gallons of water a
day are used by each person in a household; that 63.4 per cent of the
population are Anglicans but only 4 per cent practise their faith; and that
the National Trust topped the list of charities with Pounds 55.73m in
voluntary income in 1990.
In contrast, Vital Signs is a reference book with a strong ecological
message. Produced by Lester Brown, president of the Washington-based
Worldwatch Institute, an independent research organisation, with researchers
Christopher Flavin and Hal Kane, the book focuses on issues such as: what is
happening to the world's fish catch? Third World debt, military expenditure
and CFC production.
Part one of the paperback describes 36 trends on double-paged spreads of
text, data and graphs which part two contains short essays on important
trends for which no historical or global data exists. Among its revelations:
world bicycle production now outpaces car production three to one; 80 per
cent of the world's 9,000 bird species are in decline, and world fertiliser
use has dropped for an unprecedented two years in a row.
It has a list of contents, but no index. Nevertheless it is well set out and
easy to read and should appeal to a wide audience.

recovery

MEXICO, THE REMAKING OF AN ECONOMY
by Nora Lustig
Brookings Institution, Dollars 28.9 5 hardback, Dollars 11.95 p/back,
186 pages
AT A TIME when optimism about economic prospects for the former Soviet Union
and east Europe have sunk to an all time low, it is consoling to read Nora
Lustig's account of the remaking of Mexico's economy.
One thing her book tells us is that rebuilding a broken economy,
particularly when world economic conditions are adverse, cannot be done
overnight.
After only three years, many observers appear to be losing faith in the
ability of the former eastern bloc to cope with its economic waste-land. But
as Lustig shows, it has taken Mexico ten years to emerge from the dark days
of 1982, when the government declared a moratorium on its debt, to the
present day when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
is forecasting single-digit annual inflation and growth of 5 to 6 per cent
throughout the mid-1990s.
There are big differences between Mexico and the former eastern bloc
countries but there is one important parallel. Poor external conditions
stymied Mexico's economic progress in the 1980s, just as slow world growth
is now hindering the development of the bloc.
In a down-to-earth analysis of Mexico's economic rejuvenation, Lustig argues
that the main explanation for Mexico's slow economic recovery lies in the
adverse world economic conditions - scarce external credit, unfavourable
terms of trade and high real world interest rates - that prevailed since
1982. She argues that these factors prevented a 'bounce back' of the Mexican
economy after what should have been a two-year rather than an eight-year
adjustment period.
Falling oil prices and high world interest rates meant that the debt burden
worsened rather than eased as the decade wore on. This discouraged private
sector investment because of fears that the government would have to raise
taxes or resort to inflationary financing by printing money to keep up
payments. Whenever the government tried to deter capital flight by raising
domestic interest rates, private investment and growth were further
affected.
Second, lower oil prices, higher real interest rates and external credit
rationing hindered recovery by triggering a much larger relative cut in
public investment than in current government expenditures because the
Mexican government had to act quickly and found it easier to cut investment.
Last, with a heavy debt burden and poor external conditions, Mexico had to
devalue the peso in order to help generate a balance of payments surplus.
But this fueled inflation and further impeded recovery.
It took successive Mexican governments three attempts to defeat inflation,
restore business confidence, and encourage the return of domestic and
foreign capital. Once conditions were in place two crucial boosts to
confidence in 1990 - reprivatisation of the banks and the announcement that
the government would be seeking a free trade agreement with the US - gave
the spur to inward investment and economic growth.
Lustig devotes an entire chapter to the social costs of readjustment and
concludes that the economic strategy left a hard core of poverty that
economic growth alone may not be able to eliminate.
Also relevant to east European-watchers is the chapter dealing with public
sector reforms. 'The crisis and adjustment process provided an opportunity
to streamline the bureaucracy, improve the public sector's revenue
collection and expenditure mechanisms and redefine the nature and extent of
state participation in the economy,' writes Lustig.
Her conclusions on the success of the reforms are somewhat indecisive,
mainly because it is too early to judge the long-term results. However, she
believes that the reforms were successful in encouraging private investment,
and capital repatriation.
An account of the Mexican readjustment process is bound to throw up
interesting parallels with countries facing similar problems. Lustig's
thoughts on the Mexican experience are that while it teaches important
lessons its case is probably difficult to replicate: Mexico has an
acquiescent labour force and a uniquely cohesive and controlled state.
Nonetheless, the book's publication is timely. With the signing of a free
trade agreement with Canada and the US in August, there is evidence to
suggest that Mexico could be one of the fastest growing economies of the
1990s.

poker game

UNDER THE HAMMER: THE ITV FRANCHISE BATTLE
by Andrew Davidson
Heinemann, Pounds 16.99, 318 pages
THE STORY of how the ITV franchises were put out to competitive tender and
the elaborate Pounds 1bn poker game that went on all over the UK for more
than a year is one of the most extraordinary in business history.
From January 1 both bidders and viewers will have to live with the
consequences. Several thousand television professionals will have lost their
jobs and about Pounds 300m a year will go to the Treasury instead of the
current Pounds 100m or so. Companies such as Thames, with a 25-year
programme making tradition, will head for the wilderness. In the depths of
an advertising recession some of the 'winners' could yet go to the wall for
bidding too high. There is also at least a question mark over how much
serious ITV programming can survive in prime time in what will inevitably be
a more remorselessly commercial industry.
Andrew Davidson has successfully captured the mood of the great game - the
surreptitious meetings in country house hotel, the bluff and double bluff,
the tension and the fear of putting a number in an envelope that will
determine whether a company lives or dies.
As he says, television is not only the most powerful communication tool yet
invented, it can also be 'one of the most exciting, frustrating, malicious,
greedy and cynical industries there is.'
The anecdotes bring out an additional dimension - the farce. They include
the story of how the executives from Granada, travelling round the Tyne-Tees
region in preparation for a hostile bid, ran straight into David Reay, the
Tyne- Tees chief executive, in the lobby of a Newcastle hotel.
Then there was the chaos of the Polygram, Palace Picture, Mentorn bid
against London Weekend. On the night before the bids had to go in someone in
their headquarters - the Groucho Club in London's Soho - tripped over a
computer lead and wiped out the eight page summary of their bid. They only
just managed to rewrite it in time for the printers.
Executives at Central, which bid only Pounds 2,000, nearly had a heart
attack when they picked up a story that the Rizzoli media group was planning
to bid against them with one of their own shareholders. In fact, they had
been discussing Centrale - the Italian word for the centre - in this case
London.
The funniest and most telling story of all comes from Christopher Bland,
chairman of LWT, who did not trip over any computer leads and saw off the
Groucho bid. Bland found himself sitting opposite to Sir Jeffrey Sterling,
the P&amp; O boss who had advised Margaret Thatcher on the broadcasting
legislation, in spite of knowing little about broadcasting.
'Oh Jeffrey,' said Bland. 'I've just been invited to head a commission to
look into the shipping industry.'
'But you don't know anything about shipping,' said Sir Jeffrey (now Lord)
Sterling. 'I think I know as much about shipping as you do about
broadcasting . . .' replied Christopher Bland, allowing time for his little
joke to sink in.
Apart from being an hilarious read the book provides useful insights into
some apparently inexplicable decisions, such as why TV-am thought it could
hold on to its franchise with a bid of only Pounds 14m - Pounds 20m less
than the winner - when it knew it faced two powerful rivals.
Andrew Davidson suggests, plausibly, that TV-am may have interpreted words
of praise from the Independent Television Commission for its Gulf War
coverage, its training and contribution to improving the broadcasting bill,
as a sign that it was safe, that the ITC would invoke 'exceptional
circumstances' to set aside higher cash bids. Thames Television, which bid
Pounds 32m, a figure that was unlikely to be the highest for the London
weekday franchise, clearly suffered from similar unfulfilled hopes.
Under The Hammer is an extraordinary tale of extraordinary events, but for
all the panache of its story-telling the book is light on analysis and
context and concentrates almost entirely on the big companies and the big
battles.
'Those looking for an answer to the perennial question, 'whither
broadcasting?' will search in vain,' the author explains. He does, however,
provide four and a half pages of explanation as an appendix. You also have
to look in the appendices for a significant interview with Mr George, now
Sir George, Russell, ITC chairman.
There the ITC chairman makes explicit what has been clear for some time:
that the ITC used the terms of the Broadcasting Act quite deliberately to
stop even more money flowing out of the system to the government. As a
result some rough justice was dispensed, both to existing ITV companies
which were deemed to have overbid and to outsiders which were excluded for
the same reason.
The consequences of the great ITV franchise battle are far from over. The
only hope now is that the government is capable of learning a lesson and
will approach the debate about the future of the BBC with a less dogmatic
frame of mind.

PICNICS ON VESUVIUS
by William Rees-Mogg
Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 17.50,
396 pages
IT IS TRUE, Lord Rees-Mogg agrees, that he actually read the Financial Times
every day over breakfast at Oxford, a fact which when publicised in Isis
brought the young fogey the reward of a job on the pink paper (he rose to be
chief leader writer in the late 1950s). There is a glimpse here of a
long-lost world: students today surely do not even eat breakfast, let alone
read the FT.
The quality of the young FT set at the time, he muses, was so high,
including as it did the likes of Jock Bruce-Gardyne, Shirley Williams and
Sam Brittan, that 'we were able to take Nigel Lawson in our stride, which is
more than any Cabinet was able to do'.
Now he is an old fogey, contributing entertaining, opinionated, occasionally
profound weekly columns to The Independent. He has also formed a curious
partnership with an American called James Dale Davidson; together this odd
couple has published two lurid and lucrative non-fiction financial
spinechillers, Blood in the Streets and The Great Reckoning. This collection
of articles from The Independent is mostly quite different in character, but
even here Rees-Mogg clearly enjoys the occasional role of prophet of doom -
hence, presumably, the title.
Although once right at the heart of the British Establishment as editor of
The Times, and still retaining a foothold among the great and the good, as
chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, William Rees-Mogg has always
indulged in the eccentricities allowed to the upper classes. He pleaded for
the return to the gold standard in the 1970s when conventional wisdom was
still Keynesian; he is Roman Catholic rather than Anglican. He is both
snobbish, for example describing the despised 1960s as 'a decade in which
society took its values from photographers and hairdressers', and
occasionally vulgar as in his books on what is described coarsely as
'megapolitics'.
He writes in what he claims to be 'a subdued copy of an 18th century style'
which is probably one of his rather rare little jokes. The only other
discernable one is his regret at never having met Ms Pamella Bordes 'which
perhaps makes me a unique figure among those who have edited London journals
in the past twenty years'.
In fact his style is commendably modern and direct, well-suited to the
discipline of 1,000-word chunks of which the book is largely composed,
interspersed with a few rather longer and newely-written introductions to
the various sections. He is also ready to pepper the texts with personal or
family details, which is a slightly risky approach. We do not really want to
know that there are 250 Moggs in the US, and that one branch of the family
adopted the spelling Mugge; but on the other hand there is the diverting
story of ghostly Dorothy Mogg who for years after her death in the 18th
century prowled the bedroom of a house in Wincanton until she was exorcised.
The first piece in The Independent which really pleased him, he says, was a
late 1986 attack on Somerset County Cricket Club for the ejection of Botham,
Richards and Garner. He had felt about the Somerset side of the early 1980s
'rather as Carlyle felt about Frederick the Great' (and he is not talking
about Trueman, we suppose). The curse of Mogg was duly pronounced and by
1992 Somerset were bottom of the county table, and worse than that, 'were a
side of no consequence'.
The demands of a weekly deadline are considerable and some of the topical
articles can date very quickly. A November 1991 column on the just-deceased
Robert Maxwell does not look particularly well-judged today, and it is
perhaps brave of Rees-Mogg to include it here. 'I shall remember him with
affection,' he wrote at the time. He updates this now with the remark that
'now I know that when I drank his champagne it may have been fraudulently
paid for'.
What are we to make of Moggonomics? The self-confessed 'loose Keynesian'
from the FT think tank of the 1950s was converted to monetarism by Peter Jay
in his days as economic editor of The Times. Rees-Mogg additionally
encouraged Tim Congdon, who also converted to monetarism in The Times in the
1970s. Temperamentally, though, he claims to be a currency fixer rather than
a floater, a trait reflected in his hankering for a return to gold as
hyperinflation loomed in the 1970s.
Nevertheless he firmly came out a year ago against Britain's membership of
the European exchange rate mechanism, and correctly predicted a crisis some
time in 1992 in which Britain might have to abandon the attempt to maintain
a fixed exchange rate.
Latterly he has moved towards fringe economic doctrines such as the rather
dubious cyclical approach of Juglar and Kondratieff, but who is to say he is
wrong? There is much of interest here, although these are bite-sized rather
than plate-filling portions, and you might find some volcanic ash in your

EVIL MONEY: ENCOUNTERS ALONG THE MONEY TRAIL
by Rachel Ehrenfeld
Harper Collins, Dollars 22, 298 pages
THERE IS an old saying among investigative journalists who are trying to
undercover a political or corporate intrigue: 'follow the money'. The saying
has become something of a cliche, but it remains as true as ever.
In the presently unfolding Iraqgate scandal - where officials of the US and
Britain appear to have broken their own export laws in an attempt to sweeten
Saddam Hussein with arms and money - the need to understand and to follow
the money trail is of primary importance.
Two of the banks caught up in the Iraqgate affair are discussed in Evil
Money, a new look at money laundering by Dr Rachel Ehrenfeld.
Dr Ehrenfeld is a woman of many talents - investigator, academic, journalist
and author. Her gifts were made apparent in an earlier book about
narco-terrorism and the Medellin cartel. This new book is a smorgasbord of
financial and political adventure. It includes new perspectives on the Bank
of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair as well as a fascinating
inside look at the estimated one trillion US dollars of annual drug revenues
that are laundered through the international banking systems.
The book's great strength lies in its specificity. Dr Ehrenfeld takes us on
a voyage from the legacy of Meyer Lansky's offshore banking connections in
the Bahamas to the money laundering mechanisms utilised by the cocaine
traffickers of South America, detailing a demi-monde of front companies,
international bank wire transfers, bribe-taking politicians and crooked
accountants and lawyers. Its only weakness is that it does not draw this
vast subject together and make recommendations in a grand finale of a
concluding chapter. But this can be excused: Evil Money remains must reading
for anyone interested in the frightening interstices among drug traders,
terrorists, bankers and government officials.

THIRD PARTY ACCESS IN EUROPEAN GAS INDUSTRIES
by Jonathan Stern
The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Pounds 12.50,
141 pages
AS THE EC single market approaches, most of the attention of the energy
industry has focused on Brussels' proposals to integrate the electricity
supply - by, for example, obliging member states to grant access to their
grid to suppliers from other states. Much less attention has been paid to
Brussels' parallel proposal to open up gas supplies on similar lines, even
though the effects could be just as far reaching.
This timely study from Chatham House is an attempt to shed light on these
issues. And what a tangle they are. As Stern points out, the European gas
industry is a tight-knit community of monopolies, many state-owned, whose
instinctive reaction to proposals of this sort is to say no. They have
deliberately exaggerated the problems and marshalled obscure technical
arguments in order to retard the pace of change. As a result the debate is
getting bogged down and is not sparking the amount of public interest it
needs.
There are times when Stern himself seems to have difficulty rising above the
complexities. He is frequently forced to comment that evidence is
'inconclusive', or to adopt over-wide generalisations in order to encompass
the subject, which is frustrating for the reader. Nonetheless one does
emerge from the study with a clearer sense of the issues and the direction
the debate is likely to take.
The Brussels plan is to open up third party access (TPA) to gas transmission
systems so that new suppliers can enter national markets. The aim is to
stimulate competition in a business where little or none has existed in the
past and, ultimately, benefit the consumer by increasing choice and driving
down prices.
The question is whether the merits of this plan are outweighed by the
potential threats to security of supply and to the stability that has
enabled the gas industry to make large investments up to now. Although Stern
dismisses some of the objections as scaremongering by the established
players, he does believe that the plan still has shortcomings.
His main concern is that while the Brussels TPA Directive lays out the
principles, it falls far short of being the sort of practical plan to get
things moving. He doubts that Continental EC members (the UK is different
because of the privatised gas industry and its special regulation set-up)
will be sufficiently motivated to put in place a pro-active regulatory
framework.
But Stern does see light ahead. He notes the key importance of the recent
growth of competition in Germany where, rather to people's surprise, certain
large players have forced their way into the market. By the middle of this
year, he also believes that other major players 'began to appreciate that
outright rejection was no longer a tenable position.'
But this will not necessarily open the way for implementation of a grand,
Brussels-driven plan. Instead he foresees 'a slow piecemeal, uneven
development of TPA on a country by country and perhaps even case by case
basis.' Change will be driven principally by the urge of the more aggressive
members of the gas industry to break into new markets. This will increase
the need for agreed international rules, at which point there will be a role
for the Brussels plan, though that will still be several years away.

MEMOS TO THE PRESIDENT: A GUIDE THROUGH MACROECONOMICS FOR THE BUSY
POLICYMAKER
by Charles L. Schultze
The Brookings Institution, Dollars 24.95, 323 pages
THE US president-elect Bill Clinton is undoubtably a busy man right now as
he prepares to take over in January. One thing is for sure; he is not short
of advice, or free from special pleaders, or just from those wanting a job
on the Clinton bandwagon.
The campaign rhetoric and promises are almost history; what Clinton needs is
sound, experienced advice. Economists, officials, commentators and
hangers-on are offering solutions, but the man himself needs to understand
what they are telling him.
Enter Charles L. Schultze and his timely Memos to the President which
provides an essential, easy-to-read guide in language, to quote Herbert
Stein of the American Enterprise Institute, 'which even the President
(presumably it also goes for the President-elect) can understand.' Touche]
Schultze, now a senior fellow in the Economics Studies programme at the
Brookings Institution, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
(CEA) during the administration of the last Democratic Party president,
Jimmy Carter, and director of the US Bureau of the Budget during the Johnson
presidency - not bad qualifications to advise an arriving president. The old
Washington fox has embarked on a personal fantasy, his own description:
'I imagined a new president (in the 1990s) promising the chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers to devote an hour a week to learning about the
key economic relationships that a president ought to understand as a
background for making macroeconomic policy judgments. My fantasy then had
the president instructing the CEA to prepare a series of weekly memoes that
would accomplish that purpose.'
Schultze adds a qualification about his president, and a comment about
economic advisers of seemingly conflicting ideological persuasions. He
imagines that his hypothetical president and adviser come from near the
middle of the political spectrum, thus excluding the convinced supply-siders
of the early Reagan years or the left wing of the Democratic Party (that
should clear Clinton), and Schultze is not convinced that any one hundred
economists will have an equal number of macroeconomic prescriptions.
Noting his ten year association with the CEA, he observes that - nuances of
language and emphasis apart - the advice given presidents by both Republican
and Democratic CEAs was remarkably similar on about two-thirds to
three-quarters of the relevant issues. 'If one thinks of the views of
first-rank professional economists about issues of public policy as arrayed
across a spectrum of 180 degrees, from left to right, the middle third of
the spectrum would probably contain four-fifths of the economists.'
Having claimed for himself this broad middle ground, Schultze with admirable
clarity divides his 29 memos to the president into a three-part scheme. The
first four set the groundwork, with the nasty aside that many politicians
and journalists, and perhaps some professional economists, carry on the
public debate about macroeconomic policy in terms of what those policies
will or will not do to gross national product (GNP), but with only the
foggiest notion of what GNP is.
The next 15 notes deal with inflation and unemployment and explain how
economic forces produce short term changes of total demand and spending in
the economy; how these changes in demand, interacting with a more stable and
slowly changing supply, can generate inflation and unemployment; and how
economic policies can help keep total demand and supply more nearly matched
so as to avoid those consequences.
The nine memoes in the final part (memo 29 is a concise summary) are the
most interesting. They identify the principle forces that determine the pace
of long-term supply growth and consider the possibilities, costs and
limitations of government policies to promote it.
Schultze acknowledges that a host of microeconomic policy measures can
affect the growth of output supply: trade policy, environmental regulations,
minimum wages, agricultural policy. But he concentrates on three
macroeconomic contributors: national savings and investment in new plant,
equipment and infrastructure; the amount and quality of education embodied
in the labour force (here he finds the US educational system wanting); and
technological advance as it can be influenced by government support for
research and development.
The author writes that short-run changes in a country's economic fortunes
are dominated by changes in aggregate demand; policies to stabilise demand
can contribute to improving America's well-being by minimising periods of
high unemployment and inflation.
'In the long run, however, demand management is far less important than
policies to promote the growth of supply. Unlike stabilisation measures,
such policies typically produce gradual if initially imperceptible changes
in the nation's ability to produce goods and services. But these changes can
accumulate over the decades and generations and generate substantial
improvements in living standards. Continuing progress in the nation's living
standards depends heavily on growth of capital, improvement in the skills
and knowledge of workers, and scientific and technical advances.'
True, but what new president wants to hear such a long-term scenario? Yet
Schultze is correct when he says that getting economic policies at least
roughly right can make a big difference in the prosperity and growth of the
nation. In turn, understanding how the economy works is a prerequisite for
policymakers choosing the right policies. This book is an excellent starting
point.

the Fairfax dynasty

CORPORATE CANNIBALS: THE TAKING OF FAIRFAX
by Colleen Ryan and Glenn Burge
William Heinemann Australia,
ADollars 34.95, 457 pages
BEFORE Rupert Murdoch there was another, grander, Australian newspaper
dynasty. For more than 150 years, the Fairfax family wielded the sort of
power enjoyed for briefer periods by Northcliffe and Beaverbrook in Britain
and by William Randolph Hearst in the US.
It was staunchly conservative, retaining its trust in God, royalty and
empire long after many of its more egalitarian countrymen had begun to look
elsewhere for moral guidance. But it allowed its journalists a large measure
of intellectual freedom; and while its stewardship of the newspapers was
coloured by opposition to the Australian Labor Party, it acted, on the
whole, with dignity and honour.
By the 1980s, the family controlled two of Australia's leading broadsheets,
the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Melbourne, as well as the tabloid
Australian Financial Review; a chain of television and radio stations; and a
large number of provincial newspapers and magazines.
All dynasties end eventually, but rarely do they self-destruct in the
spectacular fashion achieved by the Fairfaxes. In 1987, after the global
stock markets' crash, 'Young' Warwick Fairfax, still in his 20s and a
Harvard graduate who thought he understood business, mounted a leveraged
buy-out of family shareholders. It was a fiasco.
Warwick would have inherited control of the company if he had been prepared
to wait for nature to take its course. Instead, he was taken to the cleaners
by other members of the family and his own advisers. He paid too much and
was unable to service the interest costs on bank debt of ADollars 1.25bn and
USDollars 450m of junk bonds.
By 1990, Fairfax was placed in receivership by its own directors and fell
into the hands of its bankers, principally ANZ and Citibank. Warwick
departed to live as a born-again Christian in Chicago.
The receivership lasted a year, during which bids were invited to buy the
group. There were three main contenders: a Melbourne-based consortium of
institutions called Australian Independent Newspapers (AIN); Independent
Newspapers, the Irish group owned by Tony O'Reilly, former rugby
international and chief executive of Heinz; and Tourang, a consortium
consisting originally of Conrad Black, Canadian proprietor of the UK Daily
Telegraph group, Kerry Packer, the Australian magazine and television owner,
and Hellman and Friedman, a US investment bank. (Murdoch would have liked to
bid but was ruled out on competition grounds: he controls about 70 per cent
of Australia's daily newspaper circulation).
Packer's involvement surprised no one; his family had been a down-market
competitor of the Fairfaxes for two generations. His father, Sir Frank, who
owned the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs in Sydney, sold them to Murdoch in the
1970s, leaving Kerry free to concentrate on television, and he was able to
take part in the Tourang bid so long as any holding in Fairfax stayed below
15 per cent. But no one seemed to believe Tourang's claim that Packer would
be a passive shareholder. Fairfax journalists, including Colleen Ryan,
campaigned actively against the consortium, as did a wider coalition of
journalists, politicians and academics.
Some of the opposition was heavy: Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam, the
former prime ministers, patched up their differences to claim that an
Australian press controlled effectively by Murdoch and Tourang would
challenge the sovereignty of parliament.
Some was disingenuous: much of the comment in the Fairfax press was
presented as a debate on free speech, but was really aimed at forcing Packer
out of Tourang. Some was inept: an all-party letter to Bob Hawke, then prime
minister, urged him to block any bid which would increase media
concentration.
The book details the financial and political manoeuvrings which led to
Tourang buying Fairfax, giving Black a 15 per cent stake and management
control.
Tourang was always the favourite to win, mainly because it had an exclusive
agreement with the junk bond holders negotiated by Malcolm Turnbull, the
Sydney lawyer and merchant banker known best for beating the British
government in the Spycatcher case. But it was never easy, and the internal
tensions nearly tore the consortium apart before the deal was done.
The abrasive Turnbull was forced to resign his directorship after falling
out with Dan Colson, Black's Canadian lawyer; and Trevor Kennedy, formerly
Packer's right-hand man, was dropped as potential chief executive of Fairfax
after Colson and Brian Powers, Hellman's representative in Sydney, decided
he was a lightweight.
Most damaging of all, Packer was forced to withdraw after the Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal announced an inquiry into his relationships with
Colson, Powers and Turnbull. The tribunal, which had the power to block the
deal if it decided Packer was able to exercise control through associates,
acted after reading vitriolic diary notes written by Kennedy.
While this was going on, Labor faction leaders squabbled about how to
formulate regulations on foreign ownership which would keep out Packer and
Black while allowing in the supposedly more compliant O'Reilly. Right up to
the eve of the receiver's deadline for bids, Tourang was unaware what level
of foreign ownership would be allowed.
Ryan and Burge, both Sydney Morning Herald business writers, have produced a
comprehensive chronicle of events. But the book suffers from what might be
called the Insight curse - that style of journalism pioneered by the British
Sunday Times in which reams of extraneous detail are introduced for
verisimilitude. People are forever shuffling papers or coming in from
gardens rubbing dirt off their hands before taking calls.
The authors also dig deep into the cliche basket to bring us ashen-faced
stockbrokers, hard-nosed journalists, charming Irish leprechauns and sources
who remain adamant. The language is at best infelicitous, at worst,
ungrammatical. It is a typical journalists' book, long on detail and short
on judgment.
If you want to know which merchant banker sat down when and where with which
lawyer, Corporate Cannibals will tell you. But it has little to say about
whether the campaign against Black and Packer was justified; whether, as
often suggested, the Canberra government's media policy was formulated to
help Murdoch and disadvantage Fairfax; or whether the frequent changes of
the rules on foreign investment reflected the exigencies of a special case
or the special difficulties of doing business in Australia.
Conrad Black might have had something interesting to say about these points.
He once described Australian politicians as 'venal' and the bidding process
as 'a long, degrading, grotesque charade.' Not much honour and dignity
there.

A BRIEFING FOR LEADERS: COMMUNICATION AS THE ULTIMATE EXERCISE OF POWER
by Robert L Dilenschneider
Harper Business, Dollars 23.00
IS COMMUNICATION the ultimate exercise of power for leaders and would-be
leaders?
Churchill roared and Montgomery inspired. Here, communication skills were
prerequisites of great leadership. Yet admirable as it seems to elevate
mastery of communication as the key to modern leadership, there is surely
much more to it.
The author of this book at least has a good stab at trying to define these
wider attributes. He displays a voracious appetite for dissecting and
quoting from countless worthy management articles and books and case
studies, all meticulously indexed, and from personal encounters with
hundreds of business leaders, many of whom have obviously benefited from his
counselling.
All this distilled wisdom is well organised under four key headings:
leadership raw materials; the communication landscape; the communicator's
template; and leadership goals.
Modern leadership, he maintains, clearly rests on mastery of communication -
'What you say, where you appear, how you advance your message create a
portrait of you and determine how your leadership will be interpreted.'
The publisher's blurb leads one to expect at least a few rare insights into
the qualities of great leadership sorely needed in many contemporary fields,
but the promise is only half fulfilled. The author is at pains to stress
integrity and ethical standards, but the best we can find is a useful guide
to the development and deployment of communication skills to articulate an
organisation's vision, values and goals to both internal and external
audiences.
All this is practical and helpful stuff which ought to be known and
implemented by most business leaders and should be studied by those still in
the dark. Some of the advice will be ignored at one's peril even when other
major issues, such as surviving in recessionary times or lack of confidence,
predominate.
The more upbeat message is that 'leadership is a behaviour that can be
taught and learned' and that charisma is not a vital attribute - in fact it
is dismissed as bunk. Uncharismatic leaders can also be loved by being
'wired into every part of the company'. Many aspiring business leaders and
those still mystified by the powers of good communications will find this a
useful book.

<TEXT>
ASIL NADIR AND THE RISE AND FALL OF POLLY PECK
by David Barchard
Victor Gollancz, Pounds 9.99,
288 pages
JUST OVER two years have passed since the collapse of Polly Peck, prior to
that of BCCI, the most spectacular London business failure in recent years.
The story is far from finished, since Asil Nadir's trial on charges of theft
and false accounting is not expected to begin until next March,
Nevertheless, pending further revelations, David Barchard has given us a
fascinating and thoroughly researched account of Asil Nadir's career, from
his early days as a tough and successful operator in the East End rag trade,
through to international business stardom and his eventual and sudden
downfall.
Barchard's book is based on extensive interviews with those involved, as
well as a long acquaintance with the Turkish political and business scene -
a central, but seldom explained part of the Polly Peck story. He makes sense
of a notoriously tangled web in a refreshingly crisp and engaging style.
In retrospect, the important questions about Polly Peck are not just why it
crashed, but why it seemed to be so successful for so long.
Part of the answer was that many of its reported profits were a mirage. Most
were derived from earnings from the fruit trade in Turkey and Northern
Cyprus, where inflation has run at around 50 per cent for most of the last
ten years, and the Turkish lira has steadily devalued in response. Polly
Peck's resultant foreign exchange losses were charged not to its published
pretax profits, but to reserves, and buried away in the notes to the balance
sheets. None of this was illegal, but resulted from what looks like a
serious weakness in the British accountancy rules.
It is also worth remembering that Asil Nadir identified and skilfully
exploited genuine opportunities, both political and economic. His family's
original emigration from Cyprus to London in 1959 was caused by politics
specifically, the impending British withdrawal from the island, and clear
signs that the Turkish minority would not be allowed to get ahead in
business in a Greek-dominated Cyprus.
Later, after 1974, the Turkish takeover of northern Cyprus gave Nadir his
first break outside the declining British textile industry, when he set up a
badly needed packaging plant to export citrus fruits now being grown by the
Turks.
A second and bigger opportunity arose in mainland Turkey in the 1980s, after
Turgut Ozal's government opened up a growing but hitherto highly protected
and inward-looking economy to the outside world. Asil Nadir seized the
chance, by moving into the fruit export business in Turkey with apparently
spectacular success, and then diversifying into consumer electronics and
tourism.
His expansion was part of that of Turkish capitalism, and resulted in an
alliance with its political sponsor, Turgut Ozal. To cement the alliance,
Nadir bought two newspapers and a magazine in Turkey which, almost alone in
the Turkish press, supported Ozal's cause. Nevertheless, in the final act,
Ozal declined to bail out Polly Peck.
The final collapse was partly caused by management shortcomings - in
particular, the fact that Nadir continued to run a giant corporation as
though it were still a small business - besides his disastrous bid to buy
out the company in September 1990.
However, his bankers must take their share of the blame. Only months before
the crash, the banks had been queueing up to lend Polly Peck hundreds of
millions, but then forced Nadir to fly round the world in search of a mere
Dollars 30m to try to rescue it from liquidation. Hone of them kept a close
enough watch on the company, until they were apparently scared off by an
investigation by the Serious Fraud Office - not into Polly Peck itself, but
a Nadir family company. Whatever Nadir's defects, the bankers' carelessness
also played a fatal part in the disaster.
In his last chapter, Barchard assesses Asil Nadir's undoubted talents, as
well as his failures, pointing out his compelling charm and negotiating
skills, as well as his intuitive grasp of innovative opportunities. His
description is not just that of a spectacular business career, but of a
fascinating personality. Whatever the outcome of Asil Nadir's trial, we are
unlikely to get a fairer, more thorough or lively portrait.

THE UNKNOWN MAXWELL
by Nicholas Davies
Sidgwick &amp; Jackson,
Pounds 14.99
NICHOLAS DAVIES served as foreign editor for the Mirror Group when foreign
coverage was not exactly a priority. The attitude of his last immediate
boss, Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror who was sacked earlier this
month, was that most foreign news was of limited interest to 'tabloid'
Mirror readers.
What Davies lacked in serious employment (and he continues to deny that he
was ever involved in arms-dealing, as alleged in a book by US journalist
Seymour Hersh), he made up in experience as unofficial equerry to the late
Robert Maxwell, one-time newspaper magnate whose business empire collapsed
soon after his body was found floating off the Canaries just over a year
ago.
It is in his capacity as confidante at home and note-taker during Maxwell's
globe-trotting that Davies establishes his credentials not as a serious
biographer but as a competent diarist with a skilful eye for the telling
anecdote.
At home, Maxwell spent more time on his newspapers than on any other part of
his business, even though they were not the main generators of his wealth.
Maxwell showed neither editorial judgment nor inspiration as a publisher -
with the exception of his introduction of colour printing. But his
newspapers were a convenient playground in which to bully employees and
exercise other idiosyncracies.
The bullying has been well documented in an earlier Maxwell book written by
another editor of the Daily Mirror, Roy Greenslade. What Davies manages to
put together is a rather more terrifying picture of a megalomaniac who at
times tottered on the brink of insanity.
As Davies puts it in one of the few reflective passages to be found in this
entertaining book: 'There was an emotional restlessness about him, a
deep-rooted obsession, if not an unnatural urge to dominate and rule, and I
wondered whether his excitability and irrational behaviour amounted at times
to a madness.'
Stories of the difficulties in communication within the Maxwell empire are
legion. Particularly striking is Davies' tale of Maxwell regularly imitating
animal noises - a lion, a dog, and a duck to be precise - as he answered
calls. Maxwell's number was similar to that of London Zoo, so lines
sometimes got crossed.
Dialogue was no less civil in Japan where Maxwell once travelled to try and
get his MCC shares quoted on the Tokyo stock exchange. Davies describes an
evening when Maxwell, in full view of his hosts - executives from Nomura -
dispensed with chopsticks and attacked his dinner with his hands prior to
walking out of the restaurant. He had no time to waste on protocol even when
millions of shares were at stake.
In Japan, as in France, Argentina, Kenya, Poland, Bulgaria, and even Israel,
Maxwell promised much but delivered little. Investments were never realised
with success; instead Maxwell seems to have exploited the brief fix of being
treated as a visiting head of state, surrounded by a coterie of fawning
delegates.
It was in Moscow, (where Davies seems to have carried out an investigation
to complement his own notes), that a more lasting link was established.
Maxwell, while not a spy, was regarded as an 'agent of influence' by the KGB
and may well have played a part in funnelling Communist Party funds towards
the West.
Whether talking to communist bureaucrats or Latin American playboy
presidents, Maxwell always displayed a total lack of interest in the culture
and people he visited. He was happiest in no country in particular, but
drifting at sea, where he managed to go on bullying his employees from the
luxury of his boat, the Lady Ghislaine until he fell overboard in November
1991.
By then, as everyone now knows, the Maxwell empire was already not worth the
paper it was written on. Davies provides few fresh details about where the
money went and how. But he leaves us with an intriguing suggestion as to the
three people who might shed fresh light in the future. They are Dr Werner
Rechsteiner, Maxwell's Swiss lawyer; Ellis Freedman, his US lawyer; and
Vladimir Alexandrovich Kryuchkov, former chief of the KGB.

PROPHETS IN THE DARK
by David Kearns and David Nadler
Harper Business, Dollars 22.50,
334 pages
IT WAS CALLED the Cinderella story of US business in the 1960s when this
small, undistinguished maker of photographic paper, with an odd-sounding
name, pioneered the modern office copying machine and became one of
America's fastest growing companies.
Yet by the early 1980s Xerox was in danger of a demise as dramatic as its
growth had been. Weakened by executive infighting, anti-trust legal battles
and a complacent disregard for its customers, it was losing ground to
Japanese rivals. Its share of the copier market had dropped from more than
90 per cent in the early 1970s to less than 15 per cent.
It was this burden that David Kearns inherited when he became chief
executive in 1982. He realised that, while Xerox still seemed healthy to the
outside world, 'if nothing were done to correct things, we were destined to
have a fire sale and close down by 1990.'
This book tells the remarkable story of how Kearns and his fellow managers
turned Xerox into one of the few US companies ever to win back market share
from the Japanese.
An important role was played by Kearns' co-author, David Nadler, head of a
small management consultancy hired to help with the turn-round, who is now
one of America's leading young management gurus. Kearns retired from Xerox
in 1990 and became US Deputy Secretary of Education.
Xerox's revival, and this book, are monuments to the tenets of the 'total
quality' movement which began to penetrate US and European management
systems in the 1980s. The idea, which originated with US management thinkers
but was first put to practical use by Japanese companies, is that a company
must seek the highest quality in everything it does and have as its first
goal the total satisfaction of customers' needs.
It is easy to pronounce such pat prescriptions. But putting them into
practice across complex business organisations is extremely difficult - a
fact underlined by the many cases of companies which have abandoned such
schemes, disillusioned at their lack of progress.
What lessons for the total quality movement does the Kearns/Nadler tale
hold? Probably the most important is the need for total commitment from the
very top. As Kearns admits: 'Many of our managers didn't think this quality
push was any more than some sort of top management fantasy. An amazing
amount of people thought this was a crummy idea or that I and the others
supporting it were silly. But once I had begun to believe that Xerox was on
its way out of business, I was ready to go hammer and tongs after quality.'
Key allies in this battle included two senior, but maverick executives, who
realised both the importance of the quality push and the political
importance of recruiting a core of influential managers who would ensure a
'constituency of support in the right places.'
Nadler's role was also crucial. An organisations expert, he had a close and
long-lasting relationship with Kearns, who found it invaluable to have a
sounding board he trusted from outside the organisation.
Over a period of four years Xerox put its 100,000 employees through quality
programmes, and Kearns believes the approach it adopted is one of the
company's most important contributions to the quality movement. Senior
executives were trained first, so the system cascaded down from the top, but
managers then had to teach the course to others, which made them more
attentive and drummed quality ideas into them twice. Employees were also
trained with the people they worked with every day, allowing them to apply
their new tools to collective problems.
The revival of Xerox involved plenty of mistakes, many of which Kearns
recounts, and took much longer than even he expected to start producing
results. He points out that in late 1986, nearly four years into the
programme, 'we began to sense that Leadership Through Quality was teetering
on the brink. With a little shove it could have gone over the precipice.'
A reassessment, some fine tuning and a renewed push from the top followed,
and by 1988 Xerox's quality was improving by leaps and bounds.
The weakest part of the narrative is the explanation for this sudden
transformation, with the authors citing frustratingly few concrete examples
of individual quality initiatives. Nevertheless, this is a refreshingly
jargon-free and easily digestible analysis of one of America's most
important recent corporate rescues. It is essential reading for any student
of total quality management.

FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): The bottom line, how
Reuters made the news - The remarkable history of an institution and its
visionary founder

THE POWER OF NEWS: THE HISTORY OF REUTERS
by Donald Read
Oxford University Press, Pounds 20,
432 pages
ANYONE WHO knows Reuters a little will be aware of two things: its obsession
with speed and accuracy and the sometimes melodramatic schisms between its
general newsgathering and commercial news arms.
It is pleasant, therefore, to have this history confirm that it was more or
less so from the beginning. By the time that Julius Reuter, third son of the
chief rabbi of Cassel, launched his first news service in Paris in 1849, he
already had behind him several years' experience in his uncle's bank in
Gottingen.
No doubt it was the revolutionary atmosphere of Paris in 1848 that excited
Reuter's imagination and led him into a formative alliance with Sigismund
Englander, an anarchist, freelance diplomat and scribbler. But from the very
beginning, the news sheet which Reuter sent from Paris to Germany was
crammed with Paris Bourse prices, as well as gossip and accounts of
proceedings in the national assembly. The connection between financial and
political information has informed the Reuters business ever since.
Donald Read says his main theme in this book, which is to be followed by two
more detailed volumes covering the same story, is 'the working (or
otherwise) of the Reuter news tradition.' How did it begin? How free is it
from bias?
Fortunately, he does not leave out, although he treats less fully and less
thoughtfully, what some will think the more interesting story: how did a
German-founded telegraphic news agency turn into a central communications
corridor of the British Empire, before surviving the stagnation and brawling
of post-war Fleet Street to emerge as a leading provider of electronic
information to the financial markets ?
Although an official history, the book does not hesitate to challenge
Reuter's heavy reliance through most of its history on funding and favours
from the British government.
But Reuter's early success, after a series of false starts on the continent,
was very much in the sphere of economic news. Shortly after the opening of
the cross-Channel telegraph cable, he established himself in the City,
selling information on continental markets to the London stock exchange and
sending telegraphic messages for his London customers.
He established a continental network of information channels, using
telegraph, mail, steamship and pigeon and developed an ambitious series of
alliances with other information agencies across the world, securing cartels
whenever he could.
At first, he was excluded from selling information to newspapers by the
haughtiness of The Times, but the proliferation of newspapers which followed
the repeal of newspaper stamp duty in 1855 created the conditions for Reuter
to prosper.
Until his retirement in 1878, Julius Reuter applied to his business his
gifts of vision, organisation, determination and salesmanship. He was also
constantly alert to new technology, making early use of wireless, for
example. The flamboyant Englander was by this time chief of the London
editorial bureau, from which position he was still insisting to Julius
Reuter's successor in 1886 that Reuter journalists must be hommes politiques
rather than mere reporters.
At the height of the British Empire, this Reuter-Englander blend of shrewd
efficiency and wordliness was a potent, profitable mix. Queen Victoria read
her Reuter telegrams, vouchsafing to Disraeli that Reuter was one 'who
generally knows.' When Reuter died at his villa in Nice in 1899, he left a
solid, if not stupendous, estate.
Under the leadership of his less gifted son, Baron Herbert, Reuters at first
rode the full tide of imperial greatness, but also made mistakes, including
a disastrous diversification into banking.
Weakened financially as Europe slithered towards the 1914-18 war, Reuters
found its expenses rising and its revenue stagnating. A long-standing
alliance of interests with the British Foreign Office turned, on certainly
more than one occasion, to secret payments for services rendered.
Between the wars Reuters had, in Sir Roderick Jones, another leader of great
forcefulness. It was Jones who, in 1926, started the process of selling
Reuters into the collective ownership of the British press. With the growth
of the great American agencies, Reuters was now in an intensely competitive
business.
Jones's autocratic regime saw some improvements in Reuter's range of
reporting and growth in the by now Cinderella commercial services, but there
was no post-imperial vision and no understanding of the deadliness of any
embrace between newsman and government minister. It was eventually the
exposure of yet another secret deal between Reuters and the Foreign Office
that led to Jones's resignation in 1941.
The 1941 trust agreement between the squabbling British and colonial
newspapers which now owned Reuters provided a certain kind of security, but
it was hardly likely to nurture dynamic management and growth. It also
tended to buoy the spirits of those within Reuters who were more interested
in general news than business. As Derek Jameson, later to be editor of the
Daily Express, is quoted here as telling a hapless commercial service
colleague: 'Sorry, cock. They've just formed their 29th postwar government
in Italy. No room for your crap.'
But that could not stop the black ink from business information flowing even
more strongly than the red from general news. For a period, Reuters resorted
to that last refuge of a desperate management: it ceased to declare
divisional profits figures as separate lines.
As in all geopolitical struggles, power eventually followed economic
success. The board knew that it needed more commercial service income to
avoid levying heavier tariffs on its newspaper owners and in the 1960s and
1970s, Reuters promoted to key positions individuals who had risen through
the commercial service. Multilingual, technologically alert, willing to take
large but calculated business risks, these men shaped the new Reuters.
Profits in the 1970s never exceeded Pounds 4m. By the end of the 1980s, they
had reached Pounds 283m. All of this made possible the flotation of Reuters
as a public company in 1984, yielding a fine bonanza for the Fleet Street
owners and raising questions, confidently dismissed in this book, about
their fidelity to the terms of the Reuters trust.
Read's account of the flotation contains new and arresting information, but
his narrative of Reuter's rise to pre-eminence in electronic business
information does not quite convey either the scale of the achievement or an
adequate explanation for it.
Here was an organisation bereft of capital, unused to borrowing, barely
profitable, and owned by one of the most quarrelsome groups of businessmen
on the planet; yet it transformed itself, in a decade when Fleet Street was
still spending most its time fighting outdated industrial relations battles.
Read certainly touches on some of the factors involved: the maturing of an
intake of well-educated trainees; a culture attuned to the importance of
technology shifts; the chemistry between senior executives; luck. He also
reasons that some of the most dramatic advances were really the result of
defensive moves.
These points are no doubt valid as far as they go, but they do not account
for one of the most remarkable management stories in British business since
the war. There is nothing much here, for example, about Reuter's competitors
and nothing at all to help the reader towards a judgment on the
sustainability of the company's achievements.
But Read is right to conclude that were Julius Reuter to return from the
grave, he would be glad to see his creature still noted for speed and
accuracy in both economic and general news, still innovative in terms of
technology and still a global player. 'Not least,' Read notes, 'he would be
delighted that Reuters was making large profits.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: New advance led by the dollar stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE in prospects for economic recovery remained high in the London
stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE Index closed at new trading and
closing highs in spite of a slow opening to the first effective session on
Wall Street since the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
The first day of the new two-week equity trading account saw the UK market
rise by 24 points in early trading to touch a new trading peak of 2,784.1,
as investors bought dollar stocks. When New York opened with a gain of only
3.78 Dow points in UK hours, London stocks eased back from the day's highest
levels. The final reading of 2,778.8 showed a gain of 18.7 on the FT-SE
Index.
Domestic news played a minor role yesterday. Suspension of Rosehaugh, a
leading property development group, as official receivers were called in,
restrained some other property stocks as well as those UK banks known to be
exposed in the property sector. Fears that the economic recession could
still deliver severe shocks to confidence continue to restrain investment
confidence, according to strategists at several leading securities firms.
However, there was a firm response to the statistics on November UK money
supply showing a provisional gain of 0.8 per cent. Inflationary worries have
been put aside, at least for the time being.
From the opening, attention focused on the prospects for a further rise on
Wall Street as it made a fuller response to last week's favourable data on
gross domestic product and durable goods order trends.
Once again, a strong performance from the December future contract on the
Footsie, which moved briefly above 2,800 yesterday, provided the lead for
the underlying equity market. Futures buying is often an indication that
institutions are preparing to move into equities.
Share buyers remained selective, buying Wellcome but not Glaxo and RTZ but
not SmithKline Beecham. Second line issues were very active, the total
shares traded in non-Footsie listed stocks exceeding those of the Footsie
giants.
The day's Seaq volume total of 635m shares compared with 665.9m on Friday,
when retail business of Pounds 1.19bn maintained the record of significantly
improved business levels since the mid-September.
The London market is now waiting to see the list of important economic data
on the US economy which is due today; the leading economic indicators,
National Association of Purchasing Managers survey, and construction
spending statistics will all be scanned eagerly for further signs of an
upturn in the US economy.
Tomorrow's auction of British government bonds was also believed to be a
restraining factor on institutional activity in the equity market yesterday.
Among the domestically-orientated sectors, breweries attracted buyers ahead
of a week which will bring trading reports from a number of the industry
leaders. Store and retail issues, hoping now that the all-important
Christmas selling season, which provides a substantial portion of profits
for the leading store groups, will disclose some recovery in retail
activity, found buyers.
Firmness in sterling, regarded as a necessary prop for the further reduction
of one point in UK base rates expected before the end of January, also
helped sentiment.

FT  01 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Challenge to Asda rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY hopes at Asda continued to draw support yesterday as the shares
again edged forward in huge turnover of 85m, by far the heaviest traded
stock in the market. However, there were indications last night that Asda's
good run may have peaked, with a number of brokers preparing to issue sell
notes in time for the start of trading today. The shares, which stood at 23p
on August 10, gained 2 1/2 to 58p yesterday.
Mr Nick Bubb at Morgan Stanley, a buyer of the stock since its summer
depths, said: 'The recovery in Asda was supposed to take three years not
three months. We forecast a top price of 55-60p which has now been reached.
Asda is an interesting recovery story, but until we see some new figures, we
have turned seller.' Asda's results are due on December 18.
Other traders noted that yesterday's heavy trading included some of the UK's
leading institutions as sellers, although this was more than countered by
heavy US buying and smaller UK funds. One analyst also said that the Asda
management had expressed unease about the one-way march in the shares, which
have outperformed the market by around 90 per cent in the last three months.
One leading food retail analyst commented: 'The stock is overvalued and is
no longer supported by the fundamentals.'
Oil stocks busy
The two leading UK exploration and production stocks, Lasmo and Enterprise,
were the spearhead in a general upsurge in the oil sector after last week's
Opec agreement. News of further encouraging drilling results from a southern
Italian oil discovery was said to have been the driving force behind both
companies' share prices.
The oil sector in general made good progress after last Friday's Opec
agreement to restrict output to some 24.58m barrels a day saw oil prices
move up some 20 cents a barrel. But oil analysts were by no means over
impressed with the latest moves by Opec. 'It's not a good agreement, they've
papered over the cracks and oil prices are unlikely to move up from here,'
said Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court. 'The market will still be dependent
on cold snaps to get oil prices up,' said Hoare Govett, while Keith Morris
at Carr Kitcat said: 'I'm not enthusiastic, the oil price won't go a lot
further.' County NatWest said: 'We see no reason to change our cautious view
of the oil sector.'
Lasmo ran up 8 to 170p and Enterprise 7 1/2 to 462 1/2 p after more positive
news from the Tempa Rossa oilfield in Southern Italy in which both companies
hold substantial interests.
BP edged up 2 to 233 1/2 in front of a presentation to Scottish institutions
regarding progress on the group's recovery plan. BP is due to address oil
analysts in London on December 7.
Shell added 6 at 554p. Burmah Castrol jumped 18 to 667p, responding to a
stock shortage and a broker buy recommendation. There was heavy turnover in
Aran Energy stock where a block of 6m shares, or around 2.3 per cent of the
issued capital, was sold into the market at 15 1/4 p. The shares were
thought to have come from one of the big Irish institutions. Aran shares
closed unaltered at 16p.
Rosehaugh shivers
The arrival of a receiver at Rosehaugh sent shivers through the property
market with selected stocks being marked back in nervous trading. Property
developers which have been the hardest hit by the market downturn in the
last three years were among the worst performers. Speyhawk lost 2 to 11 1/2
p, and Stanhope, which has a joint development with Rosehaugh, 6 1/2 to 11p.
Yesterday, Stanhope said its joint venture with Rosehaugh was unaffected by
the receivership, funding having been secured last week.
Mr Carl Gough at UBS Phillips and Drew said: 'We remain very negative on the
sector, but especially on those companies with exposure to the central
London office market.' He added that he expected other developers to join
the casualty list in the near future.
After an initial boost when Britain left the ERM, the commercial property
market has recently slumped back into a cycle of falling rents and few
buyers. One problem has been the unwillingness of insurers to provide
adequate cover against terrorism for central London locations. German buying
interest, much in evidence in recent weeks, appears to have faded.
Barclays Bank's substantial involvement with property development ensured
that Barclays shares were given a rough ride by the market after news of the
suspension of trading in Rosehaugh stock.
There were hints around the market that Barclays exposure to Rosehaugh could
well amount to around Pounds 150m and specialists pointed out that Barclays
had not yet provided for such a sum. Barclays shares dipped to 367p before
stabilising and closing a net penny higher at 374p.
A flurry of speculative buying drove TSB shares up 4 1/2 to 143 1/2 p with
turnover reaching a hefty 7.1m.
The latest political turbulence in Hong Kong brought renewed downward
pressures on Standard Chartered and HSBC. The latter dropped 5 to 518p on
heavy turnover of 10m and were additionally weighed down by a Lehman
Brothers recommendation that investors 'take profits' in the stock. Lehman
said 'growth at the core activities is likely to slow down and recovery
elsewhere is likely to be modest; we expect HSBC's medium term profits
growth to be below the average for the Hong Kong market.' Standard Chartered
was also unsettled by speculation that Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, the Malaysian
businessman, may be considering the sale of his near 13 per cent stake.
Other leading high street banks were affected by the worries concerning the
property sector. NatWest held at 394p, after 390p, and Lloyds closed 2
firmer at 502p, after 498p.
The electricity and water sectors were persistently sold and the proceeds
switched into the more fashionable cyclical stocks. But the Scottish
generators were well supported after Scottish Power posted top of the range
half-year profits and a better than expected interim dividend. Power shares
settled 2 better at 223p.
Paint manufacturer Manders jumped 20 to 221p after news that it had won a
long-term contract to supply own brand paint to the 67-strong Wickes chain
of DIY superstores.
Several leading international stocks continued to be boosted by last week's
favourable US data which some say points to the prospect of recovery. RTZ
jumped 21 to 640p.
US recovery hopes combined with vague takeover talk helped Cadbury-Schweppes
add 9 to 453p and United Biscuits 11 to 347p. A stock overhang held back
Kwik Save, the shares 13 lower at 731p.
WH Smith was steady at 485p, pinned back by a downgrade from UBS Phillips
and Drew. Worries over Our Price records were again cited.
In engineers, an early buyer of TI Group caused a squeeze which sent the
shares climbing 13 to 292p. Shares in Glynwed International bucked the
strong market trend and shed 2 to 217p, after it was reported that its
broker SG Warburg had reduced its current year profits forecast to Pounds
32m. The range of forecasts is now between Pounds 31 and Pounds 34m.
Rolls-Royce rose to 5m as the shares continued to recover, breaking through
the 100p barrier. They closed 5 up at 101p. Also recovering was tobacco
machinery and packaging manufacturer Molins. The shares jumped 12 to 379p.
Among motor stocks, Burndene were wanted and gained 11 to 201p. A leading
securities house was said to have turned positive on T Cowie, helping the
shares gain 6 to 137p.
Erskine House were a good market ahead of tomorrow's interim figures and the
shares firmed 5 to 75p.

<TEXT>
STRONG mid-session demand sent Footsie futures soaring, helping the
near-month contract breakthrough the 2,800 level for the first time this
year, though profit-taking prevented the contract from closing at the higher
level, writes Joel Kibazo.
A two-way pull was seen at the market's opening as some dealers indulged in
profit-taking while some chose to follow through on Friday's strength. A
mid-morning seller brought the December contract back to 2,772, however it
soon recovered and went forward to break through the 2,800 level when the
day's high of 2,802 was reached at lunchtime.
Sentiment was also boosted by UK money supply figures which were seen as
another sign of recovery. More profit-taking saw December surrender earlier
gains and the downward momentum gathered pace with the disappointing early
performance on Wall Street. Dealers also pointed to the poor performance of
the fixed interest markets for the decline.
December closed at 2,797, around 17 points above its fair value premium to
cash, which fell to around 4 points with the opening of the new account.
Turnover was a modest 6,529 contracts.
In traded options, volume reached 29,974 contracts, ahead of Friday's poor
24,489 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was 6,456. Asda was the most
active stock option with 4,514 contracts.

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Big technology stocks feature
in busy trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US prices rose across the board yesterday, aided by a strong showing from
big technology stocks and more good economic news that ensured market
sentiment remained positive, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.96 at 3,305.16, the
first time it has closed above 3,300 since September 21. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which reached new highs last week, firmed 1.18
to 431.34, a new record, while the Amex composite fell 1.72 to 395.11 and
the Nasdaq composite firmed 3.24 to 652.73, an all-time high. Turnover on
the NYSE was heavy at 230m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,138 to
661.
Although the market's mood was positive at the opening, following recent
signs that the pace of the economic recovery is quickening, there was no
initial surge in demand of the type that pushed shares sharply higher last
week.
Buying picked up, however, after the Chicago purchasers' report was
released, showing that the index of manufacturing activity in the region had
risen from 49.72 in October to 54.22.
With the National Association of Purchasing Management's report due out
today, the Chicago figures raised hopes that business activity is
accelerating across the US.
Investors also hope that the pick-up in manufacturing will presage an
improvement in labour market conditions. The latest data on the jobs market
are due on Friday when the November employment report is released.
The Dow was given a considerable boost by strong demand for technology
stocks, particularly IBM. The poor performance from IBM over the past few
months is one of the main reasons why the Dow has lagged other market
indices which have set record highs in recent days.
Yesterday, however, IBM rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 in turnover of
2.4m shares after Smith Barney, the broking house, upgraded the stock from
'hold' to 'speculative buy' on the grounds that it believed the shares have
bottomed out. Other technology stocks rose in IBM's wake, with Digital
Equipment up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 34 1/4 , Motorola Dollars 2 5/8 higher
at Dollars 102 7/8 and Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 66 1/2 .
Neiman Marcus jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 19 on reports that sales from
the luxury retail group's Christmas catalogue were at record levels.
Ambac fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 42 5/8 after the broking house Salomon
Brothers cut its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and removed it
from its recommended list. Another stock to suffer from a Wall Street

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firmer dollar contributes to
rise on Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRMER dollar contributed to the rise on most continental bourses
yesterday, though other factors were also at work, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw its biggest one-day rise in the DAX index for nearly two
weeks, although most analysts thought that the rally had little to do with
fundamentals. The index closed 21.39 ahead at 1,544.34 after a gain in the
FAZ at midsession of 6.64 to 606.05. Turnover rose to DM4.9bn from Friday's
DM3.8bn.
In the absence of major corporate news (10-month results are due from the
banks later this week) investors were pleased by the moderate 5 per cent pay
claim sought by the civil service union. This indicates a much more
realistic mood among unions, although warning strikes in the insurance
sector have been threatened for Thursday as the DAG union pursues a separate
claim.
Expectations of disappointing third-quarter GNP figures for west Germany,
due for release on Thursday, appear to have been discounted by the market.
Forecasts are for a 0.5 per cent fall in GNP from the same period last year.
Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Daimler all stood out, with high volume noted in
the first two. Deutsche Bank rose DM9.40 to DM676, Siemens advanced DM6.60
to DM602 and Daimler gained DM13.70 to DM546.
Asko was another of the day's big risers, up DM41 to DM573 following last
week's news that the cartel office had approved its merger with the Metro
group.
PARIS rose further on continued hopes of an early cut in interest rates. The
CAC-40 index ended up 21.71 or 1.2 per cent at 1,771.37. Trading was quiet
until the last hour of the session when it was enlivened by the expiry of
November stock index futures, which boosted turnover to FFr2.8bn.
Interest-rate sensitive stocks were in demand, as CCF rose FFr10 to FFr210
and Suez added FFr8 to FFr249. Suez was also supported by hopes of an early
accord with UAP on the future of Victoire and Colonia.
Euro Disney failed to participate in the firmer trend, losing FFr1.30 or 2
per cent to FFr62.70 on reports of a downgrade from a US broker. Mr Richard
Simon, analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, later said he expected the
theme park to make a pre-tax loss of FFr750m in fiscal 1993, compared with
his previous forecast of a loss of FFr250m.
MILAN fell further and volume dried up as investors retreated to the
sidelines to wait for further developments on privatisation. Currency
concerns also weighed on the market as the lira eased against the mark. The
Comit index fell 4.24 to 438.34 in turnover estimated at L145bn after
L170.4bn.
Some financial stocks bucked the trend, as Credito Italiano rose L13 to
L2,683 while Fondiaria gained L1,350 or 4.7 per cent to L29,950 on continued
speculation about its future.
Declines hit industrial blue chips, as Fiat fell L173 or 4 per cent to
L4,187 and Olivetti slid L54 or 2.7 per cent to L1,925.
The speculative fizz evaporated in the food group, Sme, down L66 to L5,579
and the retailer, Rinascente, L120 lower at L6,780. Ciga, the hotel group,
fell L52 or 4.2 per cent to L1,188 following an unfavourable report in a UK
Sunday news-paper.
AMSTERDAM welcomed the news of a proposed merger between KNP,
Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep which will create Europe's second largest
paper group, although details of terms were sketchy. An analysts meeting was
under way as the market closed. The CBS General Tendency index finished up
0.5 at 103.7 with KNP Fl 1.60 better at Fl 28.90, Buhrmann -Tetterode up 70
cents at Fl 29.20 and VRG Group rising 30 cents to Fl 23.20.
Ahold, up Fl 2.60 at Fl 83.60, pleased the market with a 6 per cent increase
in third-quarter earnings although a weaker dollar depressed growth. Some 50
per cent of the group's sales come from its US supermarket division.
ZURICH was encouraged by the firmer dollar although sentiment remained
cautious ahead of Sunday's referendum on whether to join the EEA. The SMI
index gained 16.6 to 1,931.2.
Industrials and insurers led the rally with Roche certificates adding SFr30
to SFr3,900 and BBC Brown Boveri bearers up SFr80 to SFr3,430. Among
insurers, Zurich registered shares put on SFr60 to SFr1,800 and Swiss Re
bearers improved SFr70 to SFr2,350.
STOCKHOLM extended last week's gains, aided by the stronger dollar. The
Affarsvarlden general index put on 16.2 to 901.4 in turnover of SKr922m.
Ericsson B shares featured with a rise of SKr2 to SKr179 while Astra B
shares advanced SKr12 to SKr724.
OSLO rose after the central bank cut its overnight lending rate to 17 per
cent from 25 per cent. The all-share index rose 5.20 to 358.94 in turnover
of NKr214m.
MADRID drifted lower in the absence of fresh news, and the general index
closed 1.43 down at 213.86.
ISTANBUL eased on profit-taking following strong rises last week. The
75-share index lost 56.82 at 3,786.24 in turnover of TL227.5bn.

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Currencies influence European trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued turbulence in European currency markets was again the main trading
influence on bourses last week, while good economic news from the US and a
strong performance from Japan lifted sentiment elsewhere. The FT-A World
index rose 1.2 per cent in local currency terms.
Finland stood out with a positive improvement in very high turnover: by
midweek some FM100m (Dollars 19.8m) of business was transacted, approaching
five times the average daily level. Mr Peter Lawrence of Kleinwort Benson
says that the Finnish market reacted negatively to the devaluation of the
Swedish krona, which fanned fears that it would harm Finnish industry.
However, the fact that the local currency fell in line with that of its
neighbour effectively erased worries about a loss in competitiveness.
The lifting of a threatened nationwide strike also had a positive effect on
the market, Mr Lawrence adds. Gains were seen across the board, and
international conglomerates were also heavily bought.
Ireland attracted interest on expectations that it will be forced to
devalue. Mr Robby Kelleher of the brokers Davy's notes that the market was
mimicking the situation in the UK when the FTSE showed solid gains in the
days leading up to sterling's withdrawal from the ERM. However, Ireland has
consistently underperformed other European markets this year and in spite of
the rally of the last 10 days the index remains 13 per cent down
year-on-year.
Elsewhere, New Zealand showed a near 9 per cent gain on the week in local
currency terms. Ms Pauline McAtamney of Ord Minnett in London says that
progress in the Gatt trade talks the previous weekend provided a positive
background. Strong interim results from NZ Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey, a
management reshuffle at Brierley and a major asset sale by Fletcher
Challenge provided the main corporate news.

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at day's
high but volume stays low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A RALLY in steel and shipbuilding shares, spurred by foreign investors, was
one of the day's main features as the Nikkei average closed higher, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed up 213.04 at 17,683.65, the highest point of the
day. The index fell to the day's low of 17,457.57 in the morning on
small-lot profit-taking. Volume fell to 230m shares from 247m. Advances led
declines by 777 to 202 with 145 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks gained for the eighth consecutive day, rising
15.81 to 1,323.35 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.61 to
1,071.27.
Some traders believe that the technical resistance level of 17,700 could be
broken. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the
Nikkei could rise to 18,000 in the near term. 'Public fund managers will
want to increase their equities profile for future government fund
allocation,' she said.
However, with the Nikkei at 53 times earnings and prospects of an early
corporate profits recovery uncertain, other investors are reluctant to
commit large funds to the market. Some dealers said a bulk of corporations
want to liquidate tokkin, or specified money trusts, at the 18,000 level.
Steel makers and shipbuilders were bought by leading foreign brokers. Nippon
Steel rose Y8 to Y291, NKK Y7 to Y256, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
advanced Y13 to Y553.
High-technology exporters were higher, with NEC up Y24 to Y695 and Toshiba
gaining Y2 to Y622. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said the easing of the
yen and an expected recovery of the US economy supported electronics issues
which have been previously sold on profit concerns.
Housing issues were higher on the 10.3 per cent rise in housing starts for
October. Misawa Homes rose Y40 to Y1,120 and Daiwa House Industry advanced
Y10 to Y1,430.
Dealers were active in speculative theme stocks. Mitsui Mining and Smelting,
the most active issue of the day, rose Y9 to Y508. The issue, which had
surged recently on reports of a gold vein discovery, firmed yesterday on
rumours that the company would announce the latest research data on the
veins.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 172.46 to 18,961.05 in volume of 26.5m
shares. The index posted its eighth straight rise on buying by public funds.
Machinery and construction stocks gained while pharmaceuticals stalled.
Nintendo, the video game maker, lost Y100 to Y10,500 on profit-taking.
Roundup
MARKETS in the Pacific Rim were mixed to lower. Manila was closed for a
public holiday.
HONG KONG fell nearly 3 per cent as China's row with Britain about democracy
in Hong Kong took a turn for the worse at the weekend. The Hang Seng index
ended 176.04 lower at 5,810.63 in low turnover of HKDollars 2.25bn.
Among the most actives, HSBC Holdings was down HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars
58.50, Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 1.50 lower at HKDollars 53.50 and Swire
Pacific HKDollars 1.25 cents lower at HKDollars 31.00.
AUSTRALIA lost early gains following the publication of a disastrous current
account deficit for October of ADollars 2.04bn, compared with ADollars
1.74bn in September. The All Ordinaries index closed 2.7 lower at 1,448.1 in
turnover of ADollars 188.2m.
NEW ZEALAND ended steady, with falls in some leading stocks masking a strong
rise in Fletcher Challenge and Telecom. The NZSE-40 capital index gained
1.90 to 1,547.37 in turnover worth NZDollars 28m.
FCL, which began firming last week in anticipation of the sale of its unit,
Rural Bank, ended 11 cents higher at NZDollars 2.22 after the sale was
confirmed late on Friday.
SINGAPORE posted strong gains as foreign investors' view of Singapore
improved after healthy trade indicators. The Straits Times Industrial index
rose 21.11 to 1,469.07 in volume of 132.9m shares against 177m.
Shipyards and banks were the main gainers. Sembawang Shipyard rose 45 cents
to SDollars 8.25 and DBS Foreign 40 cents to SDollars 13.80.
SEOUL rose on expectations of an interest rate cut and a more flexible
monetary policy. The composite index added 10.42 to 663.36.
Posco and Dong-Ah Construction Industrial gained sharply on news that the
two companies had been approached to take part in building a motorway
between Beijing and Hong Kong. Both shares ended limit-up, with Posco
gaining Won1,000 to Won26,100 and Dong-Ah Construction up Won800 to
Won19,100.
KUALA LUMPUR fell back on renewed selling in the afternoon. The composite
index ended just 1.41 up at 641.89 in volume of 164.4m shares against 255.4m
on Friday.
Magnum fell 40 cents to MDollars 9.90 while Multi-Purpose Holdings and MISC
foreign lost 15 cents each to MDollars 2.49 and MDollars 7.10 respectively.
BANGKOK's SET index lost 4.28 to 865.21 on profit-taking.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Record UK assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPECTRE of Black Wednesday returned to the money markets yesterday as
the Bank of England provided record assistance of Pounds 3.95bn. The help
reflected a gilt repo agreement set up to balance the books following the UK
central bank's failed attempt to prop up the pound on September 16, writes
Peter John.
Aware that the money market was unable to cope with the massive scale of
government intervention via normal channels it set up a special gilt repo on
September 18. A number of clearing banks were unhappy with the gilt repo
rates. That disenchantment meant that a new opportunity offered by the Bank
yesterday to roll over funds until February 1 attracted little interest and
the Bank was forced to repurchase heavily.
However, the early forecast shortage of Pounds 4bn, later revised to around
Pounds 3.95bn was successfully taken up prompting one money market operator
to comment; 'The system coped particularly well in exceptionally difficult
circumstances.' Another said; 'It just goes to show that the daily miracle
is still working.'
Because of the size of the shortage the Bank was using all the weapons in
its armoury yesterday. While it normally offers only short-dated band 1 and
2 bills it was yesterday providing longer dated band 3 and 4 bills.
Nevertheless, the size of the shortage, combined with various economic
indicators and pressure from overseas banks forced bank rates higher.
Dealers responded to hints from Germany that interest rates would not fall
further as well as the latest rise in M0, the narrow measure of money, which
is seen as removing pressure on the government to cut UK rates. Also,
Japanese banks have been, according to at least one dealer, 'voracious
takers of funds' ahead of their financial year end and that buying has
pushed inter-bank rates above the level that reflects the inflationary
trend.
The overnight rate was squeezed up to nine per cent at one stage, purely on
technical factors, while the more representative three-month money hit 7
7/16 per cent before closing at 7 3/8 per cent.
Short sterling was also under pressure with the March contract experiencing
heavy turnover of more than 40,500 contracts and moving down 25 percentage
points to 93.31, signalling some doubt over a continued fall in interest
rates.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound and dollar easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL currencies traded quietly yesterday as the foreign exchange
markets paused to take stock following volatility in Europe and a stronger
US currency, writes Peter John.
The dollar was broadly easier, despite hints of another tranche of positive
economic news today, while sterling failed to reflect the good news from
yesterday's money supply figures. Even the beleaguered Irish punt stayed on
the sidelines and picked itself up from the floor of the exchange rate
mechanism.
Dealers said that the dollar was not attracting attention and there was a
feeling that its recent rise might have been overdone, at least in the
short-term. This was borne out by the lack of reaction to the latest figures
from the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index. The rise to 54.2 per cent from
49.7 per cent was greater than expected and suggested good news today from
the more significant National Association of Purchasing Managers.
Nevertheless, the dollar traded sideways against the yen closing at Y124.45
against Y124.35 and slipped against the DMark to DM1.5935 from DM1.5980.
However, the German currency was also subdued as economics minister Mr
Juergen Moellemann said that the global recession had finally caught up with
the country. Third-quarter figures due on Thursday are expected to confirm
the gloomy standpoint.
Sterling might have been expected to receive a lift from the news that money
supply, at least the narrow measure that comprises notes and coins in
circulation, had increased. However, the implication that people were
finally beginning to spend was countered by suggestions in the market that
the influx of new, smaller 10p coins was at least partly to blame. Also, any
auspicious news was overshadowed by the negative weekend press stories
surrounding the UK chancellor and most dealers took the money supply figures
with a pinch of salt. The pound was marginally easier against the German
currency, slipping to DM2.4125 from DM2.4150 and closing slightly lower at
Dollars 1.5135 against Dollars 1.5115.
The Irish punt survived against the expectations of many and although the
devaluation fears remain it climbed two places up the ERM ladder above the
French franc and the Danish krone. However, France maintained its
intervention rate at 9.1 per cent and there was a conviction in the market
that the franc did not deserve to be so low on the ERM scale.
The Portuguese escudo remained at the top of the ERM as Mr Miguel Beleza,
the governor of the Bank of Portugal, distanced himself from the possibility
of devaluation.
Outside the European basket of currencies, the Norwegian krone was helped by
an inflow of currency which enabled the Norwegian central bank to cut its
overnight lending rate to 17 per cent from a six-year high of 25 per cent.
The cut follows a raise a week ago after the currency was hit on the foreign
exchanges by devaluation pressures.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big aluminium and nickel output
cuts announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL production cuts were announced yesterday by Pechiney, Europe's
biggest aluminium producer, and Falconbridge, the second-largest nickel
group outside the former Soviet Union.
Traders said this caused some chaotic conditions in the London Metal
Exchange's nickel market. Prices rose very strongly last week, by Dollars
600 a tonne to touch a peak of Dollars 6,100, and this attracted some
determined selling yesterday.
Falconbridge's announcement caused prices to fluctuate in a wide, Dollars
265 a tonne, range at one stage but the downward pressure was relentless and
in after-hours dealing nickel was quoted at Dollars 5,812.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 257.50.
Aluminium was boosted to a nine-week LME peak of Dollars 1.334 a tonne by
Pechiney's announcement but the price later fell back to close at Dollars
1,221.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the day.
Pechiney said it would close permanently its high-cost, 31,000-tonnes-a-year
smelter at Venthon in the south of France. It also will reduce the operating
rate of other smelters - at Flessinque in the Netherlands and Auzat,
Lannemezan and Saint-Jean in France - to 80 per cent of capacity which means
temporarily cutting annual output by 79,000 tonnes. Pechiney's workforce of
3,954 will be cut by 337. The group has an annual primary aluminium capacity
of about 1m tonnes.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
pointed out that this would take total annual aluminium capacity cuts
announced by the industry since June last year to 1.07m tonnes but new
capacity had come into operation and the western industry was heading for
record output of more than 15m tonnes this year.
Falconbridge, which is jointly owned by Noranda of Canada and Trelleborg of
Sweden, cited weak prices, high stocks, increasing costs and a poor market
outlook for its decision to cut 200 jobs at its Sudbury division in Canada
and 4,000 tonnes of nickel output next year by temporary shutdowns at
Sudbury and the Nikkelverk refinery in Norway. This is on top of cuts of
7,000 tonnes announced last month.
The company's Dominican Republic operations will also shut for three months
next year, resulting in another 7,700-tonnes cut in output. Falconbridge
said in total it was removing 18,700 tonnes of nickel from the market in
1993.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the commodity broker, suggested
Falconbridge's cuts were larger than expected and helped to justify last
week's rally. However, Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, thought the
market would once again see these producer cuts as 'too little, too late'.

decree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has finally signed a decree spelling out
limited privatisation plans for the country's lucrative oil industry, giving
foreigners the right to acquire up to 15 per cent of oil companies.
The decree on transforming oil enterprises into joint stock companies
preserves a controlling stake for the government and entitles workers
primarily to non-voting shares. The decree creates a trust called Rosneft to
manage the state's stakes in most oil enterprises. It in turn enables
Rosneft to delegate management responsibilities to unspecified commercial
structures, presumably be run by the enterprises' existing managers. Three
vertically-integrated holding companies, whose operations will range from
oil wells to petrol pumps, will absorb the rest of the enterprises.
The three are Lukoil, the country's first vertically-integrated company,
Surgut and Yukos. Shares will begin to be sold off both in enterprises
within the Rosneft orbit and the three holding companies to outside
investors next year. Details of these sales however have yet to be
finalised.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, announced that the
government would soon lower export tariffs for oil from Ecu30 (Pounds 24.20)
to 22 a tonne, while his colleague, Mr Peter Aven, the foreign economic
relations minister, said it would press ahead with plans to recentralise
exports to get a better grip on hard currency revenues.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean group seeks joint
venture partners

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CODELCO, THE state-owned Chilean copper corporation, is seeking joint
ventures with mining multinationals to explore four of its mining prospects.
Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's planning director, said he would invite 20 mining
companies this week to study the projects on offer. Two are copper deposits
in the Atacama desert, and two are gold prospects close to La Coipa and El
Hueso, gold mines already in operation.
Mr Bande said these were the first of several prospects Codelco wanted to
explore as joint-ventures, following the passage of recent legislation that
authorised the state-owned company to forge partnerships with the private
sector.
Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, owns about a third of the
registered mining property in Chile. Its exploration work, however, has been
limited by budget constraints dictated by the finance ministry. Mr Bande
sees the joint-ventures as a way of tapping the vast mineral potential that
Codelco is unable to develop on its own.
'We are opening a whole field of exploration that was previously closed to
the private-sector mining industry,' Mr Bande said. 'It will also allow
Codelco to share the risk of exploration ventures.'
Mr Bande did not name the mining companies that had been selected to
consider the first four mining prospects. He would only say that they were
companies already established in Chile with active exploration projects.
They are being invited to bid for risk contracts.
Codelco will effectively be a sleeping partner: it will offer its mining
properties, while the partner will be responsible for meeting the costs of
exploration work. This, Mr Bande said, would give Codelco's partners the
right to acquire a share of the mining property if the deposits were judged
to be worthy of commercial exploitation.
Several mining multinationals in Chile have expressed an interest in teaming
up with Codelco for exploration work. Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia,
which operates the huge La Escondida copper mine in the Atacama desert,
recently opened its offices for South America in Santiago. It has earmarked
Dollars 3m a year for prospecting projects in Latin America, just under half
of which will be spent in Chile. Mr Jose Cabello, BHP's explorations
manager, said he hoped his company would be included in Codelco's list of
potential partners.
Placer Dome and Falconbridge of Canada are also locating their exploration
headquarters for Latin America in Santiago, supporting Chile's claim to
being the top country for mining exploration in the region.

resume buying

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS PRODUCER and consumer members of the International Natural Rubber
Organisation continue discussions here on whether or not to proceed with a
new international rubber agreement, Inro's buffer stock manager has said
that he might have to resume buying shortly in order to stop a further slide
in prices.
Mr Aldo Hofmeister said that with the industrialised economies still facing
difficulties there was little sign of a pick up in rubber demand in the
short term. 'With additional production and with no increase in offtake by
consumers it could develop to a point where I could intervene,' said Mr
Hofmeister.
Inro last purchased rubber stocks in October and now has stockpiles of more
than 160,000 tonnes. Market analysts say that if prices do not rise sharply
in the next month a downward revision of Inro's buffer stock reference price
is inevitable early in the new year. The reference price, which reflects
production and market conditions, determines when the Inro buffer stock
manager should buy or sell rubber. Analaysts expect a 5 per cent cut in the
price to be made at a further Inro meeting in January.
The present meeting here of the Inro council, dominated by discussions on a
new International Natural Rubber Agreement, is due to end tomorrow.

The PLATINUM price rose Dollars 2.50 yesterday to Dollars 360.25 a troy
ounce, reaching the highest point for three weeks and widening still further
its premium over the GOLD price, which was up only 40 cents at Dollars
334.45 an ounce. Dealers said platinum had run up on the back of a six-day
rally in Japanese stocks, fresh violence in South Africa over the weekend
and hopes that recent signs of a US economic upturn would be confirmed by
data this week. But it lacked the momentum to break through resistance in
the Dollars 360/Dollars 362 area. Trading on the London Metal Exchange was
active with markets ending mixed after retreating from highs. Dealers said
profit-taking, hedge selling and technical sales crept in from midday
onwards, attracted by the extent and the speed of the recent rally. London
COCOA futures ended with extended losses, depressed by long liquidation of
prompt December contracts before that position became tenderable today.
March cocoa ended at Pounds 727 a tonne, down Pounds 10.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina to woo mining
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA WILL shortly be putting forward a new draft law to encourage
foreign investment in the mining industry, probably this week.
Mr Erman Gonzalez, the defence minister, said in an interview that the law
would be along the lines of the Houston Plan, which has opened up
Argentina's oil industry to foreign capital. The defence ministry is closely
involved in the government's plans to liberalise Argentina's industry and
natural resources because these sectors were previously under state control,
partly for military reasons.
Mr Gonzalez said the new law would grant investors a ten-year tax holiday
and eliminate curbs on foreign capital. He added, however, that the state
would preserve a stake in the country's mineral reserves to retain a measure
of control.
Although Argentina's mineral assets are thought to be considerable , there
has so far been little exploration activity because of the high level of
state control and inadequate infrastructure.
One feature of the new mining law will permit companies to deduct any money
spent on environmental protection from corporation tax payments.
Mr Gonzalez also confirmed that the first stage in the privatisation of YPF,
the state oil company, would begin in the first quarter of next year. The
government will retain 20 per cent of the company for itself.
Argentina is also in the process of privatising the domestic gas
distribution network. Bids are due in by the end of the year. So far, 21
companies have expressed an interest, many of them foreign.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox tries to dig itself out of
a hole - London's troubled soft commodities exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOX HAS proved to be a singularly inappropriate acronym for the Futures and
Options Exchange, which trades London's soft commodity contracts.
Far from showing the traditional cunning of its namesake, London Fox appears
to have loped off in totally the wrong direction. In the year to the end of
last March the exchange reported a loss of Pounds 691,000 on revenues of
Pounds 10m, largely because of the property futures debacle in September
1991, which led to exceptional costs of just under Pounds 1m. A round of job
cuts followed in May.
The boom years of the 1980s, when volumes soared on the London Metal
Exchange and Liffe, passed London Fox by. It made pioneering, but ill-fated
attempts to boost volume through contracts - including property futures - on
a screen-based trading system.
Now the only survivor on the screen trading system is ironically the first
contract launched on it - white sugar, which trades up to 1,500 lots a day.
Contracts for rice, rubber, arabica coffee and a base metals index all
failed. The raw sugar contract, which on one day last week traded a mere 15
lots, was switched from floor to screen and back to the floor again in just
12 months.
Such a scatter-gun approach to the markets was 'an absolute disaster',
admitted Mr Michael Jenkins, the chief executive of Liffe who became
chairman of Fox earlier this year. But he dismissed as 'pretty small' the
effect of the property futures fiasco, which led to the Securities and
Futures Association fining five brokers up to Pounds 80,000 each for
creating a false impression of investor interest in the market.
'It undoubtedly damaged morale at the exchange and it left a nasty taste in
the mouth. . . but I don't think people stayed away because they could not
trust the market,' he said.
However, it did fundamentally change the direction of the exchange away from
innovation towards a re-examination of its central business, according to Mr
Robin Woodhead, the chief executive who started work at the beginning of
October. He replaced Mr Phillip Thorpe, deputy chief executive of the SFA,
who took over on a temporary basis when Mr Mark Blundell and Mr Saxon Tate
resigned over the property futures affair.
There is little doubt that the appointments of Mr Jenkins and Mr Woodhead,
who played a central role in setting up London's International Petroleum
Exchange, are seen as the best chance for a long time to put Fox back on the
right course. 'It's good news,' said one trader. 'They are two very
experienced people. If they can't get it going we might as well all pack up
and go home.'
Mr Woodhead plans to revive Fox's fortunes by focussing on the core
contracts. He believes its activities fall into two areas - the traditional
cocoa, coffee and sugar of the old London Commodities Exchange, and the
small volume contracts of the former Baltic Futures Exchange, which merged
with Fox last year.
'People have lost sight of the fact that some of the existing contracts are
doing extremely well,' he said, pointing out that the London cocoa contract
set the international benchmark prices for the industry.
'The Baltic contracts came over to Fox just before the changes that took
place in senior management so very little attempt has been made to evaluate
and analyse what potential they have,' he said. The contracts include
freight futures, grains and potatoes.
Both Mr Woodhead and Mr Jenkins pointed out that several reviews of the
exchange by consultants basically gave it a clean bill of health. But they
agreed that Fox had some big problems - most obviously in the raw sugar and
agricultural contracts. 'In the medium term I think we feel there is room
for agricultural futures to be traded in Europe and that Fox is the only
exchange that has ambitions in this direction,' said Mr Jenkins.
'The Gatt discussions and the impact they have on the CAP (the European
Community's common agricultural policy) won't of themselves produce a lot
more free trade immediately,' said Mr Woodhead. 'But they do indicate that
the trend is against intervention and that must be to the benefit of the
futures markets.'
Raw sugar could prove a bigger problem. London used to set the international
benchmark price, but that role has been taken over by the relatively young
New York market, which attracts a lot of speculative money. Critics have
blamed London's decline in the raws trade on the failed experiment in screen
trading, but Mr Jenkins believes the decline took place over a decade,
mainly because of underlying changes in the physical market. 'I think Fox
frankly took its eye off the ball,' he said.
The London raw contract was designed with British Commonwealth producers in
mind, said Mr Woodhead. But there had been a fundamental change in the way
raws were traded, with much more sugar coming out of the Far East and South
America. At the same time the number of big sugar traders in London had
declined significantly.
Nonetheless, both men felt sugar trading would continue at Fox. 'We are
urgently looking at what we should do but we haven't come to a conclusion,'
said Mr Jenkins.
Other problems with which they will have to get to grips include a sharp
decline in robusta coffee futures trading (although options volume is well
up); the fall from 22 in 1990 to just five locals (traders who buy and sell
for their own account); and the fact that the exchange lost its marketing
department during the summer job cuts.
Fox still has more than 60 members and has recently had inquiries from
potential newcomers. Mr Woodhead is keen to re-establish contact with
members and to discuss ways of increasing their business activity on the
exchange. But he is also well aware of the changing nature of the
commodities business.
He pointed out that when a big member like Drexel Burnham Lambert or
Woodhouse Drake &amp; Carey disappeared, the capital that was supporting them
was also lost to the market. However, the development of over-the-counter
business was bringing new capital into the market and big financial groups
that had given commodities a wide berth in the past were now looking at ways
of providing a complete derivative brokerage service, he said.
Mr Woodhead also believes it is all too easy to write off futures exchanges.
'At various times in the last 10 years all of the London futures exchanges
have been described as being about to close. Notwithstanding the problems
over the property contracts, one must remember that the traditional London
Fox commodities are trading at extensive cyclical lows,' he said. 'One has
to see the potential for the exchange in the light of that trend. So don't
write us off yet.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts fall as hopes fade for further
reduction in UK interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOND prices fell across Europe yesterday, on fears that the Bundesbank is
increasingly unlikely to cut interest rates this year, perpetuating
volatility in the foreign exchange markets, as other European currencies in
the exchange rate mechanism come under pressure.
But gilts were not helped by the floating pound yesterday. Prices dropped as
much as  3/4 point, as signs of a potential economic recovery prompted
concern that the UK government may not feel the need to cut interest rates
any further.
The M0 money supply figure for November showed a 3 per cent year-on-year
growth. Because there is a strong correlation between M0 (the narrowest
definition of money supply) and retail sales, 'the government will view that
as a sign that retail sales are starting to pick up,' said Mr John Kendall,
an economist at Baring Brothers.
The gilt market's main fear is that the scope for further rate cuts may have
narrowed, while inflation is more likely to rise.
Although the market took fright, it may be too early to read much into the
figures. The key will be how much sales rise over the Christmas period, Mr
Kendall said.
Meanwhile, traders remain nervous ahead of Wednesday's auction of Pounds
2.5bn of 10-year gilts. In when-issued trading, the new partly-paid 10-year
issue was quoted yesterday at 21 17/32 , down from 24 when it was announced
a week ago.
The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 98 1/32 down from 98.
THE German market had to absorb more bad economic news yesterday, when
engineering orders fell 17 per cent month-on-month in October, led by a 20
per cent decline in foreign orders, reflecting the impact of the strong
mark.
German bond prices held up better than most, however, ending about  1/4
point down. However, money market rates rose sharply, when call money jumped
up to 9 per cent from 8.7 per cent.
RISING rates in the German money market fed through into the French market,
where three-month rates rose to 10.2 per cent. Bond prices fell  3/8 point,
on fears that the franc is set to come under renewed pressure.
Sentiment in the Italian bond market is not set to favour an auction of
Italian government bonds today.
US Treasury prices recovered from early weakness to stand mixed-to-firmer in
late trading yesterday despite the release of another strong economic
report.
In late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/16 at 100 13/32 ,
yielding 7.585 per cent. The short end of the market was little moved, with
the two-year note steady at 99 11/32 , yielding 4.774 per cent.
Early hopes that prices would trade firmer in the wake of last week's heavy
selling were dashed mid-morning when the Chicago purchasing managers
reported that their index of local manufacturing activity had risen from
49.72 in October to 54.22 in November. The Chicago figures were seen as a
precursor to a strong report from the National Association of Purchasing
Management, which publishes its index of nationwide business activity today.
Although the Chicago report initially left Treasuries slightly lower,
bargain-buying by retail investors helped securities at both ends of the
maturity range recover their early losses.

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Bonds: UK announces launch of Dollars 3bn,
10-year Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government last night announced the launch of a Dollars 3bn, 10-year
Eurobond, the largest international dollar bond issue and the final leg of
the government's Ecu10bn foreign currency borrowing programme which was
announced on September 3.
The proceeds will go towards the foreign exchange reserves and will be used
to repay short-term indebtedness incurred at the time of the sterling
crisis. The bond is expected to be priced to give a yield of between 22-25
basis points over the comparable 10-year US Treasury bond, which the Bank of
England said represents 'very fine pricing'.
S. G. Warburg Securities, one of the lead managers, said: 'The pricing
reflects a balance between the large size of the deal on the one hand and
the triple A credit (of the borrower) on the other.'
Credit Suisse First Boston and S. G. Warburg Securities are joint lead
managers and 28 other banks have been invited to join the syndicate.
Book-building started in the Far East last night and will continue today.
Pricing is expected to take place today or tomorrow.
The government's foreign currency borrowing consists of an Ecu5bn revolving
credit facility, a DM5bn five-year bond issue, and the Dollars 3bn 10-year
bond issue.
The Bank said the government was not contemplating any further issues under
the programme although if it is able to refinance the existing bank credit
facility at more favourable terms it will probably do so.
Credit Local de France yesterday became the second borrower to raise funds
using the ratchet collared floater, a new species introduced to the bond
market by Morgan Stanley International last week. The bank said it launched
the Dollars 100m five-year issue on the strength of demand for the first, a
Dollars 150m five-year issue for Rabobank Nederland last Friday.
Morgan describes the structure as an enhanced floating rate note, the
interest rate on which can never go down. The thinking is to take advantage
of interest in FRNs from investors who are positive about the dollar, but
concerned that US interest rates, while rising, could fall in the medium
term.
Morgan argues it has taken away the downside risk, and the only limit to the
upside is that interest rate rises are limited to a maximum of 25 basis
points every three months. Morgan says this innovation has the potential to
be as large as the collared floater market, but critics say the structure is
too complicated and most investors are sceptical of missing any rise in
interest rates.
Meanwhile, the Republic of Turkey launched a Y70bn samurai bond in Japan, as
part of its strategy to improve the currency composition and maturity
structure of its debt, to improve the balance between syndicated loans and
fixed-rate paper and to increase the investor base for Turkish risk.
The bond, led by Yamaichi Securities, is divided into two tranches, one with
a four-year maturity and the other six years. The platform for this latest
issue was the triple-B rating gained from Standard and Poor's in May.
Turkey's debt was Dollars 50.9bn at end-June. Of the total, 37 per cent is
at variable interest rates and the rest is fixed.
Bankers say the pricing on this issue is expected to be tight, making it
difficult to sell to institutional investors. But the success of Y50bn five
and seven-year bonds in June and September respectively suggests the
appetite among Japanese retail investors is strong. Mr Masayaki Kanayama of
Sanwa Bank in London said the market expects institutional and retail
investors to take up the four-year tranche and retail investors to buy the
six-year tranche.
The republic has already issued Dollars 899m worth of bonds in 1992,
compared with syndicated loans of Dollars 349m. In May, Paribas was lead
manager on Turkey's Ecu bond, a Dollars 185m-equivalent three-year exercise.
Commerzbank arranged a DM400m seven-year bond issue in July. Also in July,
the Treasury arranged a Dollars 250m Yankee bond issue.
When the samurai issues are included, Turkey is projected to be a net
borrower on the international capital markets in 1992, despite its original
target to be a net repayer. Debt repayments are estimated at Dollars 1.9bn
in the second half of this year. Public debt repayments are officially
projected to peak in 1995 at Dollars 4.6bn.
Due to these new borrowings and the adverse exchange rate movements which
are estimated to have added Dollars 2.3bn to the debt stock in the first
half of 1992, total debt is projected to reach between Dollars 53bn by the

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors place resources in
emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors have continued to put extra resources into following
emerging markets over the past year, although the flow of investment into
these markets has slowed markedly, according to a recent survey,
In its fourth annual survey of 30 leading international investors, Kleiman
International Consultants, based in Washington, found that allocation to
developing markets rose by 0.5 percentage points to 10 per cent in 1992,
after a 2 percentage point rise the previous year. In the past four years,
portfolio allocation has quadrupled.
The survey's respondents noted that over the past 12 months an increasing
number of conservative pension and Erisa funds have committed a small
percentage of funds to emerging markets, generally not more than 2 to 5 per
cent of their total international allocation.
At more than half the institutions, the emerging markets department was now
an 'accepted part' of institutional culture.
Investors are still concerned by the regulatory environment and settlement
difficulties in some markets. Mexico was voted as the best supervised and
most transparent of the emerging markets. Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela, India
and Pakistan were cited as continuing problem areas. Brazil and Venezuela
were also viewed as the most difficult markets for settlement.

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Banamex hopes to raise
Dollars 350m from debt issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANAMEX, one of the leading banks in Mexico, is hoping to raise more than
Dollars 350m with an unusual convertible debt issue. The deal, which is one
of the largest convertible debt issues from an emerging market, will prove
an important test of investor appetite for Mexican paper, given that
conditions for Latin American equity and bond issues have been difficult
recently.
Banamex - otherwise known as Banco Nacional de Mexico - is issuing Dollars
350m of seven-year subordinated exchangeable debentures which can be
exchanged into shares in Banacci, the quoted Mexican holding company which
owns Banamex.
The deal, which was due to be priced last night or today, will probably be
split with around Dollars 250m for international investors and Dollars 100m
for domestic investors.
The debentures are expected to pay interest of about 7 to 7.5 per cent.
International investors with an interest in Latin American issues are
expected to watch this issue closely given the recent difficulties
experienced by Latin American names in the equity and bond markets.
The steep drop in the Mexican stock market in the summer forced Banacci to
abandon its Dollars 1.4bn equity offering in June, and several other Mexican
names which had hoped to raise new money with international share offerings
have had to shelve their plans.
In the international bond markets, fears of oversupply forced yields on
Latin American issues to widen considerably.
Investment bankers are wondering whether the structure of the Banamex
subordinated exchangeable debenture, for which Goldman Sachs is lead
manager, will prove more successful in wooing back investors.
Banacci is hoping to obtain a listing on the New York Stock Exchange next
year and has not ruled out the possibility of launching a global equity
offering once market conditions improve, according to investment bankers.

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Bonds: French bank uses new structure to
launch Dollars 100m paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Local de France yesterday became the second borrower to raise funds
using the ratchet collared floater, a new species introduced to the bond
market by Morgan Stanley International last week. The bank said it launched
the Dollars 100m five-year issue on the strength of demand for the first, a
Dollars 150m five-year issue for Rabobank Nederland last Friday.
Morgan describes the structure as an enhanced floating rate note, the
interest rate on which can never go down. The thinking is to take advantage
of interest in FRNs from investors who are positive about the dollar, but
concerned that US interest rates, while rising, could fall in the medium
term.
Morgan argues it has taken away the downside risk, and the only limit to the
upside is that interest rate rises are limited to a maximum of 25 basis
points every three months. Morgan says this innovation has the potential to
be as large as the collared floater market, but critics say the structure is
too complicated and most investors are sceptical of missing any rise in
interest rates.
Meanwhile, the Republic of Turkey launched a Y70bn samurai bond in Japan, as
part of its strategy to improve the currency composition and maturity
structure of its debt, to improve the balance between syndicated loans and
fixed-rate paper and to increase the investor base for Turkish risk. Bankers
also note the samurai market has been providing more attractive financing
for sovereign borrowers than the Euroyen market.
The bond, led by Yamaichi Securities, is divided into two tranches, one with
a four-year maturity and the other six years. This is the republic's third
venture this year into the samurai market and follows moves into Yankee and
Ecu bond markets. The platform for this latest issue was the triple-B rating
gained from Standard and Poor's in May.
Turkey's debt was Dollars 50.9bn at end-June. Of the total, 37 per cent is
at variable interest rates and the rest is fixed.
Bankers say the pricing on this issue is expected to be tight, making it
difficult to sell to institutional investors. But success of Y50bn five and
seven-year bonds in June and September respectively suggests the appetite
among Japanese retail investors is strong. Mr Masayaki Kanayama of Sanwa
Bank in London said the market expects institutional and retail investors to
take up the four-year tranche, and retail investors to buy the six-year
tranche.
The republic has already issued Dollars 899m worth of bonds in 1992,
compared with syndicated loans of Dollars 349m. In May, Paribas was lead
manager on Turkey's Ecu bond, a Dollars 185m-equivalent three-year exercise.
Commerzbank arranged a DM400m seven-year bond issue in July. Also in July,
the Treasury arranged a Dollars 250m Yankee bond issue.
When the samurai issues are included, Turkey is projected to be a net
borrower on the international capital markets in 1992, despite its original
target to be a net repayer. Debt repayments are estimated at Dollars 1.9bn
in the second half of this year. Public debt repayments are officially
projected to peak in 1995 at Dollars 4.6bn.
Due to these new borrowings and the adverse exchange rate movements which
are estimated to have added Dollars 2.3bn to the debt stock in the first
half of 1992, total debt is projected to reach between Dollars 53bn by the
year end. This is a net increase of more than Dollars 4bn over 1991.
Elsewhere, bankers described as rather optimistic suggestions from Romania
that it might follow the reopening of its domestic bond market after 45
years by tapping the Eurobond market as early as 1993. S&amp;P said the debt
rating for Hungary, the only eastern European country so far to have its
debt rated, is below investment grade at BB+.
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has set an Ecu900m
borrowing programme for next year.
The bank has so far raised Ecu865m of this year's Ecu900m programme, at
economic funding levels. With an average maturity of seven years, the bank's
average cost of funds, after swapping the proceeds of its borrowings, was
better than 40 basis points below the London interbank offered rate.
Mr Rene Karsenti, the EBRD's treasurer, agreed it would be 'difficult' to
achieve the same cost of funds next year, but said the triple-A rated bank
'may benefit from the flight to quality' by bond investors.
The bank's policy is to borrow a minimum of 45 per cent of projected
requirements for cash disbursements over the next three years.
The money raised is invested in liquid assets, pending disbursement.

BOND Corporation, former flagship of Australian entrepreneur Mr Alan Bond,
yesterday changed its name to Southern Equities Corp, and gently raised
creditors hopes.
Mr Ian Ferrier, joint administrator, said he was optimistic that the company
could raise sufficient funds to meet a repayment to creditors due before the
end of the year, forestalling liquidation.
Mr Ferrier, who has been administrator of a scheme of arrangement at the
former Bond Corp. since late 1991, nearly a year after Mr Bond was forced to
resign as chairman, told the annual meeting in Perth that the company's
future depended on its ability to realise assets quickly.
The company's main asset is a damages claim against the West Australian
government over a failed petrochemical plant. Other assets include property
around Perth.
Meanwhile, the Federal Court in Sydney has brought down a judgment which
could give the trustee of Mr Bond's superannuation fund access to the assets
of the fund. It court found in favour of the fund's trustee, Mr Robert
Ramsay, who had sought access to the fund, Investors Retirement Fund, on
behalf of creditors.
Shares in joint venture companies in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New
Guinea (PNG), were heavily sold off on Australian stock exchanges yesterday
after weekend news that the PNG government was seeking increased equity in
the operation.
The mine is owned 30 per cent each by Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields
Consolidated and Highlands Gold, but PNG's prime minister, Mr Paias Wingti,
has stated he intends to lift the government's equity from 10 to 30 per
cent. Shares in all three Australian listed partners hit lows for the year,
with Placer shares down 18 cents to ADollars 1.27, Renison off 18 cents to
ADollars 2.71 and Highlands losing 16 cents to ADollars 75 cents.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITOMAN, the scandal-tainted Japanese trading house, reported a pre-tax loss
of Y8.5bn (Dollars 68.5m) for the first half as its executives yesterday
signed a merger agreement with the Sumitomo group that will dissolve the
company in March.
The trading house, which made a profit of Y1.5bn for the six months to
September, said sales fell 10.2 per cent to Y265bn, while a Y39.7bn
provision for loan losses led to an after-tax loss of Y48.6bn.
Itoman, founded in 1883, is the best-known company to fall victim to the
collapse of Japan's financial bubble. The company was undermined by a
mid-1980s diversification into stock and property speculation, and by
massive purchases of art works whose prices also plunged.
The provision for loan losses is to cover loans to Itoman Finance and a
string of other, financially-troubled, subsidiaries which were the vehicles
for some of the company's unwise excursions into the resort market and
property-related lending.
For the full year, Itoman's last year of existence, the company expects
sales of Y540bn, down 6.3 per cent, and a pre-tax loss of Y17bn, against a
profit of Y1.5bn last year.
More write-offs and provisions will lead to an after-tax loss of Y90bn,
following a profit last year of Y23.4bn.
At the close of the year, Itoman will be absorbed by Sumikin Bussan, a metal
trader and a member of the Sumitomo group, which has taken responsibility
for cleaning up the mess at the trading house. Itoman still has an extensive
international network, and is strong in Asian trade in food, textiles and
machinery, providing the unlisted Sumikin with a far broader business base.
Under the agreement signed yesterday, five Itoman shares will be swapped for
one Sumikin share, and the Sumitomo company will take control of all Itoman
employees in March.
In the meantime, Itoman will attempt to sell its Osaka headquarters to cover
some of its outstanding debts and those of its ailing subsidiaries.
Sumikin Bussan is an affiliate of Sumitomo Metal Industries, a core company
of the Sumitomo keiretsu, or corporate group. Sumitomo Bank was a lender to
Itoman, and had transferred staff to the trading house during the era of
excess in the late 1980s and, later, in a vain attempt to salvage the
debt-stricken company.
At the height of its speculative life in 1990, Itoman was estimated to have
outstanding debts of Y1,300bn, and the troubles at the trading house were a
cause of the fall of Mr Ichiro Isoda, forced to resign that year as the
chairman of Sumitomo Bank.

AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa (ABSA), South Africa's largest banking
group, yesterday announced a 14 per cent advance in net earnings to R293.8m
(Dollars 97m) for the six months to September, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
Earnings per share rose from 45.4 cents to 51.9 cents, and the bank is
stepping up its interim dividend from 15.5 cents to 17 cents a share.
ABSA was formed in 1991 when United Building Society, the country's largest
building society group, acquired the assets of three major banking groups -
Allied Group, Volkskas Group and Sage Financial Services.
Earlier this year, ABSA acquired Bankorp Holdings (Bankorp), another South
African bank, for R1.3bn.
Absa said a year-on-year comparison of income was completely comparable as
the September 1992 results took into account the contributions of Bankorp.
Mr Herc Hefer, chairman, said the group was expected to continue to perform
satis-factorily in the current six months, even though no significant
economic recovery was anticipated.
Group bad debt provisions increased 91 per cent to R420.1m at September. The
increase came from the application of provisions for all advances acquired
through the Bankorp merger and the prolonged recession, Mr Hefer said.

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Indian group launches global
equity offering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GRASIM Industries, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre manufacturer, has
launched a Dollars 90m global depositary share offering. It is the second
Indian company to tap the international equity markets this year, and a
stream of other Indian names are expected to launch international offerings
in the coming months.
Grasim's share offering has had a bumpy start. The deal was originally
scheduled for June, but lead managers Citicorp and Merrill Lynch were forced
to pull the issue as the unfolding drama of the Indian financial scandal
halted trading on the Bombay stock exchange. The Bombay exchange remained
shut for several days, and the lead managers said they were reluctant to
proceed with the issue during the traditionally quiet summer months.
In addition, some international investors expressed annoyance at the way in
which Reliance Industries, the first Indian company to tap the capital
markets, conducted its international offering in May. Shares in Reliance
suffered a sharp fall after the global offering, and many investors were
annoyed when Reliance increased the size of the issue from Dollars 100m to
Dollars 150m, as this reduced the opportunities for investors to make gains.
Grasim priced its offering on Friday at Dollars 12.98 per GDS - representing
one share with a nominal value of Rs10 - and at a discount of 18 per cent to
the price of Grasim shares trading in Bombay. Citicorp said it was quoting
the shares at Dollars 13.00 to Dollars 13.25 yesterday, compared with a
trading price in Bombay equivalent to Dollars 15.09.
The issue has been sold mainly to emerging market funds run from the US,
London and Hong Kong, and to wealthy non-resident Indian investors.
Grasim, which is part of the Birla group, will use the proceeds to help
expand its viscose staple fibre and cement operations.

<TEXT>
LIEM Sioe Liong, controller of Indonesia's biggest business group, is
teaming up with Singapore government companies to develop an industrial park
in China.
The first phase, costing an estimated Dollars 190m, should be completed by
early 1994.
Mr Liem heads the Salim group, a conglomerate with an estimated annual
turnover of more than Dollars 8bn. The group is involved in a range of
activities, from cement to property.
He will team up with two Singapore state companies, Singapore Technologies
Industrial Corp and Jurong Environmental Engineering, to develop, supervise
and market the industrial park. It is situated in Fujian province, on
China's coast.
Two of Singapore's biggest listed companies, United Industrial Corp (UIC)
and its subsidiary, Singapore Land, are involved in the project.
Also participating is Mr Wee Cho Yaw, head of United Overseas Bank (UOB),
one of the island republic's top banks.
Mr Liem has had a controlling stake in UIC since 1991. Earlier this year he
sold a 9 per cent stake in UIC to the UOB. Mr Liem has been actively
pursuing projects in several Asian countries and has a considerable
financial presence in Singapore.
Singapore has recently been urging its generally cash-rich companies to be
more outward looking and invest overseas, particularly in China's
fast-expanding economy.
The Singapore government's Economic Development Board (EDB) said the Fujian
province industrial park would attract light and medium industries from
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, as well as multinational
corporations.
The EDB added that the park would provide investors with a low-cost
manufacturing centre for exports and a base for sales into China's growing
domestic market.

PETROLEOS Mexicanos, Mexico's state-owned oil company, has signed a Dollars

Bankers say the financing, led by ANZ International Merchant Banking and

financing facility this year led by Chase Manhattan.
The maximum margin of the new facility - to finance the import or to
prefinance exports of oil products - is 7/8 - point over London interbank
offered rates (Libor). The borrower can also use the sterling bankers'
acceptance market, which might mean below Libor funding if swapped into

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Aluminium producer sees its
future in cars - The new chairman of Reynolds Metals explains his strategy
to Kenneth Gooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEERING his company towards more business from the carmakers is a top
priority for Mr Richard Holder, new chairman of Reynolds Metals, the
second-largest US aluminium company.
It is conceivable, he says, that by the end of the decade Reynolds'
transportation business, which generates a turnover of about Dollars 500m a
year, will be as big as the group's packaging operations are today - and
they bring in about Dollars 2.5bn.
'Sure, there is a big question mark about how much aluminium is going to be
used in cars.
'But even a conservative forecast says to us that in five years the average
will be 350lb of aluminium per car (in the US), up from 170lb last year,' Mr
Holder points out.
If the motor industry decides to make substantial numbers of cars from
extruded aluminium space frames - skeleton-like structures - or starts to
use aluminium for body panels, the 350lb a vehicle estimate will be left far
behind.
Reynolds recently gave the go-ahead for a Dollars 26m plant at Auburn,
Indiana, where it will produce aluminium extruded components for the motor
industry - components such as bumper systems, door intrusion beams and
sunroof tracks.
Mr Holder points out that Reynolds will make a better return on its
aluminium by producing such components.
The company has 28 automotive-related plants around the world, and
technology to be used at the Auburn plant was developed in the Netherlands.
As part of the scramble by aluminium companies world-wide to prepare for the
motor industry boom, Reynolds in April signed an agreement on joint
automotive research with Mitsubishi Aluminium and Sumitomo Light Metal
Industries of Japan.
Mr Holder has been with Reynolds for 39 years. He was chief operating
officer from 1986, so his appointment as chairman and chief executive in
succession to Mr Bill Bourke, who retired in April, was expected.
He and his board have acted swiftly to sharpen the focus on Reynolds' core
operations.
Before he had settled in the chairman's seat, the Eskimo Pie ice cream
business (acquired from a bankrupt customer in the distant past) had been
sold.
Alrelco, which supplies secondary (scrap) aluminium to automotive die
casters, was put up for sale and the aluminium cable operations sold to
BICC, the international cables and construction group. The latter deal
included a provision for Reynolds to supply BICC with competitively-priced
aluminium rod for 15 years.
Mr Holder says that, 'at the right price,' Reynolds' gold business and its
property development division would also be sold.
Reynolds now has the capacity to generate about two-thirds of the aluminium
it needs from its own plants and that is enough for now, according to Mr
Holder.
'We would rather put our investment dollars strategically into end-use
markets where margins (of profit) are higher,' he says.
Reynolds and Mitsubishi of Japan have quietly shelved an aluminium smelter
project in Venezuela, but the US group is still committed to providing
technical assistance for a smelter which is being built in Nigeria.
That project is making slow progress because the Nigerian government, which
is financing the scheme, is short of cash.
Mr Holder suggests there is still plenty of growth left in the packaging
business.
In the US, aluminium has virtually replaced steel for canned fizzy drinks,
but growth will come from increasing use of aluminium in other areas of the
packaging market.
Outside the US, the aluminium beverage can revolution has only just begun.
Reynolds also expects to win more international business for its other
packaging products.
The group's Reynolds Wrap aluminium foil has nearly 100 per cent retail
distribution in the US, and at the end of the 1980s the group capitalised on
this by acquiring more packaging companies.
Mr Holder says that, now these have been successfully digested, more
packaging purchases are on the cards.
Mr Holder has taken over at a time when Reynolds is battling through a
severe recession in the industry. But, he points out, Reynolds is in far
better shape than in the last recession at the begining of the 1980s.
His predecessor, Mr Bourke, was recruited from Ford Motor to overhaul
Reynolds.
The company shut down three high-cost US aluminium smelters, bauxite mines
in Jamaica and Arkansas, and the workforce was cut by one-third to 27,000
(subsequent acquisitions took it back to 31,000). That rationalisation cost
Dollars 600m.
Reynolds recently completed a Dollars 3bn, five-year capital spending
programme, which, among other things, gave it a great deal of low-cost
aluminium smelting capacity in Canada.
Mr Holder says the group will spend an average of Dollars 300m to Dollars
400m annually over the next three years, 'depending on the way the economy
is going.'
Reynolds aims to be 'cash neutral', if possible - to cover expenditure by
internally-generated funds - and to keep its debt-to-equity ratio in the
'low 30s.'
Mr Bourke set Reynolds a target of a 20 per cent return on equity, averaged
over the economic cycle.
Mr Holder, an aluminium rather than a motor industry man, says the new board
has yet to set a target, but '15 per cent is probably more realistic.'

lenders

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PWA, parent of Canada's second-biggest airline, has halted payments to
lenders and has sent teams as far as Tokyo to try to sell a full
restructuring plan.
PWA said its fully-owned Canadian Airlines International would continue to
operate as usual and travellers would not be affected. Operating suppliers
and trade accounts would continue to be paid, as would fuel taxes and its
17,000 employees.
Canadian is in a battle for survival with its rival, Air Canada. The two
carriers are losing about CDollars 2m (USDollars 1.6m) a day between them.
'We are confident creditors will see the advantages of our plan,' said Mr
Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman. 'We will emerge a stronger and more effective
global competitor'.
PWA has received a CDollars 50m federal loan guarantee following Ottawa's
acquisition of three Airbus 310 aircraft from Canadian Airlines. Executive
pay has been cut 20 per cent, fares raised by 5 per cent, and nearly
CDollars 15m in annual interest costs have been saved through conversion of
debt to equity.
American Airlines, itself going through a round of lay-offs, earlier offered
to buy 25 per cent of PWA for CDollars 246m if Canadian switched to its
Sabre reservations system.
However, a statement from PWA made no mention of an equity deal. 'We will
soon announce details of the partnership with American, a significant
marketing alliance,' it said.
Under revised bankruptcy laws, PWA has six months to win agreement from its

<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL, the financial services subsidiary of General Electric Company of
the US, is acquiring the over-the-road trailer leasing business of
Transamerica, a west coast-based financial services conglomerate.
The deal involves the purchase of around 19,000 Transamerica Leasing units,
valued at about Dollars 200m, by Transport International Pool, part of GE
Capital.
GE Capital said yesterday that this would take TIP's fleet size to around
62,000 units.
It would also 'increase GE Capital's investment in the highly diversified
and profitable asset management segment of its portfolio.'
Transamerica said the transaction would allow it to focus on 'established'
product lines, and on certain new businesses which it is trying to build up,
including over-the-road trailer leasing in Europe.
Its Transamerica Leasing subsidiary is based in White Plains, New York
State, and leases transportation equipment ranging from containers and
chassis to rail trailers.
Fluor, the US engineering and construction services group, has approved a
plan to divest its lead business, Doe Run Co. It will in future account for
the lead segment as a discontinued operation, Reuter reports. This will
result in a charge to 1992 net earnings of about Dollars 95m, including
Doe's operating loss of about Dollars 17m after tax.

charge for restructuring

<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, restaurants and snacks group, is to take a
Dollars 125m charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover the
restructuring of its domestic beverage operations, along with 'several
international operations'.
The company said the restructuring of the domestic beverage division related
primarily to the management structure there, and had already been outlined
in the quarterly filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pepsico declined to elaborate on which international operations were
involved in the overhaul.
However, it said that the annual cost-savings from these changes should be
around Dollars 150m.
The company combined news of the restructuring charge with an announcement
that it intended to adopt two non-cash accountancy changes.
These will also primarily affect earnings during the fourth quarter,
although both changes will also have a small impact on future earnings.
The first change relates to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) 106, which deals with the treatment of retirees' health benefits, and
will involve a one-off charge of Dollars 575m before tax (or Dollars 357m at
the net level, equal to 44 cents per share).
The second deals with SFAS 109, which relates to income taxes, where the
one-off charge will be in the range of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 550m
after tax, or 49 to 68 cents per share.
Pepsico said the size of the SFAS 109 charge reflected the significant
increase in intangible assets stemming from the large number of acquisitions
that the company had made recently.
In terms of 1992 operating results, SFAS 106 will decrease net income by
around 4 cents a share, while SFAS 109 will add 2 cents a share.
In 1993, the effect of SFAS 106 should be fully offset by the positive
impact of SFAS 109.
The company added that its 'earnings momentum continues to be very good',
with solid cash-flow.
Pepsico shares eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 early yesterday.

CONFEDERATION Life, Canada's third-largest life insurance company with
CDollars 26bn (USDollars 20.25bn) of assets under administration, plans to
raise CDollars 100m with a 10-year public subordinated debenture issue.
A new federal Insurance Companies Act enables mutually-owned companies to
use the public markets to raise regulatory capital.
Previously, insurance companies that were owned by their policyholders had
to use special subsidiaries in order to raise new outside capital.
Confederation Life has a relatively high exposure to property investment.
In 1991 it provided CDollars 155m for mortgage and other losses.
The new issue is rated double-A in Canada and single A-plus by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the New York-based credit ratings agency.

<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced a
reorganisation of its copper operations and said it was speeding up
rationalisation as part of a determined bid to return the unit to profit.
The group says the moves should improve Outokumpu Copper's operating profit
by FM200m (Dollars 38.91m) next year and, even if market conditions remain
tough, should get the unit back into profit from mid-year. Outokumpu Copper
is Outokumpu's largest segment and has suffered losses for the past three
years.
The streamlining, due to take effect on January 1, concentrates Outokumpu
Copper's operations on four business areas: tubes, strip, drawn products and
rolled products.
The group is also planning to scale back its operations in Spain and Sweden.
It will cut 400 staff in Spain, concentrated at Zaratamo tube plant. At
Vasteras in Sweden, lossmaking electrostrip production will be phased out.
Outokumpu Copper, which last year posted a FM497m deficit, will make another
big loss this year, aggravated by FM300m of restructuring costs in the final
four months.

FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dutch put the wraps on the
competition - The latest merger in the paper industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of Europe's second largest paper and packaging group through
the merger of three Dutch paper groups, Koninklijke KNP (KNP),
Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep, is the latest example of consolidation
within the industry.
Swedish companies have been particularly active in consolidation during the
last three years. SCA, Europe's biggest, acquired Reedpack of the UK for
Pounds 1.1bn (Dollars 1.66bn), while Stora, Europe's largest paper group,
bought Feldmuhle Nobel of Germany. Meanwhile, Kymmene of Finland acquired La
Chapelle-Darblay, France's main producer of newsprint, and Arjomari-Prioux,
the French group, merged with Wiggins Teape Appleton, the Anglo-US company.
The consolidation is being partly driven by the need to build increasingly
large plants. A world-scale competitive paper plant now has a capacity of at
least 200,000 tonnes a year and sometimes more than 300,000 tonnes, explains
Mr Denis Christie, paper, pulp and packaging analyst at James Capel. Each
100,000 tonnes of capacity costs about Pounds 100m, so competitive mills are
only available for all but the largest groups.
In addition, paper groups need to be larger to serve the entire European
market. Mr Klaas de Kluis, the chairman of VRG and future vice-chairman of
the new company, said that the group needed wide geographic coverage to meet
the servicing and distribution needs of thousands of small to medium-size
printers and other customers throughout Europe.
A more immediate trigger for yesterday's merger announcement may have been
the bleak outlook for the sector. Massive overcapacity and slowing growth
rates in most paper grades have hit European prices and margins.
The merger is also partly defensive: KNP has been the object of considerable
interest from other groups, including Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the
Franco-British company.
The three merger partners were at pains yesterday to emphasise that the
link-up would produce a powerful new Dutch industrial grouping. This will
undoubtedly prove popular in the Netherlands, where worries have arisen
recently over the sale of industrial 'crown jewels' to foreign buyers, such
as the planned sale of a 51 per cent in Fokker, the aircraft maker, to
Daimler-Benz of Germany.
The Netherlands, with its weak anti-monopoly tradition, is unlikely to raise
objections to the mooted deal. However, the attitude of the European
Commissions' merger task force will be more important and sceptical than
that of the Dutch authorities. According to some analysts, the combined
group will dominate as much as 90 per cent of the European solid board
market, used to package fruit and similar products.
The merged company will be by far the largest paper merchanting group in
Europe. It will also be Europe's biggest producer of coated papers,
inheriting the position built up by KNP in one of the fastest growing areas
of the paper market, and it will also hold commanding positions in certain
sectors of the cardboard packaging market. Europe accounts for 80 per cent
of the turnover of both BT and VRG, while 90 per cent of KNP's annual
production is sold on European markets.
The groups say they have an annual paper and packaging turnover of Fl 13bn
(Dollars 7.23bn), compared with Fl 15.3bn at Stora, Fl 10.1bn at SCA and Fl
8.2bn at Arjo Wiggins.
The company will have two businesses of roughly equal size. The first is an
industrial group bringing together KNP and Buhrmann's paper and packaging
manufacturing operations. The second is a trading and distribution group
comprising all Buhrmann and VRG's activities in the fields of graphic paper
and graphic systems distribution, as well as information systems and office
products.
However, analysts expressed concern about the strategy behind the merger.
'It doesn't seem that logical given what the groups have said in the past,'
says Mr Christie.
He says Buhrmann had always said it was an independent paper merchanting
company not tied to any one manufacturer. The concern is that other mills
would be less willing to use the new company because they were KNP's
competitors. Meanwhile, KNP appeared to have reversed its strategy of
ridding itself of its paper merchanting arm which had previously been
integrated into VRG.
A further concern is the graphic equipment business. Buhrmann sells
Heidelberg printing equipment in eight European countries, while VRG
distributes products of its main rival MAN-Roland. Mr Mads Asprem, paper
analyst at Morgan Stanley, says it is inconceivable the new company would be
able to distribute both.
Nevertheless, company officials played down suggestions that the German
groups may seek alternative agents, noting that the Dutch companies'
workforces were specially trained to install and repair the German
equipment. At the same time, Buhrmann alone sells some 30 per cent of what
Heidelberg produces, making a switch to another agent unlikely.
The main benefits of the merger will be rationalisation, say analysts. 'This
is a very bureaucratic structure. There is now a significant layer of
management which needs to be cut to achieve synergies,' says Mr Christie at
James Capel.
Mr Asprem at Morgan Stanley says, 'Given there is no sign of an immediate
turnround, the only way to improve margins is to cut costs.'
However, the groups yesterday were anxious to play down the possible
redundancies that might help them compete against the Swedish groups which
have rationalised heavily in recent years.

saving on costs

<TEXT>
BANG &amp; OLUFSEN, the manufacturer of high quality television and audio
equipment, yesterday announced a plan to cut costs and reorganise the group
in an attempt to ensure its survival.
Another 400 jobs are to go, including 80 in sales subsidiaries abroad. This
means that, by the end of the fiscal year on May 31, group employment will
be reduced by more than 20 per cent to about 2,400 from 3,143 at the end of
last year.
The measures will reduce costs by about DKr160m (Dollars 25.9m) a year. This
would allow the group to move out of the red even if sales fall back to
DKr2bn from last year's DKr2.23bn, Mr Anders Knutsen, chief executive, said.
'Many have predicted our demise, but we are still here, and we shall
continue to be here in the future as well,' he said.
A main objective of the changes is to reorganise the European sales
operation, reducing the total employed but increasing the number engaged in
active selling. The group's product strategy, based on high-quality products
with exclusive design characteristics, will remain unchanged. But the range
will be increased by introducing some lower-priced products.
The group expects a loss of DKr50m in the half-year to end-November and
forecasts a loss for the full year. In the two latest years, the group lost
DKr101m and DKr45m, reduced to DKr31m and DKr74m by minority shares.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK IG, one of Poland's larger private banks, yesterday took over the
lossmaking Lodzki Bank Rozwoju (LBR), the first merger in the sector since
the government began reforming the industry three years ago.
LBR, a private bank set up in 1988, was heading for bankruptcy, with a loss
over the past two years of 191.7bn zlotys (Dollars 12m). The central bank,
which took LBR back under its control in November 1991, approved the merger.
It said other small and weak private banks which had sprung up since 1989
should also merge.
Bank IG will pay 29bn zlotys for a new issue of LBR shares, giving it 99 per
cent of the voting rights.
Bank IG is one of two banks in Poland whose shares are quoted on the Warsaw
stock exchange. It will be taking over LBR's 24 branches and a 1,118bn
zlotys loan portfolio of which 903bn zlotys is overdue. Deposits are valued
at 1,021bn zlotys.
Poland's central bank has given the Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund, the
country's only foreign-owned mutual fund, permission to invest 10 per cent
of its assets abroad.
Pioneer First Polish is part of the Pioneer Group which is based in Boston
in the US. Previously, it invested Poles' savings in local Treasury bonds
and stocks on the fledgling Warsaw stock market.
The move provides Poles with their first opportunity to legally invest their
savings abroad. At the moment, private capital investment by individuals
abroad requires special permits from the central bank.
Foreign insurance companies such as AGF and Commercial Union who have joint
ventures in Poland are still waiting for permission from the central bank to
invest some premium income abroad.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Verson moves back into the black with
turnround to Pounds 1.08m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent
GREATER stability returned to the affairs of Verson International, the
Midlands-based machinery manufacturer, during its first half when it turned
in pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.08m.
This compared with a loss of Pounds 4.7m in the 1991 first half and a
pre-tax deficit for the year to last January of Pounds 12.3m.
Earnings for the six months to July were 0.72p (losses 3.42p) but again
there will be no interim dividend.
However, Verson is planning a capital reduction in order, 'to restore the
company to a position where, technically, it can resume payments of
dividends in the future.'
Verson is now entering a new phase of its existence on the back of the sale
of one US company, Taylor-Winfield, and the purchase of another, Niagara,
the development of tighter links with C Itoh and Hitachi of Japan and a
series of new banking arrangements.
During the first half, when turnover at Pounds 39.05m was marginally lower
than the Pounds 40.04m recorded in the same period of 1991, all but one of
the UK companies, now almost solely dependent on exports, traded profitably.
And there has been a substantial improvement in the US orderbook.
But the first half figures are flattered by the one-off royalty payment of
Pounds 3.8m from C Itoh, while the effect of higher orders on the
profit-and-loss account will not been seen until the next financial year.
Typically, Verson products have a delivery period of nine or more months.
This suggests that pre-tax profits in the second half will be lower than in
the first and that the benefit of a stronger flow of orders will not be
fully felt until 1993-94.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Monarch sells stake in Ewart for loss
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONARCH Properties, the private Dublin-based property developer, has sold
its 29.2 per cent stake in Ewart, the publicly-quoted Northern Ireland
property company, for a figure 'upwards of 80p per share' according to a
spokesman for Monarch. The sale has resulted in a substantial loss to
Monarch.
Ewart is the lead developer for the Pounds 100m Laganside scheme in central
Belfast, which involves construction of a concert hall, 200-bedroom hotel
and 400,000 sq ft of offices, and has other property developments throughout
the UK.
Site work on the Laganside project is expected to start in March.
Last September, Mr Philip Monahan, chairman of Monarch, called an
extraordinary meeting in an attempt to oust four of Ewart's eight-man board,
and replace them with two of his own nominees, 'with a view to radically
redefining the strategic direction direction of Ewart'.
His aim was to steer Ewart towards property development in the Republic, but
there was suspicion on the board that he simply wanted to sell some of his
own developments there into Ewart.
At the time of the boardroom battle, Mr Monahan was not prepared to state
that he was not planning such a move. His boardroom coup was narrowly
defeated.
Monarch's 5.5m shares in Ewart were bought at an average price of 125p, and
the beneficial owner to whom they have been sold is Texas-based property
developer Mr Claude Mayer.
Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director of Ewart, said yesterday: 'I have been
assured by Mr Monahan's legal representatives that Mr Mayer's intentions are
friendly and that he will not be making a full bid.
'I can only hope our relationship with Mr Mayer will be better than it was
with Mr Monahan.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: The Fril of European growth - Hays' plans
for transforming distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies are poised to transform continental Europe's retail
distribution industry over the next few years, according to Mr Ronnie Frost,
executive chairman of Hays, the business services group.
Hays is one of the small group of companies which provide distribution,
through dedicated warehouses and transport fleets, on contract to leading
retailers such as J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and Tesco.
Mr Frost believes it was the strategic decision taken about 25 years ago by
British retailers to take control of their own distribution which has given
them the whiphand over manufacturers, and allowed them to enjoy profit
margins double the level of their European counterparts.
'The retailer can't get too aggressive with price if the manufacturer
controls the distribution, because if you do the manufacturer says 'well, in
that case I won't let you have my product',' Mr Frost says.
His belief that continental retailers are bound to move in the same
direction lies behind Hays' recent acquisition of Groupe Fril, a
privately-owned French distributor. The Pounds 37.5m deal is the first
overseas move by Hays, which was floated in 1989 and has been growing
steadily towards membership of the FT-SE 100.
Hays would eventually like to have 30 per cent of its earnings outside the
UK, but Mr Frost insists: 'We will only buy businesses which fit perfectly,
and are good businesses. I won't rush around and buy companies for the sake
of it.'
The UK group is still looking to make acquisitions in Germany, Spain and
Portugal. It hired a management consultancy to select businesses in France
and Germany, albeit less sophisticated than British distributors, which were
good companies but not necessarily sellers.
Mr Frost says: 'They came up with a list of 100 names. We met 12, selected
three, progressed on Fril and are still talking to the other two.'
British distribution companies do not have an unblemished record of
expanding into Europe. Christian Salvesen last year wrote off Pounds 12.9m
on an unrealistically priced contract with a German frozen food subsidiary
of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group.
Hays has sought to avoid such mistakes by keeping the existing management of
Fril, with the present chairman and chief executive working on a three-year
earn-out.
Mr Frost says: 'What is important in acquiring a continental business is
that you do need local knowledge and local culture, which means you have got
to keep the management. This is the mistake that other British companies
have made over the last four-to-five years. They have all acquired, paid
cash and within six months the management has gone.
'With Fril we got extremely close. We were able to advise and help them,
even before we bought the business. We then agreed a price and liked the two
managers. We're looking for European management in the future, and we
believe the two people are good enough to be part of that structure.'
He added: 'We wanted them to earn as much from the business as possible, so
we persuaded them that cash down and an earn-out was the best way,
particularly as they wanted to stay with the business. It was very
difficult, because in France this earn-out principle isn't known at all.
Introducing them to people in Hays who had done earn-outs persuaded them
this was the best thing to do.'
Hays' acquisition efforts are led by Mr Graham Williams, the group's
corporate development director, who was finance director until the beginning
of this year. Before joining Hays in 1983 he was deputy managing director of
Barclays Development Capital and prior to that he worked for Charterhouse,
representing the bank on corporate boards in France and Germany.
Mr Williams speaks fluent French and German, and Hays is aware of the
importance - and perils - of dealing with different languages within the
group. Although Fril's main board meetings are conducted in English, an
interpreter is always present so that executives can make, and hear,
important points in their own language.
Fril mainly distributes for manufacturers, in common with other French
distributors, although it also does work for retailers such as Carrefour,
the hypermarket group.
Mr Frost says: 'I can see Fril still working for the manufacturers for a
long while yet. But for any retailer that wants to go the dedicated,
sole-distribution route, we could set up facilities for them, still under
Hays Fril.
'This could go into non-food directions, clothes and the like. We've got
some UK customers involved in France that are looking for UK-style central
distribution.'
Hays is also interested in making European acquisitions on the commercial
side, such as archive storage, document exchange and postal systems. Mr
Frost does not rule out making acquisitions in the third area of his group,
personnel, but says the present legal framework makes that a much less
immediate option.
The UK group can bring immediate benefits to Fril, such as the huge
discounts which Hays can obtain on commercial vehicles, trailers and
refrigeration equipment. However, Mr Frost clearly has much more ambitious
plans, on a European scale.
Hays has sole agency in the UK for Seagrams, the Canadian drinks group, and
also for Moet Hennessy, LVMH's champagne and brandy businesses. Fril has the
same arrangements in France, for which it has designed and produced a
computer system to control stock at both companies and other companies.
'What both of those companies would like to do is have a European network of
stock, not to have dump stock in each country, but have stocks in the most
convenient country for the whole of Europe, says Mr Frost.
'If you're going to have spirits, the UK is the place, if you're going to
have wine - obviously France. Computer-controlled movement of stocks between
warehouses could be built into a pan-European distribution network.'
Hays has spent a total of Pounds 65m on acquisitions since it was floated in
October, 1989 - all being commercial and distribution businesses in the UK,
apart from Fril. Since then, the market value of the group has grown from
Pounds 393m to its current level of Pounds 825m. Pre-tax profits have also
grown from Pounds 34.4m to Pounds 57.4m, although their rate of advance has
been checked by recession. The group's distribution and commercial
activities have continued to perform strongly, but profits from the
personnel businesses - specialising in recruiting accountancy staff - have
fallen sharply since 1990.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Snack foods move boosts JLI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE into snack foods helped JLI, the food processor and distributor which
supplies popcorn to UK film audiences, increase first half pre-tax profit by
61 per cent.
It rose from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.84m in the six months ended September
30 1992 and was generated on sales 27 per cent higher at Pounds 50.9m
(Pounds 40.2m).
Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said the increases had been achieved
within a food sector suffering limited growth, low consumer confidence and
margin pressures.
He was confident the group would continue to benefit from increasing
efficiency and the strategic shift away from low-margin distribution and
into food processing.
The strongest performance came from the snacks division, built up on the
back two rights issues (raising Pounds 20.7m) and three acquisitions in
little more than a year.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 450,000 last year - which included less
than three months of Playtime, the nuts and popcorn group purchased in July
1991 - to Pounds 1.3m.
Mr Gottesman said JLI had become the UK's number one processor and supplier
of own label nuts with the acquisitions of TG Smith and Golden Twin during
the first half.
Distribution suffered a decline in sales and profits as the group abandoned
low margin business. Operating surplus fell from Pounds 840,000 to Pounds
730,000 on sales Pounds 5.6m lower at Pounds 21.3m. However, operating
margins improved from 3.1 per cent to 3.4 per cent.
The group expected to benefit from the trend towards more adventurous eating
in the UK through the acquisition in late September of Brookerpaks,
distributor of high value products such as garlic and ginger.
The ingredients division saw profits fall 14 per cent to Pounds 550,000 on
sales 38 per cent ahead to Pounds 14.9m.
The enlarged share capital depressed earnings per share from 3.4p to 3.2p.
The dividend is raised just 0.05p to 1.55p.

Pounds 50,000

<TEXT>
MR BARRIE HOAR, chairman of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale
brewer, has thanked the shareholders who backed him and his brother, Robert,
against attempts to remove them from the board.
He said, when reporting interim pre-tax profits slightly ahead, that 84 per
cent of shareholders who voted supported them.
He added: 'A great deal of time and money has been spent which will be hard
to recoup in these difficult business conditions.'
Profits for the USM-quoted company in the six months to September 30 were
Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 48,000) on turnover 15 per cent lower at Pounds
812,000 (Pounds 950,000).
Earnings per share were 0.87p (0.83p) basic or 0.82p (0.78p) fully diluted.
Mr Hoar said that beer consumption was still falling and the company would
be monitoring the industry before embarking upon the replacement of its
tenanted licensed estate.
The profit on the sale of public houses, completed in October, would be
taken in the second half.
The company now had cash of Pounds 750,000 and no borrowings.

competition stiffens

<TEXT>
STIFFER competition in the premium cider market reduced first half taxable
profits of USM-quoted Merrydown Wine by 19 per cent to Pounds 760,000.
Earnings per share declined from 7.73p to 6.22p but the dividend for the six
months to September 30 is raised to 1p, an increase of 12.5 per cent.
Higher borrowings for investment in new brands and production facilities
lifted interest charges from Pounds 161,460 to Pounds 308,260.
Trading profit fell from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.07m on turnover which
increased from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 8.6m.
Merrydown Vintage cider maintained its dominance of the premium take-home
sector while sales of Traditional cider in cans retained a 5 per cent share
in the fast-growing canned sector.
Premium Draught cider made 'encouraging progress' and sales of Merrydown
apple juice increased substantially.
West Country honey increased profits on slightly lower sales after
restruc-turing and cost-cutting; and Martlet Natural Foods con-tinued to
perform well in the health foods market.
Exports grew 60 per cent to Pounds 449,984, benefiting from the appointment
of new overseas agents in France, Spain, the US and Argentina.
Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, said a new distribution agreement with Gaymer
Group, together with continued investment in marketing, and brand
acquisitions, should ensure that Merrydown shares in the substantial growth
predicted for cider and adult soft drinks.
Results in the second half would turn largely on Christmas sales, he added.

PHILIP HARRIS, the laboratory equipment and pharmaceutical products
supplier, increased pre-tax profit by 29 per cent to Pounds 806,000 (Pounds
624,000) in the half-year to September thanks to a healthy performance from
its expanded medical division.
The interim dividend is increased 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p) and is being paid
from earnings of 6.6p (5.11).
Mr Robert Jordan, chairman, said yesterday trading con-ditions in the UK
market were difficult, but the main thrust of group activities was to
consolidate its existing businesses.
Turnover rose to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 36.6m). Revenue from the education and
scientific division - Harris is the UK's largest supplier of scientific
equipment to schools - was flat at Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 11.3m).
Sales from the medical division - which sells pharmaceutical products to
dispensing doctors, retail chemists and health centres - jumped to Pounds
30.2m (Pounds 25.3m), after its expansion with the purchase of the Proctor
chain of pharmacies in June.
The costs of the deal pushed up interest charges to Pounds 330,000 (Pounds
287,000), which partially offset an increase in overall operating profit to
Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 911,000).

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: How the endless rise of Harland Simon ran
out of fuel - The questionable methods behind the group's collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON TUESDAY February 11 Mr Roy Ashman, chairman of Harland Simon, the control
systems and imaging group, finally admitted his run of luck was over.
At a board meeting that day it became clear that the company's years of
profits growth, built on successful products, but some highly questionable
financial procedures, were past. Harland issued a warning which spoke of an
expected 'significant fall in profits'. Its shares collapsed from 590p to
253p and Mr Ashman resigned.
Faced with a crisis of confidence among customers and shareholders, Harland
fell deeper into trouble and by this September its shares were suspended.
One month later receivers were appointed. The extraordinary rise of Harland
Simon was over.
Harland's main business was manufacture of process control equipment,
especially for the newspaper industry. Its products were well regarded and
sold to several national newspapers, including the Telegraph group, News
International and Financial Times.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.5m in the year to March 31, 1989 to
Pounds 8.3m in 1990 and Pounds 10.5m in 1991. In the weeks leading up to the
profits warning, analysts expected Harland to make profits of Pounds 12.5m
for the year to March 1992. But it announced losses of Pounds 6.3m.
Mr Ashman, who did not return telephone calls seeking interviews for this
article, co-founded the company and is described by former colleagues as a
dealmaker who left details to others. He gained the confidence of the City,
which was impressed by his ability to explain technology in simple terms.
Harland won a stock market premium and outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index
by 200 per cent between 1988 and the profit warning.
According to former employees, he was an optimist who believed the plaudits
awarded him in the City. But in the quest for yet higher profits, Harland
became dependent on orders from major shareholders. When these sold out,
Harland was unable to sustain orders and turned to questionable financial
practices.
'He got absorbed by his own aura and got deeper and deeper in trouble,' a
former colleague said.
Documents in the possession of the Financial Times provide evidence that:
Harland altered a large customer order so profits could be taken earlier
than allowed by accounting regulations.
executives misled investors about Harland's relationship with Perfect
Information Limited (PIL), a loss-making information company.
Harland overcharged for equipment sold to PIL which was then sold and leased
back from banks at the inflated value.
two executives lodged the accounts of a subsidiary at Companies House
against the wishes of the subsidiary's managing director, who said a board
meeting was not validly convened, as required by the Companies Act.
Harland was floated in 1987. In the mid 1980s a major source of business was
Mirror Group Newspapers, then controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. At the same
time, Mr Maxwell's Pergamon was a Harland shareholder, after gaining an
option in 1986 to buy into the company. On Harland's flotation, Pergamon
made a profit of nearly Pounds 900,000 on its shares.
Mountain Dew, a family trust controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, founder of Polly
Peck International, the failed fruits and electronics group, then emerged as
Harland's major shareholder, owning 28 per cent by August 1989.
Mr Nadir was again one of Harland's main customers. Newspapers such as Mr
Nadir's Istanbul-based Gunaydin placed substantial orders with Harland for
process control and imaging systems.
In 1990 Mountain Dew and Mr Ashman set up News Cuttings Bureau (NCB), a
company that later changed its name to PIL. Mountain Dew owned 80 per cent
of NCB while Mr Ashman and Harland each owned 10 per cent.
In late March 1990, just before Harland's year end, NCB ordered Pounds 3.8m
of equipment from Harland. The transaction was booked in Harland's 1990
accounts, generating operating profits of Pounds 2.5m.
Helped by this profit boost, Harland successfully completed a rights issue
in July to raise Pounds 13.8m. Mountain Dew used the opportunity to sell its
stake in Harland in September 1990 for a profit of nearly Pounds 5m. Its
shares in NCB were sold to Mr Ashman and Harland, so that each owned 50 per
cent.
Harland's links with Mr Maxwell and Mr Nadir were well known but their
importance was not fully appreciated by shareholders.
'Harland kept beating our profit estimates. Looking back, the deals with
Maxwell and Nadir were either fortunate coincidences or extremely clever
forward planning,' one shareholder said.
By March 1991, with no large shareholder to place orders, recession began to
take its toll. With its financial year drawing to a close, Harland told its
subsidiaries to find orders. According to a former employee, 'there was
always a problem at the year end, but Roy (Ashman) always seemed to pull a
rabbit out of his hat'.
On March 25, PIL director Mr Neil Smart wrote to Harland Simon Library
Systems ordering Pounds 2.4m of equipment. Mr Smart's order was doctored by
Harland. A second letter, written subsequently but backdated to March 25,
removed a paragraph that mentioned timings for delivery, and changed PIL's
payment terms. The letter, found in PIL's files some months later, was
purportedly signed by Evelyn Child, on behalf of Mr Smart. Ms Child was Mr
Ashman's personal assistant, and had no responsibility for PIL or Mr Smart.
According to former Harland employees, this second letter was to help
convince Harland's auditors, Price Waterhouse, that profit from the order
could be taken in 1991. These employees said taking profits early happened
on other occasions.
Harland booked about Pounds 1.6m profit from the deal, even though none of
the equipment could have been prepared, delivered and invoiced in the six
days before the year end. Equipment sold to PIL was also overpriced,
sometimes by up to 50 per cent. Earlier this year a group creditor asked a
specialist computer company to value a system supplied by Harland to PIL.
The company's conclusion was: 'The system was grossly overpriced.'
In 1990 and 1991 Harland sold equipment to PIL for Pounds 7.8m. According to
a bank involved, the list price was Pounds 3.5m. Harland therefore booked at
least Pounds 4m of clear operating profit - a 50 per cent margin compared
with about 14 per cent for the business overall.
On one occasion in 1991, a computer with a list price of Pounds 250,000 was
sold by Harland to PIL for Pounds 400,000. The equipment was then sold to
and leased back from a leading bank. The bank only checked on the value of
the equipment once Harland's problems became public.
Harland did not consolidate PIL, even when it increased its stake to 50 per
cent, because the stake was classified as a short-term holding in its
accounts. In summer 1991, Harland told shareholders it had disposed of the
investment.
Harland paid the Swiss company Oerlikon Buhrle a nominal SFr5 for Contraves,
a loss-making drives company. According to Harland, Oerlikon agreed in
return to invest Pounds 2.45m in Sandford, a Liechtenstein trust, which in
turn invested the money in PIL for a 54 per cent stake.
But Oerlikon has repeatedly said it made no money available. Price
Waterhouse qualified Harland's 1992 accounts because it could not establish
ownership of Sandford. Sandford's trustee, Prince Michael von Liechtenstein,
refused to comment.
Sandford held the 54 per cent stake in PIL, but documents with the FT
suggest Harland retained control of PIL throughout. Until January this year,
five months after Harland claimed to have relinquished control of PIL and Mr
Ashman stepped down as a director of PIL, Mr Ashman was the sole signatory
on PIL's bank account.
After Mr Ashman resigned from Harland in February, PIL's bank mandate was
changed to allow any two signatures from PIL's three directors. But two
directors, Mr George Neophitou - appointed in February - and Mr John
Stobart, were Harland executives. Harland also remained sole guarantor for
two equipment leases, worth more than Pounds 4m, taken out by PIL.
Contraves was to play a large part in Harland's downfall. It continued to
lose money and by last December Mr John Redshaw, managing director, admitted
privately that Contraves had much higher borrowings than previously thought.
Following Harland's profits warning, and more rigorous accounting policies,
Harland made provisions of Pounds 5.23m to cover Contraves.
By December, Harland had order and cashflow problems. Mr Ashman and Mr
Redshaw met with other executives and discussed wage freezes and
redundancies. In one meeting, Mr Ashman said: 'I don't think Christmas will
come this year.' On December 12 Harland released an optimistic interim
statement with a 16 per cent profits increase. The company said it was
weathering recession well and had secured good orders.
Problems mounted through January as cash drained out into Contraves and
orders were scarce. Yet Harland continued to give upbeat briefings.
On February 10, the day before the board met to agree on a profits warning,
Mr Ashman met with one institution, John Govett. After the meeting, it
bought 125,000 Harland shares for more than Pounds 700,000. When the profits
warning was released two days later, analysts and shareholders were stunned.
Mr Ashman was quickly succeeded by Mr David Mahony, the deputy chairman of
Harland and an industrial adviser to Hambros, Harland's merchant bank. But
Mr Mahony failed to restore confidence and Harland's shares continued to
slide. Morale, dented since the Christmas pay freeze, plunged. Customers and
suppliers started asking questions.
Harland discovered it had a new problem. Systems supplied to PIL were
working poorly and despite Harland's effective control over the company,
PIL's managing director Mr Charles Warner-Allen started to complain.
Because of PIL's poor trading position, he wanted a statement in PIL's March
1991 accounts - which had still not been finalised - that Harland was PIL's
ultimate holding company. Mr Warner-Allen argued that a March 1991
information memorandum seeking subscribers for shares in PIL - subsequently
aborted - contained such a clause.
Harland refused. If it had agreed, it would have been forced to consolidate
PIL's accounts. Instead, Mr Stobart and Mr Neophitou signed off the accounts
in June with only a statement of support from Harland.
According to Mr Warner-Allen, he was not notified of a board meeting to
clear the accounts, as is required under the Companies Act.
In a letter to Mr Neophitou, Mr Warner-Allen said he was 'staggered' to find
out the accounts had been signed off without the approval of the company's
managing director.
By September, Harland's decline looked terminal. Proceeds from the disposal
of a subsidiary were withheld by Barclays, Harland's main banker, and the
shares were suspended on the stock exchange at 20p.
Harland did not go into receivership immediately. Instead, its financial
adviser, Hambros, put forward two company doctors, Sir Ian Morrow and Mr
Tony McCann, to join the company's executive committee, but not as
directors. Mr McCann was paid more than Pounds 6,000 a week during his short
tenure.
On September 15 Hambros told Harland it was switching to weekly invoicing
for its advice. In the last few weeks of September, Hambros charged Harland
up to Pounds 19,000 a week for its services.
On September 11 Harland wrote to PIL saying it was withdrawing support. PIL
went into liquidation and triggered the guarantee of more than Pounds 4m
granted by Harland over PIL's leased equipment. The guarantee was worthless
once receivers were appointed at Harland on October 23.
Several hundred employees are unsure if they will recover all their
pensions. The pension fund's trustees, Mr Ashman and Mr Mahony, approved the
investment of Pounds 500,000 of the fund's money in PIL. Harland said in
July that the money would be returned, but it has not been repaid. When Mr
Ashman left the company in February he received a Pounds 365,000 pay off,
together with his full entitlement of Pounds 960,000 from Harland's Pounds
6m pension fund.
Mr Ashman, meanwhile, is attempting a comeback. Working out of an office in
Milton Keynes, he and two other directors have bought Harland's control
systems division from the receiver. The company is being renamed Harland
Simon Limited. A former colleague said: 'Roy thinks he can start all over
again. He still thinks the City loves him.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lower waste levels hit Leigh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEIGH INTERESTS, the waste management company, blamed lower levels of waste
production in the south of England and a higher interest charge for a 43 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30.
Profits fell from Pounds 7.12m to Pounds 4.08m on reduced sales of Pounds
52.3m (Pounds 58.9m).
Borrowings rose to Pounds 40m (Pounds 25m) - mainly because of acquisitions
last summer - giving gearing of 60 per cent. The interest charge increased
to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1m).
However, the shares rose 5p to close at 183p, partly out of relief that the
profit fall was in line with the company's forecast earlier this year.
Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said: 'The deepening recession in the
south means that many of our customers are just not producing any more
waste. We do not anticipate any upturn in the next half.'
Turnover was also held back by the depressed state of the construction
industry which affected the company's market for reclaiming contaminated
land.
The company says it is in a good position to take advantage of the move away
from landfilling towards treatment of more liquid wastes. Over the past two
years it has invested around Pounds 10m in 14 licenced treatment plants
which treat liquid wastes.
Mr Kent said the group was not looking to make any further acquisitions
since its decision earlier this year to buy Gerrards Cross Waste Disposal
Company, operating near the junction of the M40 and M25.
Earnings per share fell to 4.4p (7.7p). The interim dividend is held at
2.46p.

business
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company which took over the Dowty
aerospace and defence concern in June, yesterday sold Dowty's 50 per cent
share in a naval command system business for an undisclosed sum.
Under the deal, Dowty-Sema, which is developing command systems for the UK's
latest frigates and nuclear submarines, is being absorbed by BAeSema, a
joint venture between British Aerospace and Sema, the Anglo-French software
and systems company.
Mr Alex Dorrian, BAeSema managing director, said the move had been under
discussion since before TI made its hostile bid for Dowty. Dowty would
continue to work as a sub-contractor, particularly in the supply of
hardware.
The change was aimed at creating a better vehicle for overseas sales and
closer co-ordination with BAe's ambitions as a naval supplier.
Neither TI nor BAeSema was willing to provide details of the terms of the
deal.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Revamped SW Wood at Pounds 0.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVAMPED SW Wood group reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 425,000 in
the half year to September 30, its first six months as a specialist printing
and packaging business having abandoned a 20-year history of metal trading.
The group made a Pounds 154,000 pre-tax loss in the same period last year -
when it was reduced to a cash shell - before new management bought Riverside
Packaging Printers in August and Grange Press, the lithographic printers, in
January.
Interim dividends are being restored via a 0.5p payment after a 1.9p loss
per share was turned into earnings of 2p. Turnover was Pounds 5.7m compared
with Pounds 2m.
Mr Bryan Bedson, chief executive, said the printing and packaging sectors
were proving resilient and the outlook for increased profits was good.
Grange benefited from state-of-the-art technology, high productivity and a
healthy reputation, despite its recent receivership as a subsidiary of the
ailing RKF conglomerate. Mr Bedson led a management buy-out of Grange in
February 1991.
Grange could increase production quickly to meet any upturn in the economy
and the likely boost it would give to the size of magazines as advertising
increased.
There was potential for significant growth at Riverside, which currently
contributed 25 per cent of sales.
Mr Peter James, business development director, said that while the group had
Pounds 2m in cash reserves and was keen to make acquisitions in related
businesses, it was proceeding carefully.

<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL for a debt-for-equity swap is being drawn up for Isosceles'
advisers which could be put to the board of the highly-geared food retail
group in the next a week or so.
Rumours that Isosceles, which owns the Gateway chain in the UK, was
considering a third rearrangement of its financial structure have been
circulating since the second restructuring was signed in early October.
Isosceles said that trading was difficult and it was making every effort to
maximise Christmas sales. It said it was not in breach of any of its banking
covenants, which were reset in the financial restructuring approved in
October.
It said: 'We are reviewing the trading strategy at Gateway following the
management changes there.' Mr Bob Willett, who was chief executive of
Gateway, left in October. 'In the light of this review and our view of
trading for the next financial year, we will then consider whether any steps
need to be taken with respect to the financing of the company.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Few mourn as USM heads for scrapyard -
Benefits of a full market listing outweigh doubts for smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be few mourners for the Unlisted Securities Market, assuming the
Stock Exchange decides to dismantle it following the consultative paper due
out at the end of this year.
'The body has been around for a while,' says Mr John Houlihan, of Hoare
Govett's small companies team. 'Today's news is just a recognition that we
have to go to the burial service.'
Mr Houlihan's views appear to be shared by many small company observers and
executives. 'Any company worth its salt has tended to go for a full listing
as soon as possible,' says Mr Lawrence Marsh, an analyst at the small
company specialists, Winterflood.
However, there might be a few reasons to think twice about merely thrusting
smaller companies from the USM onto the main market. 'The USM provided a
universe where people could easily look to invest in smaller companies,'
says Mr Marsh. 'The Stock Exchange could address that issue better.'
Some companies also fear being swamped in their individual sectors. 'On the
USM, although small, we were able to stand out as a company going forward,'
says Mr Ashley Martin, group financial controller of the media buying group,
CIA.
'There is a danger that we could get lost in the bigger crowd,' he adds.
For those who have made the transition recently, there is no doubt that a
full listing has offered greater benefits. For example, Metal Bulletin, one
of the first to join the USM in the early 1980s, has not looked back since
moving to the main market in July.
'Going round the City one always had the feeling that being USM you were
second class,' says Mr Tom Hempenstall, Metal Bulletin's chief executive.
'You were not taken as seriously as you were in the 1980s.'
That has all changed since leaving the USM. In fact, Metal Bulletin's market
value has gone up by 10 per cent since joining the main market - its share
price rising from 214p to 238p in that period - although Mr Hempenstall is
reluctant to attribute that increase merely to the move.
The transition from the USM to the main market is expected to be almost
painless, with most of the older USM companies already meeting many of the
requirements for a full listing. Nor is cost expected to be a barrier.
In recent years, the cost differential between coming to the USM as opposed
to the main market has virtually disappeared. Metal Bulletin paid Pounds
50,000 to make its move.
Furthermore, adoption of a European Community directive in the autumn will
mean those companies moving from a junior to a main market will only have to
file abridged listing particulars. This will cut the costs even more.
The Stock Exchange is also likely to give between one and two years to make
the transition.
This will allow a company to make the move when financial details will
already have been prepared anyway - for example, when proposing an
acquisition or publishing annual results.
It is unlikely that many USM-quoted companies will choose not to move to a
full stock market listing. If anything, some have put off the transition out
of a vague loyalty to the market which gave them their start.
'We are very happy with the move,' says Mr Hempenstall. 'We are just sorry
we did not do it earlier.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Flotation benefits bolster Kenwood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD Appliances, the kitchen equipment company, yesterday reported a 10
per cent fall in interim operating profits after difficult trading
conditions in July, the month after the group floated on the Stock Exchange.
At the pre-tax level profits in the six months to September 30 increased
from Pounds 3.11m to Pounds 3.89m as the group benefited from a much lower
interest charge after the float. The result was struck on sales marginally
down at Pounds 45.3m. Operating margins were one percentage point lower at
11.6 per cent.
Earnings per share, on a pro-forma basis, were down from 10.4p to 9.2p. The
company is paying a 1.5p interim dividend.
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said Kenwood was hoping to pursue a
progressive dividend policy and cover the payment 2.5 times. Had it been
paying a dividend in the year to March 1992 it would have been 7.5p.
Sales in the UK market, which account for about a third of the total, held
up with the introduction of new models. Sales of the Kenwood Chef, on which
the company was originally built, remained firm and sales of a new
Ultrascreen electronic water filter had a good early response.
In Scandinavia sales continued to be depressed, but sterling's depreciation
before and after retreat from the ERM had benefited margins as Kenwood
invoices in foreign curren-cies.
COMMENT
After October's profits warning, Kenwood's trading slide has halted-it is
now just another company selling quality products to a public that has lost
the appetite to consume. Shareholders can thank the Chancellor's sterling
devaluation without which full year profits would have been Pounds 1.4m
lower. It is difficult, however, to see where else exciting growth will come
from in the short term or how the company is to return to a premium rating.
Kenwood will enjoy any recovery in the UK - perhaps more than purveyors of
larger ticket consumer goods - as it has strong market position and brands.
But who knows when that recovery will be. China holds out more hope since
Kenwood acquired cheap manufacturing capacity and an entree into the local
market with the acquisition of Tricom. But that, too, will have long term
rather than immediate benefit. Nevertheless, with full-year profits forecast
at Pounds 9.5m, or 17.2p of earnings, there is probably room for price
recovery given the kicker Kenwood should continue to receive from
currencies.

margins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ASPREY, the USM-quoted jewellery group which has expanded rapidly through
acquisition in the last couple of years, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds
10.9m to Pounds 11.2m in the six months to September 30, writes Peter
Pearse.
Mr Naim Attallah, previously joint managing director and chief executive
since the beginning of September when the group reorganised its management
structure, said he had no intention of going down the Ratners route.
He said the group's accounting was 'very conservative', explaining that with
acquisitions - the most recent of which was Watches of Switzerland for
Pounds 23.2m in June - the group assessed stocks 'for the worst possible
circumstances'.
He had expected WoS to be a drain on Asprey's resources, but it was
servicing the loan taken out for the acquisition, and making a profit.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 60.2m (Pounds 49.2m), with a contribution of
about Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m from WoS. Although margins had slipped, Mr
Attallah said the rise in sales was important to absorb the increased
overhead.
Earnings rose by 0.1p to 6.97p and the interim dividend is maintained at
1.1p.

SHARES IN Manders (Holdings) rose 20p to 221p on news that the paints, inks

Wickes had chosen Manders 'to ensure competitively priced, high volume and

Mr Roger Akers, Manders' chief executive, said that Wickes had embargoed
publicity on both how long the contract would run and how much it was worth
because it was sensitive about that information as far as its competitors

KPMG PEAT MARWICK, the accountancy firm, declared fee income up just 1 per
cent to Pounds 489m in the UK for the year to September 30, compared with
the 12.3 per cent growth of the preceding year.
In an indication of the difficulties facing professional practices, it cut
its staff by 9 per cent to 9,398, including cutting three partners. It also
closed four of its 49 offices. In common with other accountancy firms, Peat
Marwick does not disclose its profits.
Mr Jim Butler, senior partner, said the firm had been affected by the
continuing recession and the strong competition in the market for
professional services. Income from audit and accounting fell 3 per cent to
Pounds 200m, and from management consulting by 8 per cent to Pounds 78m.
This was offset by a 25 per cent increase from the corporate recovery
division to Pounds 56m, a 3 per cent rise in taxation to Pounds 102m and a 6
per cent rise in corporate finance to Pounds 53m.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames gets boost from SelecTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTV, the independent production company responsible for hits such as
Birds of a Feather is moving its production base from Elstree Studios to the
Thames Television complex at Teddington.
The decision is a significant boost to Thames as it trys to build up its
non-broadcasting business in advance of this month's loss of its ITV
licence.
The SelecTV contract, worth at least Pounds 1m a year in production
facilities is the largest won by Thames so far.
SelecTV decided to give up on Elstree after trying unsuccessfully for two
years to buy the studios from its present owners Brent Walker.
Mr Michael Pilsworth, director of UK operations for Select said the
facilities at Elstree had been progressively reduced to cut costs.
'The difference between a warehouse and a television studio is show
business. They took all the show business out,' Mr Pilsworth said yesterday.
If Thames succeeds in raising the money to go ahead with the new Channel 5 -
the deadline is this Friday - it could become a broadcaster again and might
lose its status as an independent producer. A joint venture with Select
could then be a useful way of keeping part of the benefit of being classed
an independent producer. ITV has to buy at least 25 per cent of its
programmes from the independent sector.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Power shows 16% advance to Pounds
95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of Scottish Power foresaw real increases in dividends of
5 per cent a year for the next two years as his company reported a 16 per
cent rise in interim pre-tax profits.
Mr Ian Preston's comments and the profits rise of Pounds 95m for the six
months to September 30 helped the shares to rise 2p to 221p. Some analysts
revised their forecasts for the full year upwards, with average expectations
at around Pounds 300m.
Profits before tax in the half year were achieved after a net provision of
Pounds 13.3m taking in a debit of Pounds 23m for reorganisation and
restructuring and a Pounds 9.7m credit for a re-assessment of energy losses.
The re-organisation costs include severance and early retirement payments to
cut the workforce further. It has fallen from 9,500 at privatisation to
about 8,300 and Mr Preston said there were opportunities for further
reductions.
Operating profit per employee in the half year was 28.5 per cent up on the
1991 first half.
For the six months earnings per share after the exceptionals were 8.47p, an
increase of 6.7 per cent. The interim dividend is 3.72p, a 10.1 per cent
increase.
Turnover was up 6 per cent at Pounds 634.8m with total unit sales 2.3 per
cent ahead. However the company said that weather apart, unit sales were
flat and full year growth was likely to be 0.5 to 1 per cent. The recession
was starting to have an effect, said Mr Preston.
Sales of electricity to England and Wales was Pounds 36.5m in the first
half, an increase of 6.7 per cent, the company said.
The company will boost its capacity to distribute electricity to England and
Wales by over 70 per cent as the interconnector is upgraded to handle 610
megawatts by the end of 1993 instead of the present 350.
Capital expenditure this year is expected to be about Pounds 130m, up on the
normal Pounds 100m to Pounds 110m, largely because of the cost of improving
the interconnecter.
Gearing was about 1 per cent at the end of the half. This will rise by the
end of the year but the company said it would be less than the 18 per cent
at the end of last year.
Mr Preston said the retail operation made an operating profit of Pounds 2m
in the half year, about the same as for the whole of last year. In
electrical contracting the company was benefiting from a renegotiation of
terms and conditions Basic salaries in the division had fallen 10 to 20 per
cent, although performance related pay arrangements meant that in some cases
earnings were higher.
The company has invested Pounds 10m in a fibre optic system, although it
said it was not in the business of setting up a rival telephone user to BT.
It wanted a niche market aiming for bulk transfer of data to companies
including financial services institutions.
The company said average rebates for small customers, arising from inflation
being lower than expected in the year to October, will range from Pounds 5
to Pounds 15. This will amount to about Pounds 20m.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Ashman buys into Harland Simon arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROY ASHMAN, former chairman of the collapsed control systems company
Harland Simon, has bought back into one of the company's main subsidiaries
through a management buy-out.
Mr Ashman provided financial backing for the buy-out of Harland Simon
Control Systems, maker of process control equipment for the newspaper
industry. The company was bought from receivers Touche Ross. No price was
released.
Mr Tony White, a Harland manager who co-lead the buy-out, confirmed Mr
Ashman's role. 'He is giving us financial backing to a certain extent,' Mr
White said. He refused to comment on the level of Mr Ashman's backing,
although he said Mr Ashman was not the only investor.
Mr Ashman's involvement in the buyout has angered some of Harland Simon's
institutional shareholders. They believe he is at least partly to blame for
the company's collapse. Harland went into receivership in October and
shareholders are unlikely to recover much of their investment.
Mr Ashman resigned from Harland in February after the company released a
profits warning. Before the warning, analysts expected Harland to make
profits of about Pounds 12.5m for last year. Instead, Harland announced
losses of Pounds 6.3m.
Harland had enjoyed rapid profits growth but this was fuelled in part by
highly questionable financial procedures, according to documents in the
possession of the Financial Times.
Mr Ashman received a Pounds 365,000 pay-off when he resigned and later
received his full pension entitlement of Pounds 960,000 from the company's
pension fund.
Control Systems, which was the original core to the Harland Simon group, is
to be renamed Harland Simon Limited - its original name. Mr Ashman is a
non-executive director of the acquiring vehicle. Mr White said Mr Ashman
'could well' be a non-executive director of the renamed company.
Mr White said he and another manager, Mr Jim Reynolds, would run Control
Systems.
But former Harland managers doubted Mr Ashman would remain a passive
investor. 'He's a very hands-on person,' one said.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Receivers move into Rosehaugh's properties: Vanessa Houlder
charts the UK developer that was the epitome of its times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rosehaugh, the property developer that yesterday went into receivership, was
the epitome of its times. From a standing start at the beginning of the
1980s, it expanded with a verve and ambition that helped it reach into
nearly every corner of the UK property market.
At the same time, its reckless expansion and over-borrowing exposed it to
the sharp downturn in property values of the past three years. From a peak
of Pounds 746m in July 1987, its market value has eroded to nothing.
Yesterday's appointment of receivers was the final stage in a slow lingering
death, rather than a sudden blow. As huge losses heaped up over the past
three years, it became clear that the company had no future.
The company's former chairman and driving force, Mr Godfrey Bradman,
resigned from the board at the start of this year, leaving its remaining
management to work out its debts.
As one of its bankers put it, yesterday's announcement merely puts the
company in the hands of official, rather than unofficial receivers.
The way forward for the receivership was cleared last week, when a Pounds
1.25bn refinancing was agreed for Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the
subsidiary that owns the Broadgate complex that is Rosehaugh's main asset.
The 26 banks had been reluctant to push RSDH into receivership as a rapid
sale of some Pounds 1.25bn of assets would depress the property market and
the return on their loans. But having ring-fenced RSDH, they felt there was
little point in keeping the rump of Rosehaugh intact.
The banks argued that receivership would cut administration costs, which ran
to more than Pounds 10m last year. In particular, it would allow Rosehaugh
to pull out of the lease on its head office in Marylebone, on which it pays
rent at twice the market rate.
Without RSDH, Rosehaugh is just a mixed assortment of minor commercial,
residential and retail property schemes - much of which is unlet - around
the country. It has sold some of the Pounds 190m of property it held in June
1991, but progress has been slow. The only significant part of its portfolio
is Pelham Homes, a land bank developer which is part owner of Chafford
Hundred, one of the UK's largest housing developments in Essex.
The wide ranging interests of Rosehaugh are a reflection of its former
chairman and architect, Mr Bradman, who is one of the most idiosyncratic
figures in the property industry.
Mr Bradman, a slightly-built accountant, was one of the most successful
taxplanners of the 1970s before he moved into the property industry. He was
also a prominent public figure, as chairman of Friends of the Earth and a
crusader for causes ranging from lead free petrol to freedom of information.
He is now pursuing developments in eastern Germany.
Under his leadership, Rosehaugh was one of the most influential companies in
the property sector in the 1980s, both in its developments and in its
financing techniques.
Its flagship development was the office complex it built with Stanhope
Properties at Broadgate in the City of London, one of the most prominent
developments to be constructed in the 1980s.
With Broadgate, Mr Bradman pioneered the use of non-recourse loans within
the UK. These loans, which were commonplace in the US, allowed the borrower
to confine the security on a loan to specific assets, rather than the parent
company. Thus, it allowed relatively insubstantial companies, such as
Rosehaugh, to undertake large developments.
In spite of Mr Bradman's fascination for finance, Rosehaugh was not noted
for tight financial controls or a sophisticated approach to risk.
In 1986 Mr Bradman was reported to have said: 'You can lose as much on a
small development if it goes wrong as on a major project, but the upside is
not nearly as exciting.'
In the second half of the decade, Rosehaugh expanded in all directions,
setting up dozens of subsidiaries to develop everything from inner city
sites in Birmingham and the London Docklands to land in Arizona.
Mr Bradman's confidence in the UK economy blinded him to the risks of a
downturn. Borrowings were left largely uncapped as Mr Bradman believed that
interest rates were heading downwards. The company remained dependent on
trading profits and failed to secure a rental income that could cushion it
when the market turned down.
The result was that Rosehaugh was the first large property company to show
the strain in the early months of the property downturn. Its problems were
clearly signalled when it announced a Pounds 125m rights issue in February
1990.
Its difficulties were also highlighted during the prolonged merger talks
last year with Stanhope, the co-owner of RSDH. Rosehaugh's financial
weakness was one of the main reasons the merger talks were finally called
off. Stanhope, which is conducting talks about its own refinancing,
yesterday said its position was unaffected by Rosehaugh's receivership.
Bankers were keen to play down the implications of Rosehaugh's receivership
for the rest of the property market. The rump of Rosehaugh's property,
estimated by analysts at Pounds 100m, will result in a relatively small
amount of new property on the market. 'It won't create a wall of property to
be disposed of,' said one.
Nonetheless, the receivership of one of the best-known UK property companies
has an ominous message for other financially pressed companies. For many
companies that are now being kept afloat by their bankers, their eventual
receivership is a matter of not if, but when.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Ciga to unveil debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGA HOTELS, the luxury international hotel group controlled by the Aga
Khan, will unveil a new debt restructuring scheme later this week.
Borrowing by the company rose to L820bn (Pounds 389m) at the end of June, up
from L737bn in December 1991, after poor earnings and continuing heavy
expenditure on modernisation.
Ciga has grown from a predominantly Italian group into one of the world's
larger hotel chains following a string of acquisitions. However, a bunching
of purchases, expensive modernisations and declining profits owing to the
Gulf war and recession have pushed it into the red. The group lost L58.8bn
in the first half of this year after losing L98bn in 1991. The new
restructuring plan, decided at a board meeting last Wednesday, will involve
disposals and refinancings to improve the group's debt profile. In May, Ciga
agreed with its bankers on a rescheduling programme which allowed for the
suspension of interest payments.
The company also plans to sell some of its best-known hotels. Although no
names have been released, the hotels for sale are believed to include the
Des Bains on the Lido in Venice and others in Milan, Rome and Florence.
Mr Claudio Miorelli, a Ciga official, said no disposals had yet taken place.
Further information may come later this week. He confirmed Ciga had more
than L1,000bn of assets at the end of 1991 to counterbalance its debts.
Although occupancy rates have improved from the depressed levels after the
Gulf war, the group remains hit by the economic slowdown. Ciga hotels, many
now lavishly restored, are among the most expensive in Italy.
'We have done relatively well compared with many other hotel groups,' said
Mr Miorelli. At the operating level, Ciga's profits improved to L14.6bn in
the first half of 1992, compared with an operating loss of L8.9bn in the
same period a year earlier. However, he admitted that occupancy rates in the
usually busy months of October and November were 'not as good as we would
have liked'.
Ciga is not the only part of the Aga Khan's Italian business empire to be
feeling the pinch. Fimpar, the overall holding company, reported a loss of
L65bn in 1991, up from L15.3bn the previous year, on sales which fell by 6.5
per cent to L461bn.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Adidas sale gives Pentland Pounds 47m gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND, the UK-based sporting goods distributor which last month pulled
out of negotiations for the purchase of sports shoe maker Adidas, has sold
back its interest in the company to Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) SA, the
holding vehicle for the controversial French businessman Mr Bernard Tapie.
Pentland said it made a pre-tax profit of about Pounds 47m on the investment
and related foreign exchange gains.
Mr Stephen Rubin, chairman, said he was disappointed the Adidas takeover had
failed but 'delighted' the stake had been sold at a profit.
In August last year Pentland paid Pounds 46m for 20.05 per cent of BTF GmbH,
the German holding company which owns 95 per cent of Adidas. In July this
year it said it would buy the remaining shares in Adidas from Mr Tapie's
holding vehicle. But three months later it halted the process claiming it
had discovered 'serious problems' which were never spelled out, apparently
because of confidentiality agreements.
The sale back to BTF frees that company from certain restrictions imposed
when Pentland took the 20 per cent stake. Pent-land's stake carried 25 per
cent of the voting rights and also gave Pentland first right of refusal for
any sale of Adidas shares.
Mr Tapie was believed to be short of cash and a spokeswoman for BTF was
unable to comment on how the deal was financed. BTF was left with a FFr900m
(Pounds 109m) cash surplus after its asset disposals in August.
Pentland's stake was sold back for Pounds 61m, giving a pre-tax profit of
about Pounds 13m after acquisition and disposal costs of about Pounds 2m.
The company also made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 34m on foreign exchange
dealings carried out in expectation the full acquisition would go though.
The profits mainly stem from the rise in the D-Mark compared with sterling
following the UK's withdrawal from the ERM.
Profits on the deal take Pentland's net cash holding to more than Pounds
300m.
The shares gained 8p to 125p. A London analyst said this rise reflected
relief that the sale of the stake to BTF removed the possibility of
recrimination between the two parties.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to make out a bear case for Hong Kong equities. The market has
finally begun to register disquiet over political developments: witness
yesterday's 3 per cent drop after China objected to plans for a new
container terminal. That is not all. Sino-US trade relations may be even
more strained under the Clinton administration and any increase in US
interest rates as that economy recovered would have to be matched in Hong
Kong.
These are all reasons to expect a pause in the upsurge that has seen the
Hang Seng almost triple since its low after the Tiananmen Square massacre in
1989. But it may be wrong to assume the market has reached a turning point.
After all, US interest rates would have to move sharply higher before Hong
Kong rates ceased to be negative in real terms. China may object to Mr Chris
Patten's democracy proposals, but its post-Tiananmen interference with the
airport project did little to thwart the regional economic development on
which Hong Kong's prosperity increasingly depends.
So long as the democracy quarrel rages, the main risk to equities may well
be on the downside, making HSBC look particularly canny to have timed its
recent offering to coincide with the peak of the market in early November.
Investors with anything more than a short-term horizon may perceive a buying
opportunity - providing the regional economy does not race ahead so fast
that China is forced to slam on the brakes.

FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Scottish Power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With coal contracts which last until 1995 already in the bag, Scottish Power
can afford to watch the battle over British Coal with an air of detachment.
It is vulnerable nonetheless. The threat is not so much that the government
might stop it exporting to enable English and Welsh electricity companies to
buy more British coal. Scottish Power's exports are also fuelled from
domestic coal, so that would hardly solve the problem of pit closures. But
with demand at home likely to remain flat through the rest of the decade,
Scottish Power badly needs to increase exports.
Better transmission facilities will more than double export capacity to the
rest of the UK by the middle of the decade. It will show an attractive
return only if Scottish Power can continue to undercut the English
generators on price. With the government's energy review still unwritten,
the price of electricity in the second half of the decade looks deeply
uncertain. The company may not be as indifferent to the outcome of the
review as it would like the market to think.
Yesterday's interim figures suggest Scottish Power can keep pace with the
sector for now simply by taking out costs. Its involvement in every stage of
electricity from generation to transmission and supply arguably leave it
more open to regulatory interference. There could be an appeal to the
monopolies commission next year, for example, if the company gets a bad deal
on transmission prices. Having been privatised on less attractive terms than
its southern neighbours, Scottish Power has less to lose. With the market
starting to focus on recovery, though, the limited downside will not support
the shares for long.

FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Rosehaugh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the decision to turn off Rosehaugh's life-support machine was only a
formality. Choosing to flick the switch yesterday still seems a little
strange. Banks have been in no rush to crystallise property losses, provided
the troubled company does not require large amounts of new cash. Maybe
having effectively secured the financing of Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments
and ring-fenced its assets they simply regard the low-grade rump of
Rosehaugh as a hopeless case.
Whatever the reason, Rosehaugh is unlikely to mark the start of a trend, if
only because its blend of assets was such an unappetising mix. Rosehaugh's
near-impenetrable web of subsidiary companies and financing agreements is
testament to the excesses of 1980s property lending. It seems improbable
that the company's management had a grip on its sprawling second and third
rate assets. And bank lenders were also far too ready to accept the parent
company's judgment on individual projects.
But the decision will further depress sentiment in a sector which has been
trying to take succour from lower interest rates. It is also a timely
reminder that the banks will not hold on to poorly performing companies for
ever. That may eventually weaken the shares of the large property groups if
asset values and rental yields continue to slip. It will be even more
salutary for those hopefuls who have been driving up the price of property
penny stocks. They have little chance of picking up crumbs from the banks'
table.

FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Money troubles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could it be that, having called the recovery wrongly so often, the
government is going to miss it when it finally appears? An 0.8 per cent
monthly increase in M0 a year ago really could have seen the chancellor
offering champagne all round. Yet this is more than just a blip. M0 has been
rising at a seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 7.7 per cent over the
past three months. Together with more buoyant retail sales and rising inland
telephone calls, that points to a slow revival in activity.
The trouble is that it is all a matter of degree. Rising unemployment and
falling house prices are still cause for concern. And even those inclined to
put an optimistic spin on the money supply still see no reason to alter
their expectation that recovery will stay anaemic well into next year. Which
is why stronger money supply growth has its worrying side as well.
If this pace of growth continues into next year, M0 will breach its target
range of 0 to 4 per cent annual growth. The authorities could then be forced
to consider tightening policy before recovery was properly under way. That
would be awkward indeed, but it is the natural consequence of sticking to a
target first set while Britain was still in the ERM. The price pressures
from devaluation may still be modest, but they mean achieving the
government's forecast growth of 1 per cent next year would strain M0 to its
permitted limit. The target looks a little tight outside the system, but
changing it would further damage the government's credibility.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK to take 4,000 more Bosnian refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has offered to shelter 4,000 more people fleeing the former Yugoslav
republics, following severe criticism of UK policy towards Bosnian refugees.
The announcement was timed to coincide with a meeting in London of European
Community ministers responsible for immigration, defusing German calls for
its EC partners to shoulder more of the refugee burden.
It was also intended to take the sting out of a series of resolutions agreed
at yesterday's meeting to toughen EC asylum and immigration rules.
Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office minister, told the House of Commons that
Britain was willing to offer accommodation for an initial period of six
months to 1,000 former detainees of prison camps and their dependants, a
total of about 4,000 people.
Welcoming the move for Labour, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said it
had been 'forced' on the government by the strength of feeling on the issue
in Britain. He urged European leaders to keep their nerve and not to be
'stampeded' by racial tension into adopting a 'fortress Europe' policy.
Last month, Britain offered at an Anglo-German summit to take 150 former
detainees and their dependants. The latest, additional, offer compares with
Germany's commitment to take 1,000 ex-Yugoslav detainees. Germany already
has some 260,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been seeking
shelter for 6,600 detainees, mainly from Bosnia, and until last Thursday had
found temporary homes for 4,300 - of whom 1,000 would be in Germany, 600 in
Spain and 150 in the UK.
Before yesterday's meeting, Mr Eduard Lintner, parliamentary under-secretary
at the German interior ministry, said Bonn was 'not very satisfied' with the
response of its EC partners.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, who chaired the meeting, said afterwards
that nobody had supported German calls for refugee quotas. But he claimed
the asylum rules agreed yesterday would be 'a positive counter to any
tendency towards racism inside the Community'.
The rules have already been attacked by a number of human rights and refugee
protection organisations for allegedly breaking international law.
Separately, Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, was unable
to persuade Britain and Denmark to agree to give up systematic controls on
people at internal EC borders after January 1, 1993. The Commission is
seeking a practical solution to EC members' concerns that controls at
external borders will not be strong enough to justify lifting internal
checks.

THE US yesterday imposed high provisional duties on imports of flat-rolled
steel from the UK, France and Italy, contending that their governments had
unfairly subsidised domestic steel production.
In all, 12 countries were found by the US Commerce Department to have
subsidised their steel producers. Duties ranged from less than 1 per cent to
nearly 59 per cent for Italian cold-rolled carbon steel.
The action came in response to the filing of 84 unfair trade complaints by
12 US steel companies in June after multilateral talks failed to produce an
agreement to end steel subsidies and dumping.
Rolled steel is produced in sheets and is used extensively in industry in
products ranging from washing machines to fighter aircraft.
The US moves come just 10 days after the EC itself imposed duties of between
11 per cent and 30 per cent on steel exporters from Croatia, the Czech and
Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland, alleging they too are dumping.
The duties are certain to aggravate transatlantic trade relations, already
inflamed by a five-year dispute over Europe's oilseeds subsidy regime which
was settled in Washington just two weeks ago after bringing the US and the
EC to the brink of trade war.
It is uncertain whether the steel dispute will put in jeopardy the Uruguay
Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, which spluttered back into
life in Geneva this week following settlement of the oilseeds dispute. But
it highlights the danger that dumping actions are set to become the
protectionists' weapon of first choice, potentially destroying many of the
gains arising from lower tariffs negotiated under the Uruguay Round.
In yesterday's action, the Commerce Department found a subsidy level of
almost 20 per cent on UK carbon steel plate, essentially contending that the
privatisation of British Steel had little effect on the cost of steel
production. French steel subsidies were found equal to 26.5 per cent of the
cost of production.
Mrs Ella Krucoff, an EC official in Washington, said: 'The Community feels
that the US has been using legitimate trade policy instruments to harass
foreign competitors and to divert world trade flows. They are not really
paying attention to the problems of the domestic steel industry.'
Mr Erwin Klein, president of the American Institute for Imported Steel,
attacked the duties, saying they would severely harm US motor companies and
other steel end-users, and would invite retaliatory trade sanctions by
foreign governments. 'Restricting steel imports will . . . pass problems of
America's steel industry on to the much larger metalworking segment of our
economy,' he said.
The Commerce Department, which determines whether foreign steel has been
dumped or subsidised, took months longer than usual to reach its decision
because of the complexity and huge number of cases.
Still greater damage to foreign steel exporters is expected to come on
January 27 when the Commerce Department announces its finding on 42
anti-dumping investigations.
In the past five years, the department has found in favour of the US
industry on dumping complaints in an overwhelming number of cases.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Boardroom bosses urged to tighten their belts: Recession and
the public sector wages squeeze are fuelling demands for restraint in top
executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wood, the Royal Bank of Scotland director who has just trebled his
annual pay, to more than Pounds 6m, believes the only people who will
complain about the rise 'are ill-informed moaning minnies'.
There are, however, a growing number of moaning minnies. And they have
recently won some support from Mr John Major, the prime minister. By
appealing to senior executives not to award themselves large pay rises
during the recession Mr Major unashamedly took the side of public opinion
against business's top earners.
Such exhortations to top executives, and the private sector as a whole, to
follow the public sector pay squeeze, are unlikely to have much immediate
impact.
But over the medium term, pay is affected by factors other than supply and
demand; one of those is the prevailing political climate. Executive pay, for
instance, rose strongly in the 1980s - as top marginal tax levels tumbled -
partly because the government encouraged an increase in differentials
between managers and workers.
Some senior executives, such as Lord King, now detect an attempt to reverse
the process. He warns: 'We must be careful about going back to the awful
mistakes of the Heath days. If we want to attract talent we have to be able
to pay for it.'
But others, such as Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, would
welcome restraint: 'Some people deserve the big salaries but others clearly
do not. Just look at what some of the utilities are paying for jobs that
have not changed that much since privatisation.'
Mr Haskins and his six fellow directors - including three non-executives -
earn less than Pounds 500,000 in total; this is about the same as what the
chief executive of Unigate receives for running a company less than half the
size of Northern Foods and less successful.
Such variations in pay within the same sector abound. In 1991, for instance,
the chairman of Fisons earned Pounds 343,000, while the chairman of ICI - a
company with sales 10 times greater - earned only Pounds 499,000.
There are often good reasons for such apparent inconsistencies. Mr Haskins
points out that it can be easier to run a company which is both large and
profitable than one which is small and struggling. 'I always put my
best-paid people into the worst-performing divisions,' he says.
But such considerations mean that establishing objective criteria for the
absolute level of top pay is very difficult. The flood of surveys of
executive pay increases can also be confusing because they tend to look at a
variety of different categories of executive, and they seldom specify the
size of company.
Even the question of what should count as remuneration is complex. According
to the Noble Lowndes consultancy, basic salary accounts for about 70 per
cent of average top executive remuneration in the UK.
Salaries are normally supplemented by annual bonuses, long-term incentives
such as share options, and perks such as a car. Arguably, contracts that
ensure that executives leave with two or three years' pay when they are
dismissed should somehow be included in total remuneration.
Many surveys do not cover bonuses but one that does, by the Monks
Partnership found that 43 per cent of chief executives had received no bonus
at all over the year to July. Over the same period the basic pay of main
board directors rose 7.7 per cent, says Monks, which was slightly above the
increase in UK average earnings.
Mr Simon Rodwell of Monks believes that is not an excessive increase. He
also claims that, while UK executives caught up with the level of pay of
their international colleagues in the 1980s, they are not at the top of the
table. The latest Monks study of European directors' pay, found the UK in
fifth position this year. US executives are still better paid, although a
higher performance element is included in their pay.
But there is cause for concern about UK directors' pay, especially when
charted against company performance and other employees' pay. The average
chairman of a FTSE-100 company now receives a basic salary and bonus package
of about Pounds 400,000, with total packages ranging from Pounds 148,000 to
Pounds 6.2m. At the same time, top executives have been increasing their
differentials over lower-ranked managers. In addition, according to the pay
analysts Incomes Data Services, chief executive pay has risen 324 per cent
since 1980, while pay for male manual workers rose by 239 per cent.
Even more significant than this widening gap, most of the research on the
link between executive pay and company performance has found little or no
connection between the two.
An unpublished study of the salary plus bonus of the highest-paid directors
in 288 of the UK's top 500 quoted companies has found that the very high pay
awards (averaging 20 per cent a year) received by top directors in the
recessionary period 1989-1991 'appear to be unrelated to the performance of
their companies'.
The study, by researchers from the Centre for Economic Performance and the
London Business School, did, however, find a strong correlation between
growth in sales, often through acquisition, and growth in pay between 1983
and 1991. They say that if directors pay is driven more by size than
performance they will have a strong incentive to pursue merger activity
'regardless of any benefit to shareholders, workers or the economy as a
whole'.
Defenders of top directors' pay levels, and increases, make various points
about this evidence. First, there is room for argument about whether the
study's measurement of performance - share price plus dividend returns - is
always, in all companies, the fairest measure of effort and achievement.
Second, some pay increases were the result of three-year bonus schemes which
reflected stronger performance in earlier years. Third, executive pay is
being distorted by a large catch-up for the chiefs of companies which have
moved from the public to the private sector.
But however eloquent the case for the defence, institutional shareholders
are again taking a close interest in executive pay. Even where the link with
performance is clear - as in the case of Mr Wood - some institutions are
asking whether there should be a ceiling on annual bonuses.
Their concerns have found some support from the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance which issues its final report today. This will
recommend greater use of remuneration committees of non-executive directors
to set top executive pay.
Mr Anthony Williams, director of executive remuneration at Hay management
consultants, concludes: 'We are advising directors that they should take
account of the risk of political and public pressure building up on pay.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With regard to your leader, 'A new policy for housing', although it
will be some time before statistics show the change, more people are now
letting homes than for many years.
Traditionally, residential landlords have been small-time investors. After
being driven out by the Rent Acts, they are now returning to the market
throughout the UK. Every month they are buying repossessed houses at auction
and, after repair, letting them to tenants.
Their return to the sector should be encouraged by the repeal of the Rent
Acts which are no longer required as the supply of rented houses is
adequate. Landlords could also be helped by tax allowances.
As mortgage interest relief is unlikely to be changed and tenants need to be
on a level playing field with mortgagors, why not let them set off rent
against tax up to an equivalent amount, say Pounds 750?

<TEXT>
Sir, Oh that the government would act upon your leader, 'A new policy for
housing' (November 23), which registers your newspaper as another subscriber
to the consensus of informed opinion advocating phasing out mortgage
interest tax relief.
All the political parties know this is right. Neither the government nor the
Labour party has had the political courage to act. Now is far enough from
the election and, as you point out, the easiest time to cushion the downside
for existing borrowers, with further interest rate falls still in prospect.
It is astonishing that a government which believes in a free-market economy
should continue to give preferential tax treatment to one tenure sector and
thereby inflate prices of what is a necessity, leaving many aspiring
owner-occupiers unable to invest and other people enduring dreadful housing
conditions.
An immediate conversion is required. The government could provide adequate
financial support for those who need it - the unemployed in danger of losing
their homes and those would-be first-time buyers who are the key to
stabilising house prices and getting the housing market moving again.
But to spend just Pounds 750m moving dwellings from one sector to another,
leaving millions in housing capital receipts languishing in local
authorities' coffers, will not be effective either in meeting housing needs
or stimulating the economy.

<TEXT>
Sir, There has been much debate over the last few days over whether the
Queen should be liable for income tax.
By contrast there has been remarkably little debate about the minimal levels
of taxation payable by European civil servants. The moves towards a single
market in Europe make this increasingly anomalous. In addition this results
in considerable distortions in the local housing and job markets in Brussels
and in Luxembourg, where the difference in net salary levels between the
private sector and the European institutions is considerable.
Which is it: subsidiarity in practice or extreme parochialism on the part of
the British public?

FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: Insurance premium for terrorism not measurable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN BURROWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an insurer I am concerned that Mr Keith Salway (Letters, November
24) considers it 'a disgraceful act' to withdraw commercial insurance cover
for damage from terrorist action on the mainland.
Insurance risks must be capable of financial measurement and it is
impossible to see how a premium for terror-ist actions can be calculated
here.
To provide cover would cause unacceptably increased premiums. The cost of
reinstating the pecuniary interest of the insured in his property for acts
of political terrorism should be met by the government out of state funds to
which we have contributed.
Only the government can overcome terrorist threats. It is up to us all to
help it in this by reporting to the police any suspected terrorists in order
to prevent damage by their actions. We may then defeat the malefactors who
threaten us.

Do we at last have an explanation of why so many companies in
English-speaking countries seem uninspired and leaderless?
'Hundreds of thousands of executives read this little magazine from cover to
cover every four weeks,' boasts a promotional copy of a pocket-sized
periodical called Bits &amp; Pieces, published by the US-based Economics Press.
It then adds: 'Why? Because it's filled with useful and stimulating ideas to
help them lead and inspire their people.'
One example of the said ideas is 'Nothing is interesting if you're not
interested'. Another runs 'One of the quickest ways to meet new people is to
pick up the wrong ball on a golf course'.
'Almost as bad as Observer's jokes,' said the colleague who passed over the

The reappointment of the glamorous Lady Wilcox as chairman of the National
Consumer Council must be a relief for a Labour-founded quango which at times
seemed in danger of succumbing to Thatcherite scepticism about its role.
Two previous chairmen sent in to inject a spot of free-market realism into
the government-funded consumer watchdog - businessman Michael Montague and
ex-MP Dame Sally Oppenheim-Barnes - were moved on fast after going native.
The strange thing is that Judith Wilcox has been no less vociferous in
defence of the consumer interest. Although she is a member of the prime
minister's advisory panel for the Citizen's Charter, the NCC has published a
series of reports which have challenged government claims to be radically
improving public services such as the health service and British Rail.
Indeed, far from impeding Lady Wilcox's career as one of the great and the
good, her high profile at the NCC has led to membership of the Local
Government Commission, the Board of the Inland Revenue, and the Money Advice
Trust. She seems to have caught the prime minister's eye.
Wherever next for the high octane woman who proudly proclaims that, where
she comes from, 'all the men go to sea and the women run the business'?

For 'black box' read blank box. It was quite a publicity coup for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin when he delivered the 'black box' of the Korean
airliner downed by the Soviets in 1983. But now the Koreans are having
second thoughts.
Yeltsin had promised that his 'black box' contained the flight and cockpit
tapes that would solve the mystery of why the airliner strayed off course
over Soviet territory before being shot down, with the loss of 296 lives.
However, the Koreans have now disclosed that when they opened the 'black
box', they found that not only was the important flight data recorder tape
missing, but that the cockpit voice tapes were copies of the original. And
bad ones, at that. Two of the four tapes had been recorded backwards.

Could it have anything to do with the increased influence of the new Mrs

which doesn't cost much, apart from the hire of a posh hotel like The

A nasty case of sour grapes is ripening nicely in Bonn. Volker Ruhe, the
ambitious minister of defence, is close to having his plan to scupper the
European Fighter Aircraft shot down by his own side.
Ruhe thinks EFA is hopelessly expensive for the post-cold war era. However,
he's being dragged back into the project by a defence lobby which argues
that any alternative would be more expensive, and less German.
In October, it suddenly emerged that Ruhe had ordered the two civil servants
most closely involved in the project - Hans-Jurgen Weiss, the
under-secretary who sits on the EFA steering committee, and Siegfried
Hofmann, his deputy, to be shunted elsewhere. It was suggested they had
failed to brief Ruhe on how difficult it would be to break contracts.
Now it appears that he's ordering their bosses into early retirement, for
daring to oppose his wishes. Both Wolfgang Burr and Joachim Heyden, the two
deputy secretaries who run the ministry's arms procurement division, are to
go next month, according to reliable reports in the Bundestag.
Bonn waits with bated breath. For it transpires that Burr is none other than
the former head of Chancellor Kohl's personal office, and the chancellor is
known as a man who shows and values personal loyalty.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JEAN ALDOUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Chilton's statement that electric vehicles are inefficient (Letters,
November 27) is incorrect, because the vehicle drive system itself is
intrinsically the most efficient and cleanest for road transport.
What is true is that our present power generation is dirty and inefficient,
but this is changing. Many of us have been working to develop an advanced
power source called a 'Fuel Cell', which instead of burning fuels, converts
them electrochemically, cleanly, quietly and efficiently.
We already have, in Japan and some European countries, fuel cell
power-generating plants with efficiency more than 80 per cent and minimal
pollutants. Fuel cells are also being evaluated for transport use, where
they are expected to be at least twice as efficient in overall energy use as
their internal combustion engined counterparts, while causing, according to
the US Department of Energy, only 1 per cent of the pollution.
The fuel cell is a proven technology, first developed in the UK by British
scientists, and it has the potential to make electric transport the most
clean and efficient of all possible in the near future.

Sir, May I draw attention to an inaccuracy about the position of satellite

fact. Mr Snoddy says that, in the week beginning September 29, BSkyB had an
audience of 500,000 for live Premier League football which, compared with
its subscription base of just over 1m, gives viewing figures of nearly 50
per cent.
Mr Snoddy thus confuses household subscriptions and individual viewers. I do
not have exact figures for household size of subscribers to Sky Sports, but
I would guess it to be between three and four, giving viewing figures closer
to one-eighth than a half.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Competition regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT wants to tighten up competition policy in ways consistent
with EC legislation. Yesterday, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, published a green paper with proposals to outlaw abuses of market
power, such as predatory pricing and other anti-competitive practices.
Such abuses are currently investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, whose remit, unlike that of the EC, covers action against
complex monopolies, where several companies with at least 25 per cent of a
market behave in anti-competitive ways. British rules also provide a wide
range of remedies, including voluntary undertakings to desist from
anti-competitive behaviour, price controls and the divestment of a business.
The EC regime is different in that it involves a simpler, one-stage process;
where guilt is established, fines can be levied and the offenders sued.
Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome prohibits abuse of dominant position - in
practice where a company has more than 40 per cent of a market - affecting
trade between EC member states. The EC Commission also has greater powers
than the MMC to pursue complaints.
The main advantage of the EC approach is its greater deterrent value.
Yesterday's green paper offers three options for strengthening the UK system
in the light of EC practice.
The first involves beefing up the current approach with additional
investigation powers and perhaps creating liability for damages. This,
however, would do little to increase the deterrent effect.
The second option would be to switch entirely to the EC approach,
prohibiting abuse of dominant position. This would have the advantage of
making the UK system congruent with the EC's, with offenders facing fines
and the risk of damages. However, anxious not to lose the flexibility and
range of the UK approach, the green paper suggests that the new rules might
apply where market share exceeds 25 rather than 40 per cent. And the wider
range of remedies in UK law, such as divestment and price controls, would be
retained.
Option three combines both approaches: an Article 86-type prohibition on
abuse of dominant power and retention of the UK powers to investigate
complex monopolies.
In theory, this looks the most attractive option: it combines the
flexibility of the UK system with EC-style deterrence. The obvious
disadvantage is that business would have to deal with two systems in
parallel, something which sounds ominously complex.
As Mr Heseltine pointed out, however, it is not only consumers that benefit
from tighter competition policy - business also flourishes where abuse of
market power is curbed. If UK business feels that any attempt to secure the
best of both worlds would involve too much regulation, now is the time to
say so.

FT  01 DEC 92 / The ball is still in the air: Deals cut at this week's
Congress of Deputies will determine the fate of Russia's reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian Congress of People's Deputies, which begins today, will be a
forum concerned with power: who wields it, and for whose benefit. The
underpinning of this struggle, however, is the economy: and it is this which
gives the battle its present urgency.
For this is a society and an economy in transition, and thus the way in
which its economy develops will determine, to a much larger extent than in a
settled country, who wins and who loses; who gets rich and who gets poor;
who is the boss and who the worker.
The Congress, with 1,045 deputies, meets in the trough of reform. It meets
when the pain is intensifying and little medicine is available. It meets to
hear its leading members, most of whom belong to the smaller, permanent
parliament, tell the less experienced parliamentarians how best to vote -
recommendations which will be based on the deals and agreements which they
themselves have cut with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's advisers, or the
government.
The most important deal is that between the government and the Civic Union,
the centrist grouping led by General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president,
Mr Arkady Volsky, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists, and
Mr Nikolai Travkin, the leader of the Democratic party. The Union's
economists have agreed a document on 'urgent measures' which represents
substantial concessions on the government's part to the industrial lobby.
But no more general agreement on the pace of reform or the shape of the
government has been concluded and none is likely to be so, at least not
explicitly.
It will, it seems, be left to those deputies who support the Civic Union to
determine for themselves how far the government has moved towards its
positions. The president and the government must decide how far they have to
change, how many ministers must be replaced with representatives of the
industrial lobby in order to get a majority, possibly on a day-by-day basis.
'We have gone part of the way towards the industrialists,' said Mr Andrei
Nechayev, the economics minister, yesterday.
There is something familiar about the current crisis: it is rather like the
political crisis at the beginning of this year. Then, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
the speaker of the parliament, was calling on the government to resign, and
Mr Yeltsin was standing behind it ('Anyone can have an emotional outburst,'
said Mr Yeltsin of Mr Khasbulatov's call). Then, prices had just been
liberalised, and people were saying they did not know how they would live:
now, prices continue to go up and people say they do not know how they will
live. Then, Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister, said that privatisation
was 'the basis of the long-term strategic direction of a profound structural
reform'. Now, acting prime minister Gaidar says privatisation (only just
begun) makes the fury of his conservative industrialist opponents the more
furious because they know it will dislodge them from their positions of
power over the economy.
In fact, though much has not happened that the government would have wished
to happen, this has been a tumultuous year in which important shifts are
being registered. The longer-term outcome of the political struggle which
will find noisy expression in the Kremlin today depends ultimately on quite
how big these shifts have been: how far has the economy of Russia changed,
how far is a new market-oriented class in place or hoping to find a place?
The economy is awful. The monthly inflation rate is between 20 and 30 per
cent, the budget deficit is subject to so many different accounts that no
single figure can be given - but it is probably more than 15 per cent of
gross national product. The rouble, which stood at about 170 to the dollar
at the beginning of the year, has seen its value fall to about 500 to the
dollar. There is no agreement between Russia and the other republics of the
former Soviet Union on a common rouble zone, and no agreement between the
Russian government and the central bank on the granting of credit.
Production continues to fall, and is estimated to be about 20 per cent down
on last year.
This is fuel enough for the anti-government deputies today and for the rest
of the Congress session. The government's supporters have thinner gruel from
which to make a meal, but they can say this: privatisation has been started
and, judging from the increase in the resale price for the Rbs10,000
privatisation cheques which are being issued to all Russian citizens, it
seems to be gaining in credibility. Russian bankers talk of investment
projects, even though they are strapped of funds. The queues are few and
(for Russia) short because there are goods in the shop - as the government
noted recently in an internal document, the verb dostat, a peculiarly
Russian word which means to get with difficulty, has been replaced with the
verb kupit, to buy.
Above all, the march to the market has begun: it is sometimes violent, often
criminal. But that open markets exist, and that market behaviour is being
studied, adapted and adopted, is now beyond question and probably beyond
suppression. 'No one talks about non-market reform now,' said Mr Alexander
Shokhin, the deputy prime minister, recently. 'That's one of our
achievements.'
Politics, too, have changed. Mr Yeltsin's popularity appears, on anecdotal
evidence (there have, mysteriously, been few polls recently) to have fallen.
He remains dominant but probably no longer unchallengeable: perhaps knowing
that, he is working to increase the scope and depth of his authority. His
security council, a committee of senior officials run by the tough Mr Yuri
Skokov, gradually increases its powers over more and more functions of the
government, from defence to the economy. He has been pressed, most of all by
the governors he appointed to be his representatives in the various regions,
to introduce presidential rule to bypass parliament: he has so far refused
to do so.
At the weekend, he proposed to a gathering of his followers that a party
should be formed to support reforms: he would be 'with this party and in
this party'. Mr Gennady Burbulis, his perpetual aide, was given the task of
organising it. As Mr Burbulis conceives it, it seems to be a party of 'the
most professional people in every sphere of life'. This, in essence, is what
the Communist party was - the party of the bosses. No wonder the daily
newspaper Izvestia ran a headline yesterday, saying: 'Burbulis to become
GenSec?' (the familiar shortening of general-secretary, once the supreme
Soviet post).
Mr Yeltsin's acting prime minister, now said to be enjoying his arduous job,
remains protected. In talks between Mr Gaidar's representatives and those of
the Civic Union, the government side has made several concessions, such as
extending support to large industrial enterprises. But Mr Yeltsin and his
advisers are adamant that they will not surrender the basic philosophy of
reform: they will keep their eye steadily on the goal of an open, liberal,
largely privately owned economy.
Any account of the past year must reckon that Russia itself has largely been
peaceful. It is important to say so, since a year ago the Russian and
western media were full of forecasts of civil strife and worse. There have
been many alarms - in relations with Ukraine over the ownership of Crimea
and the Black Sea fleet; in relations with Moldova over the continued
presence of the Russian 14th army on the left bank of the River Dnestr; in
relations with the Baltic states over the pull-out of troops. There are wars
in the Caucasus (including in the Russian Caucasus) and in Tadjikistan in
which Russian troops are engaged.
But these conflicts have either been damped down or are controlled: what has
not happened is a Russian army trampling on the rights of other countries.
Like the British, the French and other imperial forces, Russia is taking a
while to leave the former colonies: so far, it is doing it, and doing it in
peace.
Normal economic relations are beginning to be formed between the former
Soviet states though Russia has no firm agreements with them on the use of
the rouble, on banking or on inter-enterprise payments. It now seems that,
wearied after a year of fruitless negotiations on these issues, the Russians
are putting up the shutters: from January 1, Mr Gaidar said last week, the
Russian rouble will become essentially Russian only; customs posts are
already up all round the border; and payment in advance is demanded for
supplies of oil. Mr Nazar Suyunov, the deputy prime minister of
Turkmenistan, complained last week that 'Russia is pushing the CIS apart . .
. there is not, or there soon will not be, one economic space'. Most
Russians would regard this as a good thing.
Beyond the former Soviet borders, the world now trusts Russia less than it
did. A sharper note creeps in to the discussions and the intensifying
contacts with world financial institutions. The Dollars 70bn to Dollars 80bn
foreign debt is barely being paid back: contracts are constantly being
changed: political instability remains high. In spite of the best efforts of
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, hired to assist the Russian
government to find investors, no one but the energy companies are excited
about the place.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, one of the government's first foreign advisers, has
upbraided western governments and institutions for their lack of vision in
seeing Russia and other republics as essential cases for aid if breakdown
and security risks and refugees and conflict are to be avoided.
The IMF and the World Bank respond that they have done and are doing a great
deal: that most of the Dollars 12bn government-to-government credits which
made up half of the Dollars 24bn IMF package agreed by the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries in the summer has been sent; that the IMF
itself has put in Dollars 1bn; and that the bulk of the rest, the Dollars
6bn stabilisation fund, cannot be given because the rouble is too weak and
inflation-prone to be stabilised. Yet for the average Russian, and the
average Russian deputy, the Sachs point is the more persuasive (if for
different reasons): they think the westernisers in the government have been
let down by their beloved west. All they got was to be told to have a nice
day.
Until Russian politics produces parties and representatives who speak for
real interests in society the political scene will remain dominated by
personalities and in-fighting.
This is not yet a civil society: representative government is weak and the
concept of government-in-waiting is barely known. How will the Congress
'go'? With fury; with passion; with anger: but probably without too much
effect.

THE LIKELY demise of the Unlisted Securities Market, the USM, tells
something about the mood of the times. These days, the high-risk,
entrepreneurial image that went with USM membership is the last thing any
sensible company boss wants. Better to stay private or aim for a full
listing on the stock exchange, with its overtones of mahogany panelling and
19th century sobriety.
In Britain, more than in any other country, small companies have been
encouraged to turn to the fully regulated listed stock markets for finance.
The USM, though intended as a more lightly regulated version of the main
exchange, in practice had rules very like its parent.
Germany, for example, supplies small-company finance primarily through the
banking system, rather than through the equity market; and in the US, the
sort of companies that in Britain find their way on to the USM or the lower
rungs of the main stock market are traded under rules less onerous than
those imposed by the traditional exchanges.
The UK's emphasis on stock-market finance - as opposed to the German
reliance on debt - stems in part from the need for an equity cushion to
protect companies against punishingly unstable economic policies.
It has also come about, however, because the UK has an infrastructure
devoted to bringing firms to market - accountants, merchant banks,
stockbrokers - but not to providing other forms of finance. When banks did
make equity-like loans to small companies, at the peak of the 1980s boom,
they charged too little for the risks they were taking and structured the
relationships poorly.
If small companies do come to market, they find that their likely investors,
large institutions, are only interested in buying sizeable stakes, to
justify the cost of the investment decision. Company ownership thus tends to
take the pattern of infrequently traded blocks of shares, more like a
private placement market than a true public stock market.
All these factors help explain the USM's likely disappearance. With luck,
merging it into the main market will push the stock exchange to pay more
attention to improving the service it offers to all smaller companies.
Another incidental benefit might be a more realistic assessment on the part
of small companies about when a listing is appropriate.
Once economic recovery begins, however, and small companies come back into
favour, the debate about suitable vehicles for small-company finance will
resume. At one end of the spectrum would be the creation of a new USM, a
genuinely low-cost, lightly regulated new issues market restricted to
professional investors. At the other would be an initiative by some, at
least, of the big banks to obtain equity rewards if they are to take
equity-style risks in lending. If this debate is brought into clearer focus,
the USM will not have died in vain.

FT  01 DEC 92 / A very British system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tumbril may be on its way to Mr Norman Lamont, perhaps rightly so. Yet
he should not resign over the recent stories about his personal financial
affairs. As Mr Kenneth Clarke says, these are plain silly. It is of little
interest that Mr Lamont used a credit card to buy Pounds 17.47 worth of
drink. Whether it was champagne or wine matters even less. If his account
was overdue, titch. That is why they are called credit cards. Access and
Visa would collapse if everyone paid on time. This episode puts the
chancellor in a favourable light. It proves that he is not drinking at the
taxpayer's expense.
The other matter is hardly more serious. The Treasury paid some Pounds 4,000
towards a Pounds 23,000 legal bill. The chancellor had discovered that a
tenant of his was a 'sex therapist'. Mr Peter Carter-Ruck's legal firm was
brought in to see her off. The use of such a golden sledgehammer to crack a
rather small nut would hardly have been necessary if Mr Lamont had not been
a prominent minister. Who cares if an ordinary citizen discovers that his or
her tenant is a 'sex therapist'? It was reasonable for taxpayers to make a
contribution. The provenance of the Pounds 19,000 from Conservative
supporters is murky, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary we must
accept that the chancellor does not know who they were.
There is one flaw. Mr Lamont's apparently supine acceptance of the
Carter-Ruck invoice shows a lack of fighting spirit. You or I might have
sent it back embroidered with the words 'you must be joking', or some
similar phrase. Even lawyers can be embarrassed into a discount.
None of this need have happened if the chancellor were independently
wealthy, or if he were paid more than Pounds 63,047 a year. So little? The
system is uniquely British. It attracts ambitious politicians, but not for
the money. The recompense is an intangible package of non-monetary rewards.
Members of the cabinet enjoy power. They are cosseted by officials who
flatter them, pack their red boxes and order their chauffeurs. They are
called 'chancellor' or 'secretary of state'. They may enjoy, as does Mr
Lamont, an official country residence. They can, occasionally with justice,
tell themselves that they are doing good for their country. No wonder they
feel, and sometimes are, important.
What they do not feel is rich. Many is the minister who has remarked on the
civil service habit of withdrawing the official limousine. If your first
engagement is Treasury business and your second an address to Conservatives,
you may be left stranded in the dusk in outer Manchester awaiting the
chairman of the local party in a Mini. In his memoirs, The View from Number
11, former chancellor Nigel Lawson says that it took years to persuade the
Treasury to contribute to the cost of a cleaner for the flat in Number 11
Downing Street. His wife, Therese, tells of how rooms that visitors might
enter are adorned with pictures from the government collection, 'preferably
by British painters'. But there are none in the bedrooms or on the upstairs
landing, since visitors are not expected there.
At first sight this seems ridiculous, but think. The British system of
government is notoriously secretive. We are in the middle of what will at
the very least be a 17-year period of rule by a single party, with the
likelihood that it will be further extended. The level of corruption is long
established and well understood. It is traditional. Not much has changed
since Labour was in office. Contributions to party funds are helpful ways of
attracting the conferment of honours. The wining and dining of politicians
and senior officials is a sensible business expense for companies that wish
to express opinions on impending regulations. Privatisation has provided
jobs for former servants of the crown who just sat there as huge balloons of
wealth rose up beneath them. Sometimes gifts to ministers may be accepted.
These may purchase the ineffable pleasure of their company - but not, so far
as we can tell, very much more.
This is an essentially English way of nibbling at the fruits of power. By
comparison with accounts of what happens in Washington DC it is harmless if
not quite squeaky clean. We must keep it that way. Tortuous civil service
rules prevent ministers from entertaining personal friends at the state's
expense in their official residences. This is part of a web of defences that
should assure us that our domestic level of corruption will not spill over.
We cannot always rely on whistle-blowers. Our only protection is a magic
spell, a cast of mind, that has officials tying themselves in knots every
hour of every day in an effort to preserve what they regard as their own
purity as custodians of the public interest. That, and our constant,
watchful, media-fed suspicion.
As to Mr Lamont, if he cannot regain the markets' confidence in his ability
to manage the economy he should be shuffled out of the chancellorship,
perhaps to the Home Office. But that is another story.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Helping Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SOMALIS continue to die in their thousands and their country descends
ever deeper into chaos, leading United Nations members are properly
considering how they might intervene to ease the suffering. The need for
action to improve the effectiveness of relief efforts is pressing.
Nevertheless, the UN needs to tread carefully, both in determining the form
of short-term intervention and in defining its long-term objectives.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has made the gravity of
the situation clear. In a letter to the Security Council last week he said
that attacks, looting and harassment by warlords meant 'the humanitarian
assistance which reaches its intended beneficiaries is often barely more
than a trickle'.
The world needs to ensure that shipments of food are protected, convoys
escorted and distribution centres guarded so that supplies reach the needy.
The existing UN force of 650 troops is clearly inadequate; and even at its
projected strength of 4,200 it will be unable to guarantee delivery. That
may change if the UN accepts Washington's offer of up to 30,000 troops to
support such an exercise, a response to growing public anguish.
But the public must also be prepared to accept the consequences of a 'fight
to feed' policy. The two warlords who control the capital, Mogadishu, appear
prepared to accept intervention. It may be a different matter, however, when
their followers find themselves prevented from making an easy living out of
extortion. Resistance by rag-tag armies might soon be broken, but the public
must realise that US soldiers may have to kill teenagers to keep the aid
flowing.
Also to be considered are the objections of several leading aid
organisations in Somalia. They oppose intervention, arguing that aid workers
may themselves number among the casualties, or run the risk of becoming
hostages.
Nor is military intervention on its own likely to provide Somalia with more
than temporary relief. Success would be short-lived if the task force then
withdrew, leaving Somalia to its fate. The economy is shattered, social
structures in ruins, the administration non-existent. Mr Boutros Ghali must
make clear that intervention can only be the first step in a broader
political and economic reconstruction of the country.
At the outset, that is bound to place a heavy responsibility on outside
powers. The logic of the aid effort points to the UN being forced to assume
some form of trusteeship for Somalia. Just as important, the Somalis
themselves will need to be consulted. A conference outside the country under
UN auspices would provide a forum at which prominent Somalis could debate
their future and assist in the transition.
Deeper military intervention in Somalia is likely to be risky, but it is a
risk worth taking - provided the UN simultaneously takes political and
economic action to help the country towards a more stable future.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: Sir Sidney Nolan - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reputation of Sir Sidney Nolan, who died in London at the weekend at the
age of 75, is in many ways characteristic of our times; that is to say it
remains contradictory, uncertain and ambiguous. He died full of honours -
RA, a knight, member above all distinctions of the Order of Merit.
Of all Australian artists, he was as he is likely to remain the most famous,
patronised and collected by the highest in the land, known and admired for
his work by a society not exactly renowned for its support for the
contemporary and the avant garde.
And yet, within the community of British and Commonwealth artists he was
increasingly dismissed and neglected, remembered if at all as a figure from
a period that was past, fixed for ever, as Ned Kelly was within his iron
mask, with the single memorable image of that square-headed, half-mythical
figure, outlaw and anti-hero. His tragedy was that after his extraordinary
and immediate success of the 1940s and early 1950s, and his extended
development of the Kelly sequence of paintings, though he continued to
change in his own work, without his central character, no one took any
notice. And the more no one looked, the more desperate and disillusioned he
became.
Meanwhile, there were other and technically better painters among his
contemporaries, whose work was less constrained by a particular image and
more natural and consistent in its development - Arthur Boyd outstanding
among them.
Nolan rather was, so it seems now, a classic victim of his own good luck and
early success, taken up by the powerfully well-intentioned and encouraged to
cut himself off from his imaginative roots, from the landscape of the
Australian outback and its myths of the eternal vagabond and outsider. Go to
England 'and I'll help you do an exhibition", said Sir Kenneth Clark to the
the young painter in the late 1940s, 'but you have to realise that if you
leave Australia, perhaps you'll never go back.'
Perhaps in spirit he never did, but for all that, and for all the subsequent
critical obloquy and neglect, the Ned Kelly series remains a considerable
and lasting achievement.
These paintings were seen most especially and to great advantage in the Arts
Council's Angry Penguins exhibition at the Hayward four years ago, set in
their true context, with the work of the other Melbourne painters of the
1940s, Boyd, Perceval, Tucker and the rest. They remain his monument. It is
perhaps no bad thing to hit upon a powerful and particular image after all.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: A love for the coast - William Packer considers Boudin
a petit matre par excellence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Horrible it may have been in other ways, but this has been at least a very
good year for the painting of the 19th century. There was a delightful show
at Brighton in the summer centred upon the French and British artists,
Walter Sickert prominent among them, who worked in and around Dieppe; and
now we have the full Sickert retrospective at the Royal Academy. An
exhibition of the work of the Barbizon group, Daubigny, Rousseau et alios,
has lately come on at Agnew's; and there was the Sisley show in early
autumn, again at the Academy. None of these artists conspicuously altered
the course of the history of western art. None bestrode his world like a
Courbet, a Cezanne, a Picasso or a Matisse. Yet each, in offering a lesser
example, produced work of no less particular excellence, to be admired and
enjoyed for what it is. To be a petit matre is to be matre none the less.
Now, with Boudin at Trouville, we have another artist of this category and
quality, and an exhibition as exquisite as any them. Eugene Boudin died in
1898 at the age of 74. Though late in coming to his vocation - he did not
complete his formal studies until he was 30 - he was remarkably prolific,
producing something over 4000 paintings, with many thousands of drawings and
water-colours besides. He was a landscape painter, with Normandy very much
his home territory; but he made regular visits to Brussels and Antwerp,
travelled on into Holland on occasion, and made several visits to Venice in
his old age.
Yet the consistency of his work is manifest in its ostensible variety, for
Boudin's love was for the coast, and for the rich choice of subjects it gave
him, the beach and the harbour, the sea and the sky. And if he could find
such interest as well in Venice or Dordrecht, he could find it just as well
along the familiar coast of his native Normandy. Most of all he could, and
did, find it on his doorstep at the fashionable resort of Trouville, or on
the other bank of the estuary of the Touques, at Deauville, where he made
his home. The paradox is that by doing just that, he is now too easily
dismissed as an artist of merely limited and local interest.
The premise of this exhibition, fully justified in the event, is to offer a
view of the work that Boudin produced in and around Trouville across the
full span of his career, and to take it as representing the whole. The
results are at once salutary and surprising, for if Boudin is
misrepresented, it is indeed as simply the artist of the fashionable
Parisian world of the Second Empire, taking the sea air along the beaches
and promenades of Trouville, gossiping and flirting among the bathing-huts,
watching the sun go down over the sea, hooped skirts swinging,
bonnet-ribbons flying in the breeze.
Those familiar images are presented here, of course, and in strength, as
they should be, but at last they appear in their proper context along with
the harbours and the jetties, the shipping standing out to sea, the
washer-women along the river-bank, and the wider landscapes across the bay
or up the valley behind the town. What we discover by this is an artist not
limited at all, but developing rapidly and surely, in both his technique and
his attitude towards his subject-matter.
It is indeed true that the earlier work, of the early 1860s, is genre
painting of a sort, whether it is the Empress Eugenie breezing along the
front with her retinue, or a horse and cart coming down the hill on the
Trouville road. The limitation is simply a preoccupation with the subject in
documentary terms, with even a hint at social comment. Boudin was worried at
times that he might be, for his day, a little politically incorrect. 'When
you have just spent a month among people doomed to the hard labour of the
fields', he wrote to a friend in 1867, '. . . and find yourself confronted
with this troop of golden parasites . . . it inspires a little pity . . .
and a certain shame at painting lazy idleness.' A year later he had
rationalised such qualms away: 'Between you and me they are often seeking
rest after working hard in their offices.'
What is apparent from the work, however, is that within these few years even
the most overtly fashionable of his beach scenes had become much less
specific in its personal characterisation, though no less full of life and
character as an image. The crowd itself takes on the active character that
before was invested in a single figure, even a recognisable type. Boudin
will always use a figure or group to animate a landscape, beach or jetty,
and will establish the image with an extraordinary suggestive and effective
economy, but gone for ever is the particular dramatis personae, the drooping
whiskers and bowler hats, panniers and petticoats of the regulars to be
found at Trouville, year after year throughout the 1960s.
So technically as with the imagery, as Boudin absorbs the growing,
contemporary example of impressionism, so he develops his own answers to the
ever-changing problems of light, mood and atmosphere that confront the
painter working directly from nature in the open air, sur le motif. His
paintings are never large, even by the standards of the impressionists, but
the physical space they conjure for us beyond the surface of the picture is
as large and wide to the imagination as any landscape allows.
By the 1880s, in simple, unprepossessing views across the water-meadows of
the Touques, or along the Deauville road beneath a lowering grey sky, he is
producing work quite as grand in its own terms as anything by his more
celebrated peers, Monet or Manet, Pissarro or Sisley. This is not a large
exhibition, but then, like the works themselves, it hardly needs to be.
Boudin at Trouville: The Burrell Collection, Pollok Country Park, Glasgow,
until February 28; then to the Courtauld Institute Galleries, Somerset
House, London WC2: sponsored by the Whyte &amp; Mackay Group.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: Irina Arkhipova - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The veteran Bolshoi mezzosoprano, Irina Arkhipova, was already a Soviet star
in the 1950s. (You can hear her Carmen recorded live at the Bolshoi in 1959,
in a performance sung all in Russian save for Mario del Monaco, who sings
Don Jose in Italian.) She has long been an international star, and in the
international repertory; I well remember her incisive Azucena in a 1975
Covent Garden Trovatore. Her gleaming voice, its rapid vibrato so
characteristic of a tradition widespread in Soviet postwar singing, can be
heard in many recordings, especially of music by the late 19th-century
Russian masters.
Today, when the voice has lost much of its force and edge, she is still an
authoritative artist. On Friday, accompanied by Ivari Ilya at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall, she sang an all-Russian recital with her particular
combination of calm and attack. Swathed in heavy purple, with an ugly bow at
her breast that looked like an embalmed wren, she stood and delivered, with
a simple minimum of airs and graces. The vibrato is slower these days, the
voice greyer, and she does not really sing louder than mezzoforte. And she
needs music - neither too taxing nor too undemanding - that is a proper
vehicle for her gifts.
At first, in five songs by Gretchaninov, she made no great impression, and
the songs appeared to be merely stock sentimentality and run-of-the-mill
Russian soul. But she made greater interpretative inroads into five songs by
Arensky. Especially in 'A sky of blinding blue,' 'Was it so long ago to
magical sounds' and 'The garden is all in bloom,' she revealed how variously
she can still deploy her tones. Always an assured mistress of phrasing, she
constantly contrasts firm attack with sure note-to-note portamento to
expressive effect.
It was no surprise that she was at her best in nine Tchaikovsky songs.
Tchaikovsky not only wrote more sensitively for the voice than other Russian
composers, he was also a more natural communicator. The two jewels of
Friday's recital were in complete contrast: the amorous serenade 'In the
bright light of dawn' and the desolate 'Once more, as before, alone'. The
rapture of the one and the hopelessness of the other emerged with riveting
intensity. Arkhipova has the complete simplicity of the true grand manner,
and its easy range of nuance.
She showed it again in the first of her two encores - the Countess's scene
from The Queen of Spades. Disdain, pride and age all coloured her every
utterance; and then, as she recalled Boieldieu's 'Je crains de lui,' she
went straight for the erotic affliction that so marks this opera. Bitterly
and hauntedly she sang it the first time; tenderly but resignedly the next.

<TEXT>
It is hard to believe that the new production in Berne of Siegfried
Matthus's Judith is only the third time the opera has been staged since the
sensational Komische Oper premiere in 1985. Based on Friedrich Hebbel's 1840
play about the Old Testament heroine, Judith is a natural repertory piece,
combining the blood-lust of Elektra with the intensity of a psychological
thriller.
The music may not be particularly subtle or original, but it is sure of
touch and free of affected modernisms. The two leading roles offer a
magnificent challenge to a dramatic soprano and bass baritone, and the
choral writing is powerful. Judith seems tailor-made for Josephine Barstow
and English National Opera, who need look no further than this staging by
Eike Gramss, director of the 1989 ENO production of another modern German
classic, Reimann's Lear.
Ever since Vivaldi, composers have seen the dramatic potential of Judith. A
widow with a destructive longing for a mate, she saves her native Bethulia
from extinction at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar's unconquerable general,
Holofernes, by seducing him and chopping off his head. Matthus's opera has
an extended finale, in which the victorious Bethulians rape and plunder as
their enemies had done: nothing changes, the oppressed simply become the
oppressors.
It also has a feminist subtext: Holofernes is an ogre who proves his power
by abusing women; Judith initially claims 'A woman is nothing'. When she
finally realises her power by killing him, she is raped and rejected by the
very society whose interests she served.
Gramss and his designers, Werner Hutterli and Renate Schmitzer, presented
Judith as a savage myth in modern dress. Holofernes, with tattoos visible
beneath his string vest, could have been an Arab military commander or an
urban guerrilla chief, with a voracious appetite for sadistic, sexual
violence - the only area where this production went beyond the bounds of
taste. Holofernes' men wore army fatigues, Nebuchadnezzar's arrogant
messenger resembled an overfed lawyer. The besieged Bethulians were an
anonymous 20th century crowd of Jews, trapped behind the shutters of a vast
blood-red bulwark. The conflicts of the first act were emphasised by placing
the protagonists on different levels, the lighting oscillating between the
two just as the music does. The tension of the second act was superbly
realised as Judith stalked her prey in a decollete red and black evening
dress.
Berne was lucky in its leading partnership. Holofernes could have been
written for Monte Jaffe (well-remembered from ENO's Lear and Timon of
Athens). He sang with steady, penetrating voice and used every limb and
nerve to pierce the depths of this unpredictable human monster. Christa
Ranacher captured Judith's do-or-die courage and erotic power, but the
important top notes lacked the necessary brilliance and abandon. Carry
Persson as Holofernes' cowering sidekick and Anita Herrmann as Judith's Maid
gave strong support. The Berne chorus sang remarkably well. The weak link
was Martin Fischer-Dieskau's conducting. While the solo contributions from
piano, harp, bassoon and amplified bass guitar were sensitively handled, the
tutti were undifferentiated and tempi were allowed to drift.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Technology: An economic infection - On World Aids Day, Clive
Cookson analyses the disease's grim cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each day, Aids costs the world an estimated Dollars 250m. This alarming
figure includes the direct costs of treatment, prevention and research and
the more substantial indirect costs from loss of earnings. Only now, 11
years after Aids was first recognised as a new disease, are analysts
starting to make systematic estimates of its worldwide economic impact.
Figures emerging from work at the Harvard School of Public Heath in the US,
Cambridge University in the UK, the World Health Organisation in Geneva, and
elsewhere suggest that the total costs of Aids and HIV infection are now
running at about Dollars 90bn a year: Dollars 10bn direct and Dollars 80bn
indirect. According to Andrew Cliff and colleagues at Cambridge University
Department of Geography, the cumulative cost of Aids over the first decade
of the epidemic (1981-91) was Dollars 240bn. Projections for the next 10
years are more speculative, since no one knows how quickly HIV will spread
nor how successful medical researchers and the pharmaceutical industry will
be in developing better treatments for Aids. WHO estimates that 13m people
have been infected so far. Forecasts for the year 2000 range from 30m to
120m people with HIV. Global costs could then be running as high as Dollars
500bn per year - equivalent to more than 1 per cent of world GNP. Such
alarming figures lie behind WHO's message for World Aids Day: that spending
on prevention of HIV infection in developing countries must be increased at
least 20-fold 'in order to have any real hope of slowing the spread of the
epidemic' and its attendant human suffering and economic impact. Developing
countries spent only Dollars 120m on Aids prevention in 1991, WHO says. Yet
the minimum required for an effective prevention programme is Dollars 2.5bn
a year. This would include campaigns to promote safer sex through schools
and the mass media, education of prostitutes and measures to eradicate HIV
from blood supplies. But the two biggest elements of WHO's proposed
prevention package are large-scale distribution of condoms and better
treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases.
WHO advocates spending Dollars 790m distributing 8bn condoms a year to
sexually active people in developing countries - at present the total world
production of condoms is only 6bn a year. And it says Dollars 1bn a year
should be devoted to treating the diseases; much of this would be spent on
modern antibiotics to kill the bacteria more effectively than the cheap
resistance-prone drugs used in the third world today.
'We know what approaches work to prevent transmission,' says Michael Merson,
director of the WHO Global Programme on Aids. 'Compared to the cost of
caring for someone who becomes infected, these interventions are very good
value. Every hundred dollars spent now will save millions later.'
Although more than 80 per cent of those infected are in developing
countries, the absolute costs of HIV and Aids are far higher in Europe and
North America (see table) because healthcare expenses and lost earnings per
patient are so much greater.
The direct cost of caring for an average Aids patient is Dollars 32,000 per
year in the US and Dollars 400 per year in Africa, according to Daniel
Tarantola of the Harvard School of Public Health.
Fred Hellinger of the US Agency for Health Policy and Research says the
average cost of treating an American patient from diagnosis to death has
almost doubled in four years, from Dollars 57,000 in 1989 to Dollars 102,000
in 1992. (Comparable lifetime treatment costs are Dollars 20,000 for lung
cancer, Dollars 52,000 for breast cancer and Dollars 175,000 for kidney
failure.)
Medical costs are rising because US doctors are treating patients more
aggressively at an earlier stage in the progression of Aids. Although there
are still very few drugs to treat HIV directly, many are becoming available
to fight the secondary infections associated with Aids or to boost the
immune system.
Yesterday, for example, Wellcome announced that it had received approval to
market Mepron in the US and Canada for early treatment of PCP, a form of
pneumonia that is common among Aids patients.
Some patients are taking as many as 10 drugs at once, each costing several
hundred dollars a week. 'Drug costs account for 15 per cent of the total
cost and will get higher as time goes by,' Hellinger said.
According to Cliff's projections, the cumulative cost of Aids in San
Francisco, one of the worst affected US cities, will amount to Dollars
13.38bn over the period 1981-99 - Dollars 1.72bn direct and Dollars 11.66bn
indirect (loss of earnings). That is equivalent to 8.6 per cent of the total
income of the San Franciscan population over the same period.
The cumulative cost of Aids for the country of Uganda over the same 19-year
period is likely to be about Dollars 2bn, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of GDP.
In the case of Uganda, however, the costs will rise sharply during the
1990s, reaching 12 per cent of GDP from 1995 to 1999.
'While inter-regional shifts of economic resources will undoubtedly ensure
that western cities such as San Francisco survive the economic onslaught of
Aids, the future outlook for countries like Uganda is bleak,' Cliff says.
'Aids has the potential to strip away the value equivalent of the country's
modern manufacturing sector by the end of the century.'

reappointed as chairman of the 17-year-old quango which aims to give a
vigorous and independent voice to consumers.
The Government's decision to reappoint Lady Wilcox, who was married to the
late Sir Malcolm Wilcox of Midland Bank, will be seen by some as a further
seal of approval for a sometimes stern critic of officialdom. One observer
who knows her well described her as the type of self-made businesswoman that
the government is keen to promote.
She has spent over 20 years in the food industry, importing and exporting
fish all over the world. She established factories in France, Ireland and
Great Britain, processing and distributing chilled, smoked fish to national
supermarkets. Lady Wilcox is also a member of the Prime Minister's Citizen's
Charter Advisory Panel, the Local Government Commission, the Board of the
Inland Revenue, and the Money Advice Trust. A council member of the
Institute of Directors, she also plays an active role in Church of England
affairs.
Lady Wilcox will serve for a further three-year period, and Ann Scully, a
school governor and member of the Chester Small Business Bureau and Chamber
of Commerce, will serve for a further four years as NCC vice chairman.

FT  01 DEC 92 / People: Scottish Enterprise picks economics professor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chairman of Scottish Enterprise, the government's economic
development body for Scotland, is to be Professor Donald MacKay, probably
Scotland's best known economist. He will succeed Sir David Nickson in
January.
MacKay, 55, has held professorships at Aberdeen and Heriot-Watt and he
remains honorary professor at the latter university.
In 1976 he founded the economic consultancy Pieda, which operates from
Edinburgh, Reading and Manchester.
He has been an economic consultant to the Scottish Secretary since 1971,
writes an economic column in The Scotsman with a free market orientation and
presents studies for Pieda clients lucidly and with a smile.
His most recent was an assertion of the case for preserving the Rosyth naval
dockyard in Scotland against its rival Devonport, in which he accused the
Ministry of Defence of advancing 'a quite extraordinary and unacceptable
argument.' Just before the general election he produced a study undermining
the economic arguments for a Scottish parliament and for Scottish
independence.
He is a less emollient man than Nickson, 63, who presided over the breaking
up of the Scottish Development Agency, where he became chairman in 1989. The
SDA was transformed into Scottish Enterprise, which consists of a core body
and 13 local enterprise companies.
Nickson guided the government in making Scottish Enterprise a viable
organisation, and soothed the anguished brows of the SDA's top executives,
many of whom however left.
Prof MacKay is a non-executive director of Grampian Holdings, the industrial
mini-conglomerate. Sir David Nickson, who is to devote more time to his
business interests, is chairman of the Australian-owned Clydesdale Bank.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Technology: Flexible workhorse that went to war - How the
modern lathe can produce shell casings as easily as chess pieces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By selling equipment to Iraq, Matrix Churchill triggered off a political
storm which has also focused sharp attention on the versatility of modern
machine tools.
They are often called 'mother machines' because of their role in making
equipment for use throughout the manufacturing industry, but few such
mothers are as flexible as the computer-controlled lathe.
In manufacturing, however, this raises few eyebrows. Flexibility is what
lathes are all about. At the Hanover machine tool fair in September, 1989,
shortly after UK-based Matrix Churchill first publicly admitted it had sold
machine tools to Iraq, the company had one on show programmed to make chess
pieces from brass to illustrate its lathes' versatility.
If they can produce chess pieces, why shouldn't any computer numerical
control (CNC) lathes be able to make shell casings, say experts on CNC
machine tools? After all, almost the whole range of machine tools such as
milling machines, machining centres, boring machines and CNC presses are
used in arms production.
The basic process in a lathe is 'turning' - applying a tool to a rapidly
spinning billet of steel to produce a cylindrical component with
multi-diameters, tapers and other features.
Even manual lathes can produce huge varieties of cylindrical components.
With CNC, which expresses every action and movement of the machine tool as a
number which can be controlled by computer, productivity is transformed,
accuracy is controlled by computer down to a few microns, and reprogramming
to switch tasks can be done in half a day.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the CNC unit is the most sensitive
part of a modern machine tool for governments worried about possible
end-use. While the machine tools exported to Iraq were British, the CNC
units directing them were foreign - the market is dominated by Fanuc of
Japan.
CNC producers are also interested in flexibility. The Fanuc controllers used
typically on a Churchill lathe are much the same as those used on other
lathes, although the software varies. Much of the machine tool builder's
expertise goes into marrying a flexible user-friendly control system to a
versatile metal-cutting workhorse.
So how does the owner of a CNC lathe set it up to produce, say, shell
casings, or switch production from harmless widgets or tractor axles to
armament components?
The simplest approach, particularly for a manufacturer lacking a modern
computer-aided design (Cad) system, would be to produce an engineering
drawing of the casing. This would be taken to the machine tool, and an
operator would punch in the basic dimensions of the part and the sequence of
machining operations. This is called 'manual data input'.
Several different rough and final finishing operations would be needed to
produce a shell casing, but the operator would have a basic knowledge of
machining.
The CNC unit works out the details of the tool path and, in many cases,
produces a graphic of the finished part. The programmer will also input the
speed of cutting and the 'feed rate' at which the cutting tool is pushed
towards the component. Often, the CNC unit's own internal library will
calculate, for example, how quickly the workpiece will have to be turned to
cut a certain depth.
Western manufacturers of shell casings would almost certainly not follow
this route, preferring to produce the design on a Cad system. A standard
piece of computer-aided manufacturing (Cam) software attached to the Cad
system converts the design into data that can be used in manufacturing. The
programmer sits in an office inputting the machining, tooling and other
instructions in a process known as 'off-line' programming. If the program
has been produced off-line, it has to be transferred to the CNC. This is
done by storing it in a floppy disk and taking it to the CNC, or installing
a direct numerical control (DNC) cabling link between the Cam and the CNC.
Once the program is installed in the unit, and the tooling sorted out, the
first component can be produced. The operator can edit the program to adjust
dimensions, making final corrections that could take only a few minutes for
the part to be made to very fine tolerances. Then full-scale production can
begin.
Once programmed, the CNC unit will store all the information it needs and
can be switched from widgets to shell casings in an hour or two, allowing
time for changing some of the tools and the workholders. And if the bottom
falls out of the armaments market, it can be switched back to widgets again.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Stepping back from the
brink - Thomas Wyatt argues the case for Company Voluntary Arrangements
which save businesses from bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With more than 25,000 British companies going to the wall last year, one
wonders how many even knew about a rescue option which could have kept some
of them alive.
The Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) is a procedure which is awkward to
invoke, by no means foolproof but certainly far less traumatic than
liquidation. It is also a solution with the added attraction of keeping more
people in employment and allowing managers and directors to retain their
powers.
Yet last year it was a management tool used by only 137 financially sick
companies - slightly over 0.5 per cent of the dying.
The CVA is designed to shield an insolvent company from creditors so that it
can recover sufficiently to trade its way out of its difficulties. There is
a time limit, usually two or three years, to effect the approved rescue
plan.
Only companies with a solid core business qualify for such treatment,
because any CVA proposal needs 75 per cent by value of its creditors to
approve it. These creditors will often include the VAT collector and the
taxman.
The creditors are betting on recovering far more money than they would from
a liquidation or receivership. And the company's directors are hoping to
regain their dignity (and profits) after emerging from the strictures of a
successful CVA.
Every CVA needs an insolvency practitioner - acting as an independent
professional adviser - to piece together, present and supervise the proposed
rescue plan. One such is Mark Goldstein of Morley &amp; Scott in Marlow, who is
currently nurturing 25 such rescue attempts under the little-known CVA
umbrella.
He says: 'There is a considerable public and even professional information
gap about the solid reliability of the CVA rescue option. CVAs are not a
panacea for insolvent companies, but under the right conditions they can be
a most powerful and helpful management tool.'
There are three reasons why CVAs have had such a low profile.
First they do not figure in the standardised fees which the leading
insolvency practitioners habitually charge their lending bank customers when
administering the more established mortuary routines of company liquidation
or receivership. Part of the public outrage about the fees charged by the
larger insolvency practices stems from the cosy contracts which the lending
banks' recovery units allow their 'approved' insolvency practitioners.
Such chosen insolvency practitioners tend to be rather more concerned with
speedily recouping the banks' lending exposure than any intensive care
efforts to rescue ailing companies.
The liquidation of even a 'small' business, for example, might entail only
five to six days' work from 'approved' insolvency practitioners, yet earn a
firm Pounds 10,000-plus even if it fails to recover a penny of the bank's
money. Furthermore the bank will need to indemnify the practitioner from any
legal risks from other creditors caught up in the insolvency.
Second a CVA takes years, rather than days, to complete, can be tricky to
start and will pay the insolvency practitioner relatively modestly. The
emphasis in such rescue attempts is on quality of time rather than quantity.
There is no risk indemnity from the bank. By definition, therefore, it is
the smaller practitioner, one not 'approved' by the leading banks but hired
by the financially distressed company itself, who has accepted and even
specialised in CVA work.
In addition to Morley &amp; Scott there are two other smaller insolvency
practitioners, Bartfield &amp; Co and Levy Gee &amp; Partners, that are also
supervising around 25 CVAs each.
And the third reason why we are so extraordinarily poorly informed about
CVAs? The crux of their workability is finding a further injection of cash.
More money must be found from somewhere to prime the stalled trading engine.
Often, however, the historic lending bank is against providing any further
cash to its insolvent customer.
Negotiating this CVA cash supply is thus the insolvency practitioner's
trickiest task, and yet it is precisely the one which both the banks and
their 'approved' larger insolvency practitioners most studiously ignore.
Their attitude is understandable: more immediate benefit comes from gutting
the secured assets or directors' guarantees from a troubled company than
creatively risking or seeking yet more funding to attempt its possible
salvation.
Because neither the leading high street banks nor the insolvency
practitioners find it worthwhile to mount such uncharacteristic rescue
efforts, we seldom hear about CVAs.
Out of sight is out of mind, despite the fact that CVAs were introduced six
years ago in part one of the 1986 Insolvency Act.
The difficult part in designing any CVA revolves around the awkwardness of
the word voluntary - awkward because there is no familiar route or set
format to offer the gradually co-operating participants. Each solution is
quite flexible within certain rules.
What particularly offends many financial fundamentalists is that uniquely
under a CVA (as in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US) the remaining sinning
directors and managers retain their executive powers.
Some feel this is equivalent to letting the fox loose again in the hen
house. Yet this misses the point. Insolvency often occurs innocently - the
result of circumstance or commercial naivety. Given a viable core business
and the genuine will to improve performance, many companies can pull
through, although there are no guarantees.
An important technical objection to the CVA is the fact that a dissident
creditor can block an arrangement by calling in his debts. There is no
interim protection to give the majority of creditors any time to agree a
CVA.
But such protection is not necessary in every case. Much depends on the
existing quality of communication with the company's creditors.
The company which has built up goodwill and an honourable reputation over
years of fair trading practices will seldom find itself abandoned if it can
propose a viable recovery plan.
The ultimate protection for any CVA lies in the diagnostic skill of the
insolvency practitioner, who at the first sign of any consistent awkwardness
on the part of directors or managers, will simply abort the co-operative
effort and move on to liquidation or receivership.
Certainly no insolvency practitioner wishes to be involved with a rescue
attempt that he judges will fail.
If the lending banks made sustained efforts to inform both their recovery
units and their high street managers about the practical, emergency validity
of CVAs, several hundred more British companies would undoubtedly be saved
from unnecessary death every year.
To do so would entail painfully questioning long-standing routines with the
banks' existing insolvency practitioners and possibly forging fresh
alliances with some of the smaller practices that have specialised in CVA
rescues.
The financial community's ability to recognise and bite this bullet may
prove crucial for any national recovery. To cure our economy we need to
learn honestly to cure sick companies rather than simply to pity and
eviscerate them.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Wigan peer groups band
together to offer advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took 18 months of discussion, persuasion and the occasional bust-up to
bring together the four main organisations which provide help and advice for
business in Wigan, Lancashire.
Finally, last April, the local Training and Enterprise Council, known as
Metrotec, the chamber of commerce, the tourism association and the Wigan and
Leigh Small Firms Club set up the Wigan Metrotec Employers' Association and
moved into shared offices in the centre of town.
With final details of the government's plans for a national network of
one-stop business advice centres expected within the next few days,
initiatives of the sort being undertaken in Wigan are of great interest to
government and other business support organisations.
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary and the main mover behind
the one-stop shop programme, will be be seeking bids from up to 15 Tecs to
run pilot centres.
Geoff Birkett, marketing director of Metrotec, believes that the employers'
association would qualify to become one of these.
The pilots will be expected to start operating from April 1 but the
government hopes to have a national network of about 200 advice centres
within two years. The purpose is to rationalise Britain's fragmented
business support networks so that they become more effective and provide
better value for money.
There is unlikely to be a shortage of bids for the pilots. Indeed, the
problem facing the government in the coming months may be to restrain local
advice centres from starting up in an unco-ordinated way and damaging the
idea of a cohesive, high-quality network.
Metrotec began lobbying other business support organisations shortly after
it was set up two-and-a-half-years ago. 'We were concerned that there was no
single voice for business,' says Rod England, a Metrotec director, chairman
of the employers' association and deputy managing director of the local HJ
Heinz factory.
The four organisations which make up the employers' association held their
first meeting in July 1991. 'There was a natural suspicion and we had to
make clear there was no hidden agenda,' says Birkett. The smaller,
long-established business groups were wary of being taken over by the Tec,
with its Pounds 10m of government funding.
Despite these suspicions the four organisations came closer together and the
move into shared offices in Wigan town centre last April removed the
remaining barriers. Wigan New Enterprise, the local enterprise agency, is in
the same building but has yet formally to join the combined grouping while
Wigan's chamber of trade has decided in principle to join.
The four organisations continue to have their own managing boards though the
distinctions are 'melting' and new members are recruited to the employers'
association rather than to the chamber or the business club. This avoids a
difficulty which might have arisen with differing subscription levels set by
the different organisations.
Although it has been the Tec which has led the Wigan project, setting up the
employers' association as an 'umbrella' organisation means that the
partnership could continue if the government ever lost enthusiasm for Tecs.
Sharing offices has brought numerous practical benefits. The four
organisations run a single information centre for telephone inquiries and
personal visits while there is a shared electronic database. Marketing and
recruitment are carried out jointly.
Despite the co-operation that has already been achieved, there are other
important groups which have still to join the network. When the employers'
association moves to purpose-built offices near Wigan Pier in 18 months it
will be joined by the local authority's economic development unit.
The Wigan initiative has attracted interest throughout the north-west.
'People come in and think it looks easy,' says Birkett. 'But they shouldn't
underestimate the pain involved.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Double trouble - Global financial
trading groups must guard against inadvertently paying tax twice over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies operating in the US will have drawn little comfort from
President-elect Bill Clinton's campaign boast that he could increase
revenues by more than Dollars 10bn a year by 'preventing tax avoidance by
foreign corporations'.
The extent to which Mr Clinton intends to act on his threat remains to be
seen, particularly in light of last week's better than expected
third-quarter US growth figures.
What seems certain is that Congress will reintroduce foreign income tax
legislation early next year. Congress originally considered the legislation
last May but shelved it because of the US elections. If passed, the bill
would, among other things, require foreign companies to report minimum
taxable income in the US regardless of the true profitabilility or otherwise
of their US-affiliates; the sale of shares in US companies would also be
taxed.
The implications of this tax assault on foreign companies in the US could be
far-reaching. Indeed, US efforts to increase tax revenues without raising
taxation on individuals is already beginning to have an impact on global
financial trading.
According to Mr James macLachlan, a partner in the London office of the
international law firm, Baker &amp; McKenzie, the risk of inadvertently becoming
liable to tax in several jurisdictions for capital markets' trading profits
is now 'one of the most critical issues facing global financial dealers'.
Billions of dollars of financial products are traded globally daily. In the
market for financial derivatives alone, Dollars 923.4bn of swaps - the trade
of one form of debt for another - were written in the first half of 1991.
The implications of being assessed for tax on the profits of this trade in
more than one jurisdiction are far-reaching. The problem is compounded by
the fact that different jurisdictions apply different rules in determining
where income is properly taxable and what can be deducted against it.
The US rules are particularly ambiguous. In spite of the growth in global
trading in financial products in recent years, the US has not adopted a
comprehensive tax regime aimed specifically at determining the geographic
source of a company's income on a global deal.
Instead, the US continues to tax global traders under a regime designed to
levy multinationals engaged in more traditional global trade such as
manufacturing.
According to Baker &amp; McKenzie's US tax lawyers, applying this traditional
tax regime to global trading has resulted in tax rules which are 'ambiguous,
hard to comply with and which could potentially result in double taxation of
income from global trading' - as Australia's Westpac Banking Corporation
recently discovered to its cost.
Earlier this month Westpac announced it would halve its final dividend after
being hit by a previously undisclosed US tax liability of ADollars 115m
(Pounds 52m). The tax charge related to interest rate and currency swaps
assigned between Westpac's New York branch and other non-US branches in
1991-92. The liability came to light during preparation of the bank's 1991
tax return. Coming on top of a undersubscribed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue,
the tax liability was disastrous news for Westpac. The difficulty of
allocating profits and losses geographically on such transactions is widely
acknowledged. Global trading is done in a 24-hour market; deals originating
in New York may not be realised as profit until the contract is closed hours
later in Tokyo or London.
The inference drawn from the Westpac case is that there is a clear risk the
US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will treat a given swap, regardless of
where it was done, as connected to the trade or business of a foreign dealer
in the US - therefore as US income subject to US tax. It also appears that
corresponding expenses or losses on the swap book incurred by offshore
branches are not deductible in the US against that US income.
Westpac was forced to pay US taxes on profits on which it had already paid
income tax in other countries, yet was unable to offset losses on matching
deals. Westpac is not alone in being exposed to this double risk. Many other
financial institutions could also find themselves in the same position. So
what can they do?
Mr macLachlan says there are two options. First, negotiate an advance ruling
with the tax authorities setting out a simple basis on which trading profits
will be allocated to each country involved in a deal. Second, dealers should
spend time and money restructuring their operations to minimise the risk of
double taxation. This requires close back office scrutiny of where deals are
done.
The trouble with negotiating advanced rulings with tax authorities is that
several countries, notably the UK, have long opposed giving advance rulings
on the tax treatment of global financial dealings. They are also generally
opposed to allocating profit by pre-determined arbitrary formulae not
related to the way a group's business is actually organised.
There is an additional problem in the UK. The Inland Revenue lacks the
resources to provide this sort of service to taxpayers and, in the context
of global financial trading, it also lacks expertise.
The US has no such problems. The IRS recently introduced just such an
advanced pricing agreement (APA). France, Italy and Belgium have told the US
they want nothing to do with APAs, while the UK Inland Revenue's position
appears to be shifting.
Japan's Sumitomo Bank recently secured an APA from the IRS which was
accepted by the US and the Hong Kong tax authorities. Barclays Bank is
believed to have negotiated a bilateral APA for its US/UK capital market
operations. A further 20-30 applications for APAs are pending with the IRS.
APAs are not without difficulties and so are unlikely to satisfy everyone.
APAs can take years to negotiate; they require full disclosures; not all
countries are willing to participate; APAs only last three years; they
create a tax result totally out of line with group commercial accounting
practices (a problem still unresolved); APAs are arbitrary and might result
in one country getting a bigger slice of tax than it should.
The message to financial institutions from the Westpac saga and the
aggressive attempts being made by the IRS to maximise tax revenues is
simple: corporations need to review their global tax strategy. Companies
must ask themselves whether they are exposed to double or multiple taxation
and, if they are, whether they can improve their arrangements within
existing tax rules, or whether it would be sensible to seek an APA.
Ultimately, traders know that political realities will restrain tax
authorities' pursuit of tax revenues from global trading. Even the US cannot
afford to risk driving international capital markets offshore to rival money
centres by being too aggressive over tax.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: A little light on environment law -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court last week placed a strict interpretation on the
obligations of Community countries under EC environmental rules covering the
quality of drinking water.
In two cases brought by the Commission against Germany and the UK, for
failure to implement and apply the 1980 drinking water directive, the Court
agreed with the Commission when condemning Germany and holding the UK in
breach of EC environmental rules.
The cases give some insight into the way the ECJ approaches EC environmental
law which could guide interested parties in other areas of environmental
regulations.
The Commission made three complaints against the UK. First, the Commission
successfully established before the Court that the UK had failed to bring
into force binding provisions ensuring complete implementation of the
directive.
In particular, the UK's Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 did
not cover water used in the food production industry and the directive had
not yet been implemented formally in Northern Ireland or Scotland until the
Water Supply (Water Quality)(Scotland) Regulations 1990.
Second, the Court upheld the Commission's claim that water supplied in 28
supply zones in England exceeded the maximum admissible concentration levels
for nitrates and, when correctly interpreted, was not covered by unilateral
derogations relied on by the UK.
The ECJ rejected the UK's arguments that the EC rules did not oblige member
countries to ensure that drinking water met the minimum requirements laid
down but merely required them to take all practicable steps to comply with
the standards. This meant that the UK could not blame the excessive levels
of nitrate in drinking water in the East Anglia supply zones in question on
the use of fertilisers by farmers, beyond its control.
Again, in rejecting the UK's imaginative approach to its obligations and the
permissible exceptions under the directive, the ECJ limited the applicable
derogations to those expressly provided by the EC rules. Consequently, the
Court can be expected in future environmental cases to refuse to make
allowances for the activities of third parties or the conditions of the
physical environment which may involve extrinsic factors, outside the
complete control of a member state.
The UK, however, successfully defended itself against the Commission's
complaint that lead levels in 17 supply zones serving a population of about
52,000 inhabitants in Scotland exceeded the prescribed lead limits.
The UK's arguments illustrate another aspect of the interpretation of EC
environmental rules, likely to be relevant in other cases.
The rules in question provide maximum lead limits in drinking water,
established in accordance with general testing procedures laid down by the
directive. Where a house had lead pipes, the rules are more flexible in that
they only require action by a member country if a threshold double the
general limit is consistently exceeded, on the basis of particular tests.
The Court said this resulted from a correct interpretation of the specific
notes on the meaning of the technical parameters stipulated in the
directive. Consequently, in spite of the generally strict approach to member
countries' obligations illustrated by the rules on nitrates, member states
may be given greater flexibility by the small print, as in the case of lead
standards.
In the case against Germany, the Court upheld the Commission on two
complaints against the German law implementing the 1980 directive in the
context of derogations. First, Germany permitted derogations outside the
narrow parameters of the directive; and second, the German Lander had not
been obliged by the implementing law to notify the Commission of such
derogations permitted by them.
Case C-237/90, Commission v Germany, ECJ FC, November 24 1992; Case
C-337/89, Commission v UK, ECJ FC, November 25 1992.
Other Cases
Case C-286/90, Anklagemyndigheden v Poulsen and Diva Navigation Corp, ECJ
FC, November 24 1992 - enforcement of EC salmon conservation rules against
vessels registered in non-Community state.
Case C-376/90, Commission v Belgium, ECJ FC, November 25 1992 - infringement
proceedings relating to Directive 80/836/Euratom on protection against
radiation - member state permitted to adopt stricter limits than in the
directive.

Part of the three-year plan will also be to campaign for a number of changes

FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Law Lords seek help on maternity leave
case - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Lords have asked the European Court of Justice for help in resolving
the difficult question of whether an employer is guilty of sex
discrimination in dismissing a female employee who becomes pregnant shortly
after being hired to cover for another employee taking maternity leave.
The Law Lords said last week there was no doubt that in general it was
unlawful direct discrimination to dismiss a woman because she was pregnant.
But in the present case the critical factor was that the employee would not
be available for work at the time when the job for which she was
specifically recruited was to be performed.
A final decision in the case of Webb v EMO Air Cargo (UK) was suspended
pending a ruling by the European Court as to whether the issue had been
affected by recent European Court rulings on the interpretation of the 1976
EC sex discrimination directive.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row focuses on two lives of Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HAZY divide between a cabinet minister's private and public life is at
the centre of the political squabble over who should have paid the costs
that Mr Norman Lamont incurred last year in evicting his tenant.
The Treasury says it was right for the chancellor to have had financial help
after the antics of his tenant appeared in the News of the World in April
last year.
Maintaining public confidence in his office justified the expense, in the
view of Sir Peter Middleton, then Treasury permanent secretary, according to
memos released yesterday. But Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said
guidelines had been interpreted so widely that they could be used to resist
'almost every attack against any minister'. The chancellor had, in fact,
brought in his own libel lawyer to protect his personal reputation, Mr Brown
said.
Supposedly defining the divide between costs incurred by ministers in their
private and public capacities is guidance supplied to departmental permanent
secretaries by the Treasury solicitors.
The Cabinet Office took the unprecedented step yesterday of publishing an
extract from that guidance. It says that, 'where the libel relates to the
conduct of a minister in the performance of his official duties and it is in
the public interest that proceedings should be brought, the minister may
properly be indemnified out of public funds for the reasonable costs of
bringing those proceedings'.
Whitehall insiders confirmed yesterday that it is standard practice for
ministers to use government lawyers when they believe newspapers are about
to publish untrue allegations about their private lives.
Other precedents, confirmed by the government, were help given to Lord
(formerly Mr Nigel) Lawson when chancellor over legal proceedings brought
following remarks he made about the Johnson Matthey Bank and to Lord Young
as trade and industry secretary when challenged over his private interests
in relation to the House of Fraser stores.
In Mr Lamont's case - at least in the eyes of Labour - the distinction
between public duty and private responsibility and the argument about using
private lawyers are less clear.
Certainly the Treasury believed Mr Lamont had a case. It initially proposed
paying more than just Carter-Ruck and Partners' Pounds 4,700 bill for the
initial press statement and handling press inquiries.
A memo in May last year suggested also paying 'a share of the costs of the
legal proceedings to secure the removal of an unsatisfactory tenant and all
those associated with the application for an early hearing'. Mr Lamont said
that memo came at Sir Peter Middleton's initiative. The offer of extra help
had been diluted by the time Sir Terence Burns - his successor - approved
the Pounds 4,700.
A memo sent to the Treasury accounts branch in August last year said the sum
had been approved 'on the grounds that it was important quickly to put the
record straight so as to retain full confidence in the office of chancellor
and its holder'. The Treasury said that a private lawyer was used because a
statement had to be issued on the night the News of the World was printed
and required specialist lawyers.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Borrie set to head Labour tax probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Gordon Borrie, until last June director-general of the Office of Fair
Trading, is set to head Labour's Commission into Social Justice - the
party's showpiece inquiry into the tax and benefits system.
The commission, proposed by Mr John Smith during his campaign for the party
leadership, is intended to examine key questions for Labour's future policy
proposals.
These range from the relative values of universal and means-tested benefits
and such issues as the merits or otherwise of progressive and redistributive
taxation. The exact terms of reference for the commission - widely
characterised as a new Beveridge report - and its personnel have yet to be
agreed.
However, Labour has confirmed that it will be independent of the party, will
be serviced by the non-affiliated left-leaning think tank, the Institute of
Public Policy Research, and its findings will outline options rather than
define positions.
About 12 other commission members are expected to be named, alongside Sir
Gordon, largely from the centre or centre-left of the British political
spectrum. Academics, Liberal Democrats and representatives of pressure
groups are all likely to be included.
The recruitment of Sir Gordon, 61, to chair the commission - still not
formally confirmed - will be seen as a coup for Labour.
Sir Gordon is a respected academic and QC with a long track record for
working on important social issues, who twice contested parliamentary seats
for Labour in the 1950s. At around the same time he published with Professor
Aubrey Diamond a seminal book on consumer issues, The Consumer, Society and
the Law, that formed the agenda for the consumer movement in later years.
Since then, Sir Gordon has served on bodies such as the Equal Opportunities
Commission while working for 16 years as OFT director-general, surviving, in
spite of his liberal credentials, the scrutiny of Mrs Thatcher's
premiership.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Backstage wrangling over Maastricht
gets under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATHFINDERS for what will be a marathon Commons struggle over
ratification of the Maastricht treaty begin their work in earnest today as
the bill starts a six-month progress through its committee stage.
But unprecedented preliminary meetings with MPs last night gave some
indication of the complexity now faced by Mr Michael Morris, the genial but
shrewd chairman of the Commons ways and means committee. As deputy speaker,
it is to Mr Morris that the task falls of adjudicating between the warring
views of the government, the opposition and the Euro-sceptics.
At a meeting, scheduled for 10.30 this morning, he will join fellow deputy
speakers and a phalanx of Commons clerks and officials to work out the means
to find a logical route through a barrage of points of order.
The calculation is that over 30 aspects of the treaty merit reasonable
debating time in the Commons, enough to give two full days to the subject
for every week of the session between now and the end of May. More than 400
amendments have been tabled for what is a three-clause bill, barely filling
a sheet of A4 paper.
In an attempt to minimise wholly unnecessary disruption, Mr Morris passed on
his first conclusions to MPs last night. He indicated that he will group
linked issues together and try to establish a running order. Some amendments
will be dumped.
It looks as if a Liberal Democrat amendment, requiring the reinstatement of
the largely decorative preamble to the treaty, will kick off the
ratification process. Mr Morris has also indicated that Labour's demand for
the social chapter of workplace rights to be put into the bill could be
taken.
But there are more doubts over whether the same applies to pressure from the
Euro-sceptics for a debate on a referendum on the bill. Faced by a barrage
of points of order, expected to be unleashed just as soon as the committee
stage begins shortly after 3.30pm, it may be that the pragmatic course of
simply allowing such a discussion will prevail.
Most Euro-sceptic MPs are hoping that an unexpected upset - an amendment
that requires a renegotiation of the treaty, for example - will sink the
legislation. Last night Tory rebels were meeting to discuss their tactics in
the weeks and months to come. Their aim, according to Mr Michael Spicer, is
to debate the bill in an orderly fashion without inordinate filibustering.
Labour, meanwhile, appears to share that view but has imposed a three-line
whip - obliging its MPs to attend. By so doing, it threatens the government
with ambushes and aims to help erode its legislative programme as well as
the spirits of Tory MPs.
Nobody doubts that by the end of May - the government's broad schedule for
completion of the committee stage - the House will be staring-eyed with
frustration and exhaustion. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy
leader, concludes that opponents will be worn down into backing the
government's closure motions just to end the agony.
As one Europhile speculated of the sceptics last night: 'They are going to
irritate their way to eventual defeat.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Old-fashioned tip-off led The Sun
to story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUN'S exclusive on Mr Norman Lamont's Access bill came about in a very
old-fashioned way - a call out of the blue to the paper's newsdesk, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
If a conspiracy against the chancellor of the exchequer was involved then it
was a very elaborate one.
All the signs point to someone trying to make some money - and a relatively
small amount - out of confidental information on Mr Lamont's personal
finances.
The man who contacted the Sun over the Access account was representing the
person who had direct access to the information. At no stage did Sun
reporters meet anyone other than the third-party contact.
The Sun is understood to have paid only around Pounds 200 for the story,
considerably less than it might have been worth.
It is believed that Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, had no doubts,
then or now, that the story was an important one and that it was right for
the paper to print it.
Yesterday the paper had a measure of comfort for the beleaguered chancellor,
showing a copy of Mr Lamont's wine bill indicating that he had, as he
claimed, bought three bottles of claret on November 15 the day before it had
been suggested he had bought champagne and cigarettes.
There was also support for Mr Lamont in his new controversy over the public
contribution towards the costs of evicting a tenant from his house.
Meanwhile Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, is
likely to have conversations with his colleagues to see whether publication
of the story might have breached at least the spirit of the newspaper
industry's code of practice. The question is likely to be whether it was
right for the newspaper to publish information normally considered
confidential when there was no question of Mr Lamont having done anything
illegal.

Michael Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday. 'I know that many
people share my concern at the very large pay rises for senior management in
the water industry over the last two years,' he said.
Since the 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales were
privatised late in 1989, their top executives' salaries, bonuses and share
option allocations have risen sharply and the companies' twice-yearly
publication of profits has often provoked public criticism of pay levels.
Mr Howard added that the government wanted public sector pay rises next year
to be below 1.5 per cent. 'We are entitled to look to the leaders of utility
companies to set an example,' he said.
Speaking at Thames Water's opening of a new water treatment plant, he
emphasised that his remarks were not directed at Sir Roy Watts, Thames'
chairman, who saw his pay cut in the last financial year from Pounds 160,000
to Pounds 145,000 because of a fall in bonuses.
Mr Howard's remarks drew a sharp rebuttal from some companies. Mr Dennis
Grove, chairman of North West Water, who received a 15 per cent increase in
the year to March 1992 to Pounds 166,000, said: 'We have to pay the market
rates to get and keep the good people. These jobs are very demanding.' He
added that only part of a director's pay was charged to the water company's
core, regulated business.
However Mr Andrew Horne, corporate affairs manager of Northumbrian Water,
said: 'I don't think in the future that you will see anything like the past
few years' increases.'
In the year to March 1992 the salary of Northumbrian's chairman Sir Michael
Straker rose by 51 per cent to Pounds 77,000 - one of the highest rises
although one of the smallest total amounts.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Coal sale to await pit review
debate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT would take no decision on the timing of British Coal
privatisation until both houses of parliament had been able to debate the
results of the pit closure review, Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, said
yesterday.
His assurance came as ministers were attacked by opposition peers for
seeking to press ahead with the bill paving the way for the privatisation of
British Coal and of British Rail while the review of the pit closure
programme was still under way.
The legislation allows the two organisations to appoint advisers to deal
with financial and legal issues in the run-up to privatisation.
The Lords voted not to delay the paving bill until early next year when the
white paper following the coal review is due to be published.
The decision to proceed marks the overcoming of a vital hurdle for BR
privatisation, already postponed for some months.

<TEXT>
CLOSER monitoring of personal pension schemes to ensure that any abuses do
not go unchecked was promised by Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior pensions
minister, in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes.
She envisaged an enlargement of existing procedures for checking the
reliability of undertakings given by those marketing such schemes and the
levels of commission charged.
Miss Widdecombe assured Mr Archy Kirkwood, pensions spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats, that so-called 'front loading' - where commission eats up
most of the initial annual contribution - would be taken into account.
Mr Terry Rooney (Lab Bradford North) insisted that where abuses did occur
suspension of the insurance company or other organisation concerned would
not be adequate and that 'meaningful compensation' should be available to
existing holders of personal pensions who had been duped.
Miss Widdecombe told him: 'If we were to discover evidence of widespread
difficulties or malpractice it would be very much our intention to track all
those who have already taken out personal pensions'.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, moved the second reading of the
Social Security Bill, saying 5m people had chosen personal pensions since
their introduction in 1988 - 10 times as many as predicted.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: NHS drugs provision to be reformed
 -Move to curb steep rise in costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government intends to widen the range of drugs available without a
prescription as part of a drive to control the National Health Service's
soaring pharmaceuticals bill.
Drugs are the services' biggest expenditure after staff costs. The annual
drugs bill - Pounds 2.3bn in England alone - is currently rising by nearly
12 per cent in cash terms.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, has set her officials a target
of bringing the pace of increase much closer to the rate of inflation.
She will tell a Royal Pharmaceutical Society dinner tonight that she cannot
justify holding NHS pay within the government's 1.5 per cent guidelines
while allowing the drugs bill to rise so far ahead of inflation.
She believes extending the range of drugs available without prescription
would be consistent with the government's Health of the Nation strategy of
making individuals more aware of personal healthcare issues, as well as
producing 'significant' savings.
The voluntary pharmaceutical pricing regulation scheme, which controls the
industry's profits on drugs supplied to the NHS, is being renegotiated
between the government and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry. Mrs Bottomley wants to see progress on a replacement agreement by
the new year.
She will point out tonight that the German government is legislating to cut
a range of drug prices by 5 per cent and then to impose a freeze.
The government last month announced plans to extend the selected list
system, under which NHS doctors cannot prescribe specified drugs when
effective lower-cost alternatives are available. Talks are taking place
between the Department of Health and the British Medical Association on
other means of tightening up prescribing.
Research by the Department of Health shows that the prescribing costs of GP
fundholders, who control their own budgets, have risen by 3 per cent less
than family doctors in general. By next year about 25 per cent of the
population will be patients of fundholders. The government wants the same
prescribing disciplines to apply to all doctors.
The pharmaceutical industry has attacked previous attempts to control NHS
drugs expenditure, arguing that they could affect research and employment as
well as patient choice.
'I recognise that the industry has a Pounds 1bn balance-of-payments surplus,
employs 80,000 people and has a strong research-and-development base,'said
Mrs Bottomley. 'It is a problem calling for balanced measures, but we must
get value for money and ensure that the re-sources . . . are used to treat
as many patients as possible.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine vows action against abuse
of market power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the government announced in 1987 that it intended to reform legislation
on restrictive trade practices and givethe authorities stronger powers to
tackle anti-competitive behaviour, consumer groups complained that the
government was addressing only half of the problem.
Yesterday's green paper, launched by trade and industry secretary Mr Michael
Heseltine, is designed to deal with the other half - abuse by individual
companies of their power in the marketplace to stifle competition.
The proposals are targeted at companies abusing their strength to try and
drive out competitors. They are also aimed at those who use their power to
take advantage of customers and suppliers.
Existing legislation dealing with abuse of market power in the Fair Trading
Act 1973 and the Competition Act 1980 is weak on deterrents.
Under European Community law anti-competitive practices are prohibited.
Companies which indulge in price-fixing or try to force competitors out of
the market fall foul of EC competition rules and can be fined up to 10 per
cent of their worldwide turnover.
However, under UK law a business accused of anti-competitive behaviour will
not be penalised unless and until it has been investigated by the
competition authorities and has subsequently broken undertakings not to
offend again. There are no powers to impose penalties for past conduct or to
provide damages for victims of abuse.
Because the UK law is seen as weak on deterrents many people argue that UK
competition authorities need stronger powers such as those wielded by the
European Commission.
The government is now seeking views on whether reform of the UK law along
these lines would be a good idea. But while adopting a regime based on the
EC system would appear to be the easiest solution, there are aspects of the
present regime the government is keen to preserve.
By adopting a case-by-case approach and not automatically assuming that
apparent abuse of monopoly power is against the public interest the UK
system is seen to be less rigid than the EC's.
The fundamental difference between the two systems comes in the definition
of market power. The UK takes a more broad approach. A business is deemed to
have a simple monopoly if it has 25 per cent of the market, irrespective of
whether it has real market power. The existence of a simple monopoly is
determined by a statistical test.
Under EC rules actual dominance is the issue. The commission takes the view
that a dominant position exists when a business has at least 40 per cent of
the market and its rivals have significantly smaller shares. Other factors
such as barriers to entry for new competitors and anti-competitive behaviour
are also relevant.
So instead of simply adopting an EC-based approach the government has put
forward three options for change.
The first is to strengthen the existing legislation. This would allow the
competition authorities to retain a case-by-case approach rather than
treating anti-competitive behaviour as automatically unlawful. But the
government would strengthen the investigation powers of the Office of Fair
Trading; give more scope to the director-general of fair trading to accept
binding undertakings from companies without an investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission; and make provision for businesses to be
sued for damages and possibly subject to civil penalties for continuing
abuse of market power after a complaint has been referred to the monopolies
commission.
The advantage of this is that it would retain the present flexibility. But
it would not address the fundamental problem of weak deterrents and it would
only offer limited redress to victims of anti-competitive behaviour.
The second option would be to introduce a general prohibition on abuse of
market power backed by tough investigatory powers for the Office of Fair
Trading and financial penalties. The monopolies provisions of the Fair
Trading Act and the anti-competitive practices measures in the Competition
Act would be repealed.
This would bring UK practice more closely into line with continental Europe
and would offer a more uniform system for companies operating in the UK and
in continental Europe. It would however cover more market situations than EC
rules do, and the government would continue to allow the competition
authorities to use divestment and price controls as remedies. The only real
drawback to this is that it would apply in a narrower range of market
situations than existing UK legislation because, for example, it would not
enable the competition authorities to look at possible market abuse by
duopolies or complex monopolies.
The third option is to repeal measures against anti-competitive practices
measures in the Competition Act and introduce a prohibition with the same
scope as the EC rules, but keep the monopoly powers under the Fair Trading
Act.
This is seen by the government as offering the best chance of an effective
deterrent while retaining the breadth and flexibility of the existing
legislation.
The disadvantage of this option is that operating two different systems in
parallel could increase uncertainty for business.
Under the second and third options companies could be fined up to 10 per
cent of their worldwide turnover for anti-competitive behaviour.
The government says, however, that in practice the competition authorities
would apply the Euro-style prohibition where a single company is accused of
abusing its strength in the market and the monopoly provisions of the Fair
Trading Act would be confined to detailed investigation of markets where
competition between a number of companies is not working effectively, and
where a complex monopoly operating against the public interest is suspected.

privatisation.
Mr Greatrex won 2,326 votes to Mr Lynk's 1,586. The union has about 15,000

FT  01 DEC 92 / Planned power deal boosts hopes for coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS within the electricity industry on coal purchases received a boost
yesterday when the chairman of one regional company said he hoped to reach
agreement with the generators before the end of the government's energy
review.
Mr John Harris, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, said he believed that
non-binding heads-of-terms agreements - establishing a framework for local
deals - could be initialled between regional electricity companies and
generators before Christmas. There were no large stumbling blocks left, he
said.
His company would then want to move quickly in bilateral talks with the
generators on a contract to take its share of the 40m tonnes already agreed
for next year and 30m thereafter. 'We believe it would bring stability to
the marketplace and to our customers,' he said.
Failure to reach agreement between the regional companies and the generators
has left British Coal unable to sign long-term agreements on sales to the
generators.
Mr Harris's comments are significant because his company is leading talks
with the generators on behalf of the regional companies.
Although some companies remain doubtful about signing any deals before the
end of the review, a decision to do so by East Midlands would provide a
powerful stimulus for them to act. Eastern Electricity has already signed a
letter of intent with the generators and Dr James Smith, its chairman, said
a full deal could be signed shortly.
Mr Harris said yesterday that he detected a change of mood among other
regional companies in recent days on the heads-of-terms talks, with more
companies willing for them to proceed.
Meanwhile Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, joined other
chiefs of regional companies who have expressed opposition to delaying the
liberalisation of the electricity market as a way of increasing coal sales.
He said the delay would not be consistent with the development of a
competitive market.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Heseltine could face court battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COALFIELD communities threatened by pit closures are likely to widen their
campaign against the government by taking legal action against Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The first steps towards court were taken yesterday when Mr Anthony Scrivener
QC argued that both Mr Heseltine and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity regulator, had been in breach of their statutory duty under the
1989 Electricity Act.
Mr Scrivener has conducted an inquiry into pit closures for Nottinghamshire
County Council. Public and private-sector organisations in Nottinghamshire,
fearful of seven pit closures with direct and indirect job losses of 14,000,
have been vocal in their protests.
Mr Scrivener also suggested that action could be taken in the European Court
against Mr Heseltine under Articles 90 and 92 of the Treaty of Rome, which
established the European Community. These relate to distortion of
competition by publicly owned enterprises.
Mr Scrivener contended both that 'there is unequivocal evidence of a rigged
market' in electricity and that, under the terms of the Electricity Act, the
secretary of state, in this case Mr Heseltine, has a duty to promote
competition.
'If the evidence is such that competition is being distorted, as claimed,
then not only has he the power to act but he has a duty to do so and in the
final resort interested parties have a right, enforceable in the courts, to
require him to perform his duty,' he said.
Mr Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the council, said: 'We will hope to get
our partners together to seek legal redress.' He was referring to the
councils in the Coalfield Communities Campaign.
Mr Scrivener also considered that the legality of a levy on fossil fuels and
a subsidy to nuclear power 'must be questionable' under the Treaty of Rome.
He said that 'proceedings could be taken . . . without getting involved in
the more controversial question of governments in the EC providing subsidies
 -which is a political 'hot potato'.'
The Scrivener report was yesterday submitted to Mr Heseltine who is
preparing a white paper on energy policy, and to the Commons trade and
industry committee.

MR ROY LYNK, the Nottinghamshire miners' leader who strongly backed
government privatisation plans for the coal industry, has been ousted as
president of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
He was convincingly defeated by Mr Neil Greatrex, the UDM's Nottinghamshire
area president, who is expected to take a more sceptical view of
privatisation.
Mr Greatrex won 2,326 votes to Mr Lynk's 1,586. The turnout was about 4,000
of the union's membership of about 15,000.
Mr Greatrex is a more traditional mining industry unionist than Mr Lynk and
called recently for a general strike against the pit closures.
He stresses, however, that whatever his personal views he will be subject to
union policy which supports an active role in the privatisation process.
Mr Greatrex also insists that his election will not lead to immediate
rapprochement with the National Union of Mineworkers.
The NUM claims to be winning members back from the UDM although the UDM
denies that.
Mr Lynk said after staging a sit-in protest at Silverhill Colliery near
Mansfield that he would step down from the presidency in protest at the
government's betrayal of his support. But he decided not to withdraw from
the election which Mr Greatrex had always been favourite to win.
Lawyers acting for the NUM are attempting to obtain government papers
concerning the selection of the 10 pits chosen for immediate closure under
British Coal's pit closure programme.
The move follows claims that selection of the pits resulted from dealing
between ministers and Tory backbenchers to avoid a government defeat over
the issue rather than assessment of their economic prospects.

COALFIELD communities threatened by pit closures are likely to widen their
campaign against the UK government by taking legal action against Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The first steps towards the courts were taken yesterday when Mr Anthony
Scrivener QC, in the report of an inquiry into pit closures he has been
conducting for Nottinghamshire County Council, argued that both Mr Heseltine
and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, had been in
breach of their statutory duty under the Electricity Act 1989.
He also suggested that action could be taken in the European Court against

competition by publicly-owned enterprises.
Mr Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the council, said: 'We will hope to get
our partners together to seek legal redress.'
The partners to which he referred are the local authorities which are
members of the Coalfield Communities Campaign. Both public and
private-sector organisations in Nottinghamshire, fearful of seven colliery
closures with direct and indirect job losses of 14,000, have been vocal in
their protests.
The Scrivener report, which includes two volumes of evidence, was yesterday
submitted to Mr Heseltine, in connection with his promised white paper on
energy policy, and to the Commons select committee on trade and industry.
Mr Scrivener contended both that 'there is unequivocal evidence of a rigged
market' in electricity and that, under the terms of the Electricity Act, the
secretary of state, in this case Mr Heseltine, has a duty to promote
competition.
'If the evidence is such that competition is being distorted, as claimed,

the Treaty of Rome. He suggested that 'proceedings could be taken . . .
without getting involved in the more controversial question of governments
in the EC providing subsidies - which is a political 'hot potato'.'
Mr Scrivener concluded from evidence presented to the three-day enquiry he
conducted in Nottingham last month that 'Europe's largest coal resource can
be turned off because of distortions in a non-competitive market.' There
should be, instead, a national energy policy which includes 'securing and
maintaining an indigenous supply of coal.'
He also suggested that there should be a moratorium on electricity supplies
from France, the decommissioning of older nuclear power stations, no
building of new gas power stations and 15-year contracts for British Coal
from the power generators - the same as gas contracts.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Trust closed Tessa after discussions with Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM Capital Trust, a banking institution, said yesterday that it had
closed its Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (Tessa) when it realised that
it would not be able to use the deposits as it had first intended.
Mr Vernon Norton, a director and company secretary, said the trust had hoped
to link the deposits to fixed-interest loans, but then deemed this 'not
prudent' because of the requirement for Tessa deposits to remain liquid.
BCT has about 200 Tessa depositors and it has written to them saying that it
has decided to close its scheme after discussions with the Bank of England.
It had offered a fixed interest rate of 12 per cent over five years.
The company's accounts showed that it made pre-tax trading losses of Pounds
571,000 for the year to December 31 last year and of Pounds 620,000 for the
previous 12 months. It had assets last year of Pounds 1.6m, and made
provisions for bad and doubtful debts of Pounds 824,000. It had deposits of
Pounds 944,000.
Mr Norton said BCT had suffered losses as a result of the declines in the
property market and expected to make further provisions in the current year.
He added that the executive board of the company had been 'wound down', that
it no longer had a managing director, and that new plans on its future
structure would be put forward within the next 6 months.
The accounts show that there was a capital injection of Pounds 600,000 in
July last year and was continuing to try to find other suitable investors.
They also show that the company bought a car from Mr Mukkaram Syed, a
director, for Pounds 16,000 during the year, and proposed to change its
auditors from Overton Salt to KPMG Peat Marwick.
The letter sent to Tessa depositors last week said losses in 1990 and 1991
had caused a 'major erosion in the capital base of the company' and that
further losses were continuing in spite of the Pounds 600,000 capital
injection.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Prior-year changes 'rare' in accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 5 per cent of British companies made adjustments in the past 12 months
to the figures shown in accounts of previous years in spite of the large
number of recent accounting changes, a survey by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based monitoring service, showed yesterday.
The finding raises doubts about the ability of readers of accounts to draw
comparisons either with other companies or over time.
Prior-year adjustments are made by companies when their financial statements
are adjusted as a result of changes to their accounting policies. The
proportion doing so has remained roughly unchanged at 5 per cent for the
past three years. All but 14 per cent of the adjustments were made as a
result of changes in accounting policy.
Most adjustments were made for goodwill - the difference between the
purchase price of an acquisition and its net book value. Many of these
reflected new guidelines from the Urgent Issues Task Force of the Accounting
Standards Board.
Other common adjustments were made for revenue recognition, interest
capitalisation, post-retirement benefits, cost assessment and allocation and
corrections to prior-year figures.

The rules require oil operators to draw up safety plans for each of the 150
installations in the North Sea. The plans must be submitted to the Health
and Safety Executive for approval by next November.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Decision over risk weightings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday disclosed that banks would not be forced to
increase the risk weightings of most forms of mortgage-backed securities.
Risk weighting is used in calculating the capital to be held against an
asset. The Bank said the weighting for mortgage-backed securities would
remain at 50 per cent rather than rising to 100 per cent.
Uncertainty over the level of risk weighting for the Pounds 8bn of
mortgage-backed securities in Britain was created by the EC solvency ratio
directive, which was published in 1990 and comes into force in January.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Benefits of merit pay questioned by Acas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE-related pay rarely achieves completely what it is meant to do,
Acas, the conciliation service, said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes.
Mr Ted Ridley, principal adviser in the Acas work research unit, said that
in spite of the popularity of performance-related pay there were often far
more effective systems of motivation and reward for managements to introduce
if they wanted to improve their organisation's performance.
He said employers should look at alternative ways of motivating and
rewarding employees.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Air charter licences show 24% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of licences granted to travel companies selling air-charter
holidays has risen by 24.1 per cent on last year, the Civil Aviation
Authority said yesterday.
All operators taking package holidaymakers abroad by air have to receive Air
Travel Organisers' Licences from the authority.
The authority and holiday companies said that, while this appeared to
indicate optimism in the industry, it was too early to say whether the rise
would result in excess capacity and a price war.
Holiday companies cut prices heavily last summer to sell about 500,000
surplus holidays. The authority said that while companies seemed to be
expecting an expansion in their programmes, two other factors may have
accounted for this year's sharp rise in the number of licences.
Several of the large operators do not renew their licences until March, so
the authorisations they hold are for the summer of this year rather than for
next year. The figures have also been distorted by the inclusion for the
first time of some tourists who have booked package holidays travelling on
scheduled carriers.
The authority said the number of return seats licensed in November this year
stood at 14.3m compared with 11.5m last year. It said the licences granted
represented a total turnover of almost Pounds 5bn compared with Pounds 3.7bn
last year. The average price of a holiday has risen to Pounds 350 compared
with Pounds 323 last year.
Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the largest UK operator,
who has frequently called on the industry to reduce its capacity, said:
'Obviously I'm concerned about companies putting on too many holidays for
next year, but at the moment there's no evidence in either direction.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / Money supply hits rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for further cuts in interest rates before the end of the year
retreated yesterday with the news that growth in the narrow measure of the
money supply has risen to its highest level for almost a year.
Strong annual growth of M0 - mainly notes and coins in circulation - has
added weight to signs that an upturn in retail sales is under way.
The seasonally adjusted figures from the Bank of England confirmed that in
the year to November M0 expanded by 3 per cent, the strongest year-on-year
rate of growth since December last year. Compared with the previous month,
it grew by 0.8 per cent.
The rise backs up a small, but unexpected, increase in retail sales in
October. The two sets of figures indicate that a further sharp fall in
retail spending is unlikely.
Mr Leo Doyle, economist at Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank and
investment house, said: 'The figures suggest that we are past the worst. We
are not going to double-dip back down to where we were.'
However, economists also point out that M0 is a coincident indicator of
retail sales and gives little indication of future trends.
Mr Doyle said that although the latest figure was promising, it did not
change his view that retail sales would slow down in the fourth quarter as
further news of big job losses affected confidence.
The strong growth in M0 will hearten the government amid predominantly bad
economic news. A recent Confederation of British Industry survey of the
retail sector painted a gloomier picture than that reflected in official
figures, while most other Central Statistical Office data show the economy
still in recession.
The rise means that the authorities will be less willing to ease monetary
policy. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has targeted a growth rate for M0
of between 0 and 4 per cent as part of his anti-inflation strategy and will
be anxious not to let the figure jump too rapidly towards 4 per cent.
The latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers continues to show a
decline in manufacturing industry activity levels. In November, the
purchasing managers' index - a weighted average of movements in variables
such as new orders, output and employment - was below 50 per cent. However,
at 49.5 per cent it was higher than in October when it was 47.7 per cent.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Lloyd's losses in US 'could reach Pounds 4.9bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S losses from pollution and industrial diseases in the US could amount
to Pounds 4.9bn, according to estimates by Chatset, the company that
analyses the insurance market's results.
Names, the individuals whose capital supports Lloyd's, could face heavy
annual levies, depressing the profitability of current business.
Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor of Chatset, yesterday declared such an effect
'inevitable'.
The estimates form part of a new assessment of open years among Lloyd's
syndicates which leave their accounts open when they are unable to assess
the size of future claims arising on business already underwritten.
There are now 162 open years at Lloyd's, with several syndicates having more
than one open year. Chatset estimates that it will cost a further Pounds
5.3bn to close the open years, with Pounds 400m needed to close years left
open as a result of recent catastrophe losses such as Hurricane Hugo and the
European storms of 1990.
Liability claims arising from court awards to victims of asbestos-related
diseases and government-ordered clean-ups of polluted sites and
asbestos-contaminated buildings account for the remainder.
The group estimates that it could take between 20 years and 25 years to
settle all outstanding claims and that, taking into account investment
income, a fund of Pounds 2bn set aside now would be sufficient to meet all
future liabilities.
Chatset made the calculations after comparing the actual pattern of claims
payments over the past four years with actuarial projections about future
payments. These projections vary widely. Mr Sturge said Chatset had favoured
the more cautious and pessimistic projections.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Fakes feature in glitzy auction of Maxwell effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT MAXWELL could not have foreseen the very public way the contents of
Headington Hill Hall - his family home he once boasted was the finest
council house in Britain - would be put under the auctioneer's hammer.
Yesterday, journalists descended on the Oxford house - rented for just over
Pounds 10,000 a year from Oxford City Council - for a glimpse of the
building where not so long ago deals were struck and fortunes enjoyed.
Mr Harry Dalmeny from Sotheby's was on hand to offer informed comment prior
to a sale on January 14 expected to raise at least Pounds 300,000.
'It is not a collector's house,' he said. 'It is functional house and the
function it fulfilled was to impress people. It was a house very much used
for power entertaining.'
In the grand Victorian galleried hall, a large double staircase rises to a
stained-glass window depicting Samson at the gates of Gaza - the head not
unlike that of Maxwell himself - framed by reproduction Regency lamps.
In the hall itself, where the marble columns were in fact made of painted
wood, a late 19th century Aubusson tapestry hung alongside a 1950s collage
sculpture of Neptune.
'Pretty glitzy. Would have worked wonderfully on a cruise ship,' said the
man from Sotheby's.
In Maxwell's room - with its Chinese-style wallpaper and a large-screen
television - a bedside telephone had direct lines to company directors, two
sons, newspaper editors, the Mirror newsdesk and the kitchen.
Nearby, the collected works of Shelley and Samuel Pepys' diaries were fakes,
hiding a spotlight.
In an agreed statement handed out by Sotheby's, Mrs Elisabeth Maxwell said
she had inherited some of the more tasteful items on show - the furniture,
carpets, silverware and china.
'They've been with us for 33 years but material possessions don't mean much
to me and nor did they to my husband,' it said. 'The only things I collected
were minerals, fossils, coral, and seashells.'
Maxwell memorabilia on display included a mother-of-pearl inlaid nameplate
inscribed 'Robert Maxwell: Chairman' (a gift from Japanese businessmen), a
photograph of him with the US president with the inscription 'To Sir Robert
Maxwell, warm greetings from Washington, George Bush', several military
medals and a cigar.
The more expensive items include a large regency mahogany dining table
(estimated value Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000), and a pair of satinwood
and parcel gilt card tables (Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 10,000).
There were few items of jewellery and silverware, and the only paintings of
any worth were by the Israeli Reuven Rubin - one depicting a scene of
Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives where Maxwell was buried.
Buchler Phillips, receivers of Mr Maxwell's private estate, have instructed
Sotheby's to realise the highest possible value from the auction, which
follows other recent disposals.
Pensioners are likely to take little comfort from the paucity of items on
display yesterday, and from the fact that division of proceeds remains
subject to negotiation between the receivers and Mrs Maxwell.

FT  01 DEC 92 / MPs warn on cost of shedding forces jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT came under renewed pressure yesterday from the Commons
defence committee to re-assess its plans for cutting the armed forces.
The committee warned that ministers could face accusations of 'financial
profligacy' if they were forced to cut more jobs. Current redundancy plans
would cost the taxpayer about Pounds 400m a year for the next few years, it
said.
Although it stopped short of calling for a full-scale defence review, the
committee said the government's argument for sticking to plans drawn up in
1990 was 'barely credible'.
New pressures had built up, including the commitment of British forces to
the former Yugoslavia and extra troops to Northern Ireland.
The committee added: 'The time has now indeed come to stand back and take
stock of the totality of the proposals for the British armed forces for the
next decade in the light of recent changes in the strategic environment and
of pressures on the defence budget.'
The committee's report on this year's defence white paper was drawn up
before the additional budget cuts included in last month's public
expenditure changes.
It warned that attempts to achieve savings discreetly by cutting back on
logistic support and spares would have 'lethal consequences'. A repetition
of previous 'salami-slicing' policies of this kind would be criminal, it
said.
The report also called for an early decision on the future of the two
privately managed naval dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth.
It said: 'The current uncertainty, and the long-drawn-out process of review
following review, is damaging to all concerned.'
The Ministry of Defence has indicated it intends to decide before Christmas
on where to carry out refitting of nuclear submarines, which provides the
core of both dockyards' business.
GEC Ferranti of Edinburgh announced it has won a 'multi-million pound'
contract to produce radar equipment for the Royal Navy's new EH101 Merlin
helicopter.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Gooda Names halt action group move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY lossmaking Names at Lloyd's of London yesterday forced the withdrawal
of proposals which could have earned hundreds of thousands of pounds for
representatives pursuing legal action on their behalf.
Some 500 people at a meeting of the Gooda Walker Names Action group approved
legal action against 77 agents which placed them with the lossmaking Gooda
Walker syndicates. About 2,000 Names will support the action.
The Names, whose capital backs the insurance market, also agreed to raise
Pounds 2.8m to pay for their legal fees in what could be a complex and long
legal action.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the action group, bowed to
overwhelming pressure from his members by agreeing to withdraw an 'incentive
package' which could have been worth up to Pounds 300,000 for each of 12
members of the group's committee.
The Names will seek to recover Pounds 248m in losses, about 10 per cent of
the total suffered by Lloyd's as a whole in 1988 and 1989, in an action
which will allege negligence by the agents.
However Mr Doll-Stein-berg added that it would have been 'divisive' to put
the plan to claim 'success fees' - which would have been separate from legal
costs - for recovering losses to the meeting.
'There seems to be a certain groundswell,' said Mr Doll-Steinberg. 'The word
obscene is being used over and over again. If you could find another epithet
I'd be grateful.' He added that new proposals would be put to another
meeting in January.
'I wish you would express your feelings equally strongly to the people who
lost you the money in the first place,' he said.
Although many Names accepted that committee members might need some
remuneration, many questioned the scale of the promised success fees. 'Most
people believe it is obscene that you should, having decided to serve on a
voluntary basis, then ask for Pounds 300,000,' said Mr Claud Gurney.
'There is no point in appointing lawyers and then negotiating yourself,'
another Name said. 'You are keeping a dog and barking yourself.'
'We're not against you, but the goalposts are being moved during the game,'
added another Name, who said that the division would 'glad-den the hearts'
of the members' agents against whom the Names were fighting.
Earlier Mr Paul Marland, Conservative MP for Gloucestershire West, who was
one of three new Gooda Walker Names elected to the action group's committee,
said he was hopeful about the prospects for a negotiated settlement but that
the group 'must arm itself. We intend to keep our legal tanks full of fuel.'
