FT  01 DEC 92 / Benefits of merit pay questioned by Acas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE-related pay rarely achieves completely what it is meant to do,
Acas, the conciliation service, said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes.
Mr Ted Ridley, principal adviser in the Acas work research unit, said that
in spite of the popularity of performance-related pay there were often far
more effective systems of motivation and reward for managements to introduce
if they wanted to improve their organisation's performance.
He said employers should tailor reward systems more closely to their
organisational needs and look at alternative ways of motivating and
rewarding employees.
Another study published yesterday, by KPMG, the management consultancy said
non-contributory pensions were rated as the most important personal benefit.
The second most important was a company car.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Holiday licences show 24% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of licences granted to travel companies selling air-charter
holidays has risen by 24.1 per cent on last year, the Civil Aviation
Authority said yesterday.
All operators taking package holidaymakers abroad by air have to receive Air
Travel Organisers' Licences from the authority.
The authority and holiday companies said that while this appeared to
indicate optimism in the industry, they warned that it was too early to say
whether the rise would result in excess capacity and a price war.
Holiday companies cut prices heavily last summer to sell about 500,000
surplus holidays. The authority said that while companies seemed to be
expecting an expansion in their programmes, two other factors could have
accounted for this year's sharp rise in the number of licences.
Several of the large operators do not renew their licences until March, so
the authorisations they hold are for the summer of this year rather than for
next year. The figures have also been distorted by the inclusion for the
first time of some tourists who have booked package holidays travelling on
scheduled carriers.
The authority said the number of return seats licensed in November this year
stood at 14.3m, compared with 11.5m in 1992. The authority said the licences
granted represented a total turnover of almost Pounds 5bn, compared with
Pounds 3.7bn last year. The average price of a holiday has risen to Pounds
350, compared with Pounds 323 last year.
Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the largest UK operator,
who has frequently called on the industry to reduce its capacity, said:
'Obviously I'm concerned about companies putting on too many holidays for
next year, but at the moment there's no evidence in either direction.'
However, Kuoni Travel, the biggest long-haul operator, said that only part
of its 365 per cent increase in seats licensed could be attributed to the
inclusion of scheduled flights. Kuoni holds licences for 175,320 travellers,
compared with 37,707 a year ago.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Gummer not cowed by French trade warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Agriculture minister John Gummer visits the Royal Smithfield Show, at
London's Earls Court yesterday.
Later Mr Gummer was told by Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, his French counterpart,
that France would use the full force of the law to protect itself against UK
farm exports - particularly lamb, David Blackwell writes.
Mr Gummer, president of the EC Farm Council, said after lunch with Mr
Soisson that in his view France, as an important exporting country, needed a
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement as much as any country in
Europe.
He added: 'France has 3m-plus unemployed. They will continue to be
unemployed unless we have a Gatt settlement.' He said that there was no
evidence for French fears that a Gatt settlement would not square with
reform of the EC's common agricultural policy.
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers Union, said the threats
made by some sections of French agriculture against British lorries was
outrageous. He added: 'We can understand the concern of French farmers and
others, but taking to the streets in a violent manner is not the best way to
make progress.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / US Senate under fire as scandal accusations grow
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the US Congress had hoped that the purgative effects of an
election campaign might allow them to make a new start. But just four weeks
after the election, the list is already lengthening of members who stand
accused of abusing women, alcohol and power.
Over the past year, it has been the House of Representatives which has stood
lowest in public esteem, in the wake of scandals over the House's private
bank and post office.
Electoral catharsis seems, however, to have had some effect on the lower
chamber, where many of the worst abusers of the House bank's loose overdraft
practices were voted out. In the Senate, on the other hand, the nightmare
appears to be starting over again.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination in 1996, yesterday had to deny suggestions in a New
York Times article that he had intervened with federal regulators on behalf
of a property developer and savings and loan owner who had billed him only
Dollars 63,000 for Dollars 117,000 of work on his holiday home.
After Senator Brock Adams of Washington state was compelled to retire after
allegations of sexual harassment, three other senators now face charges of
sexual misconduct, in some cases stretching back over years.
Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii won re-election last month after easily
shrugging off complaints that he had forced himself on his hairdresser, but
charges of a pattern of unwanted sexual advances by Senator Bob Packwood of
Oregon only emerged after he had narrowly won his campaign for re-election
against former Democratic Representative Les Aucoin.
Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota, meanwhile, gave blood samples a
fortnight ago to help determine whether he is the father of a child whose
mother claims to have been raped by him in 1963.
The Senate last year gained few admirers for its clumsy handling of sexual
harassment charges made by Ms Anita Hill against Mr Clarence Thomas before
his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice.
It now risks reinforcing an image of harbouring a nest of ageing libertines
 -with Senator Packwood suggesting heavy drinking may have been a factor in
some of the sexual advances he is alleged to have made. He is seeking
alcoholism counselling.
The Senate faces a quandary over what to do about these latest charges. A
formal investigation by the ethics committee seems likeliest in the case of
Senator Packwood, since three of the women who claim to have been his
targets have said they plan to file formal complaints. But, in the interests
of party balance, the committee may then feel compelled to take up the case
of Democratic Senator Inouye.
Even if the ethics committee decides to step in, it runs the risk of
reinforcing the Senate's reputation as a club for insensitive white males
with little understanding of the realities of sexual harassment, unless
Senate leaders can persuade one of the four newly-elected women senators to
serve on that committee.
The four used the issue of the Senate's male insensitivity freely in their
election campaigns, but are now reluctant to join either the ethics
committee or the judiciary committee, scene of the Thomas-Hill hearings.
So far, Senator-elect Patty Murray of Washington has indicated she would, if
forced, serve on ethics, while Senator Dianne Feinstein of California may be
press-ganged on to judiciary.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Lima and Caracas head for asylum row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERUVIAN President Alberto Fujimori's decision to grant political asylum to
93 Venezuelan rebel soldiers who participated in last week's coup attempt
set the stage yesterday for a diplomatic row between the two countries.
Mr Fujimori said late on Sunday he was accepting the men's request for
refuge because 'we have to preserve . . . the security, the life and
integrity of these 93 military (men).'
The men, led by Air Force General Francisco Visconti, fled by air to the
Peruvian town of Iquitos shortly after the failed putsch, which left more
than 170 people dead and scores more injured.
Venezuelan television broadcast the news from Peru shortly after midnight on
Sunday but there was no immediate official reaction.
Venezuela's Foreign Ministry, which broke off diplomatic relations with Lima
earlier this year after Mr Fujimori suspended Peru's Congress, had already
asked the Organisation of American States (OAS) to ensure Peru returned the
rebels.
Meanwhile, shops, businesses and banks yesterday reopened in Venezuela, as
life returned to normal after Friday's failed coup.
However, share prices fell on the Caracas stock exchange, as the
dissatisfaction at the government's strict austerity measures, which had
fuelled the country's second coup attempt in a year, continued to hit
investor confidence.
The Central Bank of Venezuela sought to calm the markets by announcing that
it would ensure the demand for US dollars was met.
At the same time the government of President Carlos Andres Perez reiterated
that nationwide elections for state and local office would be held as
scheduled on December 6.
Roughly half of Venezuela's population of about 20m are registered to vote
for 22 state governors, 282 mayors, 2,116 members of city councils and 2,376
members of the newly established parish councils.
The government, fearing high abstention, is using the media to encourage
people to vote, and officials are stressing that voters should use ballots
instead of bullets to change their elected representatives.
In the last state and regional elections, held three years ago, national
voter abstention was 54 per cent, reaching a high of 73 per cent in Caracas.
The elections will be important in indicating if many Venezuelans continue
to feel alienated from the political system following two military
rebellions this year, or whether they will demonstrate some faith in
Venezuela's highly criticised democracy.
They should also show whether voters retain their preference for the two
establishment parties, Accion Democratica (the government party) and the
Christian Democrat Copei party, or for more militant leftist organisations
such as MAS (socialists) and Causa R (an offshoot of the Venezuelan
Communist party).
Meanwhile, the government is continuing its search for military and
civilians involved in Friday's uprising. The state security police detained
a retired army general, Alberto Muller Rojas, for questioning, and
authorities in different parts of the country arrested officers and soldiers
trying to leave the country or go into hiding.
Government raids on two state universities uncovered caches of automatic
weapons, ammunition and other arms. One hoard of arms was found stashed in a
hot dog vendor's wagon.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Europe facing steep rise in drugs traffic: Governments
ignoring threat, warns US law agency chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the US Drug Enforcement Administration warned yesterday of a
large increase in illegal narcotics imports into western Europe and said
European governments had not awoken yet to the threat.
Mr Robert Bonner, administrator of the DEA, told a meeting at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs yesterday that the danger was such that
western governments should make fighting narcotics a primary foreign policy
objective.
'Most of the EC seems oblivious to the fact that western Europe has become a
major export market for cocaine,' he said. An estimated 200 tonnes of
cocaine were exported by the Colombian drugs cartel into Europe last year,
most of it undetected, he claimed. However, the surge in trafficking was
indicated by a sharp increase in seizures: from 4 tonnes in 1988 to 16
tonnes last year. There was also an increase in the UK in the use of crack,
the smokeable form of cocaine.
Much of the cocaine was imported through Spain although the Netherlands,
Britain, Italy and Germany all experienced significant imports. Drugs were
also coming in 'through the back door' via eastern Europe, especially
Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Poland.
'I believe that the time is ripe for a third international conference this
century on opium and heroin. The time has never been riper for such a
conference,' he said. Previous international conferences were held in 1907
and 1912
The DEA's policy was to apply pressure on the so-called kingpins of the
trafficking organisations. However, this strategy was easier to pursue in
the case of cocaine, where 80-90 per cent of production was concentrated in
Colombia, than in the case of heroin whose production was highly
diversified.
Nonetheless, Colombian organisations had moved into heroin production,
surpassing traditional suppliers of opium (from which heroin is made) such
as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Lebanon, although Burma was responsible for an
estimated 50 per cent of output, and Laos was also a big supplier. The
Colombians could be expected to use established routes for cocaine to push
their heroin.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Peru savours return of global goodwill: The financial
benefits of recent elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the official vote count continues, it seems likely that Peruvian
congressional elections held on November 22 have been enough to satisfy the
Organisation of American States and, by extension, the international
community that the country has returned to the democratic fold.
This, in turn, should pave the way for badly-needed foreign funding.
Japan made the swiftest and most enthusiastic response. Just two days after
the election a Dollars 100m (Pounds 65.7m) loan from Tokyo, negotiated in
March but frozen in the wake of President Alberto Fujimori's April 5 coup,
was signed in Lima. It is assumed another Dollars 220m from the
InterAmerican Development Bank, involving Japan, will be disbursed when the
final OAS report on the elections is published.
The Dollars 320m was 'a lifesaver', Mr Fujimori said. The credits depend on
financial sector reforms, but since the Peruvian government has already
carried out essential restructuring with its own resources the money can
effectively be spent on anything.
There was also good news from New York. In a lightning visit days before the
election, Mr Carlos Bolona, economy minister, managed to convince Peru's
commercial creditor banks to suspend possible lawsuits over non-payment of
debt.
Mr Bolona and Mr Raymundo Morales, the debt negotiator, are due to start
renegotiations with Peru's steering committee in February.
Relations with other multinational organisations are also good. Peru has
met, and in some cases exceeded, the quarterly target set by the IMF, and a
new programme for the next couple of years is under discussion in Lima. Peru
is to apply for an extended fund facility which will effectively clear
arrears and open the door to fresh credit.
Settlement with the IMF also lays the foundation for crucial negotiations
early next year with the Paris Club of creditor nations. Peru, which owes
Dollars 6bn, is the Club's third largest debtor and the largest in Latin
America. But Lima managed to win a favourable deal with the Club in
September 1991.
Payments to the Paris Club this year were reduced to about Dollars 330m and,
as with all other external debt quotas, has been honoured. But about Dollars
2bn falls due in 1993, which is clearly unpayable without significant
rescheduling and some debt forgiveness.
Peru has a tough road ahead, even with its elections over and the increased
international goodwill. Predicted GDP growth of 3 per cent this year has
turned into a similar deficit. Peruvian per capita GDP is back at 1960
levels; the average family has seen its income dwindle by 27 per cent since
1986.
The 3 per cent growth now forecast for 1993 will, taking population growth
into account, translate into a modest 1 per cent improvement. 'At this
rate,' says economist Richard Webb, 'it will take a generation to get back
to where we were six years ago'.
Peru's balance of trade deficit for 1993 is also set to worsen.
Liberalisation and sharply lower tariffs have provoked a flood of goods from
abroad.
Official imports this year will total about Dollars 4bn; next year they will
be at least 4 per cent higher, partly due to extra expenditure on capital
goods tied to various investment projects. Only a slight rise in exports is
expected.
Economists are forecasting a current account deficit of about Dollars 2.6bn
for 1993, similar to this year. To help cover it Peru needs to form another
'support group' of friendly countries - the newly-elected Congress has
already nominated a group of representatives to accompany key ministers on
fund-raising trips abroad. Once again, Japan and the US are expected to be
the key contributors, although Peru expects the Clinton administration to
attach more strings to future financing than its predecessor.
Mr Bolona, however, seems quietly confident that Peru will win international
support. He expects to hold inflation next year to about 30 per cent and
promises moderate 1993 reactivation, largely through an increased social
spending budget which has earmarked some Dollars 500m for small construction
and infrastructure projects and job creation.
Public investment is also scheduled to rise from virtually nil to the
equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP.
The Bolona team can also expect to count on broad support from the new
Congress for ongoing structural reforms including deregulation, further
reduction of the heavily-bureaucratised state, relaxation of labour
stability laws and accelerated privatisation of state-owned assets.
With the recent blows to Peru's economically debilitating guerrilla movement
and a more favourable investment climate, 1993 could just be the year when
Peru starts to edge out of stabilisation-induced recession.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Australian deficit worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian dollar fell below 68 US cents early today for the first time
in five years after the release yesterday of October balance of payments
figures showing a deterioration in the current account deficit, Kevin Brown
writes.
The government said the unadjusted deficit was just over ADollars 2bn
(Pounds 903m), compared to ADollars 1.7bn in September. The seasonally
adjusted deficit rose by 19 per cent to ADollars 1.8bn. The trend estimate,
which irons out swings in the seasonally adjusted figures, rose 5 per cent
to ADollars 1.5bn. This was the ninth successive monthly rise.
The main cause was an 11 per cent fall in exports, which was only partly
offset by a 4 per cent import fall. The underlying import trend was a record
high for the second month running. Economists said the continuing high
demand was surprising in relation to the slow recovery from the 1990-91
recession.

<TEXT>
MOST of the biggest US and British companies doing business in Hong Kong
yesterday shrugged off the diplomatic scuffle between London and Beijing as
unlikely to affect their investment plans.
According to the Hong Kong economic and trade office in New York, US direct
foreign investment in the colony totals about Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn).
The territory is the third most important US investment destination in Asia,
after Japan and Australia.
At Amoco, the fifth largest US energy group that has its regional Asian
headquarters for chemical operations in Hong Kong, Mr Martin Pranga, manager
of foreign affairs, said he was confident matters would be sorted out, and
dismissed the row as 'much ado about nothing'.
Mr Pranga, who had just returned to Chicago from a visit to Hong Kong, said
the row 'seems more to do with domestic politics in the UK, namely Mr
Patten's future in British politics, than with Hong Kong. The British
foreign office is at the last minute trying to be remembered by history as
having done the right thing, having previously abdicated responsibility. The
business community in Hong Kong wishes it would die down because it
anticipates doing business with the mainland.
'This is one of the ups and downs to be expected and will be settled
eventually with a compromise.'
Citibank, the leading US bank with 27 branches in Hong Kong, has 2,200
employees there and is active in investment banking, commercial, consumer
and private banking. Although the bank declined an official comment,
insiders at the bank said they were unconcerned at the London-Beijing row
and saw 'tremendous opportunities' in their future business in Hong Kong.
Mr Ronald Harber, vice president for Asia at Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing (3m), said he was not worried.
'I think basically it's business as usual. We don't foresee problems. We're
entering into contracts that extend beyond 1997 with full confidence that
they will be honoured beyond that date. From a practical standpoint, I don't
seen any reason for concern.'
Mr Paul Sacks, president of Multinational Strategies, a New York-based
political risk analysis consultancy, doubted the latest turn of events would
make US companies change their Hong Kong investment plans.
'I think most people have already discounted the effects of the transition.
I do not anticipate any dramatic reaction on the part of US investors.' Mr
Sacks said.
Seen from the US point of view, the row between London and Beijing 'is
merely the beginning of the face-off between an existing colonial power and
the new landlord,' said Mr Sacks, who advises a number of US banks and
companies. Most American businessmen understood that 'the realities are that
the Chinese want this process of democratisation not to proceed and will use
any number of bargaining chips.'
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, one of the largest investors in
Hong Kong, also took a relaxed view. It said it would not change investment
decisions as a result of China's statement because it saw it as part of a
continuing war of words.
It said banks were more influenced by China's Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn)
investment in airlines, power generation and hotels in Hong Kong through the
Chinese International Trust and Investment Corporation, and Bank of China.
Among US companies active in Hong Kong is Exxon, which holds a 60 per cent
interest in an electric power generating facility from which it supplies its
partner, China Light and Power. Exxon, which earned USDollars 193m (Pounds
127m) from this activity after tax last year, said it did not expect the
events to change its investment plans.
Mr Alex Fong, director of the Hong Kong economic and trade office in New
York, said the economic fundamentals were 'so strong' that the political row
would be seen mainly as 'noises and rhetoric'.
At Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong trading company with strong UK ties, Sir
Charles Powell, a director and former foreign policy adviser to Mr John
Major and Mrs Thatcher, said: 'We have been operating in China and Hong Kong
for 160 years, so tend to take the long view in these kinds of matters.
'We believe these short-term difficulties will be resolved and remain
extremely optimistic about economic prospects for China and Hong Kong.'
Sir Charles said Jardine supported the efforts of Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, to promote greater democracy. The group, however, believed
this could only be pursued in agreement with China.
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O), of the UK, has operated for
125 years in Hong Kong in shipping and construction. The group said: 'We
view the western rim of Pacific, with Hong Kong as a hub, as an area of
great economic growth.
'Lord Sterling, our chairman, has recently returned from a very positive
visit to Beijing which has reaffirmed our commitment to the region.'
Costain, the UK construction group, is part of a consortium of Japanese, US
and European companies which yesterday formally were awarded a HKDollars 9bn
(Pounds 768.5m) contract to carry out reclamation and site preparation for
Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport.
Mr Wob Gerretsen, Costain director responsible for UK and international
contracting operations said: 'There is little concern on our part as all of
our work will have been completed and paid for by 1997.'
Logica, the largest UK-owned software house, developed the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange's computerised trading system and maintains an office of some 50
people there.
Mr Colin Rowland, director of international operations, said the political
row was not good for confidence either for prospective customers or the
company itself.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government last night said China was in breach of the 1984
Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and its own Basic Law for Hong Kong after
1997. The Joint Declaration provides for the continuance of current Hong
Kong law after 1997, of which the British law of contract is part. The Basic
Law, which was promulgated by China's National People's Congress, or
parliament, in April 1990 is specific in regard to contracts. Article 160
says: 'Documents, certificates, contracts, and rights and obligations valid
under the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall continue to be valid
and be recognised and protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, provided that they do not contravene this Law.' China has said that
the Basic Law cannot be amended before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.

FT  01 DEC 92 / S Africa tightens exchange controls: Government acts to
relieve pressure on financial rand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government has tightened exchange control regulations in
an attempt to curb disinvestments by local companies which have put South
Africa's investment currency, the financial rand, under severe pressure in
recent weeks.
Mr Derek Keys, the finance minister, said South African companies wishing to
invest abroad would have to finance their investments by raising loans
overseas - rather than by using the financial rand - unless the investment
was 'of immediate benefit to the country in the short term'. Such loans
would have to be serviced from income generated by the new investment.
The move comes after a recent surge in investments abroad by South African
companies, including large investments by the country's two forest products
groups, Sappi and Mondi, acquisitions by First National Bank and the
Standard Bank group and the proposed takeover of Del Monte Foods
International by the Royal Group and Anglo American. Mr Keys' statement said
that deals already approved by the central bank would have to be financed
overseas, with arrangements made to stagger repayments.
The impact of these investment outflows probably explains the recent
weakening in the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners
investing in South Africa and South Africans investing abroad.
The discount between the commercial and financial rands rose as a result to
a high of 46 per cent when Royal announced its proposed Del Monte
acquisition, after narrowing to a low of 7 per cent in 1991 when political
sentiment was positive towards South Africa.
Police said yesterday that the Azanian People's Liberation Army, armed wing
of the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), had claimed responsibility for
the weekend golf club attack in which four whites were killed.
A PAC spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that its army was involved,
but said many South Africans believed political violence would be treated
more seriously if it spilled over into white areas. The African National
Congress (ANC) condemned the attack, calling it an 'outrageous act of naked
terrorism'.

HONG KONG companies with British parents or with traditional British links

Sir Charles Powell, a director of trading group Jardine Matheson and former

been operating in China and Hong Kong for 160 years, so tend to take the
long view in these kinds of matters.
'We believe these short-term difficulties will be resolved and remain
extremely optimistic about economic prospects for China and Hong Kong.'
Sir Charles said Jardine supported the efforts of Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, to promote greater democracy. The group, however, believed
this could only be pursued in agreement with China.
'It is Hong Kong's and China's best interests that these differences are
resolved,' said Sir Charles.
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation ( P&amp;O) has operated for 125 years
in Hong Kong where it has shipping and construction interests. The group
said: 'We view the western rim of Pacific, with Hong Kong as a hub, as an
area of great economic growth.
'Lord Sterling, our chairman, has recently returned from a very positive
visit to Beijing which has reaffirmed our commitment to the region. Our
shares are listed in Hong Kong and we are in the process of increasing our
investment in the area. We are confident in the future for trade with
Beijing and Hong Kong.'
Costain, the UK construction group, is part of a consortium of Japanese, US
and European companies which yesterday formally were awarded a HKDollars 9bn
(Pounds 768.5m) contract to carry out reclamation and site preparation for
Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport.
Mr Wob Gerretsen, Costain director responsible for UK and international
contracting operations said: 'There is little concern on our part as all of
our work will have been completed and paid for by 1997.'
Logica, the largest UK-owned software house, developed the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange's computerised trading system and maintains an office of some 50
people there.
Mr Colin Rowland, director of international operations, said the political
row was not good for confidence either for prospective customers or the
company itself.
Banks with large investments in Hong Kong reacted cautiously to the dispute.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank said it would not change investment decisions as
a result of China's statement because it saw it as part of a continuing war
of words.
It said banks were more influenced by China's Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn)
investment in airlines, power generation and hotels in Hong Kong through the
Chinese International Trust and Investment Corporation, and Bank of China.
Hongkong and Shanghai and Standard Chartered are among the largest investors
in Hong Kong. Standard Chartered said it could not comment, but is thought
to be taking similar view of China's statement to Hongkong and Shanghai.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Beijing tries to pull mat out from under Patten: Giving
confidence a shake is intended to undermine support for reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement by Beijing yesterday that it would repudiate any business
agreement the Hong Kong government enters into without China's consent is
designed to do two things.
The first is, in the short term, to undermine confidence in the economy.
This will further weaken the support Mr Chris Patten, the governor, enjoys
among local politicians and the public for his plans for more democracy in
the territory.
In the longer term it is intended to undermine the ability of the Hong Kong
government to make agreements with local and foreign businessmen unless
Britain is prepared to accept condominium government for the colony before
Beijing re-assumes sovereignty in 1997. It is a bid for much closer
involvement in the day-to-day government of the colony.
It was this form of shared government that China only partly secured when a
year ago it signed a memorandum of understanding with Britain which allowed
for the colony's multi-billion dollar airport project to go ahead. This
agreement, which for the time being is dead in the water, allowed China a
role in approving the finance of the project and any large contracts and
business franchises related to it.
In the immediate term, the warning issued yesterday throws into question the
development of the colony's container port, the electricity industry and
cable television. It does this, not because the Hong Kong government is
unwilling to talk about commercial matters with China - something it already
does - but because Beijing is incensed at Mr Patten's plans for further
democracy in the territory. These include, by 1995 elections, a broadening
of the franchise for the 40 seats out of 60 on the Legislative Council which
are not directly elected.
China has made clear - through its surrogates in the colony's media and
community - that it is prepared to talk to Britain only if Mr Patten's plans
are withdrawn and Britain agrees to conduct elections due in 1995 on China's
terms.
Observers say Beijing is making plain to the people of Hong Kong that it
will accept only strictly limited democracy in the colony. It is also, in
effect, telling them and the British government that it is no longer
prepared to talk to Mr Patten. According to one local financier: 'China does
not care about confidence in the short term. It is quite clear that they
want this man (Mr Patten) and they want him out.'
The tactics may be crude, but they have been effective. China's threat last
week to repudiate the HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 850m) development of the
colony's ninth container terminal was the chief cause of the near 3 per cent
fall in share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.
Since early October, when Mr Patten unveiled his proposals, China has waged
a daily war in the media against him. Public support for the governor has
stood up well, although over the past 10 days there has been a noticeable
weakening in favour of compromise with Beijing.
The business community - which at first welcomed his proposals - has been
quickest to disown them. Most in business now believe that, given China's
intransigence and the reality of its takeover in 1997, Mr Patten has little
option but to withdraw his proposals and sue for peace.
China has been robust in its attacks. Chinese officials are quick to remind
local businessmen where their loyalties should lie and equally quick to
point out that China will remember the position they adopt. These threats
have been made to local politicians as well as businessmen sometimes quite
openly and in the presence of senior Hong Kong government officials.
The Hong Kong government pointed out, in its response to Beijing's
statement, that China was in breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law for Hong Kong, which was promulgated in 1990.
Both documents guarantee that any government contracts lawfully entered into
would be honoured by Hong Kong's future government.
The government's measured response stressed that Hong Kong, as matter of
course, consults China on large scale commercial matters which straddle
1997. But officials pointed out that the business of government would come
to a standstill if every agreement, no matter what the size, had first to be
approved by Beijing.
Last night the government gave every indication that it would press ahead on
the course Mr Patten has chartered. The destination is the local legislature
in the New Year when Mr Patten has undertaken to present legislation.
A vote is expected in the spring, probably in April or May, after the
budget. Analysts said yesterday that they expected the Legislative Council
to try to modify Mr Patten's proposals in an attempt to accommodate China,
although they had little confidence that Beijing would welcome such action.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Australian deficit worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian dollar fell more than half a cent to 68.3 US cents yesterday
after the release of balance of payments figures showing a significant
deterioration in the current account deficit in October.
The government said the unadjusted deficit was just over ADollars 2bn
(Pounds 903m), compared to ADollars 1.7bn in September. The seasonally
adjusted deficit rose by 19 per cent to ADollars 1.8bn, the highest since
January 1990.
The trend estimate, which irons out swings in the seasonally adjusted
figures, increased by 5 per cent to ADollars 1.5bn. This was the highest
since March 1990, and the ninth successive monthly rise.
The main cause of the deficit's rise was an 11 per cent fall in exports,
which was only partly offset by a 4 per cent import fall. The underlying
import trend was a record high for the second month running.
A 13 per cent devaluation of the trade weighted value of the Australian
dollar over the last 12 months appears to be having little impact on
exports.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government is considering whether to delay long-awaited reforms
to increase employers' rights to sack workers following strong union
protests.
The government had been expected to announce a new employment policy before
the end of this year as part of the economic liberalisation programme
launched in 1991.
However, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, suggested in a speech
yesterday that it would be at least a year before the government could
implement such a controversial move because of fierce union criticism.
'In a year's time, labour's attitudes will change and then we can change
provisions in labour laws,' he told a conference organised by the World
Economic Forum, an international research organisation.
Mr Singh was speaking after hundreds of thousands of workers demonstrated in
Delhi last week against reforms which trade union leaders claim would lead
to mass redundancies.
The government had never published details of its plans but it was widely
expected that employers would be given the freedom to dismiss workers from
loss-making enterprises. This has been almost impossible for large
businesses under current legislation.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK rejects Chinese veto over projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday acted swiftly to reject a warning by China that it had the
right to veto all long-term projects and contracts in Hong Kong after the
colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
In the latest of the increasingly acrimonious exchanges between the two
countries on the colony's future, the Foreign Office said Beijing's threat
was contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong.
Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's future mini-constitution, 'contracts which
are valid under Hong Kong's existing laws will continue to be valid and
protected. . .after 1997,' the Foreign Office statement said. The statement
was in response to China's claim that any government contracts not expressly
approved by Beijing, except for 'the provisions on land leases', would
expire with British sovereignty over the colony.
Earlier yesterday, Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad, called in Ma
Yuzhen, the Chinese ambassador in London, to express the UK government's
'surprise and concern' at other complaints by Chinese officials last week
over a projected ship container terminal in Hong Kong.
Mr Goodlad said Beijing's charge that the Hong Kong government had failed to
consult China in the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) before announcing a grant for
the colony's ninth container terminal was inaccurate.
There was no requirement for such consultation in the JLG since it was a
land grant and not a franchise, Mr Goodlad told the ambassador. On the other
hand, consultations had been held in a separate body, the Sino-British Land
Commission, and the land grant for the terminal had been approved by the
Chinese on March 20.
He stressed that there had already been eight other terminals for which a
similar procedure had been followed and the Chinese had raised no
complaints.
Britain is also involved in a running battle with Peking over the funding of
Hong Kong's multi-billion pound new airport project, which also risks being
cancelled if China carries out its veto threat after the colony's handover
in 1997. Contracts not completed by then could be at risk.
It is clear, however, that all these economic disputes are rooted in
Peking's bitter opposition to Mr Patten's democratic reforms. Though very
limited by normal western standards, these reforms are clearly seen by the
present Chinese government as the thin end of the wedge, leading to a form
of self-government entirely alien to its communist philosophy.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Japan's bank lending growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE weakened state of the Japanese economy was underlined yesterday by
figures showing that commercial bank lending rose by just 2.4 per cent in
the three months to September from a year earlier.
The economy, which faces a combination of financial contraction and
industrial retrenchment, is still mired in a downturn partly because the
reduction by manufacturing industry of inventories of unsold products has
slowed recently, the Bank of Japan's monthly bulletin warns
Recent sharp cuts in industrial investment and production were reflected in
a 0.1 per cent increase in bank lending to manufacturers in the third
quarter. The growth in lending to the non-manufacturing sector slowed to 2
per cent in the quarter. The rise in business with non-manufacturers was
mainly accounted for by strong lending to service sector companies and the
construction sector, which is being boosted by government public works
programmes.
Bank deposits contracted in September by 4.6 per cent, with corporate
deposits down 9.1 per cent. This was the 15th month in succession that bank
deposits have fallen.
The banks are trying to raise their profitability partly by offering fewer
savings accounts on which they have to pay high rates of interest to savers.
As a result individual savers are shifting their funds into the postal
savings system which offers better returns, while companies have been
running down their cash reserves to fund their working capital requirements
rather than borrow more.
Construction orders for the top 50 Japanese contractors in October fell by
7.3 per cent from a year before to Y1,587bn (Pounds 8.4bn). An 18.3 per cent
increase in civil engineering orders, fuelled by the public works programmes
failed to offset an 18.7 per cent fall in private sector construction orders
mainly from companies.
Housing starts rose by 10.3 per cent last month from a year before, the
fifth successive monthly increase. The pick-up reflects a sharp decline in
urban land prices and cheaper housing loans which have made home-ownership
more affordable.
The three opposition parties, the Social Democratic party, Komeito and the
Democratic Socialist party, yesterday called for a Y2,000bn tax cut in next
year's budget to revive the economy by boosting consumption.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party's key taxation committees started
discussion of the budget yesterday as the Ministry of Finance reported tax
revenues so far this year were 4.3 per cent down on the same period last
year.

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Canadians seek to water their Ukraine
roots - The hoped-for trade benefits of family ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MILLION Canadians, more than 3 per cent of the country's population, are
immigrants, or descendants of immigrants, from Ukraine. The ranks of
Ukrainian-Canadians include the present governor-general, the finance
minister, the premier of the prairie province of Saskatchewan and a judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada.
With such numbers and political clout, it is not surprising that the
community not only celebrated Ukraine's independence with gusto last
December, but was confident of being in pole position to take advantage of
trade and investment opportunities there.
Under pressure from the Ukrainian-Canadian political lobby, Ottawa was the
first western government to recognise Ukraine's independence and was quick
to extend trade credits and technical assistance. The expatriate community
has financed and organised construction of Ukraine's new consulate-general
in Toronto.
At the same time, however, Ukrainian-Canadians find it hard to hide their
disappointment that the effort they have put into helping their ancestral
homeland has yet to be matched by hard business opportunities.
There has been no shortage of traffic between the two countries since
Ukraine's independence. Canada's governor-general, Mr Ramon Hnatyshyn, was
greeted by thousands of rapt Ukrainians when he visited his ancestral
village last month. Toronto's Ukrainian community has organised a 12-member
'Peace Corps' to work in various ministries in Kiev. One member helped
prepare Ukraine's submission for loans from the International Monetary Fund.
A political scientist from the University of Alberta has spearheaded the
formation of a public administration school in Ukraine. Another Canadian is
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Numerous Ukrainian groups have
been to Canada to hone such varied skills as grain farming and securities
trading.
Despite this high profile, business deals have been slow to materialise. The
Canadian Bank Note Company scored an early victory by winning the contract
to print Ukraine's new currency and stamps against tough competition from
the more established Swiss company Due La Rue Giori.
Teleglobe Canada, a long-distance phone company, has installed an earth
satellite station in Lviv.
Last March, a consortium of Canadian companies formed a pig breeding and
farming venture with a collective farm near Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine.
The Canadian partners will ship breeding stock to Ukraine and build a
weaning facility on the farm.
But the Canadians appear to have less of a competitive edge than they had
hoped.
Mr Brian Monaghan, a Toronto business consultant who organised the
pig-farming venture, points to the irony that Ukraine seems to be less
interested in doing business with its friends in Canada than with Germany,
which invaded it in the second world war.
As Mr Monaghan notes: 'The Germans can fly there and back in the same day.'
More than geographical distance handicaps Canadian businessmen in Ukraine.
Canadians complain that, unlike their European competitors, they are
unfamiliar with the sleazier side of business, which is often the key to
deals in the nascent Ukrainian market.
'It's the Wild West there,' says Mr Borys Wrzesnewskyj, owner of a Toronto
bakery chain who also heads the local branch of the Canadian Friends of Rukh
(the mass movement which initiated Ukraine's drive for independence).
Mr Wrzesnewskyj says that, for the moment, he is not even trying to do
business in Ukraine because 'I don't want to tarnish my name'.
Mr Wrzesnewskyj and other emigres used a conference of the Ukrainian
diaspora this summer to point out shortcomings in the political and economic
programme of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president. Stung by these attacks, a
few days later Mr Kravchuk warned a group of Canadian emigres that
foreigners who criticised the government could be expelled.
Economics rather than politics has been behind delayed plans for a North
American issue of interest-bearing Ukraine bonds, modelled on State of
Israel bonds.
The first Dollars 30m tranche was due to be issued next month. But Mr Dan
Bilak, a Toronto lawyer spearheading the project, says the process is taking
longer than expected.
Mr Bilak notes that conversations with Ukrainian officials on the subject
tend to start with an explanation of what a bond is.
These setbacks are clearly sorting out the men from the boys in the
Ukrainian-Canadian business community. Nonetheless, McGill University's
faculty of management in Montreal recently identified Ukraine as one of a
handful of countries where Canadian business should enjoy a competitive
edge.
The McGill study advised Canadian companies to focus their efforts on
participating in selected privatisations; forming export consortiums in such
areas as telecommunications and energy distribution; and financing small
business start-ups in Ukraine.
It concluded however, that while Ukraine may offer potentially high returns,
it remains a high risk.
That clearly applies even to those Canadians who were confident that they
had a head start in sewing up business deals there.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and the European Commission yesterday began two days of talks on the
monitoring of Japanese vehicle exports to the European Community in 1993,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
An EC spokesman in Tokyo declined to comment on Japanese officials' earlier
expectations that the Commission would seek a cut in Japan's vehicle exports
to the Community next year from an estimated 1,185,000 in 1992 because of
weak EC demand.
He also declined to comment on Japanese media reports that the Commission
might suggest taking into account Japanese local production in Europe when
setting the monitoring target for Japanese exports.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister for international trade and industry, told
a news conference that Japan intended to monitor exports only. Last April,
Japan agreed to cut its new car exports to the Community over the year by
about 6 per cent from 1.26m in 1991.
The concept of 'monitoring' has received conflicting interpretations since a
broader understanding on Japanese new car sales in the Community was reached
in July last year.
This agreement was intended to govern the level of direct Japanese exports
to the EC until the end of 1999.
The accord spelled out procedures to operate for a seven-year transition
period between the creation of the EC single market from the beginning of
1993 and the throwing open of the EC market to unrestricted competition from
Japanese cars.
It is meant to give the European car industry time to complete painful
restructuring to make it more competitive internationally.
The published part of the agreement included a Japanese promise to monitor
exports to the EC market as a whole in accordance with a forecast level of
exports in 1999 of 1.23m (cars and light commercial vehicles) based on the
assumption of demand in the EC in 1999 of 15.1m.

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Push to implement accord on toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES from 41 governments are meeting this week in Uruguay to
hammer out an agreement on implementing the Basle Convention signed in May
this year. The convention restricts trade in toxic wastes, an increasingly
controversial trade and environmental issue.
Opening the conference yesterday, Mr Mostafa Tolba, United Nations
environment programme executive director, said 300m-400m tonnes of hazardous
waste were produced every year. Although most of the waste is produced,
transported and stored in industrialised countries, an increasing amount is
shipped to the developing world.
The convention - which took 11 years to negotiate - has met stiff, if
discreet, resistance from the rich countries. They are apparently wary of
establishing export controls and even more suspicious of developing
countries' demands for a potentially huge compensation scheme to be
underwritten by the industrialised world.
The scheme would be used to compensate victims of environmental disasters
caused by toxic stockpiles. Developing countries take in hazardous waste for
storage without adequate precautions.
Even if the compensation fund is unlikely to be approved in the shape hoped
for by the developing countries, the conference is likely to win approval
for a Dollars 6.6m (Pounds 4.3m) two-year budget for a secretariat and
training programmes. It is also working on draft legislation to serve as a
basis for individual national laws regulating the trade.
Greenpeace, the international environmental group, yesterday claimed the
trade in toxic waste has increased since the adoption of the convention in
1989. It said that, this year alone, companies in the US and western Europe
shipped 74,000 tonnes of waste to 17 developing countries.

FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Big farm protest planned - Mitterrand
links French veto to final Gatt agreement
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH agriculture unions are expecting up to 50,000 farmers at a
multinational demonstration in Strasbourg today in protest at cuts in
subsidised exports of European farm produce proposed in the Gatt accord with
the US.
As farmers headed for Strasbourg, President Francois Mitterrand of France
said Paris would decide to accept or veto the farm trade agreement only
after a global world trade deal had been achieved. During a state dinner
with King Baudoin of Belgium last night, Mr Mitterrand said France would not
base a decision to reject a Gatt agreement on the agricultural issue alone.
The FNSEA, France's main farm group, said 8,000 German farmers would join
today's demonstration, in defiance of a warning to the DBV German farmers'
federation by Mr Ignaz Kiechle, German agriculture minister, not to support
France's threat to veto the deal.
There have been farm demonstrations against the farm trade deal in Belgium,
the Netherlands, Spain and Germany in recent weeks. But the French
government has attracted only moderate official support from its EC
partners, despite a diplomatic campaign to pull its allies into line.
Today's demonstration will provide a clearer measure of international
solidarity for French farmers, around 30,000 of whom are expected to be
there.
The presence of German farmers is unlikely to deflect Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's discreet attempts to encourage France, his main EC ally, to
compromise on Gatt. This is likely to be discussed at Friday's Franco-German
summit in Bonn. Before EC-US negotiators worked out their proposed farm
deal, the US had threatened to impose sanctions against some European farm
exports by next Saturday.
Delegations are expected from all EC member states and from farm unions
outside the Community, to make a general protest against the Gatt and US
trade policies. They include Canadians, Swiss, Scandinavians and a
delegation from a Japanese farm co-operative, angered at US rice growers'
efforts to gain access to their protected market.
Local authorities in Strasbourg have removed street signs to stop farmers
finding the European parliament and have ensured their route avoids the US
consulate and other US buildings.

IRISH farm and industry leaders yesterday criticised the government's policy
of defending the punt against devaluation, as wholesale interest rates took
a sharp upward turn, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
The two leading clearing banks both increased their prime overdraft rates
yesterday after the central bank increased overnight rates to 100 per cent
in its efforts to deter speculators from attacking the Irish currency.
Bank of Ireland, one of the four main clearing banks, doubled overdraft
rates for corporate borrowers to 35 per cent. Allied Irish Bank kept its
increase to only 6 per cent, but said that any new overdrafts would attract
a rate of 60 per cent for corporate borrowers. The Dibor (Dublin interbank
offered rate) for one-month funds rose to between 38 and 45 per cent, while
one-week funds were being quoted at rates of up to 80 per cent.
Mr Alan Gillis, the president of the influential Irish Farmers' Association,
said that the government had 'lost control of the economy'. Intense
negotiations are under way between the main political parties over the
formation of a new coalition after last week's election which left Labour
holding the balance of power.

Norway's central bank cut its key overnight lending rate to 17 per cent from
a six-year high of 25 per cent yesterday after fending off speculators who
had bet on an imminent devaluation, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Economists said fears of renewed turmoil were likely to prevent a cut to 10
per cent - the level in force before Sweden floated its currency on November
19, putting pressure on the Norwegian krone.

<TEXT>
Mr Stefanos Manos, the Greek economy minister, yesterday proposed an
austerity budget for 1993, aimed at narrowing the economic gap with the rest
of the European Community, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The budget projects a primary surplus of 5.1 per cent of gross domestic
product but calls for heavily increased spending on interest payments to
service the public debt. As a result the central government borrowing
requirement will remain at around 7.9 per cent of GDP for another year.
Growth in 1993 is forecast at 2 per cent, while year-on-year inflation
should come down from 15.5 to 12.3 per cent, making it possible for Greece
to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism early in 1994.

HOPES of a return to moderation in German pay deals were given a further
lift yesterday as the DAG union accepted that most of its 500,000 members
would receive no real increase next year, writes Christopher Parkes in
Frankfurt.
Mr Roland Issen, leader of the white-collar union representing public and
private sector staff, said claims for 1993 would range between 4.5 per cent
and 6.5 per cent. This 'cautious' starting point took into account fading
economic prospects and conditions in the industries employing DAG members.
The statement, together with last Friday's agreement among leaders of the
oTV to seek a basic 5 per cent increase for 2.3m public sector workers, will
dampen expectations among other wage earners and ultimately help reduce
inflation. The annual rate of price increases in western Germany, forecast
to average 3.5 per cent next year after 4 per cent this year, is a key
factor determining the Bundesbank's interest rates policy.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Hurd pledges to stand his ground on rebate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK yesterday rejected all attempts to reduce its European Community
budget rebate, negotiated in 1984, and made clear that was one subject on
which it was not prepared to compromise in the run-up to the EC summit in
Edinburgh next week, writes Robert Mauthner.
'The abatement (worth about Pounds 2bn a year) is not an act of charity to
Britain,' Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said at a foreign
correspondents' lunch in London. 'It is the best answer yet designed to deal
with the problem that the Community budget does not operate on a rational
basis.'
Mr Hurd described the net distribution of revenue and expenditure in the
Community as 'irrational.' The budget still distributed resources from the
UK to richer countries. Agreement on this problem required unanimity, the
foreign secretary stressed. 'There is no prospect of unanimity on any
proposal which challenges the abatement.'
Countering the arguments of 'Eurosceptics', Mr Hurd emphasised that every
'serious' British commentator saw Britain's future in Europe.
'If we want to keep our influence we must ratify.' The Maastricht treaty was
the only attainable framework for the EC's development over the next four or
five years.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Twelve fail to agree on border controls
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC interior ministers yesterday failed to agree how to end internal border
controls on people before the end of 1993, let alone by January 1.
The London meeting was the last chance for ministers to agree a compromise
solution before the end of this year - deadline for the barrier-free single
European market.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, proposed yesterday
that all member states should pledge to eliminate 'systematic' internal
border controls on people during 1993.
But Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, who chaired the meeting, said
afterwards that no member state could promise to lift all passport checks.
EC airports have already been given until December 1993 to lift controls on
internal EC flights. Britain is the firmest opponent of lifting internal
border controls on people and will go no further than reducing checks on EC
nationals to a minimum.
Mr Clarke, whose intransigence on the issue angered a number of ministers,
said member states were moving at different speeds towards the goal of
lifting controls. 'In my opinion there's no prospect of taking it very much
further forward until we see what the various member states do in the course
of 1993,' he said.
Continental member states intend to lift checks on all travellers within the
Community in due course, but are worried that external frontiers are not yet
strong enough.
However, Dutch diplomats said the UK presidency should have pressed for a
more positive outcome. Spanish officials also complained that their efforts
to lift controls by the end of the year would be undermined by delay.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission plans to open up the EC market in electricity and
natural gas survived - just - to be fought over another day, as energy
ministers of the 12 yesterday agreed to reconsider this key plank of the
Community's single market early next year.
Dutch-led opposition to the Brussels liberalisation plan, originally to have
been in place when the single market starts in January, snatched away what
the current UK presidency of the EC had identified as one of its most
desired trophies.
Under pressure from Denmark, EC nations also postponed until next year any
decision on a proposal to boost competition in oil and gas drilling and
exploration. The plan would prohibit governments from giving preference to
companies from their own nations in the granting of prospecting and drilling
licences.
The British energy secretary, Mr Timothy Eggar, said a decision could be
taken on the proposal during the first half of next year when Denmark holds
the EC's rotating presidency.
Diplomats said Denmark may have vetoed the plan if the other 11 EC nations
had tried to push it through. Under EC rules, any member nation can veto a
measure it judges harmful to vital national interests. But the veto is
rarely used.
Norway also opposes the competition plan. Though not an EC member, Norway
could try to block the project through the terms of a free trade accord
which it - and six other non-EC members - signed earlier this year with the
Community.
The Commission proposals aim to open national gas and electricity networks
to greater competition from next year, by giving large energy users the
right to buy from suppliers anywhere in the EC. This facility would then be
extended to smaller energy users from 1996.
The ministers in their conclusions asked Brussels to 'consider
modifications'. That 'is not withdrawal or amendment', but looking at things
like transitional periods, UK officials said.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Mafia's wages of sin under attack: Asset seizures are
spearheading Italy's war on organised crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian authorities have seized Mafia assets worth L1,900bn (Pounds
903m) so far this year. Of this, all but L200bn has been seized during the
past five months, since Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, took office,
according to the Interior Ministry.
The most recent case involved L500bn held in 62 companies, property, bonds
and shares and in 200 foreign bank accounts belonging to the Madonia family,
one of the most powerful clans in Palermo. Police are still assessing the
value of cash and securities in the now frozen accounts.
The sharp increase in the scale of asset seizures is just one aspect of the
way the Italian state has finally gone on the offensive against organised
crime. 'We are no longer defensive; we have gone on to the attack,' says Mr
Nicola Mancino, the Christian Democrat interior minister.
This was begun by Mr Enzo Scotti, his predecessor; but the public outcry
over the assassinations of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni
Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, this year has placed the fight against crime
at the top of the five-month-old Amato government's agenda. It is perhaps
the first time since the Mussolini era that the state has made a concerted
effort to combat the Mafia. Government policy has five main elements,
according to Mr Mancino: tougher legislation; a more efficient justice
machine; greater police investigative powers; greater attention to attacking
Mafia wealth; and increased use of 'super-grass' testimony.
The legislation being applied to the Mafia is basically re-directed
anti-terrorist policy employed in the 1970s. Police now have great freedom
to hold and interrogate Mafia suspects. At the same time, some 160 key Mafia
figures have been kept in two high-security isolation jails instead of
conducting business freely behind bars in jails near their homes as in the
past.
In Sicily itself 7,000 troops have been helping anti-Mafia operations since
the summer.
The long-awaited special section of the judiciary dedicated to dealing with
the Mafia, which Mr Falcone was due to head, was put in place last month.
The new structure should make it more difficult for the Mafia to find
'crooked' judges' and court clerks (the latter often prevented cases going
before the judges by exploiting bureaucratic loop-holes).
Also operative, albeit in start-up phase, is the 1,200-strong
investigative/intelligence unit (DIA) based on America's Federal Bureau of
Investigation and recruited from the police, Carabinieri and Guardia di
Finanze. Poorly co-ordinated intelligence and inter-service rivalries have
often played into the Mafia's hands.
The police have become more determined since they have seen politicians
turning against the Mafia, the courts more prepared to sentence, and the
public readier to co-operate. But the real breakthrough has been as a result
of a conscious decision to use the testimony of super-grasses, the pentiti.
'We now have over 200 pentiti,' says Mr Mancino.
'Some have agreed to talk after negotiating while on the run; most are
already in prison facing long sentences; and there have been instances of
people being moved to talk because they disagree with the tactics adopted in
the killing of Falcone.' The state is offering both money and protection to
these pentiti and their families, including a new life outside Italy. These
are big incentives. It also seems that the violent rise of Toto Riina to
head the Cosa Nostra in Sicily, using a dictatorial, as opposed to the
traditional consensual, approach, has alienated many and encouraged them to
talk.
The emphasis on asset seizures is also new. 'We must hit them where it hurts
most - in the pocket,' says Mr Mancino. It is up to those who have had their
assets seized to prove they were legally acquired. If not they are formally
confiscated and sold. It remains to be seen who has the courage to buy the
assets of a well-known mafioso.
Behind all this lies the beginnings of a potentially explosive investigation
into the political cover which the Mafia has always enjoyed. This has been
its ultimate strength.
Tommaso Buscetta, Italy's best known pentito, last month gave a tantalising
foretaste of this shadowy connection which could explain many of the
country's mysteries - not least the assassination of Aldo Moro, a former
prime minister. Buscetta has chosen to speak now on the Mafia's links with
the politicians because he believes their hold can be broken.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday told Nato that their planned 'Eurocorps' of up
to 35,000 soldiers can come under allied command in time of war or
peace-keeping emergency.
This signifies a more accommodating stance by France towards Nato, which
will be welcomed by the US and other European countries like Belgium which
have said they would attach forces to the Eurocorps provided it had some
command link with Nato.
France and Germany yesterday presented a joint memorandum to their partners
in Nato, whose ambassadors will discuss it in Brussels tomorrow. The memo is
the basis on which Paris and Bonn will negotiate detailed command
arrangements with General John Shalikashvili, the US general who is the top
Nato commander known as Saceur.
France has agreed that the Eurocorps can come under Nato command, in the
case either of a general attack on the alliance or of a decision by Nato
governments to dispatch a peace-keeping force outside alliance territory.
'But the condition is Saceur must keep the Eurocorps together as an
expression of a European defence identity, and not break up the French and
German units and attach them to different formations', said a French
official.
By contrast, in peace-time there would be nothing to stop Germany
temporarily detaching its units from the Eurocorps for different duties, the
official said. In contrast to French forces, German troops come under Nato's
integrated military command in peace-time.
France quit Nato's integrated command in 1966, but a year later it agreed
that in the event of an attack on the alliance Nato commanders could count
on its forces coming under their control.
The Bush adminstration bridled earlier this year when France and Germany
announced their plan to build their current joint brigade into a full
35,000-strong corps by 1995, without clarifying its link with Nato.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations officials warned yesterday that the damaged dam in the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro holding back millions of tons of toxic
sludge from pouring into the Danube river system remains highly dangerous.
Work began last Thursday to prevent further erosion of the gravel and shale
Mojkovac dam, which was on the verge of collapse after flash floods in
mid-October tore away concrete supports along its base. Mr Hans Zimmermann,
who is co-ordinating the emergency repair work at the UN disaster relief
agency in Geneva, said yesterday there had been no further deterioration in
the dam's condition. But, he added, 'the slightest additional rainfall would
aggravate the situation again'.
The preliminary toxicology report on the site, which contains an estimated
7m tons of poisonous sludge from a now-closed lead and zinc mine, says the
dump contains lead, zinc, copper, iron and sulphur compounds, as well as
traces of nickel, cadmium, arsenic and antimony. Analysts also found high
levels of zinc in the river Tara just below the dam. The fast-flowing Tara
runs via the Drina and Sava rivers into the Danube just above Belgrade.
The report, from the Cantonal Ecotoxicological Service of Geneva, says that
if the dam was breached the river would wash out the toxic elements from the
sludge, which has the consistency of sand, carrying them downstream.
In that event, it says, all plant and animal life along the rivers could be
poisoned, and people would have to be protected from contaminated food and
drinking water. Full tests on the 30kg of sludge analysts brought back to
Geneva from their inspection visit on November 15 are expected to take
another month.
Mr Zimmermann said yesterday that preliminary work on protecting the base of
the 12m-high dam from further erosion had been completed. Engineers are now
building three jetties upstream to lessen water pressure on the dam and
dredging a new channel in the river, to stop water eddying around its base.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Fears over 'chaos' at Ukrainian N-reactor
</HEADLINE>

AUTOMATIC safety systems have been switched off at a Ukrainian nuclear
reactor three times over the past year in violations similar to the mistake
which led to the disastrous 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, safety
officials in Kiev said yesterday.
The most recent shutdown was discovered on November 11 by Mr Anatoli
Demianenko, deputy head of the Ukranian Atomic Energy Inspection Agency, who
made a surprise visit to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear reactor, 150
kilometres north of Odessa.
'There is such chaos at that reactor that they themselves could not explain
why the systems were shut down,' Mr Demianenko said.
Mr Volodymyr Yavorivsky, chairman of the parliamentary commission on
Chernobyl described the shutdown as 'the most serious and criminal violation
possible at a nuclear reactor'. He said: 'This is very similar to the events
which led up to the Chernobyl nuclear tragedy.'
According to Mr Yavorivksy, the safety systems were shut down in order to
boost power production.
Mr Yavorivsky said that, in light of the most recent violations, Ukraine
needed seriously to reconsider its reliance on atomic energy, which accounts
for 25 per cent of the republic's energy consumption. Although popular
sentiment against nuclear power is very strong in Ukraine, the republic's
break with Russia has precipitated an energy crisis which has made the
government reluctant to close down its reactors.
One of Chernobyl's four reactors was restarted last month after six months
of repair work and, together with Ukraine's four other plants, has been
reconnected to Ukraine's power grid.
Last week, the Atomic Energy Inspection Agency submitted a letter to the
cabinet requesting that Mr Volodymyr Fuks, director of the Pivdennoukrainsk,
be sacked.
However, Ukrainian officials said that the cabinet had not yet taken its
decision on the directors future.
According to insiders, Ukraine's powerful anti-nuclear lobby has a
longstanding grudge against Mr Fuks, who is a stalwart of the Ukranian
nuclear industry.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Government plans large fines for anti-competitive practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES could face fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover for
engaging in anti-competitive behaviour under proposals outlined by the
government yesterday.
The power to impose penalties of this magnitude is a feature of two of the
three legislative options set out by the government in a green paper
discussing possible changes to the law on abuse of market power by
individual companies.
Practices that could make companies liable to such fines include
deliberately pricing goods too cheaply to cover costs and refusing to supply
certain outlets.
The government is already committed to improving the law against price
fixing, market sharing and other cartels by stepping up powers to deal with
cartels by prohibiting anti-competitive agreements.
The three options on which the government yesterday invited discussion are:
To strengthen the case-by-case approach through measures that could involve
improving the Office of Fair Trading's investigative powers and allowing
more scope for the director-general of fair trading to accept binding
undertakings.
To introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power while repealing
existing UK legislation on the subject. This comprises the monopoly
provisions of the 1973 Fair Trading Act and the 1980 Competition Act.
To implement a 'dual system' by introducing a prohibition and repealing the
Competition Act provisions on anti-competitive practices, while keeping the
relevant provisions of the Fair Trading Act.
Although careful not to prejudge the consultation process's outcome, the
government said it believed the case for introducing a prohibition on abuse
of power, alongside a restricted trade practices prohibition, 'deserves
serious consideration'.
Labour welcomed the green paper and said its preference was for a
prohibition system.
At Westminster, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told MPs
that excessive discounts such as those said to be given by some suppliers to
supermarkets could be considered by the government's review if they were
improperly applied.
Regulated utilities such as British Gas and the regional electricity
utilities should be 'as fully subject to competition legislation' as was
consistent with their own statutory and regulatory framework.
Questioned on the shaping of UK policy in the context of the European
Community, Mr Heseltine said one of the arguments for moving towards one of
the prohibition options was that it 'brings practice for domestic purposes'
closer to Europe.
UK legislation differs from EC law in that abuses of market power may be
prohibited only after they have been found to be against the public
interest.

FT  01 DEC 92 / China challenges Hong Kong agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued
administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial
agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with
Beijing.
The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which
accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong
Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty
in June 1997.
The statement by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was seen in the
colony as an attempt by China to undermine confidence in Hong Kong's economy
and to defeat proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for more
democratic elections due in 1995. It represents a serious escalation in the
row which Beijing has linked to London's change in policy towards Hong
Kong's democratic development. Analysts in Hong Kong said it also amounted
to a bid by China for greater involvement in the colony's administration.
'They want to bring the government to its knees, if they can,' a senior Hong
Kong government official said last night.
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a
dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all
contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong
government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first
approved by China.
It added, however, that China encouraged foreign investment in Hong Kong.
In London, the Foreign Office rejected Beijing's threat, saying it was
contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong.
In the absence of a British climbdown on democracy, or the defeat of Mr
Patten's proposals on the floor of the local legislature, China's escalating
attacks could undermine some large-scale business ventures in energy,
communications and trade which are planned for Hong Kong in addition to the
colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 15bn) airport project.
Hong Kong's financial and business community was last night deeply concerned
about the growing rift between London and Beijing and is expected to voice
louder calls for Mr Patten to retreat. Liberal politicians said China's
behaviour underlined the need for democracy to protect Hong Kong from the
arbitrary exercise of power by Beijing.
British and US businesses with interests in Hong Kong were more sanguine
about prospects for the colony, indicating that Beijing's threat would have
no impact on investment decisions.
Share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell nearly 3 per cent in
trading yesterday, although this was largely in response to comments by a
senior Chinese official late last week over the validity of the award of
land to a consortium to build a container terminal in Hong Kong. The warning
from Beijing yesterday came too late to affect the market.
The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring
that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration
on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997
constitution - drafted by Beijing.
Both documents guarantee the safety of existing contracts after the colony
reverts to Chinese sovereignty.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Receivers called in as Rosehaugh loses battle with banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSEHAUGH, a prominent property developer in the 1980s, yesterday gave up
its battle for survival. It owes its banks, led by Barclays, a total of
about Pounds 350m.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, is expected to be appointed today
as its receiver, making Rosehaugh the latest high profile property company
to go into receivership this year. In contrast with a stock market value of
Pounds 746m in July 1987, Rosehaugh is now believed to have negative net
assets.
The downturn in the British property market, which has halved office values
in London over the past three years, is expected to result in several
billions of pounds of losses for banks operating in the UK.
Yesterday's move was the final stage in a lingering death. As the huge
losses accumulated over the past three years, it became increasingly clear
that Rosehaugh had no future. The company's former chairman and driving
force, Mr Godfrey Bradman, resigned from the board at the start of this
year.
Rosehaugh's best-known asset, the Broadgate office complex in the City of
London, is not directly affected by its receivership. It is owned by a
Rosehaugh subsidiary, Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, which last week
secured its future through a refinancing of its Pounds 1.25bn debt.
That refinancing triggered the decision to put the rest of the company into
receivership. The reason for the receivership was partly attributed to the
banks' desire to cut Rosehaugh's overheads, particularly the cost of its
head office lease.
The decision by Rosehaugh's 26 banks to put the company into receivership
contrasts with their agreement, at the start of this year, to refinance
Rosehaugh's Pounds 310m of loans until January 1994. However, funds are not
committed in this type of banking standstill and so the agreement was not
binding.
In June 1991, Rosehaugh had net assets of Pounds 164m. In the year to June
30 1991, it reported losses of Pounds 227m, which followed losses of Pounds
166m the previous year.
Apart from Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, Rosehaugh's principal asset is
Pelham Home, a landbank developer which partly owns the Chafford Hundred
housing scheme in Essex. It also owns commercial, retail and residential
properties.
Stanhope Properties, which jointly owns Rosehaugh Stanhope Development, with
Rosehaugh, said yesterday it was unaffected by Rosehaugh's receivership.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Lamont faces payment probe: Spending watchdog to investigate
Pounds 4,700 government contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION into a Pounds 4,700 government payment towards Mr Norman
Lamont's personal legal costs was launched by the National Audit Office last
night as the weekend disclosure of the contribution sparked a political row
at Westminster.
Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, told the public
accounts committee of MPs he would conduct a close examination of the affair
for 'his own satisfaction and concern'.
Sir John heads the National Audit Office, the independent watchdog
responsible for monitoring government expenditure. He indicated that he
would report back to MPs in 'two or three weeks time' after studying the
relevant papers.
His decision came after the chancellor had sought to defuse the row -
arising out of his eviction last year of a self-styled 'sex therapist' who
had rented his London home - by publishing Treasury documents supporting his
decision to accept the money.
The documents showed that the payment had been made with the full approval
of senior civil servants. But they were dismissed as irrelevant by
opposition parties which demanded a House of Commons statement from the
chancellor.
Conservative MPs voiced fears that the controversy had further dented the
chancellor's reputation by putting a question mark against his political
judgment.
Ministers said there was no question of Mr Lamont being forced to resign. Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, dismissed the controversy as 'silly'.
But in private, senior Conservatives acknowledged Mr Major was under
pressure to move Mr Lamont from the Treasury in a new year cabinet
reshuffle.
Mr Lamont responded to the opposition attacks by publishing a minute
prepared by the then permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Peter
Middleton, setting out the case for a public contribution towards his legal
costs.
The document said it would have been 'unreasonable' for Mr Lamont to bear
all the legal expense because much of it was due to his position as
chancellor and the corresponding need to take immediate action.
It showed that Sir Peter had suggested that the Treasury might defray more
of the expenses than Mr Lamont accepted. The rest of the Pounds 23,000 legal
bill was met by anonymous Conservative benefactors.
In a letter to Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, Mr Lamont said the
documents fully supported his statements that the payment had been
legitimate. He also published extracts from the guidelines for Whitehall
civil servants which allow for ministers to be indemnified from public funds
in some legal actions.
Mr Brown said there was no precedent for a minister accepting taxpayers'
money to meet a private legal bill which was unrelated to his public duties.
Whitehall officials, however, were confident that Sir John's inquiry would
show that Mr Lamont and senior Treasury civil servants had acted entirely
properly.

SOLVAY, the Belgian chemical group, has acquired 96 per cent of the shares
in Kowa Yakuhin Kogyo of Japan, agencies report.
Kowa, a specialist in the production, development and distribution of human
health drugs in Japan, had sales of around Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in 1991.
Solvay said the acquisition would allow it to market its pharmaceutical
products directly in Japan, which represents around 20 per cent of the world
market.
The Belgian company is indirectly present in Japan through products sold
under Solvay licences by several Japanese companies, which represent annual
sales of around Y9bn.
Solvay has also been active through the Solvay Meiji Yakuhin joint venture,
set up in 1989, which has been developing a number of Solvay research and
development projects including the antidepressant fluvoxamine which will be
launched in Japan in 1996.
Solvay shares closed BFr100 higher at BFr11,150 on the Brussels stock
exchange.
Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
Solvay said Kowa Yakuhin, which had turnover of about Y3bn in 1991, was
preparing to launch a 'promising product' in the field of urology.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Khmer Rouge sets up new party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leftist Khmer Rouge guerrilla group yesterday announced the formation of
a new Cambodian political party which it said could participate in
UN-sponsored elections next year if Khmer Rouge conditions were met.
The Khmer Rouge has repeatedly violated a ceasefire and refused to take part
in the elections. It has reaffirmed its opposition to the way the UN is
implementing the Cambodian peace plan agreed by all parties last year.
A statement from Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin on the Thai border,
issued in Phnom Penh, said the new party was called the National Unity of
Cambodia party.
The main condition for the party's participation in the election scheduled
for May is the same as the one previously adopted for the Khmer Rouge - the
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. Vietnam says they were
withdrawn in 1989 and the UN says it has no evidence of Vietnamese troops
inside Cambodia.
Mr Khieu Samphan was named leader of the new party; he is also leader of the
party of democratic Kampuchea as the Khmer Rouge is officially known.
The latest Khmer Rouge announcement is likely to be seen as a further
attempt to play for time. UN officials are struggling to organise an
election, which will exclude Khmer Rouge areas and take place with tens of
thousands of men from the four main factions still under arms.
Under the peace accord, most guerrillas and troops were supposed to be
regrouped and disarmed before the election, but the Khmer Rouge has refused
UN forces access to its territory and the disarmament process has stalled.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas are disrupting UN efforts to register Cambodian
voters, intimidating Cambodians and the UN electoral officials themselves.

FT  01 DEC 92 / South Africa drafts a plan for post-apartheid trade: Radical
proposals for tariff reform and a move to developing country status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bland title conceals a radical blueprint. Yet a document entitled
'Integrated Normative Economic Model' may help shape the economic future of
South Africa.
It contains what is effectively the government's draft structural adjustment
programme, and in a recent speech Mr Stef Naude, the director general of the
Department of Trade and Industry, gave a glimpse of what the government
envisages will be the main components of a post-apartheid trade policy.
Aside from the most detailed account to date of how the government proposes
to tackle tariff reform, Mr Naude touched on two matters likely to evince
considerable discussion: the proposal that South Africa should seek
developing country status, and the first public notification of government
dissatisfaction with the functioning of the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU).
Mr Naude stressed he was putting forward proposals, not making unilateral
policy announcements. He noted: 'We've got to manage restructuring very
carefully because of the political changes taking place. Because of the
unemployment, we have to be careful with how much blood we spill on the
floor.'
The idea that South Africa should seek developing country status is not new.
Earlier this year the Overseas Development Institute in London published a
document, 'Trading with South Africa', which considered six future trading
regimes for South Africa, five of which assumed developing country status.
Gatt obliges developed countries to grant trade preferences to developing
countries.
As South Africa can reclassify unilaterally, the issue is more whether its
main trade partners, such as the EC and US, would recognise it as a
developing country.
The evidence is mixed. World Bank figures suggest that with a GNP per capita
in 1990 of Dollars 2,530 and a share of industry in GDP of 44 per cent South
Africa is an 'upper middle income' country.
As the ODI report notes, however, it is a much poorer developing economy by
various trade and development criteria. Its exports are still heavily
oriented towards commodities and the five principal exports account for 46
per cent of the total compared to 30-35 per cent for developing countries.
In terms of UNDP's Human Development Index, South Africa ranks well below
countries such as Brazil and Venezuela which have similar per capital GDPs.
How much South Africa would benefit from preferential trade regimes is a
moot point. Dr Erich Leistner of the Africa Institute in Pretoria argues
that to take developing country status is to accept a lowering of status.
'We are more likely to get sympathy and support if we show that we are
efficiently run and not just one more country begging for western support.'
The ODI study also concludes that, for example, less than 20 per cent of the
country's exports to the EC would benefit from standard trade preferences
because barriers to metals and minerals exports, South Africa's main exports
to the EC, are already low.
Dissatisfaction with SACU has long been evident in government circles, but
Mr Naude is the first senior government official to broach the subject
publicly. He said it had two main problems which effectively crippled its
potential to serve as a vehicle for regional integration. First, 'on the
present formula (of revenue sharing) the massive and rapidly growing
payments to our partners are becoming unaffordably high to us.' He said
South Africa would be paying R3.06bn to the other members - Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia - in the 1992-93 financial year. 'Ultimately
South Africa retained 43 per cent of the pool to which it contributes more
than 90 per cent.'
He also suggested that diverging industrial policies regarding protection
levels, and different degrees of development, would 'increasingly strain the
relations within SACU'. South Africa has already given notice that the
structure of SACU will have to be re-examined.
On tariff reform, the accent, Mr Naude stresses, is on combating inflation
and promoting competitiveness - the government is not interested in
subsidising industries which don't have the potential to succeed
independently. Nor does it intend throwing industries to the wolves where
careful nurturing could see them through to health.
Other principles enunciated include: tariffs will not be used as a fiscal
instrument; tariff increases to promote specific increases will generally be
for limited periods only; formula duties will be phased out; regular tariff
adjustments will be avoided; tariff reductions in terms of South Africa's
offer to Gatt - currently being revised - will be phased in over five to 10
years.
The rationale underlying these reforms is simple. The sanctions years, which
placed a premium on import substitution and self-sufficiency, are largely
over. Now, says Mr Naude, 'future wealth increasingly will have to be
derived from penetration into export markets. Trade and industrial policy
thus needs to focus on the improvement of competitiveness in support of
export-driven growth . . . '

FT  01 DEC 92 / Zimbabwe seeks further aid pledges: Favourable response
expected at Paris meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Zimbabwe, battered by the worst drought in living memory,
today meets consultative group donors in Paris to seek further help for its
structural adjustment programme.
A broadly favourable response from the World Bank-chaired meeting is likely.
Implementation of the five-year programme, now nearing the end of its second
year, is broadly on target, despite unsatisfactory progress on public sector
and institutional reform.
The drought is taking a heavy toll, however. Macro-economic performance has
fallen well short of targets. Farm production is estimated to have fallen by
more than a third, while official forecasts point to a 10 per cent decline
in real GDP, the worst recession in 60 years.
Inflation, which peaked in the third quarter this year at 48 per cent, is
also way ahead of expectations. Over the three years to 1993 a cumulative
current account balance of payments deficit of some Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.3bn) is forecast, double the original programme target.
As a result, Zimbabwe's foreign debt will rise to over Dollars 3.9bn next
year, or 75 per cent of GDP, while the debt service ratio will reach 28 per
cent of exports.
In a paper prepared for the donors, the World Bank says Zimbabwe will need
Dollars 1.4bn in external aid next year, and Dollars 3.2bn over the three
years to 1995. In addition to substantial lending by the multilaterals (IMF,
World Bank and African Development Bank) 'large inputs are also needed from
bilateral donors and commercial banks'.
Of the Dollars 1.4bn for next year, Dollars 910m will come from existing
commitments - Dollars 144m from the IMF; Dollars 178m from the World Bank;
Dollars 213m from the ADB; and Dollars 246m in grants and bilateral loans.
New grant commitments of Dollars 200m and new bilaterals loans of Dollars
150m are being sought at the Paris meeting. Donor response is likely to be
positive, despite mounting demands on a near stagnant pool of foreign aid.
For its part, the Zimbabwe government will come under pressure to improve
its performance, especially on civil service reform and privatisation,
fiscal management and the deregulation of investment.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Panic accuses Milosevic of sabotaging election bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE third minister in three days yesterday resigned from Yugoslavia's
federal government, in an apparent attempt to undermine Mr Milan Panic, the
Yugoslav prime minister.
The move appears to have been engineered by Serbian president Slobodan
Milosevic, who is known to have close ties with the three cabinet ministers.
It seems to be aimed at discrediting the prime minister, whom Serbian
nationalists have accused of betraying the country's interests, in the
run-up to elections.
Mr Panic is due to announce today whether he will stand against the Serbian
president in the elections slated for December 20. He dismissed the
resignations as 'a transparent attempt by Milosevic to undermine a
government of reconciliation and hope, in a frenzied effort to stay in power
at all costs'.
The ebullient Belgrade-born Californian millionaire has won popularity for
promising to end the war in Bosnia and lift UN sanctions. He ranks ahead of
Mr Milosevic in the latest opinion polls.
Western diplomats say the elections may tip the balance between war and
peace in Serbia. Mr Milosevic is widely seen as most responsible for the
wars in neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia.
Mr Panic is the only candidate who can seriously challenge the Serbian
president. Despite more than a year of war and economic collapse, hastened
by sanctions, through his tight grip on state television, Mr Milosevic
remains popular.
Belgrade students collected the 10,000 signatures needed to put Mr Panic on
the ballot just minutes before the midnight deadline on Sunday. He joined a
list of candidates which include Mr Vuk Draskovic, an opposition leader, Mr
Jezdimir Vasiljevic, a millionaire businessman, and Captain Dragan, a
paramilitary leader.
Fighting flared throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday despite a partial
truce agreed by Croat and Serb forces in the former Yugoslav republic.
As the United Nations-brokered truce came into force, Serb fighters accused
Croats and Moslems of using it to bring in arms and reinforcements. The
ceasefire called for an end to cross-border shelling and the withdrawal from
Bosnia of the Croatian army. Croatia until Saturday had denied the presence
of its regular army units.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian government did not sign the truce. Moslems, the
republic's largest ethnic group, control only a few towns, which account for
about 10 per cent of Bosnian territory.
Belgrade radio reported fighting in Orasje, northern Bosnia, at the Croatian
border. Sarajevo radio said Serb forces shelled Olovo, Tesanj and Doboj,
northern Bosnia. It also said nearby Gradacac came under heavy shelling and
an infantry attack on Sunday night.
Meanwhile in Geneva, a report of the UN Human Rights Commission said Bosnian
Serbs were of 'primary responsibility for the human tragedy' in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.

<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) and the Sudwestdeutsche
Landesbank (SudwestLB), two of Germany's leading public sector banks, are
paying Standard Chartered Pounds 26.3m (Dollars 39.75m) to buy the 50 per
cent stake in Chartered WestLB which they do not already own.
The London-based Chartered WestLB, which specialises in pan-European
corporate finance, was founded in 1989 out of the combination of Standard
Chartered's merchant banking activities with those of WestLB, one of
Germany's biggest and most aggressive banks. A few months later, SudwestLB
took a stake in the new venture.
The two German institutions said the purchase would enable them to expand
Chartered WestLB's merchant banking activities and to integrate the common
businesses more effectively. The sale of the stake would allow Standard
Chartered to concentrate on its core commercial banking business, the
statement said.
Chartered WestLB, which apart from its London headquarters has branches in
Berlin and Dusseldorf, home of WestLB, is active in advisory business,
mergers and acquisitions, project, export and special finance. At the end of
last year its balance sheet assets stood at Pounds 1.7bn and for 1991 it
made an after-tax profit of Pounds 14.6m, which it is expecting to match in
the current year.
The existing worldwide co-operation agreement between the two German banks
and Standard Chartered will not be affected, although in future the main
area of co-operation would be foreign commercial business, they said
yesterday.

<TEXT>
ARCO, the large US oil and gas group, said yesterday it had agreed to sell
146 onshore US oil and gas properties for a total of Dollars 362m.
The property disposals are part of Arco's previously-announced programme to
reduce overall costs and to focus on core holdings by selling non-strategic
assets.
Arco said yesterday that the Dollars 362m of sales would be part of its plan
to sell properties valued at a total of nearly Dollars 600m by year-end.
Following these deals, two of which will close by year-end, Arco said it
would have 'only a few more minor fields' to be sold in the western region
of the US. Arco will retain about 60 large fields that have relatively high
production rates and profitability in the region.
The property sales are divided into three separate transactions.
The biggest is a Dollars 208.9m deal to sell property with proven reserves
of 28m barrels of crude oil and 57bn cubic feet of natural gas to Anadarko
Petroleum of Houston. The properties, in the south-west of the US, will
double Anadarko's proven US crude oil reserves and increase its 1993
production by 60 per cent.
The second-largest sale is a Dollars 90m deal under which Arco will sell
fields in California's San Joaquin basin to Vintage Petroleum, an
independent energy company.
The third is a Dollars 63m transaction, under which Arco will sell 14 fields
in Wyoming and other Rocky Mountain states to Snyder Oil, another
independent operator. Arco said it would maintain an overriding royalty
interest in some of the 14 fields being sold to Snyder and may receive
additional future payments if oil prices exceed certain levels over the next
five years.
On Wall Street yesterday, Arco's share price declined by Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 109 3/8.

CORN PRODUCTS, the US group which owns the Knorr brand name, has bought out
its local Turkish partner in the latest move by foreign companies to move
into Turkey's food and beverage industry.
The US company paid Dollars 5.5m for 40 per cent of Besan, owned by Koc
Holding group, Turkey's largest industrial company. Koc is disposing of a
number of interests to focus on core activities like motor and consumer
electronics.
Bankers say there is a growing foreign interest in the Turkish food and
beverage market, notably the manufacturing, retail and distribution sides.
Unilever recently acquired control of the Komili edible oils group after a
fierce battle for market share. Cargill of the US purchased Yanikoy, a local
glucose manufacturer.
In food retailing, Koc has established two outlets in Istanbul with
Prisunic, the French food stores company. Carrefour, the French hypermarket
group, is also considering investment in Turkey.
Turkey's privatisation agency offered in November to sell its 93 per cent
share in Gima, the state-owned chain of food stores.

The share are expected to be priced at a 30 per cent supplement on the
nominal price of the shares.
The rights offer will start within a few days and last one month.
Al-Ahli Bank is to increase its capital to KD75.56m (Dollars 252m) from
KD50.37m by giving shareholders the right to new shares on a one-for-two
basis.
The al-Ahli issue is at an earlier stage than that of Commercial Bank. It is

<TEXT>
YPF, Argentina's national oil company, has reported 1991 net profit of
Dollars 245m, more than five times its income the year before, despite a
heavy fall in sales revenues.
Sales fell to Dollars 4.03bn from Dollars 5.17bn the year before, although
the two figures may not be directly comparable.
YPF is due to be privatised in 1993. Its sharply-improved performance is due
both to a radical downsizing to prepare it for sale and to tighter
management. A YPF official said the 1991 accounts had been held up by
congressional delay in approving the YPF privatisation bill.
The company has shed its marginal oilfields and is selling off lossmaking
subsidiaries, ranging from a tanker fleet to part of its refinery capacity.
The government also sacked YPF's previous politically-appointed management
and handed control over to oil industry professionals.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president, has tripled reserves, cut operating costs
by a quarter and boosted oil output by 15 per cent. He also halved the
workforce at a cost of more than Dollars 600m.

<TEXT>
AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer with half its sales along the US east coast,
reported a 6.1 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter, despite
the dollar's weakness.
Net profit rose to Fl 66.7m (Dollars 37m) from Fl 62.9m a year ago, when the
dollar stood 15 per cent higher than in the most recent quarter. Had the
dollar not declined, net profit would have risen by a further Fl 5m, the
company said.
Sales in local currencies were higher in both the Netherlands and the US,
where Ahold owns four supermarket chains. But the lower dollar meant that
group turnover fell to Fl 4.8bn from Fl 5bn.
In the Netherlands, where Aholds operates Albert Heijn, the biggest
supermarket chain, sales rose 4.5 per cent to Fl 2.4bn. US sales increased
by 3.3 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn.
Operating profit fell to Fl 110.6m from Fl 112m, again reflecting the effect
of the lower dollar. In local currencies, Dutch operating profit was up 14
per cent at Fl 47.8m, while US results posted a 6.2 per cent gain to Dollars
38.3m.
Ahold's nine-month net profit stands at Fl 220.2m, an 8.1 per cent rise on
the same period of 1991.

PRE-TAX profits of Borthwicks, the natural flavours and food products group,
increased by Pounds 344,000 to Pounds 1.28m in the six months to September
26.
The pre-tax figure was boosted by cash received and the release of a
provision amounting to Pounds 442,000 from a discontinued operation. Profits
for the comparable period last time were depressed by reorganisation costs
totalling Pounds 346,000.
Turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds
23.2m. The interest charge fell slightly to Pounds 324,000 (Pounds 356,000).
The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.5p, payable from earnings per
share of 1.9p (1.2p).

The accounting policy relating to the capitalisation of interest on new

That reduced the current pre-tax figure by Pounds 140,000 and last year's by

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Greene King provides Pounds 3.8m for failed
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENE King's unsuccessful bid for Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer,
cost a total Pounds 3.8m in the half year to November 1 1992.
There was a Pounds 1.1m net cost of carrying the 29.3 per cent stake in
Morland, which raised the East Anglian-based brewer's interest charges from
Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.86m and contributed to a 4 per cent fall in interim
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 9.91m to Pounds 9.52m.
And there was a Pounds 2.7m extraordinary charge for underwriting costs and
professional fees for the bid.
Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, said the stake - bought at 450p a
share and now worth 418p - would be retained as a 'strategic investment.'
The reduction in interest rates would reduce carrying costs in the second
half to about Pounds 650,000, he said.
Taxable profits were also affected by lower property disposals and changes
in accounting for them. An exceptional loss of Pounds 9,000 compared with a
surplus of Pounds 486,000 in the corresponding period last time.
Earnings per share fell 4 per cent to 16.2p (16.8p), but the interim
dividend is raised 6 per cent to 3.7p (3.5p). Trading profit rose 6 per cent
to Pounds 13.27m (Pounds 12.51m) on turnover ahead 3 per cent from Pounds
65.6m to Pounds 67.5m.
Trading conditions remained depressed but beer volumes were held near last
year's levels and market share improved, Mr Redman said.
Cask beers made real volume gains, with Greene King IPA, given strong
advertising and promotional support, doing well in all trade sectors. 'We
see good potential for further growth,' Mr Redman said.
Free trade business during the half year accounted for 56 per cent of volume
sales; and a new depot is planned close to the M3 motorway to extend
distribution in southern England.
The company invested heavily in upgrading its pubs. Food takings in the
managed pubs grew 22 per cent, and the emphasis on catering has been
increased.
A number of tenanted pubs, which were not viable in the longer term, would
be sold when the property market improved, Mr Redman said. 'We intend to
continue adding to our pub estate where suitable opportunities occur. Our
investment focus is now concentrated on better quality, larger properties.'
COMMENT
Greene King must be mightily relieved by the fall in interest rates. It will
almost halve the cost in the second half of carrying the 29.3 per cent stake
in Morland; and it may help to revive consumer confidence in East Anglia
which has been one of the areas hardest hit by the recession. The Morland
holding remains an embarrassment. It is unlikely to prove successful as the
launching pad for a second bid; and Greene King will have to wait on the
Morland management to restore its value or sell at a loss. That said, it is
still getting a better return on that investment than its 35 per cent stake
in Butterfly hotels. The core beer and pubs business is performing rather
better than the market. Abbott and IPA are strong brands which should
perform even better when more buoyant conditions return. Analysts suggest
that will not be this year-forecasting flat yearly profits of Pounds 20.3m.
On a prospective p/e of 13.5, the shares are rated a hold.

STANDARD Chartered yesterday announced the proposed sale of its 50 per cent
stake in Chartered WestLB, the London-based international merchant bank
jointly owned by Standard Chartered and two German banks.
The stake was sold to WestLB (Europe) UK Holdings, which is 75 per cent
owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and 25 per cent owned by Sudwestdeustsche
Landesbank.
Standard Chartered will be paid Pounds 26.3m plus a dividend of half the
earnings of Chartered WestLB for 1992, and a share of dividends for three
years after that.
The move - if approved by the Bank of England - will complete the disposal
of what was Standard Chartered's London-based merchant bank.
It will be left with merchant banking arms in Singapore, Hong Kong and
Zimbabwe.
Mr Rodney Galpin, chief executive, said the transaction reflected a
re-refocussing of Standard Chartered businesses to concentrate capital on
core activities.
It did not affect the commercial banking relationship with WestLB

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOP three paper and packaging companies in the Netherlands are to merge,
creating the second-largest European paper group after Stora of Sweden.
The merger of KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG will produce a European paper
and packaging company with annual sales of around Fl 12.5bn (Pounds 4.6bn)
and a market capitalisation of more than Fl 2.3bn.
The announcement comes as profits of all three companies are under pressure
from over-capacity and recession. However, Mr Frank de Wit, KNP chairman,
said the proposed merger was designed as a way of positioning all three
partners for the future.
The new company, as yet unnamed, will be a large European force in packaging
and have a wide network for distributing graphic equipment.
The deal is unlikely to encounter opposition from Dutch authorities but the
merger partners will also have to inform the European Commission, which now
has power to review mergers and acquisitions. Mr Robert van Oordt, Buhrmann
chairman and the proposed chairman of the new company, said he did not
foresee 'big problems' from Brussels.
The link-up will be effected through an exchange of shares between KNP on
the one hand and Buhrmann and VRG on the other. Buhrmann shareholders will
receive one share in the new company for every share they own, while VRG
shareholders will receive 0.8 share for each of their shares. Shares in all
three companies rose on the news.
'Shareholders will gain from the quantum leap in the scale of the new
group's operations and the consequent strategic and financial benefits
without paying a premium,' the companies said.
A prospectus will be published in late January or early February. The deal
will reduce the group's exposure to the paper business cycle, as the company
will purchase three-quarters of its paper needs from outside suppliers.
KNP is mainly a paper and cardboard producer while Buhrmann and VRG are
primarily involved in the trade and distribution of graphic paper, graphic
systems and information systems. Buhrmann is also active in packaging.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Friendly society stops taking business after Pounds 4.3m
write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LANCASHIRE &amp; Yorkshire Assurance, a friendly society, closed to new business
yesterday after revealing that a fund advertised as investing only in cash
deposits and gilts had suffered a Pounds 4.3m property write-off.
The society, which took in Pounds 10.151m in new premium business last year,
said it would resume writing new business only after the high court had
reached a decision on how much compensation was payable. It said this could
take many months. It will continue to pay claims on maturing policies.
Insurance brokers felt that the society could not continue trading, and
would seek a 'rescue' from another friendly society. About 69,000
policyholders have money invested in the society's Capital Secure fund,
which included the property, a motorway hotel development.
Of these, about 36,000 made their investment before January 1987, when
property was specifically excluded from the range of assets in which the
fund could invest. Only investments in the Capital Secure fund, which
dropped by 9 per cent in value as a result, are affected.
Mr John Ramsden, chairman of the society, said the problem came to light
early this year, when investors queried their returns on maturing policies.
All the present board members have been appointed since June 1990. Mr
Ramsden said that one option may be to transfer L&amp;Y's interests to another
friendly society, but this would be clear only after the court ruling.
He added that it was unclear whether compensation should be paid, as there
was no legal precedent for the case, and that the society had held
discussions with the Registry of Friendly Societies and with Lautro, the
life assurance regulator, before deciding to seek a high court ruling.
Mr John Richards, a Bristol-based insurance broker who has done business
with L&amp;Y said: 'I think they are cutting the ground beneath their feet by
closing to new business. In these times it could be financial suicide.'
Mr Colin Boylett, an independent financial adviser, said: 'We had been given
direct assurance. I fail to see how they can possibly not compensate on that
basis.'
Policyholder Mrs Margaret Harvey, a London journalist, said her policy was
inflexible, making it difficult to switch between funds.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of the money policy group at the Consumers'
Association, said: 'We would obviously be extremely concerned if they were
not covered by the compensation scheme. It's very much in the interests of
the friendly society movement to set up some kind of ex gratia arrangement.'

FT  01 DEC 92 / Observer: Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tribal customs of Britain's main public sector trade unions have long
been of interest to employers. They are now to be the subject of a formal
study by an anthropologist charged with helping smooth the merger of Nalgo,
Nupe and Cohse, into the public sector 'super-union' to be called Unison.
Dr Alexandra Ourousoff, who has been given the job, says: 'It is important
to understand the cultures of the organisations because it is so easy for
differences in cultural values to impede communication'. Perhaps the unions
are leading where companies should follow.

FT  01 DEC 92 / ICI grapples with electricity price riddle: How setting the
level is more complicated than solving the Rubik cube
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 4 O'CLOCK every afternoon, senior managers at ICI's Runcorn complex start
a computer game that takes them well into the evening and produces a
forecast for the next day's electricity price.
Only when it is over can they determine whether ICI can afford to make
chlorine in the next 24 hours.
The data is no more accurate than a weather forecast.
This unpredictability over the price of the vast quantity of power the
complex uses - 1 per cent of all the UK's electricity consumption - has
caused ICI to consider quitting its UK chlorine business, putting 7,000 jobs
at risk.
ICI's protests are echoed by other large-scale electricity users in the
steel, glass and cement industries, as well as other chemicals companies.
Chlorine is basic to the solvents and plastics sector of the chemicals
industry.
The chlor-chemicals industry is already under pressure for environmental
reasons.
Chlorine is dangerous and the regulations for making and using it are tight
and getting tighter.
ICI has reduced discharges of liquid chlorinated hydrocarbons into the
Weston Canal at Runcorn by 80 per cent in the past five years but must
reduce them from the present 45 tonnes a year to under 18 tonnes by the
mid-1990s.
It is allowed to emit 10,000 tonnes of gases into the atmosphere - 20 per
cent down on 1987 levels - but these must be reduced to just 700 tonnes in
the same period.
ICI says it can afford the Pounds 50m needed to meet these targets only if
profitability is restored to levels before electricity privatisation.
The price ICI pays for electricity may vary unpredictably every half hour -
it pays the price bid by the last electricity generating station needed to
meet demand for that half-hour slot in the day.
If the weather becomes colder and demand for electricity rises, the price
may shoot up beyond expectations.
Since ICI never knows what it has to pay until after it has consumed the
power, it is crucial for managers to second-guess the forecast as closely as
possible so they can shut down plant before getting caught out.
To complicate forecasting, Britain's 50 power stations can, the next day,
put in one of three bid prices for each set of generating equipment. Each
station may have as many as four sets, making 12 potential prices from each
of them every half hour.
A surcharge may also apply: some stations may have to run because
distribution problems at any particular moment might mean inadequate local
supplies if they did not.
Mr Ken Green, commercial manager of ICI's energy policy and purchasing
department, says this is the electricity generators' 'open chequebook' on
prices.
Mr Green, a chartered electrical engineer, is in charge of trying to master
Britain's electricity pricing system for ICI, but says the mathematics have
so far proved beyond computer-assisted brainpower.
'We are constantly trying to second-guess the workings of a very complicated
algorithm,' he says. 'The Rubik Cube was an algorithm. I worked out the
rules and could eventually do it in about three minutes.
'I wish I could do the same with the formula for pricing electricity. We
have computer programs to help us and still we can't develop any proper
logicality.'
Mr Bryan Bulloch, power services manager at Runcorn, who has prepared the
company's evidence on the issue to two Commons committees, values the
chlor-chemicals sector's home and export markets at Pounds 750m a year each.
If ICI abandoned chlorine production to foreign competition, the overall
impact on the UK balance of trade would be Pounds 1.5bn.
Before electricity was privatised, ICI paid about Pounds 20 per
megawatt-hour (MWh). Average costs this year will average more than Pounds
31 per MWh. About Pounds 30m of exports have been turned away because ICI
cannot afford to run plant long enough to meet demand and profits are Pounds
20m down in spite of rigorous cost-cutting.
Under German competition law, ICI cannot divulge how much it pays for
electricity for its similar, but smaller scale operations in Wilhelmshaven,
northern Germany, but a figure of Pounds 25 per MWH was inadvertently
confirmed as approximately right by Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI
Chemicals and Polymer, earlier this month.
To achieve that, ICI has to guarantee running the plant at 95 per cent
capacity to keep its contribution to overall energy demand predictable.
It will come off-load in cold weather to help electricity generators cope
with surges.
Mr Green says similar bargains cannot be struck in Britain. 'We should be
able to bring to the negotiating table virtues such as load factor,
load-shedding capability, size, long-term commitment and a willingness to
take or pay whether we use all the electricity or not.
'But there is no negotiating table. The generators tell us the price and we
have to take it or leave it.'
The consequences of imposed, variable prices are an engineering nightmare
for Mr Bulloch and his colleagues.
Mr Bulloch says the government believes that 90 per cent of industrial
electricity users are paying less than before privatisation, while big users
such as ICI are merely whining.
He says any company using less than 10 MW has gained, but the volume
discounts for big users - Runcorn's demand is about 250 MW - have
disappeared in favour of everyone having to pay the same price at any given
time of day.
The big users are all in strategic industries. ICI believes discounts should
be available for large users once they pass a negotiable threshold,
calculated so that even the most heavily discounted price would never be
subsidised.
Negotiation would match the lowest discounted price to the lowest profitable
marginal price available locally, so as not to cause distribution problems.
ICI Runcorn is less than five miles from Fiddler's Ferry, a 2,000 MW
old-established plant producing cheap electricity from competitively-priced
coal.
At present, the marginal price of electricity to individual industrial users
goes up as national demand rises.
ICI's argument is that any large individual user should be encouraged to use
more by paying less per unit for increasing volumes once a reasonable
threshold has been cleared.
This, Mr Bulloch says, is the commercial reality of any normal marketplace.
But British bulk electricity markets are not normal. Mr Green says they are
not even markets.
There is no mutuality of self-interest between suppliers and large
consumers, so no incentive to the suppliers - generators and distributors -
to give ground as they operate what ICI says is, in effect, a monopoly.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Cork Gully case disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PARTNERS from Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, gave
'inadequate' information to the court considering their application to be
appointed administrators to Polly Peck International, the
fruit-to-electronics group, their professional body said yesterday.
Mr Michael Jordan, head of Cork Gully, and Mr Richard Stone, head of
corporate finance, were both found guilty of misconduct on two grounds by
the professional conduct committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales.
They sought and accepted appointment as administrators while failing without
good reason to follow their professional ethics guidance, and when they
should have known there was, or appeared, to be a conflict of interest
between the firm, Polly Peck and Mr Asil Nadir, its chairman.
The charges came in the details of proceedings of the committee, made public
yesterday, a month after the two men were each fined Pounds 1,000 and asked
to pay Pounds 1,000 in costs.
The committee said the men offered no satisfactory explanation for the
inadequacy of information they provided to the court on October 25 1990. Had
they made proper inquiries, the fact they had a 'clear continuing
professional relationship' would have been clear, it said.
It also emerged that the statement issued yesterday was shown to Coopers
before it was released, and that alterations were made as a result.
Two footnotes to the judgment were removed - one which reproduced an extract
from the professional code of conduct, and another stating the maximum fine
which could be imposed at the time of the hearing was Pounds 1,000 per
person.
Mr Douglas Llambias, a council member of the Institute and its disciplinary
committee, said yesterday's statement should have been released at the time
of the original findings against the two men.

THE Financial Times has selected the advertising agency Delaney Fletcher
Slaymaker Delaney and Bozell to handle its Pounds 1m annual UK advertising
campaign.
The agency replaces Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which handled FT advertising from 1981
until August. The successful agency was chosen from a shortlist of three -
the other two were BMP DDB Needham and Laing Henry.
Ogilvy &amp; Mather was responsible for the slogan 'No FT: No Comment'. Mr Terry
Damer, the FT's UK marketing director, said: 'We don't expect it (the
slogan) to be buried but the new campaign, to be launched early in 1993,
will not depend upon it.'
The new agency will handle only the UK account. The FT's advertising in
continental Europe is created by Ambler Rodford Stevns.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Democracy link puts investment plans at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S decision to link Hong Kong's political development with the colony's
economic administration puts at risk hundreds of millions of dollars of
planned investments, Simon Holberton writes.
While China said it continued to welcome foreign investment in Hong Kong, it
has also indicated it will not talk to the colonial government until it
withdraws plans to broaden democracy there.
Some of the bigger projects which could be threatened if Britain and China
are unable to agree are: Black Point power station: a development planned by
China Light and Power (CLP), monopoly supplier of electricity to Kowloon and
the New Territories, and Exxon, the US oil company. It would have generating
capacity of 6,000MW and is expected to require investment of around
HKDollars 60bn (Pounds 5bn). China has agreed to the extension of CLP's
monopoly until well into the next century, but has yet to agree a grant of
land upon which the plant will be built.
A delay to the project would not only limit potential growth in Hong Kong,
but it could also harm neighbouring Guangdong province in China which
imports electricity from CLP.
Container Terminal 9, (CT9): the development of Hong Kong's container port
to enlarge its capacity. Investment is expected to be about HKDollars 9bn.
China approved the grant of land for CT9 earlier this year but last week
claimed it should also have a say in how the government negotiated disposal
of the land.
Cable television: Wharf, the company of the late Sir Y K Pao, has emerged as
the only serious bidder for an exclusive franchise to operate Hong Kong's
first cable TV service. China's agreement will be necessary if the
government accepts Wharf's proposal, which is estimated to require about
HKDollars 5bn in investment.
Hongkong Telecom: this company, which is majority-owned by Britain's Cable
and Wireless, has an exclusive franchise to operate Hong Kong's domestic
fixed wire telecommunications network.
The government wants to introduce competition into domestic Hong Kong
telecommunications and renew Hongkong Telecom's licence when it falls due in
1993 - both need China's approval. Hongkong Telecom's monopoly on
international telephony has already been agreed with China and is assured
until 2006.
Hongkong Electric: this is the monopoly supplier of power to Victoria
Island. Its monopoly right comes up for renegotiation in the next year or
so. Until the latest break down in Anglo-Chinese relations it was expected
to be approved without any difficulty.

FT  01 DEC 92 / Yeltsin ban on party upheld: Court verdict makes symbolic
concessions to Communists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S highest court yesterday closed a drawn-out trial of the Communist
party with a compromise verdict that makes symbolic concessions to
supporters of the party without reversing its dismantling by President Boris
Yeltsin.
The decision by the Constitutional Court, which said Mr Yeltsin was right
after the August coup last year to ban the party's top bodies but not its
local cells, enables both sides to claim victory while sparing Mr Yeltsin
charges that he controls the courts. Such charges could have undermined his
authority at the Congress of People's Deputies which opens today amid
threats by deputies to press for the government's removal.
A political adviser to the government said a few ministers might be
sacrificed in the course of negotiations which will continue throughout the
Congress with the centrist Civic Union opposition group.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, even set out the possibility of
Mr Yegor Gaidar resigning as prime minister in favour of somebody who would
not interfere with economic policy. He also suggested a technical
resignation of the whole government which would, however, amount to little
more than a gimmick.
But Civic Union leaders are also divided over how far to push the
government.
The court, asked to review the legitimacy of President Yeltsin's decrees
disbanding the party and confiscating its property, found he was right to
dismantle its top bodies and take over state property appropriated by the
party. But it found against his decision to dismantle local branches and
against the transfer to the state of property paid for by rank and file
members.
Mr Valentin Kuptsov, one of the former senior Communists who challenged the
president's decrees in the court, said the decision gave the Congress 'good
grounds' to seek President Yeltsin's impeachment. It also cleared the way
for the Communist party to reconstitute itself and sue for the return of its
property.
However, it is difficult to see how party cells can reconstitute an
organisation with its top bodies still banned.
Lawyers for Mr Yeltsin suggested that property would not be retrievable in
the courts. The state would have to continue making it available to society
at large.
Russia and its western creditors remain divided over how much of the former
Soviet Union's foreign debt the country is capable of repaying next year,
putting off attempts to agree a debt rescheduling until mid-December. The
Paris Club of creditor states is offering a 10-year rescheduling with a
five-year grace period which would make Russia pay Dollars 5bn next year,
while Moscow is saying it can only pay Dollars 2.5bn.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Waste water treatment scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC CIVIL ENGINEERING has won a Pounds 4m contract from Anglian Water to
construct diaphragm wall waste water holding tanks, together with gravity
sewers, pumping mains and buildings at Cromer, Sheringham and Overstrand on
the north Norfolk coast.
Sewage discharging through the short sea outfalls is to be intercepted and
delivered to a new treatment centre near Cromer. Treated effluent will then
be discharged into the North Sea via a new long sea outfall.
The company will install a 4,300 cu metre storm waste water holding tank and
construct a pumping station on the west promenade at Cromer. The tank will
be located at the site of a Victorian shelter at the base of the cliff.
A sewer will be laid along the promenade in Cromer from the town centre to
the new pumping station and storm tank, to intercept all sewage flows
presently discharging onto the beach or the short sea outfall.
At Sheringham a 25 metre diameter, 3,076 cu metre storm sewage holding tank
will be installed and a pumping station constructed. On completion of the
cover slab, a building will be constructed to house pump control equipment,
odour control and other facilities.
New sewers, generally up to 375mm diameter, will be constructed at
Overstrand and will include construction of 1.5 metre diameter and 2.1 metre
diameter on-line sewer storage tanks.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Study finds fault with bank loan covenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH BANKERS may have shown financial naivety when setting conditions for
loans with companies, an academic study suggests.
The current definitions in loan agreements between companies and banks of
ratios such as minimum net worth, interest cover or gearing are open to
widespread manipulation, the study found.
The conclusions come in an analysis of bank loan covenants by Mr David
Citron, a lecturer in accounting at City University Business School in
London.
Most banks attempt to safeguard their loans with performance linked to key
financial ratios, yet while the definitions are legally watertight most
leave enormous scope for creative accounting by managers determined not to
breach these ratios.
Bankers appear to have relied too much on their lawyers and not enough on
their accountants. In a survey of 29 leading lending institutions, Mr Citron
found that for loans over Pounds 1m more than two-thirds have financial
ratio covenants, rising to an even greater proportion for unsecured loans or
for those to companies with high gearing.
In a separate analysis of 25 bank loan contracts and 13 contract templates,
he found few of the ratios were directly linked to performance. The most
common were minimum net worth, interest cover and gearing.
On the definition of profit, he says: 'There is little evidence that
contracts attempt to adjust for accounting procedures that are particularly
susceptible to management discretion.'
Overall, he concludes: 'Some items are accepted as presented in the
accounts, thus leaving some scope for manoeuvre through a choice of
appropriate accounting methods.'
While some of the accounting ratios are more tightly defined with less scope
for abuse - such as assets - many measures are based on profits and so
remain open to manipulation.
Off-balance sheet finance is typically not considered, because most of the
ratios only specify the ratios in relation to the consolidated accounts of a
company.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter From Rozay-En-Brie: US pressure is the final straw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The family of Jean-Philippe Garnot has been growing cereals on the wide
plains of Brie east of Paris for generations. Yet never before has the
region been so much under threat, says Mr Garnot.
The threat comes from US pressure to cut European subsidised farm exports.
The European Community, to which farmers such as Mr Garnot have always
turned for protection, has caved in to American demands, he says. Today Mr
Garnot, 35, feels abandoned by Brussels.
'Why should American farmers have the right to produce and European farmers
not have the right to produce?' asks Mr Garnot, who like many fellow farmers
is a loyal right-wing Gaullist.
'The Americans are just defending their corner. More than half our fight is
against the European Commission,' he adds. 'We are not really understood by
the Commission . . . A few commissioners have signed something that is in
the general interest, but when you take the special case of France, it is
catastrophic.'
Mr Garnot, a pillar of the local branch of the FNSEA, France's main farm
union, manned the barricades in last week's farmers' demonstrations in Paris
and will do again at a rally with other European farmers in Strasbourg
tomorrow. He believes he is defending his region and his job.
Many people believe Mr Garnot and his colleagues are wrong, that French
farmers have lived for too long under the cosy protection of the EC's Common
Agricultural Policy (Cap). French farmers, critics say, should have faced up
to the realities of international competition years ago.
Yet the problem does not look that simple from the vantage point of the 14th
century keep that dominates Mr Garnot's farmhouse. The tower looks out over
a tapestry of pale green shades, the first shoots of a crop sown six weeks
ago, which stretches away towards the medieval market town of Rozay-en-Brie.
The view has not changed very much for hundreds of years, during which time
Brie supplied the famous cheese of the same name and wheat for Parisians'
bread. Yet the view is about to change, and with it the region's fortunes,
farmers fear. Next year ugly brown squares will appear in the tapestry,
fields to be left fallow under Cap reforms designed to take land out of
production - the so-called set-aside scheme.
The local economy, still firmly wedded to its rural roots, cannot generate
new jobs to replace the more than 1,000 farmworkers that Mr Garnot estimates
will lose their jobs in his departement of Seine-et-Marne over the next
three years.
The movement of jobs and people away from the country - desertification -
has just started to blight the fertile cereal plains of Brie.
Desertification in Brie is nothing like as bad as in the poorer central and
south-western France. Yet the first signs are there, with the closure of a
butcher's shop and a bakery in a village near Mr Garnot's last year.
As elsewhere in France, local people are looking for someone to blame for
their economic plight. Some have turned against the EC, in line with other
rural communities which nearly succeeded in persuading the nation to vote
down the Maastricht treaty in September's referendum. A faded poster on a
wall bordering the track to Mr Garnot's tower declares: 'Maastricht,
unemployment, taxes.'
Mr Garnot will survive the Cap reform better than most because his farm is
relatively large - more than 200 hectares - and on prime land. But he will
not entirely escape the impact of the Cap reforms and he fears the EC-US
trade accord will hit him even harder.
Under the Cap reforms, Mr Garnot, like other large cereal farms, is obliged
to take 15 per cent of his land out of production. Next year he will plough
over the least productive fields. His annual turnover will fall by 7 per
cent. Some fields, like his own, will be left as bare earth if their owners
follow good farming practice and sterilise the soil. Poorer farmers will
allow their set-aside fields to fall prey to weeds.
By 1995, Mr Garnot estimates that cuts in production and in cereal prices
will reduce his annual income by 45 per cent to FFr145,000 (Pounds 17,618).
That will just enable him to cover his running costs, assuming he stops all
investment in machinery and equipment, currently FFr150,000 a year. The rest
of the farm's FFr450,000 annual operating income will be swallowed up by
debt repayments and buying fertiliser and other materials. His one full-time
farm hand might have to go.
As a director of the local branch of Credit Agricole bank, Mr Garnot knows
how badly his neighbours will be hit because he keeps an eye on their bank
accounts. Some farmers have already reached the stage where it will take
them 30 years to repay debts from their farms' operating income. 'Who will
want to buy a farm in that state?' he asks.
Mr Garnot denies that French farmers are using the US-EC trade row to try to
regain ground lost under the Cap reforms. He taps away at a calculator to
produce unconvincing figures to support his claims that the transatlantic
accord will hurt more than the Brussels reforms.
The drift of the argument is clear. If Mr Garnot can only just accept Cap
reforms, he certainly cannot tolerate being pushed around by Washington.
Paris must therefore use its veto, 'to say stop, to let things calm down,'
he says.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Encounter in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The central question facing next week's European summit in Edinburgh is
whether the member states wish, or indeed are any longer able, to keep alive
the Community model of European integration as we have known it for the past
40 years. No doubt all or most of the original six founder members would
wish to do so, and perhaps also Spain and Portugal. But the pressure of
circumstances, and contrary pulls in other directions, may make it
impossible.
This fundamental question will underlie two of the most important items of
the agenda: the Danish problem, and the issue of the future enlargement of
the EC. The way these two issues are handled may well, between them, mark
the end of the Community as we know it.
The conventional wisdom is that the Danish problem is insoluble; in fact, it
may be easily soluble, but only by setting a deeply damaging precedent for
the future of the Community. The Danes have asked for exemptions from some
of the far-reaching ambitions of the Maastricht treaty, including monetary
union and the eventual development of a common defence; and they want these
exemptions to be given legally binding form.
Many people assume that the words 'legally binding' would require a change
in the Maastricht treaty; but since the other member states have ruled out
any renegotiation, the Danes will have to scale back their demands, and
solve 'their' problem on their own.
This is precisely what they may do. The obvious precedent is the 1963
Franco-German Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation. President de Gaulle of
France intended the treaty to introduce a new Franco-German priority into
the policy of the Federal Republic. But when the Bundestag ratified the
treaty, it tacked on a preamble which said, in effect: 'This treaty does not
diminish our commitment to Nato or our friendship with the US.' De Gaulle
was furious.
The lesson is simple. The Danes can simply put a new bill through their own
parliament, to say, in effect: 'None of the following commitments in the
Maastricht treaty applies to us.' This would be 'legally binding' in
Denmark, but not on the rest of the Community: problem solved, QED.
At that point, Maastricht may be ratifiable in Denmark; it may even be
ratifiable in Britain, if Mr John Major ever recovers some authority over
his party. But in either event the treaty will have been voided of much of
its substance, by the unilateral action of one member state.
The enlargement of the EC, as discussed in a recent publication*, is now
assumed to be inevitable, just because there are so many qualified
candidates waiting at the door. Norway last week added its name to the list,
which includes Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Cyprus and
Malta.
Until now, the applications have been stalled by the trials and tribulations
of Maastricht. But once the treaty is ratified, the EC can start to
negotiate with the candidates.
It is not clear, however, that these candidates can join without
jeopardising the EC's future development. A case in point is the treaty
objective of a common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The Commission has
said that no country should be admitted which is not committed to the
objective of a CFSP; but four of the five leading candidates are or have
been neutral. If Denmark (which is in Nato) can sign up for a common
defence, and then write itself an opt-out, it will be hard to demand any
foreign policy commitment from the Swedes or the Swiss.
The trouble with the treaty is that the heart of it consists of programmes
for future action. Some are precise, such as the programme for monetary
union; and some are vague, such as the aim of a CFSP. But the common
assumption is that this is a homogeneous Community of reasonably like-minded
states, all more or less committed to the programme. If the Danes, the
British or the Germans give themselves let-outs in advance, then the treaty
is as leaky as a colander. It might be logical to admit members before
negotiating a Maastricht-type programme; or after it had been implemented;
but not in the middle.
More seriously, the admission of a large number of members must change the
general character of the EC; the neutrality of the candidates is less
important than their size and number.
At the simplest level, it is obvious that policy decision-making will be
more difficult in a Community of 17 than in one of 12; a Community of 25
will largely cease to take any decisions. One possible response would be
more majority voting; the problem is that majority voting is only easily
manageable in a homogeneous group, whereas enlargement necessarily means
less homogeneity. Finland is much more different from Greece than Belgium is
from Holland.
The essentially universalist characteristic of the EC in the past was that
all member states took part in all decision-making. The programme for
monetary union in the Maastricht treaty marks the beginning of variable
speed policies in action; large-scale enlargement will spell the end of
universalist decision-making, and thus the end of the Community as we have
known it.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Europe's flexible friend: Martin
Bangemann, European Commission vice-president, talks to Andrew Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Bangemann, vice-president of the European Commission and former
German economics minister, is used to being misrepresented in the press. He
says it does not bother him: 'If people start with a horrible vision of you,
they can only be pleasantly surprised.'
Many people in Europe have built up a horrible vision of Mr Bangemann since
1989, when he became Germany's senior commissioner, responsible for the
internal market and industrial policy. According to the extensive Bangemann
mythology, this is the man who tried to ban the UK prawn-cocktail crisp, to
outlaw dozens of traditional unpasteurised cheeses, and to eradicate the
Spanish tilde - the squiggle over the 'n' of Espana - in the interests of EC
harmonisation.
In fact, Mr Bangemann perpetrated none of these alleged crimes against
national sovereignty but as internal market commissioner he was held
responsible. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the bulky
commissioner has frequently trodden on people's toes. Earlier this year, for
example, he attacked officials in the Commission's competition directorate,
describing them as 'ayatollahs' and 'gurus', for their over-legalistic
approach to anti-trust policy. And this month, Mr Bangemann infuriated a
nervous UK government with - in the words of Prime Minister John Major - a
'very silly and ill-informed' speech linking the Maastricht treaty to
federalism on the eve of the British parliament's vote on ratification.
Today, Mr Bangemann may upset the British again. He is attending a meeting
of EC immigration ministers in London, armed with a Commission legal opinion
that says Britain must lift its border controls on travellers within the EC
on January 1 1993.
But Mr Bangemann, 58, will not be demanding satisfaction from Britain - or
from the 11 other EC members, which are also beginning to express doubts
about the wisdom of lifting controls so soon. He says he will look for a
practical solution to the problem.
Mr Bangemann has a doctorate in law, but he claims to be, above all, a
pragmatist and a politician. 'People who stick to a theory are always better
off, (than pragmatists) because they appear completely pure and consistent.'
Mr Bangemann believes his pragmatism is one reason why he has been
criticised as inconsistent. This is one element of the principal charge
against the commissioner - that he is a political lightweight. Another is
his apparent reluctance to bury himself in complex dossiers. Although he is
eloquent, affable and erudite, national and Commission officials say he
lacks the taste for detail which is the strongpoint of commissioners such as
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner for competition and financial
services.
His political flexibility has come under fire before. When Mr Bangemann was
German economics minister, between 1984 and 1988, he disappointed his own
party - the free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - by championing the
controversial takeover of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB), the aerospace
company, by Daimler-Benz, the German motor group.
His party colleagues and the German cartel office believed the merger would
distort competition and reinforce Daimler's dominance. Mr Bangemann still
dismisses these complaints. A merger was essential to give the German
company the strength to take part in civil aircraft programmes, he argues.
In Brussels, he has continued to eschew the narrow, legal approach and
favour the flexible political solution. In framing an industrial policy, for
example, Mr Bangemann and his officials have tried not to be hamstrung
either by free-trade or protectionist prescriptions for industry.
According to the Commission's 1990 paper on industrial policy, political
authorities should aim to put in place a suitable environment in which
business can flourish, for example by encouraging the development of the
single market and global free trade. 'Protectionists must be persuaded to
cease subsidising industrial policy and orthodox economists have to admit
that ideal societies do not exist,' says Mr Bangemann in a recent book on
industrial policy. 'A European industrial policy must find a reasonable
compromise between the two extremes.'
The central example of Mr Bangemann's practical approach was last year's
voluntary agreement with Tokyo to restrain the import of Japanese cars,
while gradually removing national quotas within the EC. That deal, he says,
found a middle line between leaving protectionist restrictions in place, and
opening the market suddenly - an option which might have destroyed an
unprepared EC industry. At the time, however, the accord was also attacked
for being non-binding - hallmarks of a delicate compromise.
The real debate over industrial policy in the past four years has been
fought over competition cases, specifically on mergers, where Brussels has
substantial autonomous powers to affect the structure of European industry.
Mr Bangemann argues that industry policy is not at odds with competition
policy - a view shared by Sir Leon Brittan, and outlined in the November
1990 paper. 'We have said that the first aim of our industrial policy is to
contribute as far as possible to the competitiveness of European industry,'
says Mr Bangemann. But he adds: 'The main question in that context is how to
define competition and what measures are necessary to improve
competitiveness.'
This is where Mr Bangemann and Sir Leon have found themselves at
loggerheads. Mr Bangemann says his target is not Sir Leon himself, but the
'backward-looking, theoretical approach' of some of the Commission's
competition officials. 'They always tend to define competition in legal
terms, in abstract terms, and that is not right because competition is
changing day by day,' he says.
Mr Bangemann maintains, for example, that the Commission should have waved
through last year's controversial takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian
aircraft manufacturer, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. A
favourable decision would have created a European force in the world market
for commuter aircraft, Mr Bangemann claimed at the time.
Sir Leon won the day. But Mr Bangemann has continued to claim that he got
the De Havilland recommendation wrong. He maintains that the competition
commissiner defined the market too narrowly, exaggerating the deal's impact.
This is one issue on which Mr Bangemann, for all his pragmatism, appears
unshakeable. Another is federalism, the theme of his speech in Berlin
earlier this month which so incensed Mr Major.
In the speech, Mr Bangemann reiterated his view that the Maastricht treaty
points towards a federal European state. This was the sort of comment he had
made 'a hundred times in the past', Mr Bangemann says. But, given that the
British government was about to risk defeat from the opposition and some of
its own back-benchers on Maastricht, were the timing and tone of the speech
rather insensitive?
'If I'd said something different when (integration) was the subject of the
conference, people would have been really astonished,' he replies.
In spite of the EC's trials, the commissioner is relaxed about the
Community's prospects, even if the result is a two-speed Europe. 'If
Maastricht fails then there will be a new impetus, because out of any crisis
(Europe) has experienced, something new and better has emerged.'
Mr Bangemann is adamant that internal-market changes which come into force
on January 1 will create opportunities for European business to prosper,
even if important areas of liberalisation - in energy and
telecommunications, for example - have been deferred.
As for the issue of border controls, Mr Bangemann will try to nudge
immigration ministers at today's London meeting towards one of his pragmatic
solutions, so that the EC can be declared open at midnight on December 31.
The British have already suggested one way of easing controls on people
without having to give up border checks altogether. EC visitors should be
allowed simply to show the cover of their passports to immigration officials
at UK borders. As a classic political compromise, it is appropriate that it
should already have been dubbed 'the Bangemann wave'.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY can say for certain that tensions in the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism are over, and there will be a strong focus this week on the
D-Mark's performance against the weaker ERM currencies, writes James Blitz.
The Irish authorities will continue to make a concerted effort to defend the
Irish punt this week, and overnight rates are due to be set at around 100
per cent from today.
There may be more intense pressure on the French franc. The French currency
fell through the FFr3.40 to the D-Mark level last week. Many analysts
continue to think that if there is strong pressure on the currency it will
come in the New Year, because dealers do not want to keep positions open for
long towards the year end.
The market remains undecided about whether the dollar can make a concerted
break through the DM1.61 level this year. Despite the uncertainties over the
ERM last week, the dollar failed to break through this level.
But according to strategists at IBJ International, there is a growing
perception that the currency will strengthen on further signs of economic
recovery.
Friday's non-farm payroll figure will give some further indication of the
scale of the economic upturn. However, the figure would have to be
particularly bad to prompt any easing in monetary policy from the Federal
Reserve.
Sterling was mostly sidelined last week, with strong support at DM2.42 and
resistance at DM2.44. With relatively little economic data due out this
week, the currency is likely to be confined to these ranges.
The sharp rise in Canadian prime lending rates in the last two weeks has
strengthened the Canadian dollar. There will be caution ahead of the
government's economic statement on Wednesday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
THE main interest in GEC's interims, due on Wednesday, will be not so much
in the profits as the dividend. Last year's interim payment was held. But
the final was raised by 5 per cent, despite unchanged earnings per share for
the year.
This time, profits are expected to be only modestly up, in the range Pounds
350-360m (Pounds 346m). But GEC is still accumulating cash at a ferocious
rate. At the start of the year, net cash - including GEC's share in joint
ventures - stood at Pounds 1.4bn. It is expected to reach Pounds 1.6bn by
the year end.
Lord Weinstock can certainly afford an increase. The question this can be
ahead of earnings. Given encouraging news from Germany on the future of the
European Fighter project, there is perhaps scope for generosity.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to have suffered its
first-ever year on year fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its
full-year results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen to
around Pounds 1.24bn (Pounds 1.31bn). The fall is less than it might have
been - Pounds 100m of exceptionals will be taken above the line in
accordance with the new accounting rules.
Allied-Lyons is expected to report first-half profits tomorrow of Pounds
280m (Pounds 276m), restated after adjustments. Most of the gain will come
from spirits and wine, helped by cost-savings from restructuring of
distribution in North America and resilient performances in Spain and Japan.
Brewing and pub retailing has been under pressure from the UK recession and
the disruption caused by the government's beer orders.
Forecasts of full-year results from Bass on Wednesday range from Pounds 515m
to Pounds 538m - between 20 per cent and 25 per cent up on last year's
Pounds 430m. The figures will be affected by the levels of exceptional
restructuring charges and property disposals. Trading profits are expected
to be flat.
Well-publicised trading difficulties for Grand Metropolitan's North American
foods business will be reflected in a decline in full-year profits on
Thursday from Pounds 950m to about Pounds 920m. IDV, the group's spirits
division, is expected to record another solid advance in trading profits but
lower earnings are forecast from the retailing sector, where an improvement
in Burger King is unlikely to compensate for pressure on pubs.
Trafalgar House, the construction, engineering and property group, reporting
full-year results on Tuesday, is expected to announce that Pounds 90m of
profits were wiped out by a big tax charge and Pounds 50m of writedowns on
housing and commercial property. Last year's Pounds 122.4m pre-tax profits
were reclassified after Pounds 102.7m of development properties were
deducted, following an investigation by the Financial Reporting Review
Panel.

FT  30 NOV 92 / European Government Bonds: Fears of fresh upheaval in the
ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY remains a safety play as tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism continue. In spite of the recent realignments of parities in the
ERM, economists and analysts agree that the crisis is not over. Fear of
further ERM realignments kept markets such as Irish gilts, and Spanish,
Portuguese and Danish government bonds under pressure last week.
The key to the survival of the ERM remains the interest rate stance of the
Bundesbank. Some observers insist that it will cut rates on December 10 to
suit domestic needs and EC politics ahead of the Edinburgh summit. Others,
pointing to remarks by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the
Bundesbank, insist it will continue to follow a policy of unreconstructed
monetarism.
Meanwhile, several European markets regained some of the ground lost on
German bonds in the latter part of last week, after Germany produced the
week's biggest disappointment - its poor inflation and money supply figures.
Provisional figures for November showed inflation stubbornly high at 3.7 per
cent for the second month in succession, with forecasts saying it is heading
for 4 per cent. Money supply is growing at more than 10 per cent on an
annualised basis.
Analysts say that the realignments have highlighted the attractions of the
stronger currencies. They say we are witnessing a decoupling of the two
tiers, and that currency uncertainty is now shifting to Ireland, Denmark and
France. These three countries are seeing the most dramatic changes in yield
curves as short-term rates rise to defend the currencies. Ireland was only
delaying inevitable devaluation, agreed bond analysts late last week. The
high short-term rates introduced to defend the punt have sharply inverted
the yield curve and are not sustainable.
If Ireland does devalue, they say, Denmark and even France could move into
the firing line. Although Denmark's latest inflation figure is one of the
lowest in the EC, its trading position is becoming more vulnerable as other
currencies are devalued. Denmark has suffered particularly badly in the ERM
turmoil. Given its much lower inflation rate than Germany, and much better
government finances, its 10-year spread of around 160 reflects entirely
devaluation risk, say analysts. It could tighten significantly in the near
term.
Political uncertainty continues to put a question mark over France. With
elections due next March, the 'franc fort' policy may be further challenged.
Before Sweden devalued, there had been hopes of a French cut irrespective of
German action; French franc bonds are suffering as rate cut expectations
have been disappointed, say analysts.
France's new problems include the possibility of its vetoing the EC/US farm
accord. The margin between French and Germany government bonds, which has
been fluctuating with the perceived devaluation risk, did start to narrow
again to finish the week just above 90 basis points. They could tighten
towards 80 basis points this week if devaluation fears subside, says Mr
Michael Burke of Yamaichi.
'Whether this spread narrows or widens depends on whether the franc can be
seen as a hard currency or not,' adds Mr Malcolm Roberts of UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew. 'On straight economic fundamentals, France should yield less than
Germany.' SG Warburg Securities, on the other hand, argues that the spread
could widen to 125 basis points as investors question the franc's status as
a Tier 1 ERM currency. If it survives the present crisis, the franc could
move to a narrow 1 per cent band against the D-Mark, joining the Benelux
countries at the hard core of an evolving ERM, says Mr Julian Jessop of
Samuel Montagu.
The French yield curve continues to shadow the D-Mark and the other hard
core currencies, but with higher rates at the short end to defend the
currency and at the long end where there is less certainty about inflation.
Looking further ahead, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in
London, is taking what some might regard as an extreme position. He argues
that while 1992 has been the year of the D-Mark, Germany's accumulating
inflation problems, high public sector borrowing requirement and other
factors will lead to a reappraisal and end what he describes as its near
mythic status.
'Germany is very much an accident waiting to happen,' he says, predicting
that the Bundesbank will at some stage have to cut interest rates
dramatically. 'It will be weaker against not just the dollar but other
European currencies.'
Mr Burke agrees that the D-Mark could weaken, at least against the harder
ERM currencies. 'The Bund market is looking overbought,' he says.

FT  30 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Cool response to signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS short, but it was sweet. The Thanksgiving holiday meant that trading
on US bond markets was restricted to three-and-a-half days. But in that
abbreviated period, there was both good news on the economy and a remarkably
sanguine response from bond traders.
Normally, signs of economic strength depress bond prices, pushing up yields,
as investors fret about looming inflationary dangers. But the Commerce
Department's announcement on Wednesday that the nation's economy grew by a
sturdy 3.9 per cent during the third quarter - a large upward revision from
the previous-reported 2.7 per cent rate - brought only the slightest of
reactions. The 30-year long bond, for example, fell by  1/16 to 100 1/16 ,
where it yielded 7.53 per cent. By Friday's 2pm close. the price had edged
only marginally lower, and the yield stood at 7.59 per cent.
At first glance, this apparent stoicism was surprising. The third-quarter
growth rate, after all, was the strongest registered for four years, and
release of the revised data came amid a raft of other encouraging economic
news. This included, for example, a 4 per cent increase in durable goods
orders in October (although the gain was heavily concentrated in aircraft,
automobiles, and defence); a sharp jump in the Conference Board's index of
consumer confidence, from 54.6 in October to 65.5 in November; and a
12,000-strong fall in initial claims for state unemployment insurance for
the week ended November 14.
There are two simple explanations for the market's response. The first is
the thought that an economy which is demonstrably recovering under its own
steam will be less likely to provoke a large fiscal stimulus package from
the Clinton administration next year. The President-elect seemed anxious to
reinforce this impression when, amid the Thanksgiving festivities in Little
Rock, he said the latest growth figures 'could have some impact on
short-term judgments' - although he also stressed that it would not affect
his long-term plans to improve the nation's competitive stance.
More simply, despite the upturn in industrial activity, there is relatively
little sign of any serious inflation threat. In fact, the same Commerce
Department report which revised the growth figure, also tweaked the 'price
deflator', to show a 1.7 per cent annual rate for the third quarter,
compared with the 2.0 per cent rate estimated last month.
Third, there is a widespread conviction that this robust level of growth
will not be repeated in the immediate future, even if the economy is edging
out of the doldrums. It is true that some economic growth forecasts for the
first half of 1993 are being nudged higher, but many pundits are happy to
stick around the 2.5 per cent mark. This, in turn, might warrant some modest
decline in bond prices, but there is a widespread expectation that yields at
the long end will hover around the 7.75 per cent mark.
This week, further confirmation that the economy is on a slow recovery tack
is expected in a steady flow of statistics. It will start with the October
leading indicators, to be released on Tuesday; work on to factory orders and
auto sales on Thursday; and culminate in the November employment data on
Friday. There is little doubt that Friday's news will be the focus of the
week: analysts are looking for some further pick-up in non-farm job growth,
although they still expect this to come from the service sector, with
manufacturing registering another overall loss of jobs. The unemployment
figure itself is predicted to remain at around the 7.4 per cent mark.

FT  30 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Differing views on prospects for prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS moved slightly lower as the market digested the implications of the
Bank of England's plan this Wednesday to auction Pounds 2.5bn of a new
10-year benchmark bond.
The sale of the 8 per cent stock due 2003 is expected to proceed reasonably
smoothly, after some reports last week that foreign investors were showing
enthusiasm for the securities on offer.
However, the auction is likely to ram home in the minds of many investors
the large volumes of gilts due to go on sale over the next two years due to
the need to fund Britain's burgeoning public sector borrowing requirement.
The admission from Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, that
it would be 'many years' before the government's finances returned to
surplus did little to damp concern about funding. Mr Budd told a Commons
select committee, that because of the depth of the recession the proportion
of total UK output accounted for by the government deficit would rise 'for
some years'.
This marks a change in the Treasury's thinking about the PSBR. In last
month's Autumn Statement, the Treasury said the proportion would be about 7
per cent of GDP in 1993-94, amounting to roughly Pounds 44bn. Many gilt
specialists have come round to the view that yearly deficits of this size
will continue during the mid to late 1990s.
However, as to the Treasury's thinking about the profile for the deficit
later in the 1990s, the gilt market has little to go on other than figures
set out in the March Budget. According to this, the PSBR as a proportion of
GDP was due to peak in 1993-94 at 4.75 per cent and then come down to 3.5
per cent in 1994-95.
While gilt yields moved up along the yield curve by a few basis points on
the week, there were differing views as to how prices will change over the
next few weeks. Mr Nigel Richardson, a gilt specialist at SG Warburg
Securities, reckons demand will be subdued on account of the funding
problems and indications that weak inflationary pressures may be starting to
exert themselves.
Indications of this sort came with latest figures for the volume of
banknotes in circulation, which suggested that M0, the narrow measure of the
money supply which is a good guide to overall demand, rose during November
by about 3 per cent compared with November last year. If confirmed when the
Bank issues official M0 figures on December 18, that would be the biggest
year-on-year rise for M0 in any month this year.
Echoing Mr Richardson's concerns about a recovery and its likely impact on
inflation, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said that
the Treasury's target of keeping underlying inflation at less than 4 per
cent could be exceeded during 1993.
More positive about the future for gilts is Mr Malcolm Roberts, a bond
analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He reckons that investors in longer-dated
securities will take heart from indications that the UK will be in no hurry
for further cuts in base rates, now at 7 per cent. That should put a floor
under prices at this end of the curve, and cause significant buying of
securities of longer maturities, particularly from overseas investors,
giving the overall gilt market a boost.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Brussels' investment plans push EIB to
centre-stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO POLITICIANS, it means putting people back to work. To the capital
markets, it means a greater demand for finance - and to other borrowers,
particularly companies, it could mean higher borrowing costs.
Last week, politicians in Brussels proposed huge extra investment in
infrastructure projects across the European Community as a way of reviving
the flagging economies of member states. They also tentatively suggested how
such a package could be financed: through the European Investment Bank, the
EC states' development bank, which is already the biggest borrower on the
international capital markets.
With considerable competition for funds expected in the international
markets next year - in part from the states which are the EIB's shareholders
 -any such programme would push up costs for all borrowers.
EC states seem unwilling to fund new projects directly. With growing budget
deficits to finance, and a widening gap between their current fiscal
positions and what they would have to achieve to meet the Maastricht
convergence criteria, the emphasis is on fiscal restraint. A desire to take
the pressure off domestic bond markets - and to rebuild depleted reserves -
has already driven a number of European sovereign borrowers into the
international bond markets, and more are expected.
That leaves the EIB holding centre-stage in any new growth programme,
although its chairman, Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, cautioned last week against
expecting too much, too soon. For a start, he said, the EIB is putting more
effort into its credit appraisal process: it no longer has the guarantees of
member states to back it, and so is more aware of the need to avoid losses
and build reserves.
Also, the EIB typically lends only around a quarter of the amount needed for
any project. It waits for projects to be brought to it, and expects them to
be largely financed commercially first. So any pick-up in lending depends
mainly on the promoters of particular projects.
There are other reasons why the EIB's presence in the markets may not pick
up dramatically. It is considering issuing guarantees to commercial banks to
encourage them to lend in some cases, rather than lending directly itself,
says Mr Broder. Bankers welcomed the idea last week: they currently have no
exposure to the EIB, and would be happy to take on such a credit risk.
Should the bank need to borrow more from the bond market, there is no
theoretical limit to the amount it could raise, says Mr Broder. Its capital
base was doubled in size at the beginning of last year, and most of this
capital remains unused. Also, the EIB's AAA-rating and sovereign
shareholders make it one of the top credits around.
The effects of any sharp upturn in EIB borrowing are not easy to predict,
either on the bank's own borrowing costs or those of other customers of the
Eurobond market. That is partly due to the bank's borrowing strategy in the
past. While other large borrowers have turned in recent years to ever-bigger
bond issues, the EIB has remained close to its Euromarket roots: issuing
smaller amounts in a range of currencies in deals often aimed at retail
investors.
Until two months ago, this was not surprising. The withholding tax privilege
accorded to supranational agencies like the EIB by Italy made it cheaper to
issue bonds to Italian investors. With the tax advantage now scrapped, that
has changed.
Two approaches are now possible. The EIB could continue with its
opportunistic strategy, trying to keep borrowing costs as low as possible in
the short term; or it could set out to establish bigger, benchmark issues in
an attempt to build a new following among a wider range of institutional
investors.
It seems initially to be following the first route, reaching into a wider
range of markets to find opportunities to borrow cheaply. The bank raised
Dollars 200m in the US earlier this month, its first drawing under a Dollars
750m medium-term note facility, an EIB official says - its first venture
into the domestic US market for some time. It is also looking at borrowing
in a wider range of European currencies: the Belgian franc, the Luxembourg
franc and the Dutch guilder are all under-used, the official says.
All of this is to make up in part for the disruption of the Ecu market,
which provided 18 per cent of the bank's new funds last year. However, the
EIB adds that the Ecu could still be one of its most important currencies:
'It could easily come back. We think we could do something in the near
future.'
This apparent determination to follow its familiar borrowing strategy
follows what the EIB says was something of a surprise this autumn: the loss
of the withholding tax privilege has had only a small effect on its
borrowing costs. A short-dated dollar issue launched last month cost only 'a
few basis points' more than a similar issue in March, even though yield
spreads in the market generally have widened.
Should the bank change its mind and move into the US market, it could find
itself paying much more. Its bonds would be priced against those of the
World Bank, says one US banker: 'They haven't had to do that for a long
time.'
But if the bank stays in the Euromarkets, any extra borrowing would make
life more difficult for other issuers. If a crunch develops, it will not be
the EIB that is crowded out of the market. As one London banker says: 'There
is going to be stiff competition for funds in 1993, there's no doubt about
it. But the ones who will be squeezed out will be the corporates.'

FT  30 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: Growing concern over the dangers of
counterparty credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE importance attached to counterparty credit risk has increased
substantially in recent years, due to declining confidence in the financial
strength of banks and securities houses and a surge in the number of
corporate defaults.
Nowhere has the impact been more keenly felt than in the over-the-counter
market in derivative instruments. In a securities trade, counterparty risk
ends when the transaction is settled; in the derivatives market, it
continues for the life of the agreement. In the burgeoning swaps market,
which now totals Dollars 4,000bn, agreements typically run for three to 10
years. The result: an explosion of counterparty risk.
Some regulators believe it is the greatest risk facing financial
institutions, in a market where other risks are already substantial. Part of
the problem is that counterparty risk in the derivatives market is difficult
to quantify, since exposure changes as market prices rise and fall.
Bankers have developed a number of techniques to reduce or limit
counterparty risk. Some now ask for margin payments, imitating futures
exchanges. In other cases, contracts require interim settlement, so that the
period of risk is more limited. Or they may allow for mutual termination of
agreements, if covenants are broken or credit ratings downgraded.
One important means of reducing counterparty risk is still the subject of
wrangling between bankers and regulators. Netting - which enables an
institution to offset the value of profitable (in-the-money) and loss-making
(out-of-the-money) transactions with a defaulting counterparty - remains
something of a grey area. Currently, Basle capital guidelines do not allow
netting for capital adequacy purposes. However, the Basle committee on
banking supervision is to meet shortly to discuss the response to its
consultative paper on netting issued in May.
One reason for the reluctance to allow netting is the doubt about its legal
enforceability in a number of jurisdictions. However, a report from the Bank
for International Settlements in 1990 concluded that netting was likely to
be enforceable in most major markets, and it has been implemented
successfully in the liquidations of Drexel Burnham Lambert and DFC, the
state-owned New Zealand development bank.
Meanwhile, some of the banks and securities houses which were leaders in the
derivatives markets have seen business fall away as their credit quality has
deteriorated. According to a recent report by the BIS: 'At the long end of
the market, counterparties pay more attention to credit standing than to the
prices offered. This has resulted in a large share of the longer-dated swaps
market being arranged by a relatively small number of highly rated
institutions.'
But weaker rated institutions have come up with an answer: a separately
capitalised derivatives unit, structured so that it qualifies for a double-A
or triple-A credit rating. Many are considering establishing credit-enhanced
units in the coming year, based loosely on the model of Merrill Lynch
Derivatives Products, established a year ago.
Salomon Brothers is expected to set up a credit-enhanced vehicle in the next
few months, while Continental, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Lehman Brothers,
and Kidder Peabody are also considering this route. (Goldman Sachs set up a
separately-capitalised derivatives unit earlier this year, but with somewhat
different objectives.)
According to Mr Christian Schade, vice-president in charge of European swaps
marketing at MLDP: '(Our derivatives business) has expanded across the
board, because of the vehicle. We can deal with counterparties who would not
normally consider us.'
But a number of market participants say that such a structure is costly,
using up excessive capital. By channelling resources into a relatively
capital-intensive area, other areas of business may be held back.
Nor are regulators convinced that 'ring-fencing' works. If rumours that a
financial institution was facing difficulties swept the market, a separately
capitalised unit would not necessarily be immune from a change in sentiment.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Israel aims to raise Dollars
350m from sell-off
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S government yesterday launched the country's biggest public
flotation of state-owned shares, placing its 42.5 per cent stake in IDB
Holding, a big industrial investment group, on the Tel Aviv stock exchange
(TASE) for an anticipated return of more than Dollars 350m.
Although no change of control in IDB was involved, as the balance of shares
is held by the Recanati family of Tel Aviv, the government pointed to the
issue as evidence of its commitment to privatisation.
TASE officials said the issue was 120 times oversubscribed and testified to
pent-up demand for privatisation issues, despite a bull run which has seen
the exchange's main index rise by more than 60 per cent this year. The
previous biggest sale of government-held shares was in February, when 25 per
cent of Israel Chemicals was sold for Shk600m.
The IDB sale was a spin-off from the government's programme to sell its
majority holdings in Israel's four main banks, acquired at a cost of Dollars
7bn after a share collapse in 1983. IDB Holding had been split from its
previous partner, Israel Discount Bank, and control sold back to the
Recanatis, two of whom are on trial on criminal charges arising from the
1983 share collapse.
However, the government has yet to finalise how it will dispose of Israel
Discount Bank, or Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, the country's three biggest
financial institutions. There has been criticism that it has not moved fast
enough to sell the banks, or the major candidates among government-owned
companies.
Yesterday's issue was split into tranches consisting of 26.6 per cent of IDB
in shares and the remainder in options exerciseable by next October. The
total raised will be Shk945m. At today's value of Dollars 357m, this
compares with the Dollars 314m the government paid to acquire the shares in
1983.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: BASF trims polystyrene capacity
as demand falls

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, is to slash polystyrene capacity at its
Ludwigshafen plant by 25 per cent.
The group, which 10 days ago announced a 45 per cent slump in pre-tax
profits for the first nine months of this year, blamed the need for cuts on
falling demand and the impact on prices of the recent appreciation of the
D-Mark. It is Europe's largest polystyrene manufacturer.
Prices would have to increase quickly by around 30 per cent before
polystyrene manufacture was economically viable, it said, but it saw no
possibility of improvements during 1993. A recent attempt by manufacturers
to increase prices failed.
BASF's move is only the latest of a series of attempts to rationalise the
industry which is suffering from overcapacity. Elf Atochem, the French
group, closed a 110,000 tonnes a year plant in Dieuze this summer.
Meanwhile, BP Chemicals and Enichem of Italy have tried to form an Dollars
800m joint-venture in polystyrene.
BASF, which is planning to reduce its workforce by more than 2,000 next
year, said people displaced by the closures would be offered work in other
parts of its giant Ludwigshafen works at the confluence of the Rhine and
Neckar rivers.

TORONTO-DOMINION Bank, Canada's fifth largest chartered bank, has reported a
7 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits and an 18 per cent drop for the
full year ended October 31.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 113m (USDollars 88.2m) or 35 cents a
share against CDollars 120m or 37 cents a year earlier. Return on equity was
9.2 per cent against 10.1 per cent and on assets 0.61 per cent against 0.70
per cent.
Full-year earnings were CDollars 408m or CDollars 1.25 a share against
CDollars 497m or CDollars 1.51 a year earlier. Total assets at October 31
were CDollars 74bn, up 7 per cent, fuelled by growth in securities holdings
and residential mortgages.
Loan losses increased 10 per cent to CDollars 543m, though the personal
lending sector stabilised. Net non-performing loans were CDollars 1.7bn, up
CDollars 228m and equal to 2.98 per cent of total loans against 2.6 per cent
a year earlier.
It was the bank's third successive year of falling profits. The bank does
not have any loans to Olympia and York, the troubled developer, but took an
undisclosed provision against its holdings of Edper group preferred shares.
Bank of Nova Scotia posted net profit of CDollars 676.2m or CDollars 2.94 a
share for the year ended October 31, up 7 per cent from CDollars 633m or
CDollars 2.81 a share in fiscal 1991. Fourth-quarter profits were up 1 per
cent to CDollars 163.3 m or 72 cents a share despite sharply higher loan and
loss provisions.

low asset growth
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Life Insurance, the largest of Japan's life companies, reported a
meagre 2.5 per cent increase in premium income for the first half, as the
Japanese industry recorded its lowest level of asset growth in the post-war
period.
The industry would have been further weakened but for a deferral of
appraisal losses on securities holdings, eroded by the collapse in Tokyo
stock prices, though companies will have to take the losses at the end of
the fiscal year in March.
Nippon Life's latent profits on stock holdings fell 22.7 per cent from March
to Y2,382bn (Dollars 19.2bn) at the end of September, while the latent
profits at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life were down 29 per cent to 1,054bn, and those
at Sumitomo Life plunged 65 per cent to a relatively thin Y195.8bn
The industry was under orders from the finance ministry not to offload
shares during the half, as there were fears that sales would put further
pressure on already weak stock prices. In return, the ministry allowed the
stock appraisal losses to be deferred.
The eight leading life companies reported a collective 4.8 per cent growth
to Y10,812bn in premiums for the first half, with Mitsui Mutual Life
Insurance reporting the smallest increase - 1.9 per cent - and Meiji Mutual
Life Insurance the largest, 10.1 per cent.
Income from asset investment fell 11.5 per cent, as interest rates and stock
prices both declined, but payouts were down 8.1 per cent. The industry has
received finance ministry approval to lift premiums, which should bolster
income during the second half.
But the industry will still be under pressure, as the latent profits on
stocks for the eight companies fell 28.4 per cent over the six months to
Y6,033bn, down from a peak of Y38,000bn at end March 1989.
Yasuda Mutual Life reported the strongest growth in total assets, up 10.5
per cent, followed by the 10.4 per cent at Meiji Mutual, while the 8.2 per
cent expansion at Nippon Life was the smallest among the leading companies.

billions go? / Over six years the Kuwait Investment Office invested up to
Dollars 4bn in building an industrial conglomerate in Spain. It says it has
seen no return on the money and large sums are missing. Peter Bruce
investigates an affair that has caused a storm over how Kuwait manages its
oil wealth
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), the external treasury of the Kuwaiti
government, has long had a reputation as one of the world's most powerful,
conservative and secretive investing institutions. But in recent months it
has found itself at the centre of a growing storm concerning the management
of its multi-billion-dollar investments in Spain.
The affair has brought the KIO's investment empire in Spain to the brink of
collapse. It has provoked a bitter row between the current KIO management
and some of Spain's leading banks and businessmen, and has stirred
unprecedented criticism of the office's activities in Kuwait itself. It may
be about to erupt in litigation, which threatens to throw an unwelcome
spotlight on the way Kuwait and its rulers manage their oil wealth and could
further damage the KIO's reputation in the financial world.
The KIO says that although it has invested up to Dollars 4bn in Spain since
1986, it has seen no return. It also says it now finds itself owing around
Dollars 3bn to creditors in Spain, and Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank, has told it that its Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, which last
year lost Dollars 440m, has a negative net worth of more than Dollars 500m.
Billions of dollars, the KIO claims, are missing. 'It is very clear that
there has been a major misappropriation of funds in Spain,' says Mr Mahmoud
al-Nouri, the new chief executive of Grupo Torras.
Much remains unclear, amid the welter of charge and counter-charge, about
exactly what has gone wrong for the KIO in Spain. Former KIO managers who
directed the investment drive into Spain and their Spanish business
partners, with whom the new KIO management is now at loggerheads, have a
simple explanation. They insist their initial investments were highly
profitable, and that the office's Spanish empire only fell into loss as a
result of the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the sharp slowdown of
Spain's economy.
By contrast, their successors who took over last spring, accuse them of
having violated the office's conservative investment guidelines by building
up a portfolio overloaded with industrial assets that required the KIO to
take an unfamiliar direct managerial role.
Certainly, the office's investment strategy in Spain differed dramatically
from the approach with which it has been traditionally associated - namely,
that of a discreet investor in blue-chip international companies such as
Daimler-Benz, Metallgesellschaft and Midland Bank.
According to the KIO and Grupo Torras records, the KIO spent Dollars 3.4bn
over the past six years to build up an industrial conglomerate, Grupo
Torras, according to KIO and Torras records. By the time the new KIO
management came in last May, Torras employed more than 30,000 people and
controlled Spain's largest chemical group, Ercros; its largest paper
producer, Torras-Papel; its biggest foods group, Ebro; and its third largest
property developer, Prima.
The KIO's Spanish adventure was run out of the office's London headquarters
by a small circle of senior KIO managers: Sheikh Fahad Mohammed al-Sabah,
chairman for more than 20 years and a cousin of the Emir of Kuwait; Fouad
Jaffar, general manager; and the KIO's two most senior British managers,
Trevor Ball and Bruce Dawson.
The story starts in the early 1980s, when the KIO - as investor of the oil
revenues accumulated in Kuwait's Reserve for Future Generations, a sort of
national pension fund - was trying to diversify from traditional northern
European and US markets.
In 1983, KIO staff suggested that the office look at Spain, which was set
for strong economic growth as European Community entry approached. A year
later Dawson was introduced to a small Catalan packaging producer, Inpacsa,
that was in need of fresh capital. Inpacsa's biggest creditor was Banco
Garriga Nogues, an affiliate of one of Spain's main commercial banks,
Banesto. Dawson met the head of Garriga Nogues, an ambitious Catalan named
Javier de la Rosa, and decided to spend Dollars 30m on buying control of the
packaging company, insisting that De la Rosa stay on the board.
That was in November 1984. Before doing the deal, the KIO had run a check on
the young banker. It found a sharp financial brain, a family scandal - his
father had fled the country after being accused of defrauding the Barcelona
authorities in a land development - and a looming disaster at Banco Garriga
Nogues.
During Spain's banking crisis in the early 1980s, Banesto had passed a
number of its riskier loans on to Garriga Nogues. In addition De La Rosa had
promoted a costly agricultural development that had turned sour. Garriga
Nogues collapsed in 1986 with bad debts of Dollars 800m.
'We knew De la Rosa was in trouble,' says a former KIO manager, 'and we
obviously had a maverick on our hands. He was always slightly paranoid, but
very likeable.'
By 1985 De la Rosa had left Garriga Nogues and begun a private investment
career in Barcelona with his own company, Quail Espana. While on holiday on
the Costa Brava he met Fahad al-Rashid, chief executive of the Kuwait
Investment Authority (KIA) - the body that in theory controls the KIO. The
two hit it off and De la Rosa began dealing shares in Spain for the KIA.
In 1985 De la Rosa also met Jorge Nunez, managing director of another
troubled Catalan paper company, Torras Hostench. Torras, a publicly quoted
company, had suspended payments to its creditors under Spanish insolvency
proceedings, but nevertheless had cash reserves of Dollars 204m. De la Rosa
persuaded Dawson to take a look at the company. With the approval of the
KIA, the KIO took control of a 40 per cent stake in Torras. With its cash
reserve, Torras then bought Inpacsa, generating a 100 per cent profit for
the KIO.
The Kuwaitis had 'arrived' in Spain. In March 1987 Sheikh Fahad became
chairman of Torras. Fouad Jaffar, Bruce Dawson and De la Rosa became deputy
chairmen, and Nunez remained chief executive.
The KIO's investments in Spain became a torrent. Within two years the office
had built up the biggest industrial group in the country not owned by the
government or by a bank. Just a year ago, Peat Marwick, the KIO's auditors,
valued these and other KIO-controlled assets at between Dollars 2.9bn and
Dollars 4.4bn.
This sort of aggressive investment spree was a new departure for the KIO,
and not everybody in the Kuwaiti government or in the office itself was
happy about it. Some criticism focused on the role of Kuwait's ebullient and
energetic oil minister, Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, a cousin of the Emir
and first cousin of the KIO chairman who exerted a strong influence over the
KIO.
The KIO bosses did not agree. Worries about the Spanish adventure, says one
former KIO manager were 'stupid'. 'We were a risk-taking organisation and we
were making hundreds of millions of dollars with De la Rosa.'
The question is: where did the profits go? Until now, that has been the
central mystery to all but those most closely involved in the affair. The
FT, however, has uncovered the answer: the government's Future Generation
account was only partially involved in the creation of the KIO's Spanish
industrial group. In other words, the small group running the operation from
London was investing from external accounts which the office managed on
behalf of Kuwaiti corporate and private clients.
In part the use of external accounts was a matter of convenience for the
KIO. Had it entered Spain declaring itself a sovereign investor on behalf of
the Future Generation Reserve, it might have been subject to close
supervision by the Spanish government.
But the external accounts also served as a vehicle by which the KIO's
clients could take profits they made on share dealing in Spain offshore and
avoid tax. This diversion was to become one source of the conflict between
the KIO's new and former managers.
The external accounts were run by Trevor Ball, who reported on them directly
to Sheikh Fahad. They invested through a number of specially established
offshore companies, mostly registered in Switzerland. Peat Marwick, the
KIO's auditors, identified some of these investment vehicles last year: GSM
Securities Management, Montrex and BPS. It appears that it was these
accounts, not the Future Generations account, that took the bulk of the
profits generated by the KIO in Spain.
An internal KIO memo, dated May 14 1990, shows how. It says the Future
Generations account had made, until then, just Dollars 24m on share dealing
in Spain while 'managed funds', the external accounts, had made Dollars
231m. That is probably an understatement, as the memo's author was a junior
and not privy to all the secrets of the external funds Trevor Ball was
managing.
On whose behalf were the external accounts being run? According to several
well-placed sources, some very important investors indeed. One of the
accounts, known inside the KIO headquarters as number 11-A, is said to have
contained the private investments of a senior Kuwaiti politician. It would
not be surprising. Ex-KIO employees are convinced the office would routinely
invest on behalf of ministers or of the ruling family.
'There was always al-Sabah money when there were good investments on the
go,' says one.
The new KIO management does not deny it was running external accounts in
addition to the Future Generation account; it says simply that the office's
constitution allows it to invest any funds the government tells it to.
The external accounts played a crucial role in the construction of Grupo
Torras. They were used to build big stakes in target companies whose stock
(like most of the Spanish market) was thought to be ripe for big gains. In
all this the key player was De la Rosa, who was given a highly lucrative
contract that put him in management control of Torras.
At the time, only a few people understood exactly what was going on. They
may not even have included Grupo Torras itself, which last year asked
auditors Peat Marwick to map out how the KIO had operated. It reported in
October 1991, as follows: The office would follow advice from De la Rosa and
buy into a stock in the name of the external accounts. Then, as the share
price rose on rumours of the KIO's purchase, it would sell the stock on to
Torras at a profit. Torras, which had in July 1987 launched a Dollars 550m
rights issue, would pay for it with this money or bank loans, thus leaving
debt onshore while profits were taken by the external accounts in tax
havens.
In one example, Peat Marwick found that in the second quarter of 1987 GSM
Securities Management bought 119,498 shares of the sugar refiner, Ebro, on
the markets for Dollars 9.8m and a few weeks later sold them to Torras for
Dollars 19m. By one informed reckoning, the KIO's various accounts took
Dollars 1.5bn of profits out of Spain.
The benefits to the holders of the external accounts were obvious; the
advantages to Torras, which was in effect being force-fed shares, less so -
at least with hindsight. The hope all along was that Torras would grow into
a thriving industrial empire on the back of Spain's economic boom, and be
able to repay its borrowings later by selling off assets to hungry local and
foreign investors. Sadly, this was not how events were to turn out.
By the end of 1989 the office began to show signs of fatigue. It was also
coming under great pressure from Kuwait to improve its reporting to the KIO
executive committee, presided over by the KIA, which had become nervous
about the publicity the Spanish investments were attracting.
Investors were also becoming disenchanted with Torras. It had become an
almost impossibly unwieldy conglomerate, with an insatiable appetite for
rights issues. Its stock price languished accordingly.
All this spelt problems for the Kuwaitis, who had become anxious to speed up
the sale of some Torras assets in order to repay group borrowings. The KIO's
solution, decided on by its executive committee in December 1989, was to
take Torras private. 'This should be considered as a first step,' the
minutes of the meeting say, 'towards reducing our investments in Spain
through the sale of some of Torras's assets with a guaranteed profit.'
The delisting took place at the end of that month, but it did not go
smoothly. Torras offered its shareholders a mixture of cash and shares in
its Prima property group. Unfortunately, these shares - like many in the
group - were seriously overvalued. Beta Capital, the KIO's brokers, had
earlier warned that the price of the Prima shares would somehow have to be
'guaranteed' if the operation was to work.
Thus, a massive price support operation was set in motion to absorb Prima
shares after Torras had been taken private. Soon after the Torras
'privatisation', about 40 per cent of Prima suddenly appeared in the hands
of companies controlled by people and institutions close to the KIO - Fouad
Jaffar and Gerald Hines, a US property developer who did a lot of business
with the Office, took about 14 per cent between them. The KIO's advice was
that this share support operation was perfectly legal under Spanish law.
It was not the only such operation. In 1989 De la Rosa had registered a
stake of about 18 per cent in Torras, and, later, one of about the same
amount in Ercros, under his own name. The support operations were vital to
Torras because its stock and that of its affiliates was being used as
collateral to attract bank loans.
But if the delisting of Torras was supposed to be the start of a slow
withdrawal from Spain - paying off accumulated bank debt with profits from
disposals - the strategy went badly wrong. First, criticism of the KIO's
activities back home in Kuwait had reached such a pitch that Fouad Jaffar
was forced - in March 1990 - to resign as general manager, leaving Sheikh
Fahad in day-to-day control.
Then came Iraq. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 was a
catastrophe for the KIO as well as for the emirate itself. Suddenly, the
Kuwaitis needed cash, and this would have to be generated through the sale
of many of the KIO's bluest-chip assets.
More specifically, the Iraqi annexation was also a serious blow to the KIO
in Spain. It stopped the Torras disposal strategy and diverted the office's
attention from Spain.
Torras began to disintegrate. Following the invasion no investor would touch
a KIO company. With the value of their collateral thus threatened, the
Torras group's creditor banks began to call in their loans. For the first
time, Torras was forced to ask for a direct cash injection from the KIO - of
Dollars 400m. A few months later it was to ask for a further Dollars 1.3bn.
'Had it not,' says a Torras memo at the time, 'Torras would obviously have
had to declare bankruptcy.'
To make matters worse, the KIO is alleged to have sought to use Torras - one
of the few substantial companies in the world in which it exercised complete
management control - as a source of funds for the emirate's war effort.
Former KIO managers claim that up to Dollars 500m was channelled from Torras
to the exiled Kuwaiti government - although the new KIO management says this
money has not been accounted for and that it regards it as missing.
'Torras was the only way the Kuwaitis could get at their money early in the
crisis,' says a former KIO manager. 'It's incredible that the new management
should expose one of the best covert operations of the war.'
The KIO had become the government-in-exile's only source of funds and it was
being run, effectively, by Sheikh Ali Khalifa, by then finance minister, and
Sheikh Fahad. Together with Trevor Ball and Bruce Dawson, these two men
directed the financing of the war, discreetly selling stock around the world
to pay huge amounts being demanded by the US and its allies.
The liberation of Kuwait brought great changes to the emirate, mostly
centred on diminishing the power of the Emir. One of those changes was a new
cabinet and one of the biggest heads to roll was that of Ali Khalifa. His
replacement as finance minister, Nasser Abdullah al-Rowdan, quickly set
about counting what Kuwait had left. The Reserve for Future Generations,
worth Dollars 75bn before the war, had been cut in half.
The most obvious haemorrhage was in Spain, and the new finance minister
began to lobby for Sheikh Fahad's removal as chairman of the KIO. That was
achieved last February, when he was replaced by Ali-Rashid al-Bader,
chairman of the troubled Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East. The KIO had
changed too. Trevor Ball died in 1991. Fahad al-Sabah is pensioned off and
lives in London, as does Fouad Jaffar. Bruce Dawson has retired.
In May, al-Bader appointed a close friend, Mahmoud al-Nouri, to run Torras
and De la Rosa resigned. From that moment on, al-Bader and al-Nouri have
turned the heat up on the old team at the KIO and Torras. They ordered
Torras's auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to rework the Torras 1991 accounts,
valuing assets at market value and not at cost, which turned a tiny profit
last year into a Dollars 440m loss.
Both men are clearly convinced that money was misappropriated in Spain,
though they say they do not yet fully understand how. The KIO's lawyers,
Stephenson Harwood, and Peat Marwick have just completed a long
investigation into the Spanish investments and the Kuwaiti government is
considering whether to bring legal action against De la Rosa, Jaffar and
Sheikh Fahad. 'Our findings point to what appear to be significant
irregularities,' says Kenneth Bonavia, Stephenson Harwood's partner in
Spain.
The current KIO management's complaints of irregularities in its Spanish
investments are twofold: first, that the office has never seen profits from
Spain; and second, that the large direct transfers from the KIO to Spain
after the Iraqi invasion of August 1990 have disappeared.
From the FT's inquiries it seems that the first complaint is at best
disingenuous: the KIO's own documents show that it recorded profits from
Spain being transferred to external accounts offshore, and this was later
confirmed in Peat Marwick's report.
The second charge is more contentious. Former KIO managers, defending
themselves against accusations of impropriety, say monies transferred from
the KIO to Torras were swallowed up by the group's losses, resulting from
its debt burden, from increasingly difficult trading conditions in Spain,
from the problems created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and from the
operation to support Torras shares. The current KIO management is contesting
the legality of some of the share support operations, although it has repaid
a portion of the bank loans which financed them.
Any legal action could embarrass powerful figures in Kuwait and expose the
fact that the office was investing in Spain on behalf of Kuwaiti third
parties. Indeed, as allegations have rained on De la Rosa, he has begun to
threaten retaliation. In a statement last week his spokesman said that he
had remained silent so as not to 'damage the KIO by obliging it to open its
books' in court.
If the new KIO bosses have found a mess in Spain, an increasing number of
bankers and analysts in Madrid feel their hunt for someone to blame has
compounded the problem. Ercros, the chemical company, has collapsed and is
in receivership after the new KIO management refused to support it. The
Prima property group seems likely to go the same way unless a buyer can be
found. Creditors have been told they will not get their money. Last Tuesday,
Grupo Torras defaulted on international bank loans of Dollars 400m; they
have to be repaid by the KIO, which guaranteed them.
Since June, when al-Nouri took control of Torras and began, through public
relations advisers, denouncing his predecessors, the value of its portfolio
has plummeted. Stock in Ebro, the food group, for example, worth more than
Pta2,000 in mid-May, is now worth just Pta965. It becomes a vicious circle.
The more the new KIO managers complain there is money missing, the more that
the value of their assets falls.
'The KIO is using its Spanish investments to resolve its internal problems,'
said Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman of Saffa, the Italian industrial group which
owns 6 per cent of Prima. 'It is completely irresponsible. The new managers
are at war with the old managers while the (Spanish) companies are being
ruined.'
Al-Bader, now the KIO president, is anxious to return the office to its old
role as a discreet, low-risk trader. But in his rush to extricate his
organisation from Spain, he may be further harming Kuwait's reputation with
the international financial community. Last week's defaults, for example,
were a direct result of the new KIO management's reluctance to restore its
Spanish companies to health. Since the Gulf war, Kuwait has become a big
borrower, and bankers will be sensitive to the way the KIO treats Torras's
remaining Spanish debt.
The KIO is in a bind. If it is to recover any of the money it has pumped
into Spain, it will have to produce a recovery in the fortunes of Grupo
Torras, and that - given the hostility of Spanish banks - will inevitably
mean providing it with yet more funds in the short term. If it concentrates
exclusively on its quest for retribution against those it believes have
betrayed it, it risks losing everything.

BROWN &amp; Jackson, operator of the Poundstretcher chain of discount stores,
has disposed of its remaining 25 per cent stake in Advanced Technology
Industries for Pounds 550,000.
This ends a particularly painful episode for Brown &amp; Jackson and confirms
the new management's policy of concentrating on core retail discount
activities.
The majority share in Advanced Technology, a security alarm manufacturer,
was acquired in 1988. It was transferred back to its original owner,
Limelight Group, earlier this year on agreement to drop claims to nearly
Pounds 11m of the original purchase price.
A review by brokers Henry Ansbacher found that up to 40 per cent of ATI
profits between 1988 and 1990 may have been questionable. Renumeration to
former owners was based on profits earned in that period.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: UK insurers may get tax benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is reconsidering the tax treatment of insurance companies
after complaints from British insurers that they are penalised more heavily
than European counterparts, it was disclosed yesterday.
The Inland Revenue said it was considering whether the competitive position
of British insurers was being penalised by the fact that they are not
allowed to deduct tax on equalisation reserves made against future claims.
The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce said
it had received a letter from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, saying that the government was re-examining the tax position.
Mr Dorrell's letter said the Inland Revenue was looking at the treatment of
equalisation reserves. 'If some change is called for, we will consider
whether this can be achieved without causing unacceptable distortions,' he
said.
Mr Roger Miller, executive director of Airmic, said the association ovhad
put forward a number of arguments for changes
Airmic believes the government should make equalisation reserves tax
deductible. This would allow insurance companies to reduce taxable profits
by setting aside sums to pay for future catastrophic claims
It wants to prevent discounting for tax purposes on long-term insurance
provisions. This would stop taxation of investment sums set aside to pay for
specific future claims.
Mr Miller said in a letter to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the
British insurance industry was being penalised because European companies
were allowed more favourable tax treatment
He said Airmic regarded 'the stability, competitiveness and solvency of the
British insurance industry as vital to the interests of the whole of British
industry. Export earnings would rise if there was a 'level playing field' in
taxation.
Mr Dorrell said in his reply that differences in accounting methods in other
EC countries meant there were good reasons why discounting did not arise as
a tax issue elsewhere in the way in which it did in Britain.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Granada aims to sustain computer
recovery - Alan Cane on its battle with manufacturers for maintenance work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING after other people's computers seemed a promising diversification
for Granada in the mid-1980s when the television and leisure services group
was 'dashing for growth'.
Europe's computer users were then spending about Dollars 10bn a year on
maintenance. Computer manufacturers, then as now, took the lion's share, but
there was just under Dollars 1bn for independent, or third party,
maintenance organisations to compete for. The sector was growing at about 15
per cent per annum, well ahead of most other services businesses.
A string of acquisitions costing some Pounds 200m gave Granada instant
market leadership in Europe, but the prospective gold mine quickly became a
disaster. It failed properly to integrate the new division and in 1991
losses were Pounds 7.7m on revenues of Pounds 200m. Cash was bleeding out of
the division at an appreciably faster rate.
The computer services division's problems were compounded by the recession
and difficulties in other parts of the group, including a heavy debt burden
leading to sharp falls in both revenues and profits for the whole
organisation. Mr Derek Lewis, the former Granada chief executive who was
closely associated with the move into computing services, lost his job, the
most public victim of the debacle. Now, under a new chairman, Mr John
Curran, and after extensive surgery to bring overheads in line with sales
expectations, Granada Computer Services seems back on track.
It turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.3m on revenues of Pounds 77.2m at
the half-way stage, compared with a Pounds 3.6m loss last year. The group is
due to report full-year results on Wednesday. Earlier this year the division
secured a key contract with British Aerospace worth Pounds 12m over three
years. As Mr Curran notes, it was not the value of the contract but the
boost to the morale of the organisation that was important.
Mr Curran is a 46 year old US-born computer industry veteran, in a business
where experience, track record and connections are vital. Formerly with
Mobil Oil, National Advanced Systems and Control Data, his later career has
included a spell as consultant specialising in turning around ailing
companies.
Granada Computer Services was certainly ailing. It was formed between 1986
and 1988 by the acquisition of Computer Field Maintenance, SMS, Mainstay,
DPCE and Wigo, all well respected companies. But Mr Curran arrived to find
an uncordinated group of separate organisations, wracked by internal strife
with multiple management systems, heavy overheads and no economies of scale.
Support operations were replicated; each group had its own training centres.
The individual companies were first class; DPCE and Computer Field had been
pioneers in breaking the stranglehold the manufacturers had over computer
maintenance. Granada's newly imposed management layer, however, lacked
knowledge or experience of the maintenance side.
Mr Curran moved swiftly once he believed the division could be salvaged. He
brought in trusted senior managers from his previous existence and sacked 20
per cent of the 3,000 workforce in one week. It cost a one-off Pounds 15m
but prepared the ground for this year's return to profitability.
But can it be sustained? The maintenance battleground has changed
significantly over the past four years. Attempts to build thriving
businesses on the back of computer maintenance - notably Ferrari Computer
Services - have failed.
The European market for computer maintenance is still about Dollars 10bn -
prices have fallen sharply - but growing at only about five per cent per
year. There is renewed competition from the big hardware manufacturers,
International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and now, the Japanese.
Olivetti of Italy is also a leading player in maintenance but chiefly in the
mid-range system area, while Granada is focused on mainframes and personal
computers.
The manufacturers are powerful - IBM's maintenance revenues alone top more
than Dollars 4bn annually - and are well placed to use price as a
competitive weapon. They are aggressively seeking to replace falling
hardware sales with services revenues. Granada remains the independent
European market leader with sales of about Dollars 300m, substantially
bigger than the next largest independents Thomainfor (a subsidiary of
Thompson CSF), Sorbus (owned joinly by ICL and Bell Atlantic) and Getronics
of the Netherlands.
Mr Curran's strategy for the future is based on two concepts: multi-vendor
support and partnerships.
The big manufacturers, he reasons, are hard to beat on their own ground  -
servicing machines of their own manufacture where they have a natural
advantage. But today many large customers buy their equipment from a
diversity of manufacturers and are building multi-vendor networks of
workstations and departmental computers to distribute computer power through
their organisations.
They are seeking a single partner who will take responsibility for ensuring
that everything works efficiently together. But manufacturers' expertise
tends to be limited to their own equipment. That, Mr Curran says, is where
Granada's broad skills count: 'What we are good at is complexity
management'. It will, however, need to beef up software skills to be
completely convincing.
The company believes that partnerships and alliances are the way ahead,
especially with the growth of 'outsourcing', where a company passes over its
data processing operations to a third party against an agreed level of
service.
The leaders in outsourcing in Europe include EDS-Scicon, Cap Gemini Sogeti
and Sema Group. Granada is keen to form partnerships with companies like
these with a view to offering a complete computing service - facilities
management plus maintenance in one package.
Granada Computer Services will have to develop its US business to become the
global player that Mr Curran envisages, but all the parts of the operation
seem at last to be pulling in the same direction. Last year it was at the
centre of Granada's financial woes; this year it should prove a foundation
for its profitability.

write-downs

<TEXT>
ALEXANDERS Holdings, the car sales and leasing group, has revealed
accountancy discrepancies which have led it to make write-downs of over
Pounds 1m.
Alexanders announced on Friday that Sharles, the group's auditors, had
resigned two weeks ago and that Clark Whitehill has been appointed to the
position. It is believed that an independent report by Clark Whitehill
brought the discrepancies to light.
These included premises which the Alexanders board said should have been
valued at Pounds 370,000, which instead had a book value of Pounds 788,000.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 418,000 is to be made in the restated
accounts for the year ended September 30 1991.
A provision of Pounds 700,000 is also being made against its contract rental
business, most of which relates to the period ended September 30 1990.
Alexanders' shares, plunged 5p to 12p on Friday. The group, which is the
main Ford dealer in Scotland, is controlled by the Clayton family which has
over 50 per cent of the shares.

FT  30 NOV 92 / BCT to shut down Tessa scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM Capital Trust, a small banking institution licensed by the Bank
of England, is shutting down a Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (Tessa)
scheme after suffering a 'major erosion' of its capital base, and continuing
losses.
Depositors in the Tessa scheme, which offered a fixed interest rate of 12
per cent over five years, have been advised to transfer their balances -
with the interest they have earned to date - to another bank or building
society.
BCT told depositors in a letter dated Friday that 'after much thought and
formal discussions with the Bank of England' it had decided to close down
the Tessa scheme. It said losses had made it prudent to examine the Tessa's
viability.
The letter said BCT made losses in 1990 and 1991 'due to the prevailing
economic climate . . . This resulted in a major erosion of the capital base
of the company. Despite the fresh injection of capital, further losses are
continuing to occur'.
The Financial Times was unable to contact directors of the company for
comment yesterday. The Bank of England said it could make no comment about
any action it had taken over BCT, a licensed institution under the 1987
Banking Act.
BCT has recommended depositors in the Tessa scheme - which was initially
offered in January last year but was later reported to have been withdrawn -
to transfer funds to a Tessa variable interest account at the Dudley
Building Society.
BCT's letter said it had made special arrangements with the Dudley Building
Society, which has assets of about Pounds 65m, to transfer accounts to its
variable interest Tessa. This is currently paying an interest rate of 10 per
cent.
The Tessa offered by BCT was among the most attractive fixed interest Tessa
schemes for depositors when such schemes were first offered in January last
year. However, it was reported to have been withdrawn shortly afterwards.
Deacon Hoare, a small licensed banking institution in Bristol, went into
liquidation this June after suffering losses on high interest saver
accounts. It had offered among the highest variable interest rates on a
Tessa scheme.

FT  30 NOV 92 / French group for sell-off offers bleak prospectus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the state-owned chemical group that the French government is
trying to privatise partially, has painted a bleak picture of its prospects
in the US prospectus for the sell-off.
It says that conditions, already poor last year, deteriorated sharply during
the third quarter of the current 12 months.
A number of divisions have been particularly hit by the slowdown. Sales of
chemical intermediates such as soda ash and chlorine have been knocked by
slowing demand and falling prices in European markets. Management does not
expect any significant improvement for this division before 1994.
No improvement is expected at the fibres and polymers division, hit by price
falls of 6 per cent during the first nine months. Management does not expect
an amelioration in the division's operating profits before 1994.
The company's sales were also affected in the first nine months by the
depreciation of the US dollar. This influenced prices of products
manufactured in Europe competing against products exported from the dollar
zone. Translation of US earnings into francs reduced Rhone-Poulenc's
operating profits by about FFr250m (Pounds 30.5m).
Agrochemicals sales will continue to be hit in 1993 by the EC's new common
agricultural policy.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Russia changes direction of its radical
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Russia is changing its economic course. It has proposed a
fundamental change in direction, in which the emphasis on fiscal and
monetary measures, given pride of place earlier this year, yields precedence
to an underscoring of its effort to support industry, to stop the fall in
living standards and to construct a 'social' market economy.
This is an important shift. Whether or not it will be given a chance to work
is a matter of politics, and the politics will be played out in public from
tomorrow in the febrile forum of the Congress of Peoples Deputies - at the
centre of whose deliberations will be the government and its performance.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, has striven to make clear in the
past week that there is no desertion of radical reform. The direction is the
market, an open economy and a stable currency - all conceived of as the
indispensable economic infrastructure for a civil and democratic society.
Yet while this new course is not a turning back, it is more than just a
'correction'.
The key text for the shift is a document of some thirty pages, called 'A
programme of urgent measures to lead the Russian economy out of crisis'. It
was completed eight days ago, and was drawn up by a commission of experts,
one side of which was drawn from the government and headed by Mr Sergei
Vassiliev, director of the Centre for Economic Reform; the other side of
which was drawn from the Civic Union and the Russian Union of Industrialists
and Entrepreneurs, headed by Mr Yevgeny Yasin, director of the latter
organisation's expert institute. This is the written basis of the agreement
between the government and the Civic Union - though it is clear that no
broader political agreement is yet firm.
The document makes a spirited and too-rare claim for some success, pointing
out that the conditions for market relations have at least been laid, that
the queues have largely disappeared and that the trust of foreign countries
has been retained. But it does not minimise the failures. Inflation is up to
around 25 per cent a month. The rise in prices continues. The production
fall shows signs of evening out, but has gone on longer and to lower levels
than forecast. Many enterprises are on the verge of bankruptcy:the rouble
has fallen to close to 500 to the dollar; foreign trade regulations change
constantly.
In the long list of mistakes with which the programme begins, one theme is
dominant: that is, that the government is not able to execute its will and
has been absent from too many processes in which it should have been a main
actor. It has not secured laws on bankruptcy and private ownership of land;
it has not been able to stop illegal exports, and the illegal transferring
abroad of vast amounts of hard currency. It has been helpless before a surge
in crime and in the continued inertia and interference of the bureaucracy.
It is now deemed a mistake to have avoided what is now seen as a
responsibility: that is, to support Russian industry; to give clear
guidelines to the state companies; to take an active hand in the
reconstruction of those which have good prospects; to subsidise and promote
exports, and to define and support enterprises which could substitute for
imports.
This theme is writ large in the main body of the programme. Central to it is
this observation: 'An objective account of our realities and analysis of the
vast experience, both positive and negative, which we have acquired in the
past year shows that in our real conditions we cannot just have a transition
to a regulated market so much as a regulated transition to the market.'
In short, the government no longer expects individuals, enterprises and
institutions to make their way to capitalism by unsupervised actions within
a legal, monetary and fiscal framework. The Russian - or rather, post-Soviet
 -realities have been shown not to permit it. A market needs to be created:
the creator can only be the state. To quote the programme again: 'this means
a strengthening of state power, and the raising of its efficiency'.
This is a great deal to ask of a state as fractured and demoralised as the
Russian one now is: furthermore, of one which has lost so much of its once
grossly overcentralised power to other levels of regional and local
bureaucracy, and to the enterprises. As the programme bitterly notes at one
point, the enterprises usually keep the profits, passing on their debts to
the state.
It is important to note that the programme does not abandon fiscal and
monetary rectitude: on the contrary, it devotes several pages to a
description of how it will be achieved. But it also says this: 'to restore
production and the living standards of the population, it is not possible to
stop inflation quickly.' (It later says that the aim is now to get inflation
down to between 8 per cent and 10 per cent a month within six months.)
Further, it promises a lot of support - to the population's living
standards, of course; to various sectors; to scientific institutions; to
exporters. Only in one sentence does it promise the 'regulated reduction of
enterprises and branches which have no future'. Clearly, to do all this and
fight inflation is almost certainly too tall an order.
It is, in the end, only a programme. The interest is not in the detail but
in the direction: the government is now prepared, in order to gain the
support of the centrist block represented by Civic Union, to try its hand at
constructing a viable corporatism, on the grounds that only through that
will it be able to establish reform on a broad enough social base to make at
least some of its objectives attainable.
It is not at all clear if this will go far enough. Like most such
programmes, there is something in it for everyone: and without trust between
the contracting parties, the fears of the Civic Union that the current
government would be much keener on the monetary and fiscal instruments than
on the apparatus of industrial planning could be well grounded.
The next days and weeks will see how far this new course is a political
tactic, or a real economic strategy.

FT  30 NOV 92 / The lingering death of a whizzkid's haven: The Stock
Exchange seems set to recommend closing the USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Unlisted Securities Market has been suffering a slow, lingering death.
Although it survived the crash of 1987, the recession of early 1990s has
gradually drained liquidity and confidence from the market.
The Stock Exchange seems set to recommend the abolition of the market, with
as many companies as possible transferring to the upper tier.
For a brief period in the mid-1980s, the market seemed to have become what
it was designed to be; a thriving haven for budding British entrepreneurs.
The USM was founded in response to an age-old fear that the stock market was
too inflexible to cater for the young, vigorous companies which could be the
driving force of Britain's economic growth. The Wilson committee reported in
1979 that there was a 'capital gap' facing companies which were too small
for a listing and which did not want to rely on banking facilities.
The Stock Exchange was also concerned about the development of
'over-the-counter market' trading in unlisted companies, and wanted to bring
this area under its control.
There was something rather exciting about the establishment of this market;
one of the first companies to join was Lord Hesketh's ambitious venture for
building a British superbike.
The Hesketh business failed, but as the UK economy emerged from the early
1980s recession, the USM built momentum. From 23 companies at the end of
1980, the market grew to 268 by the end of 1984.
In the early years, the market's performance was dogged by a heavy
concentration in oil and electronics companies. But as the bull market
gathered pace, the speculative attractions of the market increased - the USM
Index doubled between January 1 and October 16 of 1987.
The crash appeared to deal a grievous blow to the market. Overnight,
liquidity in many of the shares disappeared; investors found they were
simply unable to offload the stakes they bought when the market was rising.
However, there was some recovery in 1988 and 1989. UK corporate profits were
still rising, and companies were able to float on the back of strong growth
records. Analysts pointed to the 'small company effect', whereby shares in
such companies outperformed their larger brethren over long periods, and
this encouraged investors to back flotations.
But the early 1990s recession was a body blow. Smaller companies tend to
have a greater concentration of their business in the UK and thus were
doubly hit by the fall in demand and the effect of high interest rates.
Small company shares have underperformed those of larger companies in each
of the calendar years from 1989-1992.
The USM's smaller sibling, the Third Market, which was founded in 1987, was
quick to bite the dust. The market, which was designed to cater for even
smaller and younger companies, never really captured investors' imagination
and was closed at the end of 1990.
What may have sealed the fate of the USM, however, was a change in the
rulebook. When the USM was established, a five-year record was required
before companies could join the main market, whereas USM companies had just
a three-year minimum. In 1991, these requirements were reduced to three and
two years respectively. Many companies seem to have decided that they might
as well wait an extra 12 months and join the more prestigious senior tier.
Other small companies have chosen to be acquired by larger groups in a trade
sale, rather than face the risks and expense of the flotation process. And
many successful USM companies have been promoted to the main market, with
weaker groups left behind on the junior tier.
The number of new issues has gradually dwindled. In the peak year, 1988, 103
companies joined the market. By 1991, there were just 15, and in this year's
first half, only four.
The lifeblood of the USM has ebbed away. At the end of June, there were 326
companies on the market, with a total capitalisation of Pounds 5.08bn. That
compares with 443 companies and a market value of almost Pounds 10bn at the
end of September 1989.
And the USM has long since ceased to be an important means of capital
financing for small companies. In 1988, companies on the market raised
Pounds 308m from investors; that figure rapidly dropped to Pounds 45m in
1990, Pounds 11.6m in 1991 and Pounds 14.6m in the first half of 1992.
The value of customer business on the market has also fallen sharply - from
Pounds 6.08bn worth of shares traded in 1987 to Pounds 1.43bn in 1991. As a
consequence, several market-makers have decided to pull out of trading the
shares of many smaller companies, as it was proving impossible to earn
profits in the sector.
The Stock Exchange recently established a new system for trading illiquid
shares, SEATS, but for many investors, the damage may already have been
done. It will take a while before they will be prepared to take the risks of
investing in small company shares again, even if USM stocks transfer to the
main market.
Speculation about the USM's extinction has been commonplace in 1992. If most
participants are able to transfer to the main market, few will shed any
tears.
But perhaps if the USM dies, a small part of the once popular vision of an
'entrepreneurial Britain' could die with it.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Isosceles may face third refinancing plan: Investment
vehicle considers debt for equity rescue as trading slows at its food stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted management buy-out vehicle for the Gateway
food stores, is considering its third restructuring plan, only a month after
its second was approved by shareholders.
According to one of its financial advisers, the group is 'actively
considering a debt into equity rescue plan' because of its inability to make
significant inroads into debts of more than Pounds 1.2bn.
Trading has deteriorated at Gateway, which has more than 600 outlets.
Isosceles is expected to announce in January that Gateway's operating
profits for the half-year to November 9 have fallen to between Pounds 60m
and Pounds 65m, against Pounds 93m in the comparative period.
The trading performance of Gateway's mainstream stores continues to be well
below budget.
Any new refinancing would have to be agreed by Wasserstein Perella, which
has an inbuilt majority of A shares giving it a veto over any new proposals.
One of the group's financial advisers said: 'We would obviously hope to
avoid a new refinancing package.
'Not only would it be very expensive but Wasserstein Perella's support is by
no means guaranteed. But since the debt is still so high it has to be
actively considered,' he added.
The group's immediate problems stem from its inability to make asset sales
to reduce borrowings.
Following last month's sale of its Wellworth subsidiary, the Northern Irish
supermarket chain, Isosceles' net debt has fallen below Pounds 1.3bn.
Wellworth was sold for Pounds 122m, a price below earlier hopes.
But further delays in selling Herman's Sporting Goods, its US subsidiary, is
likely to require agreement from the banks to defer principal debt
repayments.
In the year to April, Isosceles wrote off Pounds 145m from the value of
Herman's leaving its net assets at about Pounds 50m.
Only last month a buyer, believed to have been Odyssey, a New York based
buy-out capital group, pulled out after being at an advanced stage of
negotiations.
The group is still looking for buyers for Herman's, but is understood to be
no nearer to pulling off a deal.
If Gateway's trading continues to deteriorate the group's banks may also be
asked to waive covenants.
While Isosceles is not in breach of its covenants at the moment its
financial advisers fear a breach could occur next January if the results are
as bad as expected.
However, Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, who recently took over Mr Bob Willett's
role as chief executive of Gateway, is understood to believe that
Wasserstein Perella may have to be persuaded to agree to a third refinancing
agreement.
Mr Mitchell-Innes, who is also chief executive of Isosceles and chairman of
Gateway, hopes that Wasserstein Perella will recognise the depth of the
problems and not block a debt to equity conversion if a third refinancing is
needed.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Stock Exchange may close USM: Recommendation follows a
decline in interest of investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK EXCHANGE is set to recommend the closure of the Unlisted
Securities Market, the UK's junior market, in a consultative document to be
issued in the next few weeks.
The action follows regulatory changes and declining interest by investors
and companies in the USM, founded 12 years ago to help entrepreneurs gain
access to the UK equity markets.
Final approval for the recommendation must still be made by the stock
exchange quotations committee and the board, chaired by Sir Andrew Hugh
Smith, before a document is issued for public consultation.
Unless there are strong objections, that could lead to closure of the market
to new issues by mid-1993, with a transition period of at least another year
before all companies are moved to the main market or delisted.
The stock exchange launched a review of the USM early this year, writing to
canvass views from all of the roughly 330 remaining companies on the market
and many other practitioners.
The result is believed to have shown a clear consensus that many companies
on the USM wanted to move off it, while others had little interest in
joining, leaving questions about the quality of those that remained.
It highlighted the fact that the remaining regulatory distinctions between
the main market and the USM have eroded and the difficulties in transferring
from one to the other have reduced substantially. Many brokers are already
advising USM applicants to comply with the exchange's full listing
requirements.
The exchange refused to confirm the contents of the document yesterday but
said: 'We have undertaken an enormous amount of research on the USM. There
have been many changes since it was introduced. We have to see whether there
is still the need for a distinct regulatory regime.'
The future of the USM has been in doubt since the late 1980s with the end of
the stock market boom. In the past three years, the number of companies
quoted has fallen by a third and the value of the market has halved. Only
four companies joined in the first two quarters this year.
The Third Market, which was created in 1987 to provide equity for start-up
businesses, never managed to take off and was closed at the end of 1990.
The document is expected to raise hopes that many companies could transfer
to a full stock exchange listing. That will become easier after this
autumn's new regulations.
There are still some concerns about the tax implications of transferring,
but they are not considered a significant hindrance by the exchange.

FT  30 NOV 92 / ICI may pull out of chlorine production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indust-ries, the British chemicals group, is to decide in
three months' time whether to pull out of chlorine production and associated
businesses in the UK because of high electricity prices and tightening
environmental controls.
To meet stiffer emission controls that will come into force in the next few
years, ICI estimates it will have to invest about Pounds 50m by about 1996,
with Pounds 30m of this committed by next year. However, managers fear they
may not be able to justify such investments at current levels of
profitability, which have been hit by rising power costs since privatisation
of the electricity industry.
Closure of ICI's three British sites - at Runcorn and Northwich in Cheshire
and on Teesside - would cost about 7,000 jobs and worsen the UK's visible
trade balance by about Pounds 1.5bn a year.
The company closed two chlorine plants near Fleetwood, Lancashire, earlier
this month, with the loss of 100 jobs.
Mr Bob Hunt, managing director of ICI Chlor-Chemicals, said yesterday that
it would be impossible to justify Pounds 30m of capital spending on present
financial performance. ICI has already said that no plant will operate if it
cannot meet new, tougher standards for emission control.
'At today's levels of profitability, we have too poor a case to put to the
ICI main board for the capital needed to sustain the business, especially
when we are not performing to the levels of the past,' Mr Hunt said.
Electricity now accounts for about 75 per cent of ICI's variable costs in
chlorine production. The company uses the Castner-Kellner process, in which
electrolysis splits a solution of brine into chlorine and caustic soda.
These are the basic feedstocks for a wide range of chemical products,
including most modern solvents and plastics. About 4,000 'downstream' jobs
depend on chlorine production at Runcorn alone, where ICI's complex of three
Castner-Kellner plants consumes 1 per cent of the nation's power output,
making it Britain's largest electricity customer.
The company has the bulk of the UK market but now cannot afford to operate
plant for long enough each day to fill all its export orders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Partisan lobbying is all grist to Westminster's mill. But the efforts of the
electricity generators and regional electricity companies to blame each
other in the coal row may yet cause the government difficulty. If it is to
make concessions on pit closures, its priority must be to get more coal
burnt, and for that it will need the co-operation of both sides of the
electricity industry. Giving that help could well guarantee a light touch
from a grateful government. A fudge - perhaps based on Southern Electric's
suggestion that the government should sell its competition soul and maintain
the size of the non-competitive market till 1988 - could be agreed with a
little give all round. British Coal might then sell over 50m tonnes a year
and buy much needed time.
Yet obvious tension between the RECs and the generators could compromise a
deal. It may be rash for the RECs to press for a break-up of the generators,
since by almost any measure REC returns are higher. And the suggestion by
National Power that the non-competitive market should be reserved for coal
largely burnt by the generators is mischievous. Shareholders must hope that
neither side invites a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry by pursuing
feuds which run back to the long fiat of the CEGB.

FT  30 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the soggy performance of UK smaller companies in recent years, it
takes a leap of faith to launch an investment trust designed to track the
stock market's minnows. Hoare Govett's new venture, however, may not be
quite as perverse as it seems. Smaller companies are particularly vulnerable
to high interest rates partly because they are usually highly geared. As
recession hits, they are also hurt because large companies try to improve
their cash flow at the expense of the smaller fry. Both those pressures ease
as interest rates fall.
Historically the sector has offered high returns to compensate investors for
the difficulty in dealing in the companies' shares. That changed in the
mid-1980s, as small company shares were briefly perceived as more liquid.
The 1987 stock market crash shattered this illusion. Now the sector has
fallen back to allow the more traditional high return. Illiquidity, and
hence this high return, may well continue: an investor in small company
shares may often have advantageous information which his counterparty has
not researched. Wide spreads are a defence against this information gap.
Hoare Govett might argue that investors in its trust are protected from the
liquidity problem. The trust will track its own Smaller Companies Index
which has a beta of one, making it no more volatile than the market as a
whole. It might thus seem a cheap way of obtaining high small company
returns. That said, investors may prefer to wait and see what level of
discount to net assets the fund settles at before taking the plunge.

FT  30 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as the UK market is getting accustomed to adjusting reported profits
for pension costs, a new item has started to muddy the figures. The new
method of accounting for the cost of providing post-retirement medical care
to US employees knocked Pounds 4m off Tate &amp; Lyle's full-year profits. It
will also take a Pounds 52m bite out of the balance sheet. Tate is merely
falling into line with the latest guidance from the UK accounting standards
setters that such benefits should be treated in the same way as pension
costs. That means an actuarial stab at the future cost of providing health
care and smoothing the charge over the average working life of employees.
In Tate &amp; Lyle's case the new method doubled the annual charge against
profits. For companies with a bigger or older US workforce, the damage will
be worse. If the actuarial sums are correct, of course, the cash cost should
eventually catch up with the accounting charge. Estimating future medical
costs makes pension arithmetic look like an exact science. Making
assumptions about the rate at which retired employees fall ill, and the cost
of medical treatment by the time they do, is little more than guess work.
This could be a case, though, where a new method of bean-counting prompts
overdue action. Tate is already looking for ways to reduce its
post-retirement obligations. Some US companies are taking a more draconian
approach. Unisys, for example, has said it will stop contributing at all
from 1996 rather than take a Dollars 100m annual charge and a Dollars 700m
write-off. If the accountants help bring about reform of the US health care
system, so much the better.

<TEXT>
Beware consensus in the UK housing market. That would seem a sensible rule
for investors given the events of recent years. Building societies, estate
agents and even many independent City commentators, after all, were
anticipating a rise in house prices at the start of both 1991 and 1992 which
never materialised. Judging by the latest forecasts from Charterhouse and
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew (which to be fair predicted that prices would continue
to slide this year) expectations are now somewhat more muted. If they are
right, however, there will be a bounce in the volume of house purchases in
1993 from their current 20-year low. Prices will finally turn up, perhaps by
5-6 per cent, in calender 1994.
As P &amp; D points out recent interest rate developments have made houses in
the UK more affordable than at any time since the early 1970s. There are
also demographic factors - including, intriguingly, an unprecedented number
of women of average child bearing age - likely to fuel demand. The troubles,
of course, include that old enemy unemployment which seemed to be
accelerating in the third quarter and is unlikely to stabilise until next
year. Prospective purchasers are also put off by the prospect of further
house price falls and tougher lending criteria on the part of the building
societies.
The risk is that many of the ingredients for revival - better price/income
ratios, pent up demand and the like - also seemed to be in place 12 months
ago. Volume housebuilders such as Persimmon and Wilson Bowden have rightly
been pinpointed as the best targets for those determined to play the sector.
But prospective earnings multiples of 17 leave no scope for further
disappointment.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Chinese demands cast doubt on HK port project
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S row with Britain about democracy in Hong Kong took a turn for the
worse at the weekend when senior Chinese representatives in the colony
attempted to cast doubt over the future development of Hong Kong's container
port.
Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador to London, has been summoned to the Foreign
Office today to receive a toughly worded note from Mr Alastair Goodlad, a
foreign office minister, after Beijing demanded to be consulted on the
proposed development of the port's ninth terminal.
Officials in Hong Kong said the latest intervention by China was an attempt
to undermine confidence in the colony.
Beijing has claimed the proposed development of the port's ninth terminal
cannot proceed without China's agreement on terms under which government
land to accommodate the terminal will be sold to the terminal operators. The
government recently made a proposal to three operators, each of which has
substantial mainland Chinese links, over terms for proceeding with the
HKDollars 8bn to HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 854m) project.
The Hong Kong government denied the Chinese needed to be consulted over
terms of the sale of the land - permission for which was agreed with China
earlier this year. It pointed out that no government contracts or franchises
were being awarded.
China last year secured the right to be consulted on contracts and
franchises which span June 1997 - when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty - when it agreed to the construction of the new airport.
It has since refused to agree to financing arrangements for the airport
because it disagrees with Britain about the development of democracy in Hong
Kong.
The Chinese demand for consultation on the terminal was voiced by Guo
Fengmin, Beijing's chief representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group. It coincided with a vote by the colony's Legislative Council to
approve the administration's request for additional finance for the new
airport.

FT  30 NOV 92 / KIO in Spain made large profits for outside accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office, which claims to have lost billions of dollars
on industrial investments in Spain over the past few years, was at the same
time making large profits in Spain for institutional and private Kuwaiti
clients.
The profits were transferred to a number of hitherto unrevealed external
accounts the KIO was managing alongside the Kuwaiti oil revenue reserve it
traditionally handles.
A Financial Times investigation has uncovered evidence that the external
accounts were the main beneficiaries of the KIO's controversial investment
drive into Spain in the late 1980s. They may, in part, have made profits at
the expense of Kuwait's Reserve for Future Generations, which the KIO, one
of the world's most powerful and secretive investors, was created to manage.
Between 1986 and May this year the KIO spent Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.2bn)
building one of Spain's largest industrial conglomerates. New managers who
took control of the organisation last spring have been investigating what
they claim are 'irregularities' in the handling of the Spanish assets bought
with the money.
The KIO holding company in Spain, Grupo Torras, now has debts of about
Dollars 3bn and a number of its affiliates have now either collapsed or are
close to failing.
The new KIO management claims that no profits were made in Spain and is
threatening to take legal action against the former leadership of the KIO
and its Spanish partners. But internal KIO documents show that by May 1990
the KIO's future generations account had made Dollars 24m in Spain while
some of its 'managed' accounts had made a profit of Dollars 231m.
A report produced last year by the KIO's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, details
transfers of profits made on share transactions from Spain to a series of
offshore companies - GSM Securities Management, Montrex and BPS - through
which the external accounts traded.
It has not been possible to identify the owners of the external accounts.
The KIO's constitution authorises it to manage any funds it is directed to
by the Kuwaiti government.
The KIO's relationship with the banking community in Spain and abroad is
already being tested by difficulties at Torras and some of its companies.
Last week Torras defaulted on loans worth a total of Dollars 400m from
Credit Suisse and Bank of America. The KIO itself had guaranteed these loans
and must repay them.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Support for continuity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR HUGH MARSDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I endorse Mr Baker's excellent letter (November 26) seeking support
for the Securities and Futures Authority's continuing success in regulating
retail stock exchange business. Your article, 'Back to the Drawing Board'
(November 26) seems to indicate that Mr Mick Newmarch (of Prudential
Corporation) and Lord Alexander (of National Westminster Bank) are
influenced by the clear need for their own self-interest to salvage FIMBRA.
In my own self-interest, and that of my clients, I urge Lord Alexander, Mr
Newmarch and other financial services industry leaders to consider the
undoubted success of the stock exchange over many years and its present
successor, the SFA, and to build on it. Their proposals would surely
unnecessarily sublimate a small and much needed service which is essential
to private investors and to the government's declared aim to encourage wider
share ownership.
In any case, vast change will incur vast cost without ensuring a better end
product. Will small- and medium-sized independent intermediaries survive a
second onslaught of regulatory change and cost within a decade? Without
intermediaries the public will have less independent advice. Is this what
the Prudential and Natwest are seeking?

FT  30 NOV 92 / Costs and benefits of the currency conundrum: FT writers
examine the impact of European exchange rate upheavals on the competitive
position of the continent's exporters

<TEXT>
Industrialists throughout Europe are still recovering their breath after an
autumn of European currency upheaval. With the effects on competitiveness
varying according to whether they sell from a hard or soft-currency country,
exporters around the continent have different stories to tell.
Following three realignments in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), combined
with the floating of the Swedish krona and Finnish markka, there is unease
that more devaluations may be on the way. And one overriding worry is that
competitive devaluation could exacerbate the problems faced by Germany,
Europe's strongest economy - adding to recessionary pressures around the
continent.
Countries where currencies have appreciated are feeling the pinch. The
D-Mark and the French franc have risen sharply against leading European
currencies since sterling and the lira left the ERM on September 16. The
trend continued after the fresh ERM realignment on November 22, in which the
peseta and escudo were devalued by 5 per cent. The disadvantages caused by
foreign devaluations for exporters in Germany and France have been partly
offset by the rise of the dollar since September - which has cheapened
European exports compared with those priced in dollars. But, since
intra-European trade far outweighs European countries' exports to the dollar
zone, it is the ERM shifts which have had the larger consequences for
competitiveness.
Commenting on the September devaluation, Mr Robert Hudry, finance director
of Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, complains: 'In the
space of one week, we lost four years' effort in improving our productivity.
It's a heavy handicap.'
Since France's labour costs are now rising much more slowly than Germany's,
the Paris government reckons competitive problems are tolerable. Mr Bruno
Durieux, the junior trade minister, estimates that the weakness of sterling,
the lira and the peseta will set back the French trade balance by FFr5bn
(Pounds 610m) in a full year, compared with the forecast trade surplus of
FFr25bn this year. However, The Patronat, the French employers' association,
expects French exporters to lose market share in cars, steel and
telecommunications unless companies cut margins.
Patronat officials say their real worry is whether the ERM will hold
together if strains revive. Mr Noel Goutard, chairman of Valeo, the car
components maker, says: 'My worst nightmare is that the Bundesbank will not
cut interest rates by the end of the year and that France will approach its
legislative election next March facing 3m unemployed in a political panic.
The political right will then be tempted to devalue, perhaps by 10-15 per
cent, when the government could have got away with only a 3-4 per cent
devaluation a few weeks ago.'
The country showing most pessimism about the currency changes is Germany.
Labour costs are rising faster than in many competitor countries, and the
economy slowed sharply in the third quarter this year. Companies' worries
that they may be pricing themselves out of export markets have cast a fresh
pall over economic prospects.
Mr Manfred Schneider, chief executive of Bayer, the chemicals group, says
D-Mark appreciation has damaged the competitiveness of the entire,
export-oriented chemicals sector - and warns that profits this year will
fall sharply. Similar warnings have been broadcast by a range of other top
companies, including Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Metallgesellschaft and
Mannesmann.
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), during the past three years Germany has been losing export markets
for manufactured goods faster than any other industrialised country. Taking
into account the September ERM changes, the OECD estimates Germany's share
of manufactured goods markets will fall 4.8 per cent this year and 1.5 per
cent in 1993, after a drop of 6 per cent in 1991.
In the countries in which currencies have devalued, industrialists have
welcomed the fillip to exports. Mr Robin Mowday, commercial director of
Bridgeport, the export-dependent UK machine tool-maker, says sales to the US
and western Europe have improved. 'We are looking to export our way out of
trouble, so September 16 was a big help.' Mr Richard Freeman, corporate
chief economist at ICI, the UK chemicals group, says sterling's fall will
give a 'very big impact' to exports.
But exporters from weak currency countries also fear that gains could be
eroded by higher import prices. Mr Filip Marazzi, chairman of Ceramica
Marazzi, one of Italy's biggest tile groups, says: 'We pay for a lot of raw
materials in dollars, D-Marks or schillings. The expected rise in production
costs will eliminate the benefit of devaluation.'
In Spain, industrialists say the peseta's double devaluation has brought the
previously overvalued exchange rate back to reality. But Mr Claudio
Aranzadi, Spain's industry minister, last week said Spain would only stay
within its new ERM limits if workers agreed lower wage rises.
In Sweden, the forestry industry - competing above all with North American
and Finnish producers - will be the single largest beneficiary of the
abandonment of the krona's links with the Ecu. MoDo, one of Sweden's three
leading forest companies, estimates its annual turnover will increase by
more than SKr200m as a result of the appreciation of foreign currencies.
Both Volvo and Saab Automobile, with large export markets in the UK and US,
are obvious beneficiaries. But many industry executives believe Sweden may
repeat the mistakes of the 1982 devaluation, when rising wage costs and
inflation eventually eroded competitive benefits.
Economists believe the changes will do little to reverse the long-term trend
of declining European competitiveness vis-a-vis the rest of the world. EC
countries' share of world export markets for manufactured goods has fallen
by a cumulative 6.3 per cent during 1990-92, according to OECD estimates.
The EC's trade deficit with the rest of the world rose to Dollars 71bn last
year from only Dollars 11bn in 1988. The shortfall was Dollars 40bn in the
first eight months of this year, in spite of faltering EC growth, which
would normally be expected to reduce imports.
A further round of devaluations during the run-up to next spring's French
elections could divert attention from the search for solutions to the
decline in the international performance of European industry. Mr Douglas
McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, says:
'European labour is the highest paid in the world. We work the shortest
hours and have the longest holidays. You have to be very productive to get
over that.'

FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Contracting for public services - regulations not
extended for first time, and employees' fears confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LESLIE CHRISTIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Waldegrave's attempt to reassure potential contractors for public
services ('Government seeks to clarify rights of employees in transfers',
November 26) will only serve to confirm their fears. He claims that
discussion of the application of the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations
(TUPE) is a 'red herring'. The only thing fishy about the debate is the
government's attempt to pretend that the TUPE regulations (and the EC
directive on which they are based) have no effect on the market testing
programme.
Playing with words, the government argues that TUPE has always covered the
public sector. Formally, this is true - but up to now TUPE has never been
deemed to cover the contracting out of public services because
'non-commercial' ventures were excluded. The government's recent proposed
amendments to UK legislation effectively admit that it was in breach of the
EC directive.
The minister's next defence is that the regulations applied 'only when an
undertaking was transferred' and that this would depend on the facts of the
case. A recent European Court of Justice decision makes it much more likely
that the regulations would now apply in most cases of contracting out of
services.
And to rub salt into the wounds (or the herring), those who have suffered as
a result of the government's failure to implement correctly an EC directive
into domestic law now have the option of bringing an action for damages
against the government under principles laid down by the European Court of
Justice.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL FORSYTH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contractors for local authority services may well have been confused by
misleading reports in the FT and elsewhere about an amendment to the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations proposed in
the employment legislation now before parliament.
These regulations provide for the transfer of employees' contracts where an
undertaking is transferred to a new employer. Catherine Milton said in her
articles on October 29 and 30: 'Until now the government has argued that the
directive applies only to workers in the private sector.' That is not true.
The government has always accepted that both public and private sectors come
within the scope of the regulations. The amendments in the current bill
certainly do not have the effect of extending the regulations to the public
sector for the first time.
However, the regulations do not normally apply where local authorities
contract out in-house services in accordance with the requirements of our
compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) legislation, since there is not
normally a transfer of an undertaking in these circumstances. The amendment
we are making to the regulations does not alter this position. CCT has led
to both financial savings and improvements in the quality of local services,
and it is in no one's interest to see its impact lessened by ill-informed
reports.
Nor has the Foreign and Commonwealth Office suspended its preparation for
market testing, as your report stated. The White Paper published on November
25, as reported in your edition of November 26, contained a list of
activities to be market tested in every government department, including the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The legal position on the regulations is
one of a number of issues which have to be taken into account in the normal
course of developing contracting out programmes, before tendering can
proceed. The amendment we are making does not affect the government's plans
for market testing or contracting out.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Customer loyalty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy for journalists to abuse the privilege of their position by
slagging off a product or company that has provided them with shoddy
service. Members of the public rarely get the same sort of response as an
incensed scribe threatening to reveal all.
Even so Lynn Barber's tale, in The Independent on Sunday, of how her
daughter has been waiting seven weeks for her free camera and cash card
after opening a Lloyds Bank student account, struck a chord. The free camera
has finally arrived - it doesn't work - but still no sign of her daughter's
cash card.
Ms Barber contrasts Lloyds' response with that of the John Lewis department
store group after she complained about a worn out loose cover for her sofa.
The offending item was whisked off to a laboratory to see what went wrong
and a replacement is being made as fast as possible. 'Imagine if someone had
seen that cover and you had said you got it at John Lewis,' a worried John
Lewis partner told Ms Barber.
The difference between a clearing bank and a department store is that the
latter's success depends on repeat business, whereas a clearing bank can
live off a near captive customer base. That said, tales like the above do
raise the question of whether Lloyds Bank really deserves its reputation as
the best-managed London clearing bank.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Royal wonder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Wood, the 46-year-old founder of Royal Bank of Scotland's money-making
Direct Line Insurance subsidiary, started yesterday with a game of tennis
before heading for the office to return the anticipated volley of criticism
over his Pounds 6m bonus.
Wood is hardly the traditional clearing bank director. An entrepreneurial
figure who rattles off an array of statistics about his telephone sales
operation, he is briskly unapologetic about what he gets paid. 'I certainly
don't want to be known as the Dollars 6m man,' was the closest he came to
sounding defensive.
The bank was supporting its colourful director yesterday. But does it really
want more 'Peter Wood clones', as he himself thinks? Far be it for Observer
to sow seeds of boardroom dissent. But if Wood can keep up this type of
performance - he told The Observer that his operation could be 'worth more
than the Royal Bank before too long' - he should be running the Royal Bank
and not George Mathewson.
Like Michael Hepher, Lloyds Bank's insurance supremo who defected to BT, it
is hard to imagine the Royal Bank offerring Wood the sort of career
prospects which will satisfy a multi-millionaire for the next 14 years.

It sounds as if chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont is not the only

that Alastair Burt, a junior minister in the department of social security,
has requested a copy of Bernadine Lawrence's useful new book, 'How to feed

Given that the National Consumer Council estimates that the average family
spends at least Pounds 60 a week on food, Burt should have recouped his
Pounds 3.99 outlay in a couple of days if he sticks to the diet.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Mandarin solution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's to be hoped the Queen's offer to pay tax on her private wealth does not
lead to the sort of bureaucratic madness that followed an attempt to bring
privileged bodies into the tax net by the Labour government of the 1960s.
The instigator was the late Richard Crossman who had previously been not
only an Oxford don, but a member of the city's council. As such, he'd been
appalled by the income lost to the city because Oxford University, like its
counterparts elsewhere, was exempt from paying rates.
So, on becoming minister for local government, he withdrew the
rates-exemption from universities in general.
The snag was that a good many lacked the money to pay the charges because
their entire income was committed to teaching and research. Warnings of
impending bankruptcies began to spread.
But Whitehall mandarins neatly produced a cost-less solution. They increased
the central government grants to universities to cover the rate-payments to
their local authorities, and decreased the central grants to the relevant
authorities by the same amounts.
Alas, the resulting money-go-round hadn't been operating for long before
another arm of officialdom threw a spanner in the works.
Since the new arrangement was purely a book-keeping exercise, whenever the
local authorities raised the rates, the universities simply paid up without
demur. But that incurred the displeasure of the Committee of Public
Accounts, which said they must contest the rate-increases to keep the local
councils in check.
Whereupon universities on the one hand and councils on the other took to the
courts, and soon large dollops of taxpayers' and ratepayers' money were
flying off the money-go-round . . . into the pockets of lawyers, of course.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Penny-pinching leaves passengers suffering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R J ARDERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on passenger reaction to the new Networker trains
('Passengers say new trains create strain', November 25) could be applied to
most of the new trains introduced in recent years. Economic penny-pinching
has won at the expense of passenger comfort.
The class 156 Super Sprinter is seriously deficient in toilet provision. The
ubiquitous class 158 Express Sprinter and the Mark 4 coaches on the East
Coast Main Line are cramped like the Networker. Seats are too narrow and too
close together, particularly where four people are expected to sit with
knees knocking round a table which has insufficient space for their papers.
Larger people and pregnant women are simply not catered for.
The lack of mid-carriage doors and the cramped conditions also extend
unloading times by a significant amount which could be life-threatening in a
major incident. Presumably these designs have passed somebody's safety
audit? A worrying trend for the future is that the 158s are already becoming
rattle-traps with ceiling units and luggage racks banging away throughout
the journey. This same problem was also apparent recently when I sampled the
new stock on the Portsmouth line.
One big advance has been the smoother ride given by the new generation of
bogies and BR should be congratulated on this. However, it would do well to
start again from the body shell and design interiors more suited to
reasonable passenger comfort. The trains are projected to last for 30 years,
but will customers' patience? R J Ardern,

Sir, In recent days you have carried a number of suggestions for the

These all sound like wonderful ways of taking risk out of our lives, and Mr

FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Reason for optimism about changes in auditing
practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A P THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article 'Auditors' body calls for changes in practice'
(November 24).
It is ironic that the accounting profession, this time in the form of the
Auditing Practices Board, is discovering again that there is 'a need for
auditors to report to a wider audience' and 'on a far wider range of
activities'.
It is ironic because this was the main thrust of the Accounting Standards
Steering Committee's 'The Corporate Report', published in 1975. This
document proposed six specific additional statements, many of which address
current concerns and none of which has ever been taken up by the ASC, the
stock exchange or legislation.
The Corporate Report, like the current discussion document, was radical in
recognising a responsibility to regulators, employees, etc.
However, there is more reason to be optimistic under the new standard
setting regime that the profession will at long last grasp this thistle and
make major improvements in both financial reporting and the role of
auditors.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Black Wednesday's bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the ridiculous slogan attributed to Henry Ford, 'history is bunk',
history will not go away, an example being the cost of the British
government's un-successful attempts to defend sterling's ERM parity up to
Black Wednesday, September 16.
That new and most useful periodical, Central Banking*, has provided an
analysis in its autumn issue. Although its own estimate is probably too
high, it has helped to prise out some information.
The best estimate of the sums expended by both the Bank of England and other
central banks in defending sterling during the period is in the region of
Pounds 15bn to Pounds 20bn. This includes drawings made on the special Ecu
facility announced on September 3 and on proceeds of earlier Ecu borrowing.
So it is double counting to add them all together.
The best approximation to the capital loss would be to apply to the sums
expended the 15 per cent devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark, which
gives a loss of around Pounds 2 1/4 bn to Pounds 3bn, near the upper end of
what was estimated by outside observers immediately afterwards. This is
obviously not exact. For instance, some of the outstanding amount to be
repaid is Ecu denominated; and the pound was devalued a little less against
the Ecu than the D-Mark. Nevertheless it is in the right ballpark.
We are not talking about small sums. What is most likely to anger the
chancellor is not the numbers in Central Banking but the assertion in the
magazine that the loss is 'just as if Norman Lamont had personally thrown
entire hospitals and schools into the sea all afternoon'.
It is true that the transactions of the Exchange Equalisation Account are
excluded from the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. But look at the
well-known Dollars 1bn gain of a private fund manager, George Soros, from
the devaluation of sterling. Suppose that Mr Soros had been less skilful and
had lost an equivalent amount. Is there any doubt that he and his
fundholders would have been poorer? Capital losses in the public sector can
be spread over a longer period - it would be absurd to raise British taxes
in one year to make up foreign exchange losses. But they have not vanished
into thin air.
A more important revelation in Central Banking is of a letter from a former
president of the Bundesbank, the late Dr Otmar Emminger, written in 1978
before the start of the ERM and accepted by the German government, opting
out of any obligation of unlimited intervention in support of weaker
currencies.
The substance of the letter was known to other central banks. Indeed the
whole concept of unlimited intervention was basically a bluff. Quite apart
from the controversy about the effects of such intervention on the German
money supply, there is an obligation to repay these sums within 75 days -
only a fraction can be rolled over. Repayment becomes less credible once
intervention gets into the stratosphere.
For instance, by the weekend of the Italian lira devaluation, the Bundesbank
had spent DM90bn in support of currencies against their ERM margins, in
practice the lira. In addition some DM200bn had previously been expended in
intramarginal support of currencies before they had reached their limits,
making a grand total of no less than DM290bn.
There were other ignored warning signals. When a currency had reached 75 per
cent of the maximum permitted divergence in the ERM grid, consultations with
partner countries should be triggered, covering fundamental policy. Yet the
British government, as far as is known, was not prepared either to raise
interest rates or to raise the question of realignment.
By the weekend of the lira devaluation, the Bundesbank had notified the
German government that intervention had reached unmanageable proportions and
once again raised the question of a wider realignment in return for a larger
cut in interest rates. Recent contacts between the House of Commons treasury
committee and the Bundesbank have suggested that this proposal was not
passed on by Jean-Claude Trichet, the French chairman of the Monetary
Committee. The French riposte, with which one can sympathise, is that the
German position was surely clear enough and was not dependent on one
particular channel for its transmission.
One Bundesbank view is that some good may still come from the confusion if
it is now clear that:
realignments are still within the rules of the ERM game;
ERM members can temporarily opt out during periods of stress; and
unlimited intervention is for the birds.
But why did it take an international catastrophe to establish these
elementary points? Of course a case could have been made, as I indeed tried
to, for a harder version of the ERM. But it was simply ostrich-like to
pretend that the core player, Germany, accepted such a hard version when in
fact it did not.

self-imposed deadline of publishing a white paper 'early in the new year'.
He will not lack ideas. In the seven weeks since British Coal triggered a
crisis with its announcement of 31 pit closures and the loss of 30,000 jobs,
he has been deluged with suggestions from industrial, social and public
interests. The parallel hearings conducted by the Commons select committee
on trade and industry have also produced hundreds of pages of testimony.
With the consultation period now drawing to a close, these will all go into
the melting pot.
The overall message is clear: Britain's energy policy, insofar as any
exists, is in a mess; people are confused and shocked by the decision to
shut down half the coal industry, and they think the answer lies in
government taking a more active role. But unfortunately for Mr Heseltine,
the torrent of words does not contain an easy solution to his dilemma.
If anything, the debate has shown that virtually anything he does to try and
increase coal's share of the UK energy market will have a knock-on cost,
either as higher prices, jobs lost or subsidies. It has also become evident
that he will be hard-pressed to save more than a third of the 30,000 jobs at
risk. But the result need not be just a short-term palliative. One of the
few encouraging points emphasised by the debate is that British Coal might
have stronger prospects if it can only be helped over the next three or four
difficult years.
Mr Heseltine's white paper will have to balance many competing aims. These
include:
saving a large enough number of coal jobs to quell public outrage, but
keeping the cost to a minimum;
achieving quick results, but also creating a sensible long-term framework;
taking government initiative without destroying the overriding aim of
introducing market forces into the energy sector;
making the rescue a boost rather than a burden to the economy as it
struggles to recover.
The fundamental question which Mr Heseltine will have to answer before he
considers possible courses of action is who will bear the cost of saving
British Coal, the taxpayer or the electricity consumer. The trade secretary
himself has put the total cost of keeping British Coal at its present size
at Pounds 1.2bn a year.
The case for placing the cost on the taxpayer is that saving miners' jobs is
essentially a social matter. Coal is uncommercial, and if wider national
considerations require it to be saved, the country at large should foot the
bill. But having only just agreed the spending cuts needed for the Autumn
Statement, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be in no mood to
countenance fresh outlays. Saving coal would add about a half penny to the
basic rate of income tax.
There is a stronger case for loading the cost on the electricity consumer.
Here, the argument is that saving coal is not a social matter but a prudent
way of diversifying the country's fuel supplies. A rescue financed by
consumers would also save the government a large sum of money by reducing
the state's redundancy bill for jobless miners.
Mr Heseltine may find it easier to bury the cost in electricity bills. At
the moment these are unlikely to rise next year because of the effect of
price controls. If Mr Heseltine forces them up, household consumers may not
notice much difference, though industrial consumers could kick up a fuss
about the threat to recovery: 'What we need is price decreases, not price
increases,' Mr Peter Rost, the chairman of the Major Energy Users Council
told the select committee.
None of the possible solutions would meet all of Mr Heseltine's
requirements. Some, such as the suggestion that power generators be asked to
hold larger coal stocks, are plainly impractical because their yards are
already bulging with coal, and British Coal itself has 20m tonnes lying
unsold. Suggestions that imports of coal and electricity should be banned
are ruled out by the commercial and diplomatic repercussions.
The solution that looks most attractive remains one of the first to be
mooted: the extension of the so-called franchise market in which most of the
electricity generated from British Coal's output is sold. Those in this
market, which consists of all but the 5,000 largest electricity consumers in
the country, have to buy power from their local distribution company. It
accounts for 70 per cent of electricity consumed, and prices have been
maintained at artificially high levels to help coal.
The intention was to phase the franchise market out in stages starting in
1994, and to liberalise competition completely by 1998. Mr Heseltine could
delay this timetable, either through legislation or with the agreement of
the electricity regulator, Prof Stephen Littlechild. Such a move would be
welcomed by many regional distribution companies which are not looking
forward to tougher competition, and it would place the cost on the consumer
rather than the taxpayer.
Above all, it would achieve quick results because it would give the
electricity industry confidence to sign up for larger deliveries of coal in
the new five-year contracts which they are negotiating with British Coal.
These contracts, due to start next April, are crucial to British Coal's
future.
The franchise market could be extended in a further way, along the lines of
a proposal by Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the largest
generator. He suggested that Mr Heseltine decree that this market could only
be served by electricity generated from coal produced in the UK. This would
mean excluding the controversial new gas-fired generators which have been
accused by large electricity users and the coal lobby of being uneconomic.
The present structure of the market allows the regional electricity
companies to pass on any higher costs directly to consumers. Mr Baker's
suggestion would also staunch coal imports.
Although Mr Baker's proposal looks self-serving because National Power is
the largest supplier of electricity to the franchise market, it would return
that market to the role for which it was originally created - to protect
coal. It would doubtless provoke a cry of protest  - and probably legal
action - from the gas projects' owners. But it would also put to the test
the claim which these projects have always made that gas can compete in a
free market. 'They can't have it both ways,' says Mr Baker.
Together, these measures could add 15m tonnes of coal to the 40m tonnes
currently expected to be burnt for power generation next year.
By contrast, the other front-running suggestion - that Mr Heseltine
accelerate the closure of the UK's ageing magnox nuclear reactors - has
fewer attractions. Although these reactors are currently subsidised to the
tune of Pounds 1.2bn a year, their closure would not save this money since
it is earmarked for decommissioning costs which will be needed anyway. On
top of that, premature closure would deprive the Treasury of the
considerable earnings which the magnoxes generate now that their costs have
been fully written down. Nuclear Electric puts the potential revenue loss at
Pounds 2bn.
A further drawback is that nuclear power stations cannot be closed down at a
stroke; their closure would not spark any immediate additional demand for
coal.
While Mr Heseltine will want quick results, he will also need to lay out
long-term plans in order to rebuild confidence in the energy sector. The
question here is whether he will want to institutionalise a more active
government energy policy by creating an energy commission, or even reviving
the department of energy which he scrapped only six months ago.
There is strong political support for the idea of an energy commission.
Public opinion seems to favour making the country's fuel mix a matter of
national policy which takes account of social, economic and environmental
needs. It also looks as if the select committee will back such a scheme.
The committee's hopes that Prof Littlechild would perform this role were
dashed when he told them that it was not his job to promote particular types
of fuel or save the coal industry. The committee subsequently welcomed a
blueprint for an energy agency proposed by Dr Dieter Helm, director of
Oxford Economic Research Associates.
But Mr Heseltine would have to decide whether closer government intervention
marked a large step back from its long-term plan of introducing market
forces into the energy sector. For one thing, it would require detailed
legislation. The cost of trying to dictate the fuel mix could also be huge
because of the subsidies and distortions it would introduce. The economics
of the electricity generation and distribution business would be radically
altered only two years after privatisation.
But are these fears exaggerated? Mr Francis McGowan of the Science Policy
Research Unit at Sussex University, a leading academic centre on energy
policy, says it should be possible to adopt a more active policy without
falling into the same mistakes as the past. The privatisation of the power
industry and the creation of regulators to protect consumers' interests have
made the market much more transparent. 'The pendulum has to swing back a bit
the other way,' he says.
Would a solution that created a market for an extra 15m tonnes of coal
production be enough? Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, delivered a
gloomy warning to the select committee. Because of the increases of
productivity which his company is making, the need for labour will fall
anyway. So even though 15m tonnes represents half the amount by which
British Coal production was due to be cut, it would at the most save only 10
of the 31 threatened pits, and a third of the miners' jobs.
But by the same token, a breathing space would enable British Coal to bring
more of its pits up to competitive strength. According to John T. Boyd, the
mining consultancy hired by the government to advise on the closures, 28 of
the pits could produce coal at an average price of Pounds 1.33 a gigajoule
within three or four years, and some could do better. That compares with the
current price of Pounds 1.80, and would take British Coal within range of
imported coal prices.
Mr Heseltine may conclude that it is worth holding back changes in the power
market in the hopes of securing these gains, and putting British Coal on a
sounder long-term footing, particularly if he can point to wider social
benefits. But there will be a hefty price to pay.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Russia before the Congress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONGRESS of People's Deputies which meets in Moscow this week is a
leftover from Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, which demolished the old
communist system but failed to erect a new one. Many of its members
represent the interests of the old, centralised economy, which made the
Soviet Union a deformed military superpower but never delivered prosperity,
because it was not designed to do so.
Before the Congress these men tried to pursuade President Boris Yeltsin that
the monster designed to make the Soviet Union militarily powerful can be
re-targeted, to make the Russian successor state prosperous and efficient.
Powerful men such as Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the industrialists'
association, have sought to weaken the market reformers in the government
led by Mr Yegor Gaidar. They have demanded the resignation of reformist
ministers, accusing them of trying to foist an inappropriate western model
onto Russia. They have also pushed for a further slackening of financial and
other restraints on the military-industrial complex and an economic strategy
which would make state enterprises the engine of modernisation.
Recent events have already provided indications of what such a policy would
mean. For a start, it means a new effort to provide work for military
factories by a determined export drive. Russia is offering tanks,
submarines, aircraft carriers, aircraft and arms and equipment of all
descriptions, in competition not only with western manufacturers but also
with arms plants in Ukraine and other former Soviet states.
It also means a new emphasis on 'self-reliance', as in the decision to place
a multi-billion dollar contract for the development of the giant Shtokman
gas field in the Barents Sea with a consortium of Russian defence
industries, and the expected decision to go ahead with the Udokan copper
project. This would provide thousands of jobs, but is never likely to
provide an economic return.
Given Russia's shortage of hard currency, and the spectre of mass
unemployment, it is understandable that the managers should wish to keep
their empires together by mammoth projects like these. That is what they
were designed for. But the Soviet Union paid highly for the obsessive
concentration of resources on a few prestige projects, like the White Sea
canal under Stalin or the BAM railway through the Siberian wilderness under
Brezhnev.
Russia needs a new type of economy, responsive to market forces and the
demands of ordinary people for the 'thousand and one tiny things' which
central planning could never deliver, from a decent shirt to tasty foods and
good medicines. That is the kind of economy being created in post-communist
central europe. It is the kind of economy which Mr Gaidar and his government
have also been striving to create.
Mr Gaidar agrees that Russia should produce more and better equipment for
the oil and gas industry and many other products designed to improve Russian
efficiency and satisfy long-neglected needs, where necessary with the help
of western finance and investment.
A painful compromise has been worked on between the government and Civic
Union conservatives. But Mr Gaidar is right to insist that four basic
principles be retained. These are: no return to a state distribution system;
tight control over the ballooning money supply; no wage or price freeze; and
no artificially low exchange rates.
Mr Yeltsin dismissed Mr Gorbachev's efforts to merge the contradictory plans
for reform of market-oriented economists and the industrial bureaucracy as a
'marriage between a hedgehog and a snake'.
He should remember those words and insist that Russia re-build its economy
along market lines, with state industry playing its part within these
disciplines.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUCLEAR industry is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its birth on
December 2 1942, when Enrico Fermi and colleagues carried out the first
controlled nuclear reaction. Past glories are a distraction from what looks
like a barren future for nuclear research, at least in the UK.
The government is cutting back drastically on the development of new nuclear
energy sources, and R&amp;D on fast reactors will be wound up over the next 18
months: the UK is to withdraw from the European Fast Reactor project and
close its Dounreay prototype reactor. That will leave fusion as the last
remaining field of nuclear research in which the UK is actively involved -
and even its most fervent advocates do not expect to see a commercial fusion
reactor within 40 years.
Nuclear scientists and engineers are lamenting what they see as the
short-sightedness of pulling out of fast reactor research, after spending
Pounds 2bn on it since the 1950s. They see the fast reactor - also known as
a 'breeder' because it can produce more fuel than it consumes - as a future
jewel in the crown of nuclear power.
That attitude is understandable but sadly out of date. Experience with
experimental fast reactors has shown that they are more difficult to build
and operate successfully than nuclear engineers had expected.
More important, the economic justification for fast reactors - that nuclear
fuel shortages early in the next century would make plutonium breeding
worthwhile - has disappeared. Most experts now expect the world to remain
awash in plutonium and uranium for several decades.
To have proceeded to the next stage of the European Fast Reactor project
would have meant designing a Pounds 2bn demonstration reactor for a specific
site. Yet there was no real prospect for the foreseeable future of the three
countries involved - France, Germany and the UK - agreeing either to put up
the funds required or to host the station.
The US has not been seriously interested in commercial fast reactor
development since the 1970s. Even Japan's enthusiasm for fast breeders is
cooling in the face of worldwide protests against its plutonium shipments.
In the unlikely event of the UK wanting to build a fast reactor in, say,
2020, there is no reason why Nuclear Electric should not buy a Japanese
design, just as it is building an American-designed PWR now at Sizewell.
The government should put the money saved on fast reactor research - Pounds
13m a year on EFR and Pounds 40m on Dounreay - into other areas of energy
research which have been starved of funds, such as clean coal technology.
And it must keep up Britain's share of the international effort to develop
nuclear fusion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DICK SPRING, and the Irish Labour party which he leads, surprised even
themselves in the general election last week. The party more than doubled
its share of the popular vote and its share of the seats in the Dail. Even
though Labour remains very much the third party, and Ireland will continue
to have to be governed by a coalition, Mr Spring has pulled off a remarkable
achievement. He is entitled to say that he represents the only party that is
on the way up.
Labour's strong showing is one of a series of events that suggests that the
old mould of Irish politics is being cracked, if not broken. Two years ago
the country elected a woman and a non-traditionalist as president. Seen from
abroad, the two leading parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, have never
looked as different from each other as they pretend at home. There was an
attempt at breaking the mould when the Progressive Democrats (PD) left the
mainstream to set up on their own, but the new party never quite took off:
it became an adjunct to the existing system. Last week's general election
need never have come about, had it not been for quarrels between politicians
of the old school, which includes some of the PDs.
Nevertheless, in spite of the political shortcomings, Ireland continues to
adapt. Anglo-Irish relations have improved immeasurably, despite - and
perhaps partly because of - the problems in the north. Membership of the
European Community has increased Ireland's self-confidence no end. The
country still has formidable economic difficulties, many of which stem from
its peripheral geographical position. There is the more immediate question
of whether the punt can maintain its position in the exchange rate mechanism
without realignment.
The election results suggest that Ireland would welcome a new voice in its
politics. That wish should now be reflected in the negotiations on a new
coalition. Fianna Fail needs a rest. Fine Gael is still the second party,
but has missed its opportunity. Mr Spring should seek to head a coalition of
Labour, Fine Gael and PDs.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: Sibelius symphony cycle - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the music of the North is an art borne of isolation in defiance of the
hostile elements of wind and cold, then Sibelius is its prime creator. No
other composer from the Northernmost reaches of Europe has equalled his
standing and there must be some measure of satisfaction in Britain that his
early international reputation was to a large degree won here.
The 'Tender is the North' festival, devoted to Scandinavian arts,
conveniently stretches its boundaries to include Finland as well. It is
difficult to imagine the musical side of it without Sibelius. The Finnish
composer's seven symphonies are the most significant single corpus of work
to have come from the North and a complete cycle of them, by Colin Davis and
the London Symphony Orchestra, is a major feature of the festival.
The best of the symphonies are concise in form, concentrated in thought. Yet
all the vast expanses of Finland's forests and lakes seem to be there.
Thomas Beecham, who was one of the foremost early interpreters of Sibelius's
music, grasped this essence of their style as if it was second nature and
was able to inflect every smallest detail without taking away from the
broader design. Davis is more of a landscape Sibelian, although that should
not be taken to mean that his performances lack intensity.
In the opening concert of the cycle at the Barbican on Thursday, both the
symphonies on the programme - Nos 3 and 1 in that order - had drive. Davis
really digs into the rhythms, giving us a tough and determined Sibelius,
unafraid of underlining the music emphatically. Even the slighter Third
Symphony had a weightier mass than usual, while the skies in both loomed
dark and lowering - a commendably atmospheric start to the cycle, aided by
above average playing from the LSO.
The most intimate contact with Sibelius, however, was made elsewhere. In
between the symphonies Karita Mattila sang a beautiful and heartfelt
performance of Luonnotar. This tone-poem for soprano and orchestra is
ostensibly about the world's creation, as viewed by the Finnish national
epic (the Kalevala), but in it Sibelius is surely plumbing the depths of his
inspiration to say what it is that made him and his music the very voice of
Finland.
In a festival of this kind the lesser-known pieces are always the most
valuable. Another concert two days earlier had thrown up a couple of
interesting smaller items. The Clarinet Concerto by the Danish Carl Nielsen
is never music of place in the way that makes Sibelius so easy to visualise
in terms of nationality, climate, temperament, but its neo-classical manners
can be pleasing enough if played with as much spirit as here by Emma
Johnson.
Paavo Berglund and the English Chamber Orchestra had also opened the concert
with a recent (1986) piece by Aulis Sallinen, his Chamber Music III,
sub-titled The Nocturnal Dances of Don Juanquixote. This is a fairly light
entertainment for cello solo, taken by Arto Noras, and string orchestra, in
which various places mingle: American jazz, Spanish dances, chilly Northern
textures. A Finnish composer in the late 20th century is an international
figure.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: The Rape of Tamar - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tirso de Molina (c1582-1648) is best known as the author who put Don Juan
into the European consciousness. A Mercedarian monk, he was - with Lope de
Vega and Calderon - one of the three great dramatists of the Spanish Golden
Age, and an extraordinary artist. London is lucky that in recent years these
men's plays have become more widely performed here.
On the one hand, Tirso had a remarkably light, fresh, direct and funny
touch. On the other, he was a serious moralist who believed that there is a
point at which God's mercy stops and beyond which sin is punished. Both
sides are evident in The Rape of Tamar - Paul Whit-worth's new translation
of La Venganza de Tamar (probably written between 1621 and 1624).
The Biblical King David's eldest son Amnon conceives an incestuous passion
for Tamar, David's daughter by another marriage. Eventually, after
discovering that she is in love with someone else, he rapes her. Tamar
appeals to David and to her full brother, Absalom, to avenge her dishonour.
David cannot bring himself to bring proper punishment (death) on his beloved
Amnon. It is Absalom - partly out of ambition for the throne - who takes
Amnon's life; and it is this death (with its intimations of Absalom's own
impending death) that finally devastates David.
Though the word 'rape' in the English title is eyecatching, Tirso's real
theme was revenge (as for so many early 17th-century dramatists). As he
tells the story (often with a light touch), he fills it with suspense -
fills it also with acute, ambiguous, multi-faceted moral perceptions. He
does not spell out every irony; he simply shows the appalling difference
between David's evasiveness about Amnon's crime and his grief (with nary a
thought of Tamar) at Amnon's death. And, again without commenting, he shows
how much David and his sons are preoccupied by power, ambition and
self-gratification. This is both a revenge tragedy and a history play.
The play's most shocking (and psychologically most acute) scene occurs after
the rape, when Amnon suddenly reviles Tamar as venomous trash. Later, Tirso
makes much of a quasi-Shakespearian pastoral scene, in which the veiled
Tamar wanders, wretched, among happy shepherds. After a nicely sibylline
scene in which a countrywoman gives ambiguous prophecies to each of David's
four sons, Amnon tries to seduce Tamar until he realises who she is. He has
no sooner unveiled her than he tries - in vain - to re-veil her.
Whitworth's translation is admirably fresh and transparent. He tries to keep
parlance within rhyming quatrameters, but is prepared to sacrifice metre or
rhyme to clarity. Only in a few yuppified quips ('Two days in that
boneshaker make your buttocks turn to salmon steak') does he draw attention
to himself. He also directs this production; and in this, too, clarity is
his hallmark, with one or two ultra-modern blots. Tim Reed's designs catch
nicely the way Tirso presents his Hebrew theme through a Spanish baroque
filter. The cast of 12 (several of them playing more roles than one) play
with unfussed simplicity and urgency.
It is hard to take Patrick Wilde's Amnon, with his non-designer stubble,
poor stance, and unpolished diction, as a crown prince - but his delivery is
so natural that it is easy always to believe, if not in the character, then
in him. Morris Perry's account of King David has just the right unforced
authority and near-cloying paternal solicitude. His account of his first
scene - starting with a very difficult piece of grand rhetoric - is the only
over-florid part of his or anyone's performance.
Most remarkable is Jules Melvin as Tamar - a kitten, then a tiger; a
princess, then a young crone. Though there are a few immaturities in her
performance, this is a young actress who speaks verse with a properly
supported voice (rare), naturally communicative force (rarer), and
surprising effects of phrasing. As Jean de Reszke used to say, never take a
breath when they expect you to.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: A foolish plan to reinvent Windsor - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching the flames at Windsor was a numbing experience and only the gradual
passage of time has put the disaster into some perspective. The losses are,
in architectural terms, immense. The stroke of luck, if one can call it
that, was that important works of art had been moved from some of the rooms
in preparation for the next stage of a comprehensive rewiring programme. Six
major rooms have been destroyed or badly damaged with roofs and ceilings
suffering the most.
The fire began in the private chapel, a relatively modest room that was
refurbished by Sir Hugh Casson in a wave of modernisation early in the
Queen's reign. Will this be the first room in Britain to be restored in the
Casson style? The Octagon Room, close to the chapel, was also damaged but
the serious losses are the enormous St. George's Hall, the Grand Reception
Room, the State Dining Room, and the Crimson Drawing Room. All these rooms
represent part of the complete transformation of the castle by King George
IV in the 1820s. There is no doubt that George IV, both as King and Prince
Regent, was the finest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I.
Windsor Castle was extensively altered by Charles II, but by the 19th
century it had become unsuitable for the residence of the sovereign of a
major world power. In 1824, the House of Commons granted the not
inconsiderable sum of Pounds 150,000 for improvements at Windsor. Sir
Charles Long, the King's principal artistic adviser, organised an
architectural competition. He invited three architects from the Office of
Works - Sir John Soane, Sir Robert Smirke and John Nash - to compete with
one outsider Jeffry Wyatt (who was to rename himself when he was knighted,
Sir Jeffry Wyatville). After long consultations with the King, Charles Long
produced a fascinating and extremely detailed brief. Wyatville followed the
brief very precisely and won the competition.
Wyatville's ambition at Windsor was to create in the Upper Ward a series of
State Apartments on the north side with a new grand entrance, the George IV
gateway, on the south side. An important part of the brief and of
Wyatville's plan was to improve and romanticise the castle's silhouette.
This included raising the height of the Round Tower by 33 feet to make it
the dominant element in the new group of battlemented and machicolated
towers. As an exercise in the picturesque, Wyatville and his patron achieved
a remarkable success; seen from the Great Park, or even from the M4
motorway, the castle makes one of Europe's most romantic skylines.
I am amazed that the Royal Institute of British Architects has reacted to
the fire at Windsor not with a scholarly and thoughtful response based on
historical knowledge, but with a Pavlovian reaction urging: 'an
architectural competition be held for the rebuilding of Windsor Castle. An
architectural competition would be a far more positive assertion of
tradition than the slavish recreation of Victorian pastiche. A contemporary
rebuilding could also provide an unrivalled opportunity to combine new state
rooms with acceptable modern galleries in which the Queen's art collection
could be put on permanent, and safe, public display. This really would be
worth every penny of the public money that the rebuilding will cost.' The
RIBA's statement goes on to urge the Queen to take advice from the president
of the Institute and Sir Hugh Casson.
Apart from the breathtaking ignorance that tries to suggest that good
Regency architecture is Victorian pastiche, I wonder whether any member of
the RIBA has recently been to Windsor or taken the slightest interest in
English artistic and architectural history. The facts are that the walls of
these important state rooms remain and there is sufficient plasterwork in
the Grand Reception Room, for example - one of the finest neo-Rococo
interiors in the world - for the only solution to be painstaking and
accurate restoration. There is plenty of archival evidence of how these
rooms looked and only a committee of historians and the finest conservation
architects can ensure that a decent job of restoration is carried out. I can
only suppose that the Institutional architects did not notice that most of
the furniture, tapestries and pictures that belonged in these rooms was
carefully rescued and is of a quality that deserves appropriate
reinstatement in properly restored rooms.
In Vienna last Friday another architectural loss was sustained when a part
of the Hofburg Imperial palace was badly damaged by fire. The main loss
seems to have been the great Redoutensaal built by the Empress Maria Theresa
and used for international conferences. The reaction of the Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitsky was the appropriate one. 'The whole area was
recently renovated and was one of the prominent jewels of our city. We'll
just have to renovate it again.'
The same sentiments should apply to Windsor Castle. There is an aesthetic
consistency in the Gothic progression of rooms from the Great Staircase
(later altered by Salvin) through the great vaulted Guard Chamber with its
military decoration and tributes to Marlborough, Wellington and Nelson to
St. George's Hall and the State Apartments. The dining room, and the vaulted
octagon room which serves as an ante-room in the Brunswick tower (both badly
damaged) continue the Gothic theme. Pugin's sideboard may have to be
replaced and the challenge will be to find craftsmen to recreate that sense
of Gothic chivalry and romance that is so important a part of the Windsor
style. No amount of prevarication about cost and stylistic treatment should
be allowed to cloud the fact that the only right course for Windsor Castle
is complete and accurate reconstruction.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: Madama Butterfly - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tragedy of sexual exploi-tation by Western travellers to the East seems
to be played out afresh for each generation. When television regularly beams
to our homes pictures of teenagers in prostitution, these days in Thailand
or the Philippines, it is hardly necessary to update the story of Madama
Butterfly as though in search of some hidden relevance.
Undeterred, the present Royal Opera production updates it anyway. (The
original producer, Nuria Espert, introduced costumes that suggest the period
around the Second World War.) Dressed in flimsy, flower-patterned trousers,
Yoko Watanabe's Madame Butterfly could easily have stepped out of a
television documentary, for she looks the very picture of the modern Eastern
Miss - and that despite 10 years service in this taxing role.
The marvel of Watanabe's performance is that it still looks so spontaneous.
Every expression tells; every movement affords another intimate insight into
her nave teenage bride of a Butterfly. The moment when she trustingly kisses
Pinkerton's letter brings a lump to the throat. When she hears the guns
announce his ship in the harbour, years of pent-up hopes and disappointments
flash across her face.
The whole of the final scene is most movingly played and by that point it
seems ungenerous to complain that the voice is no longer as freely produced
and beautiful as one would like. In vocal terms Puccini gave sopranos a
killer of a part to get through in this opera. Miss Watanabe's strength is
that she has learned, over the many times that she must have sung it, how to
save her stamina to make the maximum effect when it counts.
That is fortunate, as the present revival rests entirely on her delicate
shoulders. Arthur Davies, as Pinkerton, sounds less Italianate in Puccini
here than he did when he was singing down the road at the Coliseum. Malcolm
Donnelly's broad range of virtues makes his Royal Opera debut deserved, but
his Sharpless lacks individuality. There are a few bright spots among the
supporting cast, including John Dobson's bookish Goro and Yvonne Howard as a
Kate Pinkerton with presence - but not many.
They all have to struggle against orchestral playing too loud for the size
of the voices. Too fast, as well: Sian Edwards cuts 10 minutes off the
announced running time. If the idea was to stress the modern elements of
Puccini's style by bringing out the music's angular rhythms and percussive
drive, then it meets with only limited success. Those glowing Puccini
climaxes which should send a shiver down the spine fail to arrive.
Altogether, there is little warmth here. The combination of harsh orchestral
sounds and the production's grimy setting, which has Butterfly living in a
crowded 20th-century tenement block far from the traditional flower-covered
hills overlooking Nagasaki, has put the opera down in a hostile milieu. To
that extent the performance is, at least, all of a piece.

FT  30 NOV 92 / People: Sir Archibald Forster retires from Esso
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Archibald Forster is to retire as chairman and chief executive of oil
company Esso next February, when he reaches the age of 65.
His successor - subject to election by the Esso board - is expected to be
Keith Taylor, currently managing director of Esso Exploration and
Production.
Sir Archibald was described by one Esso insider as a 'thoroughly
professional oilman, who was probably never more comfortable than when he
was out on the ground, talking to employees'.
He has been in the top job since 1979, and so has guided the company through
the peak of North Sea production, the oil price crash of 1986, and the
transition of the North Sea into a mature oil and gas province.
He is said to have been instrumental in persuading Geoffrey Howe, then
chancellor of the exchequer, to ease, in the 1983 Budget, what was
considered to be the 'penal' fiscal regime under which the UK oil industry
was operating. He will also be remembered for the skilful way in which he
put Esso's case to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into petrol
pricing in 1989, which concluded that the petrol market was fully
competitive.
He joined Esso in 1951 at the Fawley refinery in Hampshire, and became
refinery manager at Milford Haven, Wales, before returning to Fawley as
refinery manager in 1964. After a spell as logistics director of Esso UK he
left for the US where he filled a variety of posts at Exxon, the parent
corporation.
He returned to London as vice-president of Esso Europe in 1975, and became
managing director of Esso UK three years later. Sir Archibald is a former
president of the Institute of Chemical Engineers and of the Institute of
Petroleum. He is a non-executive director of Midland Bank and, recently, of
Trafalgar House.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Management: Old-timers who slow the pace of corporate change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managing change is rightly identified as one of the key competitive issues
for manufacturing industry in the 1990s, but are UK companies getting it
right?
A survey by Ingersoll Engineers, the UK consultancy, suggests that
manufacturers understand the importance of the issue, and know the key
ingredients for success - but are not yet using all of them as effectively
as they might.
Ingersoll's fourth annual survey, Commitment: Implementing the Vision*,
comes a year after it accused operating managers of approaching change too
timidly, perhaps for external reasons such as uncertainty over company
ownership.
This year, Ingersoll looks at the internal workings of manufacturing
industry and its approach to change, with the help of 200 managing directors
or chief executives, operating directors, manufacturing directors or general
managers.
The survey found broad agreement on the five success factors for managing
change: vision, strategy, implementation, communications and behavioural
issues. But it discovered that managers do not give the five factors equal
importance.
While vision and strategy were seen as 'very important' by managing
directors, their commitment wanes as the process moves towards planning,
measurement and implementation. This lack of commitment has two important
effects.
First, responsibility for implementing change is delegated to people
'learning on the job' - skilled line managers rather than 'change managers'.
Only 55 per cent of change programmes use task forces or specialist
resources, and then only in part, the survey finds.
Second, and worse still, implementing the programme is delegated typically
to those groups perceived as most resistant to change - among middle
managers, administrators and supervisors in particular.
Among these groups, says Brian Small, Ingersoll's managing director, will be
found people who see themselves as 'guardians' of the company, employees of
long standing, who know the importance of the company to their family and
their town, and do not want to see a new MD ruining everything - and then
being promoted after three years.
But the 'guardians' are not negative, says Small. They are simply cautious.
The trouble is, they are not informed early enough about the change
programme - in some 40 per cent of cases supervisors are not told until the
start of implementation.
Winning the commitment seen as key to the five success factors, therefore,
depends on better organisation to manage change. 'Detailed planning and
implementation is not yet a high enough priority nor a sufficiently
developed skill while communication still leaves much to be desired,' says
Ingersoll.
And the evidence for that comes from the MDs themselves. The four most
difficult problems in change programmes are seen as changing people's
behaviour, keeping to schedule, dedicating adequate resources and motivating
people. So Ingersoll has 'six pointers' for MDs facing a change programme.
Your help will be needed by the team throughout, not just with vision and
strategy.
Recognise that you will need to build sophisticated new project management
skills.
Communicate as a priority - as early as you can.
Everybody will absorb the changes at their own rate. Everybody must 'buy in'
and become involved; encourage the dialogue that makes this happen.
Before starting, be sure your implementers are fully committed.
To win commitment, ensure you have a meticulous plan.
*Ingersoll Engineers, Bourton Hall, Rugby, Warwickshire, CV23 9SD.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Management: Low marks for training / A look at why many
managers are dissatisfied with the courses they attend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most big organisations attempt to provide some sort of training for their
managers, either in-house or bought-in. Always done with good intention, it
can be both extremely expensive and conspicuously ineffective.
Very frequently, the people who plan or pay for the training are
disappointed because the results are not what they expected. Is this because
their expectations are inappropriate, the training methods are flawed, or
their managers are untrainable?
The first problem lies in determining the goals of management training.
These may be general or specific; implicit or explicit; realistic or
unrealistic; achievable or impossible; measurable or simply determined by
gut-feel; trackable or not.
Most management training is about the acquisition of some skill - technical
or interpersonal - though it could also be about insight and increasing
sensitivity. As such, the training is often, but certainly not always,
modestly successful. The question, however, remains why the skill is not
retained between the classroom and the office.
Apart from skill acquisition, management training can offer other benefits.
Courses allow people from different parts of the organisation to network, to
compare and contrast and to establish lateral links. It may be an expensive
way of bringing people together but it can be very effective, particularly
if trainees are required to operate in competitive teams or undergo
outward-bound-type dangers.
Courses can also help to change the culture of an organisation, either
deliberately or not. Taught similar skills, or even concepts and terms,
employees develop into a more homogenous body who, despite the fact that
they have different functions and expertise, seek a common language.
Some courses may also be perceived as a perk for those attending, not
because it is time away from the daily grind, but rather because they
acquire some valuable and transportable skills. In this sense, management
training facilitates career development and may be seen by employees as
positive.
But most organisations have a training department, or bring in consultants,
to make their staff more efficient and effective. A laudable aim but
frequently unfulfilled. Why? The following are some of the reasons why many
management training courses fail to deliver enough bang for the (frequently
large) bucks.
The goals of the course are unattainable. Some skills are easier to train
than others; many are not acquired easily; most take lots of practice. What
can one realistically expect from a three-, five- or even 14-day course?
Consider how long it takes to master a language or to become fully computer
literate. Short, sharp shock courses may get one started, but need extensive
post-course back-up, if skills are to be retained.
The teaching method is inappropriate. Not all skills can or should be taught
in the same way. There should be a balance between instruction, practice and
feedback. Not everybody likes to be taught in the same way. The preferred
pace of instructions is also important. Most people who attend like to be
entertained by a jovial, story-telling consultant. But do they learn
anything?
The skills are not practised. However steep the learning curve, unless the
newly-acquired skills are continually practised they decline substantially
afterwards.
The skills are not necessary and inappropriate. Though the insight, language
and skills acquired may be interesting, they are not strictly relevant to
the trainee's job.
The corporate culture discourages the use of skills. Although the
organisation may be eager for employees to use a particular skill or way of
behaving, the strong corporate norms inhibit or even punish it. The skills
learned, then, are never used and it is the course that takes the blame. The
skills were never really acquired on the course. True skill acquisition take
effort and can be hard work. Some trainers prefer a rather old-fashioned
chalk-and-talk routine where they are in control. Things can look easy from
the participants' point of view and they may bluff themselves that they have
accepted the skills, but in reality they have not.
The skills are not easily transferable. The atmosphere and context within
which one acquires a skill may be very different from that in which it is
supposed to be practised. This makes skill transfer less probable and
certainly less easy, and may account for the course 'failure'.
The training tasks and situations are unlike the 'real world' situation. The
more similar the practice and the real situation the better the transfer of
skills and vice versa. Are plush country hotels or well-equipped training
centres similar to office environment or not?
Using high-trust, low-threat 'learning environments', many middle-management
courses focus on personal renewal and the development of skills. These
courses play an important (even life-changing) role in their participants'
personal and professional lives.
Then a typical scenario emerges. After the course the change participants
return to their organisation. Because no one else from the organisation was
on the course the ex-participant gets little reward for their experience.
Any notions about change and new ideas are knocked out of their minds by
daily tasks and problems. As a result many participants report that
frustration with their inability to affect their organisations any more than
they were before they attended the course.
Training courses work in the sense that learning occurs and is retained
under specific conditions. People must want to learn and attend the course:
one volunteer is worth 10 conscripts.
People need reinforcement and rewards for skill acquisition, not being
ignored, despised or punished. Practice of skills is imperative and needs to
be distributed over time.
Personnel magazines are full of residential training course advertisements.
They promise the earth and a fully changed individual - motivated, full of
insight, skilled and enthusiastic.
Often the persona who returns after a training course is exhausted, over-fed
and a bit bewildered. Training courses can change peoples' lives but not in
ways always anticipated by those well- meaning employers who send them on
the course.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Chief scorns critics of his Pounds 6m pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER WOOD, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line
Insurance subsidiary, yesterday pre-empted criticism of his Pounds 6m-plus
pay this year. 'The only people who will complain are ill-informed moaning
minnies,' he said.
Confirming that he was paid more than Pounds 6m in the year to September, Mr
Wood said he might earn a similar sum in each of the next two years.
Mr Wood, whose remuneration of Pounds 285,000 basic salary and a Pounds 6m
bonus payment is thought to make him the highest-paid British employee, said
he deserved the reward because of the rapid growth of the company, which he
had founded. He became a main board director of Royal Bank of Scotland this
summer.
The formula governing Mr Wood's bonus links his earnings to the rise in the
insurance subsidiary's value. He said that its rapid growth might give him
similar earnings for the next two years but they would fall after that.
Mr Wood said he would try to maintain his earnings by forming a company
called Direct Line Financial Services which would sell mortgages and
personal loans by telephone in the same manner as Direct Line Insurance.
'I started something from scratch, and I have satisfied my customers, my
staff and shareholders,' he said. The suggestion that it was wrong to earn
this amount was equivalent to 'saying that we ought to become like the
former Soviet Union'. He was talking openly about his earnings because he
regarded them as being fair.
If the net value of the company grows more than 12 per cent in a financial
year, Mr Wood will receive a bonus of one percentage point of the additional
increase in value. He earned Pounds 1.84m under the formula in the year to
September 1991.
Mr Wood founded Direct Line Insurance in 1985 and sold his 25 per cent stake
to Royal Bank of Scotland for a reduced price in 1988 in return for the
earnings formula. The subsidiary has 700,000 motor and 200,000 house
insurance policies.
He said the subsidiary was selling 50,000 motor and 8,000 house policies a
month. He would be 'very disappointed' if the company's net value was less
than Pounds 400m at year-end next September.
The bank is to announce its full-year results to September 30 this week. It
is thought to have disclosed Mr Wood's earnings earlier so that they did not
distract attention from the figures.

FT  30 NOV 92 / OFT set to limit ITV rights to programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading is expected this week to recommend strict limits
on the time during which ITV companies can hold the UK rights to programmes
made by independent producers.
ITV said it wanted to hold UK rights to programmes it had funded for 10
years with an option for a further five years.
The OFT is expected to decide that ITV should hold the UK rights to an
independent production for only around five years.
ITV has told the OFT it is willing to give up its 15-year proposal in favour
of individual negotiations on every project, but that offer is likely to be
rejected.
The OFT is also expected to favour independent producers having the option
of being commissioned directly by the network centre.
However, the position on rights could be complicated by an EC draft
directive which suggests giving primacy on rights to programmes to their
authors and directors rather than to the production companies or
broadcasters.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Companies look beyond perks ruling: How a decision in the
Lords will affect staff benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES are taking a fresh look at the perks they give their employees
following a landmark ruling in the House of Lords on Thursday.
Most companies will be relieved because the judgment - much to the Inland
Revenue's surprise - went in favour of the taxpayer. But much uncertainty
over the implications remains.
The case of Pepper vs Hart concerned 10 teachers from Malvern College who
argued that they should be assessed only for tax on any difference between
the reduced fees they paid for their own children to attend the school and
the marginal or extra cost of providing this education - to cover books,
laundry and food.
The Revenue argued that tax should be paid on any difference between the
fees and the average cost of providing the education. If the revenue had won
there would have been big implications for employee benefits.
The ruling has no effect on some perks which are dealt with under separate
rules and guidelines, including subsidised staff canteens and company cars.
But it has great significance for many, not least reduced-rate education for
teachers' children at other fee-paying schools.
Many London-based employers who offer subsidised or free sports facilities
will be affected. So will travel companies and tour operators offering
reduced-rate travel, lawyers providing conveyancing, manufacturers selling
products at a discount, restaurants offering meals to staff and companies
with executive dining rooms.
Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield from accountants Touche Ross says it might also
have an impact on shareholders in some companies who receive benefits in
return for their investment as though they were employees.
A survey in October of more than 1,500 companies by accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick showed that 18 per cent of employers provided goods or services as a
benefit to their employees at less than average cost and that 16 per cent
provided sports and social facilities. Ten per cent of the companies said
they would withdraw some perks if Pepper vs Hart was decided in the
Revenue's favour.
British Airways offers staff concessionary travel for as little as 10 per
cent of the full fare. It was one of a number of companies and professional
firms to contribute to the fighting fund backing the Malvern teachers'
appeal.
Mr Clive Tulloch from Coopers &amp; Lybrand stressed that companies with
benefits in which the marginal cost exceeds the average cost will suffer as
a result of the judgement. That will include executives employing company
gardeners or chauffeurs at anti-social times such as weekends, when they
would be paid overtime above their normal rates.
The law lords' judgment for the first time allowed ministerial debate before
legislation to be considered alongside the letter of the law. That opens a
new line of legal attack for appeals in many types of case, and has big
implications for lawyers and accountants who will now have to consult
Hansard as well as the statute book.
But the ruling leaves many questions unanswered. The first question is
whether there is any recourse for companies which, under pressure from the
Inland Revenue, have used average cost as the benchmark.
Mr Brian Friedman, head of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said: 'Those companies
which have already settled are going to feel pretty sick.'
The second question is the continued uncertainty of how to calculate
marginal cost. BA - which recently reached a settlement with the Revenue on
its fares until April - is uncertain how to work out the costs of these
fares.
The third and most important question is how long the new procedures will be
in place. The Revenue appears to have been taken by surprise by the ruling.
Now it must clarify its position. It may well consider new legislation is
needed explicitly to require average costs to be used in future.
Next year there will be two budgets when the Revenue could propose this. It
has promised a statement shortly.
No Revenue press release is likely to be scrutinised more closely.

FT  30 NOV 92 / New fears raised over coal jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY ABOUT a third of the 31 threatened British Coal pits would be saved
even if the most radical measures to boost demand for UK coal were adopted,
one of its senior executives said last night.
Mr Andrew Horsler, director general of marketing, said the most radical
measures could provide a market of 50m tonnes. That compares with 40m tonnes
which British Coal has tentatively agreed to sell the electricity generators
next year and 30m in the following four years.
On the BBC2 Money Programme, Mr Horsler said that if 50m tonnes could be
achieved it would result in 10 to 12 of the 31 threatened pits being saved.
His estimates underline the difficulties the government will have in
formulating an energy policy which saves enough coal jobs to satisfy MPs and
the public.
Separately, further opposition has emerged among the regional electricity
companies to suggestions that the government should delay a planned increase
in competition in the industry to make room for a bigger coal market.
Seeboard, serving Kent, Surrey and the Sussex area, has told MPs inquiring
into energy policy that deferring liberalisation would strengthen the
position of the two main electricity generators and frustrate customer
expectations of increased choice of supplier.
Last week suggestions by Southern Electric to the Commons energy committee
that liberalisation could be postponed to allow electricity companies to buy
an extra 15m tonnes of coal a year on medium-term contracts were criticised
by Eastern Electricity. It had been assumed that most other regional
electricity companies would accept such a solution, in part because of fears
about the effects of increased competition.
Under the plans the competitive part of the market, which is restricted to
large companies, would be open to medium-sized companies in 1994. In 1998
all customers, including households, would be able to choose from which
company to buy electricity supplies.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, strongly supports
increased competition and some believe his position would be untenable if
liberalisation plans were modified significantly.
For this reason some regional electricity companies would be happier with a
compromise.
East Midlands Electricity has applied to the Department of Trade and
Industry for a licence to supply regional customers with a range of
telecommunications services.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Hope for house sales in new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited recovery in house sales is expected to begin next year even
though prices may continue to fall for a further 12 months, securities house
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew says today, Andrew Taylor writes.
P&amp;D predicts the number of sales could rise by as much as 15 per cent next
year. But prices are unlikely to rise and could fall by up to a further 5
per cent, housing analyst Mr John Wriglesworth said. Prices were unlikely to
recover until the overhang of 225,000 unsold empty homes was taken up.
It is the third forecast in less than a week to predict a rise in sales.
Fixed-rate mortgages accounted for more than a fifth of advances for house
purchases in the second quarter of this year, the Council of Mortgage
Lenders said.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Tarnished Lamont starts to lose support: Talk among Tories
about a successor is spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN POLITICS, image counts for as much as substance. So the political damage
inflicted on Mr Norman Lamont by the disclosure that the Treasury helped to
pay one of his personal legal bills has little to do with the merits of the
argument.
As the weekend reports about the chancellor's financial affairs dealt
another public relations blow to the government, the view among senior
Conservatives was that Mr Lamont's image had been badly tarnished.
The hardening consensus was that Mr John Major should move him from the
Treasury in a new-year cabinet reshuffle. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary,
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, were being cited as front-runners for his job.
No one was suggesting that Mr Lamont had broken the rules by accepting the
Pounds 4,000 payment towards a Pounds 23,000 bill incurred after he
discovered 18 months ago that the tenant in his Notting Hill house was a
self-styled sex therapist.
The contribution had been approved by Treasury officials who had judged that
it matched the expenses he had incurred directly as a result of his public
office. The taxpayers' contribution covered the initial handling of press
inquiries, not the subsequent legal bill to evict the tenant.
According to senior Whitehall insiders Mr Lamont had not asked for the
money. Instead it had been offered after his officials judged that
protecting the reputation of the chancellor was a legitimate public expense.
The payment had been approved both by Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent
secretary, and by Sir Terence Burns, his successor. An explanation of the
expenditure had been sent to the National Audit Office.
Whatever the proprieties, ministerial colleagues acknowledged yesterday that
Mr Lamont had made a serious political misjudgment. They queried also
whether he should have accepted the generosity of the anonymous Conservative
benefactors who paid the remainder of the legal costs.
The timing could not have been worse. A few days earlier the disclosures
about Mr Lamont's credit-card record had indicated that the chancellor had
been repeatedly behind in meeting his repayments. Taken together the two
events conveyed an image of a chancellor living beyond his means, a bon
viveur charged with stewardship of the nation's finances but careless about
his own.
As one minister put it last night: 'Accepting taxpayers' money does not say
much for his judgment.'
In more tranquil times Mr Lamont might have been able to brush off the
controversy. But two years of deepening economic gloom and the
disintegration on September 16 of the government's economic strategy with
sterling's withdrawal from the ERM have seriously undermined his reputation.
Neither the Conservative party nor the electorate are in a forgiving mood.
Mr Lamont's position had been underpinned by his support on the right of the
party. A Euro-sceptic, he has made clear that he is in no hurry to take
sterling back into the ERM. But this weekend his admirers were beginning to
question whether, with Mr Lamont at the Treasury, the government could hope
to re-ignite the consumer and industrial confidence central to its hopes of
economic recovery.
There are signs of strain between Mr Major and Mr Lamont. The prime
minister's friends have made clear that the economic recovery package in
this month's Autumn Statement was a source of friction between the two men.
The chancellor is said to have sought to trim Mr Major's ambitions.
Mr Lamont has told his allies that he has an assurance from the prime
minister that his position is secure, but the relationship between the two -
the most important in the government - is businesslike rather than friendly.
Nor is Mr Lamont's reputation high within the Treasury. He is judged to lack
the intellectual clout - and capacity for hard work - of some of his
predecessors.
Some senior Conservatives were saying last night that Mr Major might yet
seek to avoid until the summer a reshuffle that would anger Tory
Euro-sceptics. The government is already faced with the prospect of a series
of backbench revolts against the Maastricht bill. To move Mr Clarke or Mr
MacGregor - both prominent pro-Europeans - to the Treasury could increase
the number of potential rebels. Mr Howard, the most junior candidate, alone
among the front-runners shares Mr Lamont's instincts on Europe and the ERM.
Mr Clarke, widely acknowledged to be the most powerful minister in Mr
Major's cabinet, has by far the strongest claim to the chancellorship. Mr
Lamont could be moved to the Home Office or, in a wider reshuffle, to
defence.
Mr Major is a cautious politician but he may have to take the risk. After
the traumas of the past few months he and his government need above all to
demonstrate that they have re-established a grip.
Putting Mr Clarke in 11 Downing Street could do it.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Smith to seek overhaul of 'creaking constitution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, opposition leader, is to urge a new relationship between
government and citizens as part of a Labour policy on what he calls
Britain's 'creaking constitution'.
In a speech to be made either before Christmas or in the new year he will
address what he sees as growing public disenchantment with the 'elective
dictatorship' and with what is seen as arrogance from ministers in their
exercise of power.
Mr Smith believes the handling of the pit closures was just one recent
example among many of disquiet among voters at the lack of consultation
between governors and governed. Another was the so-called Iraqgate
disclosures over the sales of machinery with military end-uses to Iraq.
Labour is already committed to a freedom of information act, a bill of
rights and reform of the House of Lords. Mr Smith is expected to add new
proposals on increasing the accountability of politicians to the public and
parliament.
These could include new powers for Commons committees to inquire into the
actions of government departments and measures to apply the European
Community's subsidiarity principle to the devolution of powers from
Whitehall to the regions. The Maastricht treaty was 'the best deal on
offer', Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, said yesterday.
But he refused to pledge Labour's support for the third reading of the Bill
to ratify the treaty.
Leftwing Labour MPs are showing unease at the party leadership's European
policy. They argue in a paper published by the 100-strong Tribune group that
Labour should support a federal Europe and take a much more active role in
pushing for a more democratically accountable EC.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Strong money supply figures fuel optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY ECONOMISTS are optimistic that strong money supply figures to be
published by the Bank of England today will point towards a revival in
consumer demand.
Weekly money supply statistics already released by the Bank suggest that M0,
the narrow measure of money supply and a good guide to overall demand, grew
by about 3 per cent in the year to November. This is the highest annual
growth rate for any month this year and compares with growth of 2.4 per cent
in the 12 months to October and 2.1 per cent in the year to September.
Release of the M0 figure used to occur about two weeks after the end of the
month in question. It has been brought forward to the end of the relevant
month to coincide with publication of the Treasury's new monthly assessment
of the economy.
Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, described the rise in
the growth of narrow money as 'significant'. 'There has been this ceiling of
2.5 per cent which the M0 figure has not been able to break through so far
this year,' he said.
The news will provide a glimmer of hope on prospects for UK growth, but
comes at a time when assessments of the economy remain predominantly gloomy.
It will hearten Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who at the weekend urged
home-owners and businesses to have confidence about the future.
He said at a meeting of the Conservative Political Centre, a party
discussion group, at Conservative Central Office in London: 'While economic
conditions have been difficult, I now believe there are a number of reasons
why confidence should grow.'
He said cuts in interest rates, plus rises in real incomes combined with
income tax reductions in the Budget meant that real take-home pay for
someone on an average income with a typical mortgage had increased by Pounds
37 a week.
Hotels, catering and business services will be among the first UK industries
to feel the benefits of devaluation, a report says today.
Cambridge Econometrics, the research group, says the devaluation of
sterling, which is expected to average 15 per cent next year compared with
this year's rates, will contribute to overall export growth of more than 6
per cent next year and in 1994.
The report says industries relatively dependent on the US will benefit more
quickly as economic growth in Europe slows down.
Business services, 'already a competitive UK industry', will experience
rapid growth in exports as national markets open up.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Warning of 3.25m jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people unemployed and claiming benefit will continue to rise
until at least the spring of 1994, the independent Employment Institute has
warned.
By then, it says, almost 3.25m people will be unemployed compared with the
current 2.8m.
The institute, a research and consultancy body, analyses the chancellor's
Autumn Statement in a report and says a clear flaw in the package was the
failure to do more to help the unemployed, particularly those out of work
for more than 12 months.
It adds that the government's decision to offer more opportunities on job
search programmes was welcome but not enough. It questions the funding of
programmes for the adult unemployed - Employment Training, the main training
scheme, and Employment Action, the work experience scheme, have been
combined. The new scheme, to be called Training for Work, will have a budget
of Pounds 936m in 1993-94 - Pounds 40m less than is being spent on ET and EA
this year.
Training places should have been expanded. 'This is the ideal time to
re-skill the unemployed and help reduce the skill bottlenecks which fuel
inflation and which will inevitably occur when the economy begins to grow
more rapidly.'
The institute says skill bottlenecks will be only one of the supply-side
problems.
It points out that although unemployment is rising the Department of
Employment's budget will be a third lower in real terms in 1993 than in
1987-88, when unemployment was falling.

FT  30 NOV 92 / InterCity's passenger's Charter fails to meet required
levels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S InterCity sector is set to end the first year of the
Passenger's Charter with all seven of its 'routes' (groups of lines) failing
to meet the required levels of punctuality, reliability or both.
Three of its routes - Anglia, West Coast and Cross Country - are falling so
far short of their punctuality targets that they look likely to trigger 5
per cent discounts for passengers renewing season tickets.
Two more routes - Midland Main Line and Gatwick Express - are performing so
poorly on reliability that these, too, look likely to trigger 5 per cent
discounts.
The Great Western and East Coast routes are also failing to meet one or both
targets. In neither case, however, does the margin reach the level necessary
to trigger discounts.
InterCity says the targets it has been set are unrealistic because they
require all routes to perform to the standards of punctuality and
reliability regardless of whether they have been modernised. It wants
separate targets for each route. The government has rejected the idea
because the result would be a softening of targets for most lines, and
ministers are not prepared to concede a relaxation of the Passenger's
Charter.

FT  30 NOV 92 / BR compensation likely to be limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
COMMUTERS on British Rail's Network SouthEast services are likely to find
that only one - if any - of the network's 15 routes will have performed
badly enough by the end of the year to trigger compensation under the
Passenger's Charter in the form of discounts for season tickets.
The results are likely to bring criticisms that the performance targets,
which vary from one Network SouthEast route to another according to the
investment they have received, are too easy.
The only route likely to make a pay-out this year is the Kent Coast line
which is failing to get the required 82 per cent of peak-hour trains to
their destination within five minutes of the scheduled time. So far this
year it has managed only 78.5 per cent.
Network SouthEast said reasons for the route's poor performance included
preparations for the Channel tunnel as well as train failures and leaves on
the line.
If its performance fails to improve, commuters using the route will get a 5
per cent discount on the renewal price of their season tickets. But if the
line can bring punctuality to within 3 percentage points of the target in
the last few weeks of the year, it will still avoid having to pay
compensation.
Network SouthEast said the purpose of the targets was to improve the
performance of the railway, not to hand out cash. The fact that
season-ticket discounts were unlikely to be triggered indicated that the
targets were achieving their objective.
The government points to the performance of lines such as the rundown route
between London and Tilbury and Southend in Essex, which, although it has a
punctuality target of only 80 per cent, is actually achieving 90.3 per cent.
Ministers say this supports the belief that performance is as much a matter
of organisation and management as of investment. They are therefore likely
to set much tougher targets for all lines next year including the
under-invested ones. Five of the 24 Regional Railways routes will give
discounts to season ticket holders if their performance does not improve by
the end of the year. They are Cross Country; East Midlands and Lincs; West
Midlands; Cardiff Valleys; and North East services.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Bucking the trend: Furnishing a surprising example - Neil
Buckley meets two brothers who prospered by not borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THRIVING furniture company is something of a rarity these days. To find
one in Essex, one of the counties worst-hit by the recession, is a double
surprise.
Essex Furniture, which specialises in making and selling three-piece suites,
brought some much-needed cheer to the business pages last month. For the
year to June the company saw turnover increase 52 per cent to Pounds 7.15m
and pre-tax profits increase 46 per cent to Pounds 727,000.
UK furniture sales rose 5.5 per cent last year. Essex Furniture achieved
like-for-like growth of about 28 per cent. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax
profits for this year of Pounds 1m.
The philosophy that has enabled Mr Michael Franks, chairman, and his brother
Martin, the chief executive, to achieve this success can perhaps be summed
up in one phrase: a desire to be masters of their own destiny.
Two important decisions underpinned that philosophy. The first was to give
up selling to the trade and instead to retail directly to the public. The
second was never to borrow money.
Mr Michael Franks says: 'A lot of companies that borrowed heavily in the 80s
now spend 75 per cent of their time working out how they are going to
service the debt. We spend our whole time thinking about how to expand the
business.'
The brothers began helping in their father's furniture workshop in
Shoreditch, east London, when they were still in their teens.
By the 1970s the business had become Shoebury Upholstery, with factories in
Shoeburyness, Essex, and Scotland. In 1972 it went bankrupt.
The brothers say it was a shattering but important experience which helped
instil their suspicion of borrowing.
The brothers and their father decided to try again with Essex Furniture,
selling initially to the trade 'because that was what we knew'.
A second setback brought a change of tack. A trade customer went bankrupt
owing Essex Furniture large sums of money. The Franks experimented with
direct retailing.
On Friday afternoons they would lay out some of their finished goods in a
corner of their factory at Rochford, Essex, before delivering to retailers
and offering to duplicate and sell direct anything on show.
The local council stopped this because the factory was not designated a
retail zone. But in 1975 Essex Furniture rented a vacant 3,500 sq ft shop
near the factory and began selling only to the public. A second shop opened
at Grays, Essex, in 1977. Others were added every two or three years until,
in 1987, the brothers received an offer of a buy-out.
They rejected it, but began to consider how best they could expand the
company more rapidly. The boom years of the late 80s had tempted many
businesses to borrow heavily, but the brothers resisted.
They sought a flotation on the unlisted securities market, even though with
a market capitalisation of only Pounds 3.5m they were considerably smaller
than the average size for USM companies.
Essex Furniture was successfully floated in September 1989. This provided
the capital needed to expand the business as well as raising awareness of
the company. Since then the company has opened eight showrooms - five of
them outside Essex, trading under the name The Furniture Workshop - taking
the total to 14.
The company is now capitalised at Pounds 7m and employs nearly 800 people.
Essex Furniture took advantage of the weak property market to obtain
favourable terms for new showrooms. It also plans to open at least three
more showrooms next year, armed with Pounds 1.1m from a rights issue in
June.
Mr Michael Franks envisages that by 1996 there will be a chain of 20 to 30
stores as far as 200 miles from the factory and head office at Leigh-on-Sea,
Essex.
Part of the company's formula is to trade through showrooms of 10,000 sq ft
 -large enough to show an extensive range but intimate enough to avoid the
feel of a 'shed'. The company offers a number of standard designs but
customers choose from a range of fabrics from which curtains can also be
made to measure.
Another strategy is to hold no stocks, which cuts warehousing costs, and
manufacture only to order. Customers wait six to 10 weeks from paying their
deposit to receiving their furniture.
Mr Michael Franks says the company has had considerable success in ironing
out the peaks and the troughs of seasonal demand through carefully timed
marketing campaigns.
This does not fully answer the question of why consumers are flocking into
the company's showrooms in spite of the economic downturn. Mr Franks will
not reveal what he thinks the secret is.
'All I can say is that it's like two women going into the supermarket and
buying the same ingredients to bake a cake. The cakes will always taste
different. It's the way you put the ingredients together.'

POHANG Iron and Steel (Posco), South Korea's largest steelmaker, will
negotiate with China this week about its possible participation in the
construction of a Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) motorway between Beijing and
Hong Kong.
China is also seeking support from other Korean companies, including Dong Ah
Construction, and Japanese and Taiwanese partners.
Mr Park Tae-joon, honorary chairman of Posco, will hold talks with Shougang,
China's leading steelmaker, about forming a consortium. Posco is already
advising Shougang about construction of a cold-rolled steel mill. The
building of the 2,400km motorway would take at least a decade.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Age-old dilemma taxes Japan's Ministry of Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE SEA of scandal and profligacy which is Japan's pork barrel
politics, the Ministry of Finance is an island of conservatism and fiscal
rectitude. Its officials take their role as guardians of the government's
finances seriously and were unhappy about the size of the recent budget
package. The mere suggestion that it might be a little austere for the
Japanese government to be running a budget surplus as the economy slides
toward recession is enough to make their blood boil.
Not surprisingly, the Ministry of Finance prefers the world to take notice
of its central government budget balance. Even after the Y10,800bn (Pounds
57bn) package, the general government budget will be in surplus next year by
the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. But the central
government budget, as the latest OECD report on the Japanese economy
stresses, will be in deficit to the tune of 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1993. The
large discrepancy between the Japanese central and general government
budgets is explained by the social security fund, the revenues from which
are excluded from the central government budget, in contrast to the US where
they are included.
One reason for emphasising the central government deficit is politics. The
Ministry of Finance has bitter memories of the speed with which Japan's
politicians allowed the budget deficit to rise in the years following the
1974-1975 recession and the difficulty it subsequently had in bringing the
deficit down. The ministry has been fighting an economic guerrilla war to
prevent a return to fiscal profligacy.
Yet the ministry is also worried about the fiscal implications of Japan's
ageing population. The right-hand chart shows the projected dependency
ratios of the US, Japan and Germany over the next three decades. The US had
the steepest fall in its dependency in the 1960s and 1970s as the post-war
baby boom generation moved into the labour force. But Japan is expected to
have the largest rise as the baby-boomers move into retirement, and live
longer lives. By 2020, over half of the US population, but nearly two-thirds
of the Japanese will be either young or retired.
This helps explain why Japan has a higher personal sector savings rate than
the US or Europe. But Japan also has a national savings rate that is almost
twice as high as the US and UK, in part because the government is saving on
behalf of its future aged. The social security fund showed a surplus of 3.5
per cent of GDP this year compared to 0.9 per cent in the US. Japan's social
security fund assets are equivalent to over 50 per cent of Japanese GDP,
explaining how the Japanese government can have a gross debt of over 60 per
cent of GDP but a net debt ratio which is 5.4 per cent of GDP and falling,
compared to an OECD average of 33 per cent.
Does it make sense for the Japanese government to save in this way? Yes, say
the OECD and the Ministry of Finance. The health and pension needs of
Japan's ageing population could raise the ratio of non-interest spending by
30 per cent between 1990 and 2028, equal to 8 1/2 per cent of GNP. Unless
the government saves and repays debt in order to reduce the interest burden,
currently a little under 17 per cent of GDP, the general government budget
will move into structural deficit and taxes will have to rise.
The alternative to higher taxes in the future is higher taxes and lower
public spending today. But Japanese incomes per head are rising fast so
taxpayers in the year 2028 will be absolutely much better off. The problem
is that they will still have to pay a higher proportion of these higher
incomes in tax, something the ministry fears they will both resent and
oppose.
Yet the level of national savings will also determine how fast the Japanese
economy grows between now and then. A high national savings rate now means
more funds for domestic investment and more accumulated foreign assets.
We are all dead in the long run: but taxpayers in the US and UK may soon
find themselves lamenting the fact that every year the long run takes longer
to arrive.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Airliner flight tape 'missing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea said at the weekend that the flight data recorder tape of the
Korean airliner downed by a Soviet missile in 1983 was missing from the
aircraft's 'black box' President Boris Yeltsin delivered in Seoul two weeks
ago, writes John Burton.
The tape would help explain why the airliner strayed off course over
Sakhalin island before being shot down, killing all 269 people abroad. South
Korea's ambassador to Moscow is expected to seek an explanation for the
tape's absence.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Japan's defence budget likely to be reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE defence budget is likely to suffer its first cut in real terms
for 32 years under plans for the 1993 budget drawn up by the Finance
Ministry.
The Y4,700bn (Pounds 25bn) defence budget has become one of the main targets
for Finance Ministry cuts to finance higher investment in public works to
help to revive the flagging economy.
Although the main reason for the cut is the need to stimulate the economy,
it marks the long delayed impact of the end of the Cold War on Japanese
defence policy.
The planned cuts in the 1993 budget are likely to lead to a review of the
medium-term defence spending plan, adopted in 1990, which envisaged real
growth in the defence budget of 3 per cent a year between 1991 and 1995.
Defence spending in Japan has had a privileged status despite the country's
constitution which limits the role of its forces to providing a minimum
level of national self-defence.
Between 1961 and 1979 defence spending grew at an average of about 14 per
cent a year. In the 1980s the growth slowed but was always more than 5 per
cent a year. Last year's budget rose by 3.6 per cent and this year the
defence forces have called for a 3.8 per cent increase in spending.
The Self Defence Agency is fighting a fierce rearguard action against the
Finance Ministry which is believed to have proposed the budget should be cut
to below 1992 levels. A senior SDA official said: 'We will never accept zero
growth.'
The debate should come to a head in the second week in December.
The SDA says Japanese defence policy needs to reflect the strong growth of
defence spending in nearby South Korea and China. It also argues there is
limited room for cuts because about 80 per cent of the budget is made up by
staff costs or payments on contracts which have already been awared.
The SDA believes the budget will need to be expanded to respond to calls
from the US for Japan to carry a larger burden of the costs of US forces
stationed in Japan as well as international peace keeping operations.
The debate over the budget is complicated by negotiations between the
defence forces and the US government over plans for Japan to buy two Awacs
reconnaissance aircraft. A deal is likely to be made within the next few
months adding about Y120bn to the budget. This would make a significant
contribution to reducing Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with
the US.
Overall public spending is likely to grow by about 1 per cent to about
Y72,000bn. However spending on public works will rise by about 5 per cent to
about Y8,600bn. This will mainly be financed by cuts in current expenditure
on welfare programmes, which account for Y12,300bn and education (Y6,000bn)
as well as defence.
Despite the low growth in overall spending, Finance Ministry officials
describe the budget as supportive because they are maintaining spending
despite a drop of about Y5,000bn in tax revenues.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Central Asian republics join trade grouping
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE FORMER Soviet central Asian republics along with Afghanistan at the
weekend joined the Economic Co-operation Organisation (ECO), a grouping
which was established by Pakistan, Iran and Turkey to expand mutual trade
and business ventures.
The five are Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan. Tajikistan is also seeking ECO membership but was unable to send
a representative to the Islamabad ceremony.
Pakistani officials are optimistic that, with a total population of 300m,
the ECO member countries have a market which is sizeable enough to support
new initiatives. However, some western experts have expressed concern in
recent months over the rise of a new Islamic bloc after the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
Pakistani officials and representatives from other member countries who
attended the weekend meeting denied that the ECO would emerge as such a bloc
which would threaten other countries.
Mr Sheharyar Khan, the Pakistani foreign secretary, said: 'This is not an
Islamic bloc. This is an economic bloc. We are all Islamic countries but we
are focusing on economic co-operation'.

FT  30 NOV 92 / S African golf club attack leaves 4 dead

BLACK gunmen hurling hand grenades killed four whites and injured 17 other
people attending a South African wine-tasting party at the weekend, the
first significant incident of racial terrorism against whites since
negotiations began to end apartheid.
A government spokesman said South Africa was 'shocked and horrified' by the
attack, which took place at a golf club in the white Cape Province
settlement of King William's Town, as well as by other incidents in which 21
more people were killed at the weekend.
The golf club attack will deepen the mood of gloom which has set in among
whites as constitutional negotiations have faltered, and could provoke a
violent backlash from right-wing whites who oppose negotiations. Police
clearly fear such a backlash, and yesterday called for 'maximum restraint'
from the public.
Police have offered a R50,000 (Pounds 11,000) reward for information leading
to arrests in the golf club incident, much more than is normal for incidents
involving black victims.
The government official said the King William's Town attack, the murder of
four members of a white family in a robbery, and the deaths of 14 blacks in
other violence, introduced 'a harsh and discordant note' after recent
tentative signs of progress in negotiations. The African National Congress
(ANC) and the government are to meet later this week for the first formal
constitutional talks to be held for over six months.
Local ANC officials condemned the golf club attack, describing it as an
attempt by unidentified forces to foment violence in the region, which
includes the volatile black homeland of Ciskei.
Police said five attackers hurled grenades into the club's bar and dining
areas and started firing rounds with South African R-4 or R-5 automatic
rifles into guests, killing two white couples and wounding 17 people, mostly
whites.
'The scene was one of devastation. . .absolute carnage,' said Mr Ray Radue,
a member of parliament for the ruling National party who attended the
function, held at the town's multi-racial golf club. Mr Nelson Mandela, the
ANC president, yesterday assured South Africa's white soldiers, policemen
and civil servants they would not be cast aside by a new non-racial
democratic government, Reuter adds from Mamelodi, Transvaal.
'No-one will be thrown into the street, existing contracts will be
respected,' he said.
In the same speech he acknowledged that ANC guerrillas were being given
military training in Asian and western countries. He said he had kept the
government fully informed.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Aid workers in Somalia fear US show of force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED Nations officials considering new relief measures for Somalia have
been warned that large-scale US intervention could jeopardise aid workers in
the country.
Aid organisations battling against Somalia's famine have prepared evacuation
plans, fearing reports that large-scale US military intervention will make
foreign staff targets of Somali gunmen seeking hostages.
Virtually all relief organisations have said they would pull out of Somalia
while troop deployment took place to avoid the risk of being attacked by
racketeers, who are angry at losing their grip on the 'aid business'.
The White House confirmed on Friday that the US administration had concluded
that 'some form of military activity' involving US troops was the only way
to assure the security of relief supplies to Somalia.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the spokesman, said in Maine, where President George
Bush is on vacation, that it was premature to speculate on troop deployments
at this stage. Critical decisions have first to be reached in the United
Nations Security Council, which has been holding meetings to discuss a
Somali operation.
Somalia's two main warlords have cautiously welcomed reports of the US offer
to help the UN protect food convoys and ensure aid reaches the needy.
However aid workers with long experience of Somalia are sure armed gangs,
only loosely controlled by warlords, would attack UN troops.
Washington is aware of the relief agencies' concerns that their staff in
Somalia may be placed at greater risk by even the talk of outside military
intervention.
However, it has concluded that the alternative would be to invite even
greater criticism that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian
catastrophe.
There has been a fundamental shift in the Defence Department's previously
firmly held view that Somalia was unpropitious territory for the engagement
of US forces.
At a National Security Council meeting last Wednesday, neither Mr Dick
Cheney, defence secretary, nor Gen Colin Powell, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, raised objections to the State Department proposal that as
many as 30,000 US troops be offered to a UN force.
However this force is composed, the US military still wants to ensure that
its contingent remains under US command. This reflects its new belief that
looters controlled by various Somali warlords do not pose a serious military
threat.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, briefed
President-elect Bill Clinton last week on the new US approach and reported
that Mr Clinton fully supported greater US engagement.
Mr Larry Eagleburger, acting secretary of state, has been in touch with
governments in Europe and in the region, to drum up support for
intervention. The case for this has grown stronger with the presentation of
evidence that as much as 70 per cent of the international relief supplies
reaching Somalia have been purloined and redirected to the broader African
black market in food.

<TEXT>
THE arrival of an aircraft loaded with 93 Venezuelan military in the
Amazonian town of Iquitos late on Friday has posed a delicate diplomatic
problem for the Peruvian government.
Gen Francisco Visconti the group's senior officer, claimed they fled
Venezuela in danger of their lives. They had chosen to seek asylum in Peru
because of 'links of brotherhood which unite our people'.
Diplomats and constitutionalists in Lima say that, on humanitarian grounds,
the rebels could hardly be sent back to Venezuela. Granting them asylum,
however, would further strain tense relations between the two countries.
One solution might be to move the Venezuelans on to a third country,
possibly Chile.
Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Peru immediately after
President Alberto Fujimori's April 5 coup and Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez has been one of the regime's most severe critics. As a result
of last week's elections, however, relations were likely to be normalised
soon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Andres Perez said in a televised speech yesterday that he
would not resign as a result of the failed attempt to topple his government,
saying such a move would only 'precipitate chaos and tragedy in Venezuela'.
Officials stressed that state and local elections would take place as
scheduled on December 6, and that registered candidates and political
parties could hold public rallies. All other public meetings are still
banned under the government's emergency powers.
The government has arrested about 500 officers and 800 soldiers from
different branches of the armed forces for participating in Friday's failed
coup.
An estimated 170 people died during the unsuccessful rebellion, according to
Gen Ivan Dario Jimenez, the minister of defence. Of these, 140 were
civilians and included some 45 prisoners who died during a break-out from
Caracas jail.
Yesterday, according to some reports, a further 60 inmates at the
overcrowded jail were killed in a fresh riot. The Justice Ministry said 900
prisoners had now been moved.
Gen Jimenez indicated that while the attempted coup was led by elements of
the Venezuelan Air Force, members of the navy, national guard and army (the
latter to a very small extent) also participated.
The authorities have not yet identified civilians who played a leading role
in the uprising, except to say that they are 'subversives from the left'.
The government of President Perez, which faced a coup attempt nine months
ago in which an estimated 40 people died, is to use special provisions under
the Military Justice Code to bring those charged with military rebellion to
swift judgment, perhaps within a fortnight.
Army officers who led the February 4 rebellion have used delaying tactics to
stretch out their military trial, which is still receiving testimony from
witnesses and the accused.
While some of the coup leaders were captured by military units loyal to the
government, 93 officers and cadets escaped to Iquitos, Peru, in a Venezuelan
air force Hercules C-130 just before pro-government forces took control of
the country's main air force base in Maracay late on Friday.
Venezuela's minister of foreign affairs, retired general Fernando Ochoa
Antich, said the government would be seeking to extradite the officers and
recover the aircraft and weapons they carried with them.
Venezuela's capital was quiet yesterday, except for the detonation of faulty
bombs, dropped on La Carlota airport by rebel aircraft last Friday.
On Saturday, the day after the coup attempt, residents of the capital formed
long queues at food shops, but were frightened off the streets after an
unidentified helicopter strafed the presidential office complex in the
centre of Caracas.
Shooting also broke out between snipers, police and security forces near the
president's office, but this had ended by Saturday afternoon.
The Perez government has already begun to ease some of the emergency
measures introduced on Friday. The 6pm to 6am curfew has been reduced to
10pm to 5am, Maiquetia international airport outside Caracas has been
re-opened, and the Caracas Metro has begun operating a limited schedule.
However, the Ministry of Education announced that classes in state and
private schools would be cancelled until the day after the elections.
Meanwhile, Venezuelan journalists protested at the government's decision to
terminate normal news broadcasts by Radio Rumbos, the largest national radio
network. The station continues to be on the air, but is broadcasting only
music.

THE OPERATOR of the trans-Alaska pipeline has agreed to pay the state of
Alaska and the federal government Dollars 32m (Pounds 21m) to settle
outstanding lawsuits related to the 1989 oil spill off the Alaska coast by
the Exxon Valdez, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, a consortium of oil companies formed to
operate the pipeline, had been accused of failing to respond rapidly to the
Valdez spill.
Under the agreed settlement, the money paid out by Alyeska will be used to
build docks and warehouses to store equipment for the clean-up.
US authorities had previously settled their legal actions against Exxon,
which said last year it would pay a record Dollars 1bn fine in connection
with the Valdez disaster.
The state of Alaska is to receive Dollars 900m from Exxon, over 10 years, to
settle civil charges, while Exxon and its Exxon Shipping subsidiary have
agreed to pay a Dollars 150m fine to Alaska to settle criminal charges.

<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN President Itamar Franco has taken control of prices policy,
bringing under his direct purview all monthly adjustments for public sector
tariffs and medicines, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
The controversial decision, announced by presidential decree, means Mr
Franco will decide the prices of petrol, telephone calls, electricity,
rubber, interstate transport and sugar cane. These are now adjusted monthly
by a department of the Economy Ministry to reflect inflation (running at 26
per cent a month).
Mr Franco was concerned for the ability of Brazil's poor to afford basic
items and medicines. However, Petrobras, the state oil company, has been
losing Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) a day because of delays over price
increases. The pharmaceutical companies retort that it is impossible to make
medicines cheap enough for people who earn Pounds 33 a month.
The financial community fears the next step will be a return to full price
controls in an attempt to control inflation.

<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German Chancellor, yesterday vowed to combat right-wing
extremism as part of a two-pronged strategy aimed at reassuring the
country's 6m foreigners and restoring Germany's tarnished image abroad.
Mr Kohl, speaking on German radio just three days after the Interior
Ministry said it had banned the extreme right-wing Nationalist Front, said
the 'full force of the law would be applied' against those involved in
attacks on foreigners.
At the same time, the country's main tourist agencies yesterday carried
full-page advertisements in the main newspapers, condemning the attacks on
foreigners, and reassuring the international community that the country
remained a haven and home for foreigners.
Mr Kohl's interview followed a fresh attack on a refugee hostel in the
eastern German town of Eberswalde, in which 18 rooms inhabited by Bulgarian
and Romanian refugees were gutted by fire, and a weekend of anti-racism
demonstrations throughout Germany.
Yesterday, Israel issued its sharpest condemnation to date of the spate of
racist violence with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, calling on the
authorities to 'crush the head of the snake while it is small'.
An official statement issued after a long cabinet meeting in Jerusalem said
the Jewish state viewed with deep concern 'the phenomena of neo-Nazism,
racism and anti-Semitism'. It added: 'The government demands that the matter
be dealt with with the full severity of the law and that everything
necessary will be done to prevent these phenomena.'
The cabinet rejected demands from opposition MPs and one government member
that Jews from Israel and elsewhere should boycott Germany by refusing to
travel to the country. Instead, the statement expressed appreciation for
those in Germany who 'struggle against racism and anti-Semitism'.
But three MPs postponed indefinitely a trip to Germany scheduled for this
week in protest at Bonn's failure to take stronger action against neo-Nazi
violence.
Public opinion in Germany is rallying behind the government's pledge to curb
the rise of the far-right, though Mr Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic
Union and its Bavarian-based sister party, the Christian Social Union, have
been accused of reacting too slowly to extremism.
Efforts to contain the violence runs in parallel with talks by the main
political parties about how to amend the constitutional right to asylum,
which guarantees the right of any individual to seek political asylum in
Germany.
Talks at amending the constitution - which would speed the application
process, and at the same time restrict the right to entry under this article
 -were postponed yesterday.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the CDU'S parliamentary leader, yesterday said the
talks would resume on Wednesday.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Aid for Srebrenica after seven-month siege: Laura Silber
arrives with the UN convoy bringing relief to a Moslem stronghold in Bosnia

<TEXT>
WOMEN and children streamed down the hills in tears at the weekend as a
United Nations relief convoy brought the first outside help to the Moslem
stronghold of Srebrenica since the war erupted in Bosnia-Hercegovina in
April.
It brought food and clothing to 70,000 people surviving on maize, oats, and
potatoes in the ruins. 'We didn't dare to believe the Serbs would let you
come here. Thank God,' said 45-year-old Mrs Sabra Hasanovic.
Serb forces for seven months have besieged Srebrenica. As the convoy crossed
lines in Serb-held Bratunac, most Serbs spat and swore at the passing white
UN vehicles. Some black-clad women threw flowers.
As the convoy crossed the 2,000-yard no-man's-land into Srebrenica,
children, many barefoot, and women dressed in dimije, baggy Turkish-style
trousers, crowded the streets and jammed sagging balconies to welcome the
UN.
The Ukrainian UN armoured personnel carriers were forced to bulldoze a
Moslem barricade of burned-out buses to enter the town, nestled in the
mountains. Local officials said the population of 30,000 had more than
doubled, as Moslem refugees fled 'ethnic cleansing' by Serb forces elsewhere
in eastern Bosnia.
Moslem women told harrowing tales of treks to sanctuary in the besieged
town. 'My father-in-law hanged himself when he saw the Serbs had set fire to
his house. His wife dropped dead from the shock. Now I must take care of my
two children,' said Mrs Mera Kandjatorovic.
Potatoes boiled on a wood-burning stove in a kitchen she and five other
refugees now call home. 'We've covered the windows with plastic bags, but it
will soon be cold.' People have crowded into any rooms which have escaped
destruction. Stacks of wood piled outside every house are the only defence
against the harsh winter. Maize has replaced currency, but there is little
to buy.
The women and their thin children are terrified and hungry but the Bosnian
fighters are in good spirits. They vow to defend the town, whose centre was
burned out by Serbs when they briefly held it in April.
Mr Resup Naseroric, a local commander, said he did not hate his Serbian
neighbours. 'We are not fighting a jihad (holy war), but the Serbian side is
forcing us into one. We don't want it to be a religious war because there
are also people of Serbian nationality on our territory.'
Ironically, Mr Naseroric, 25, spent 4 1/2 years as a personal bodyguard of
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, widely seen as most responsible for
the war in Bosnia. Fighters cajoled the town's first visitors into giving
them cigarettes while others helped UN soldiers unload the 137 tonnes of
flour, beans and sugar.
Doctors at Srebrenica hospital were aghast that the convoy brought no
medicine. 'We have nothing. No medicine, no pain-killers,' complained Mr
Aziz Husic, one of five local doctors caring for 70 wounded. The UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Saturday said medicines would be
included on the next convoy, which could be as soon as next week.
But the UNHCR managed to reach Srebrenica only after months of negotiations
and a four-day stand-off at Bosnia's frontier with Serbia.
As winter sets in, Srebrenica waits for the siege to end. Mrs Hajruda
Hrustic said: 'This food will help. But it's not enough and maybe you will
never be allowed here again. Help us to leave this place, or we will starve
to death.'
Heavy fighting between Croat and Serb forces in north Bosnia was reported
yesterday near Loncari village, by a corridor linking Serb-held regions in
Croatia with Serbia, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. A ceasefire between the
two rivals was due to come into effect hours later.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will today press its 11 EC partners for further harmonisation of
asylum and immigration policies - in spite of claims that the proposed rules
break international law.
Faced with an influx of refugees from the ex-Yugoslav republics and eastern
Europe, immigration ministers meeting in London will consider plans to speed
the procedure for dealing with 'manifestly unfound-ed' applications for
asylum.
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Amnesty International and
the European Consultation on Refugees and Exiles have all condemned the
proposals. They claim member states are riding roughshod over existing
international conventions on human rights.
The organisations are also worried about the lack of public scrutiny of
intergovernmental negotiations on immigration policy, which take place
outside the EC framework.
Mr Johannes Van Der Klaauw, Amnesty's EC representative, said on Friday:
'The new rules do not adhere to the essential principles and safeguards -
the minimum standards for satisfactory (asylum) procedures.'
But Amnesty admitted that the fact that the EC would agree framework
'resolutions' rather than legally-binding rules limited the opportunities
for a legal challenge.
The London meeting, which will continue tomorrow, also provides the last
formal opportunity for EC immigration ministers to discuss whether to lift
internal EC border controls on people from January 1. Britain is determined
to retain controls, despite European Commission objections, but other member
states have also begun to voice doubts about removing all frontier checks so
soon.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, who will chair today's meeting,
told the European parliament last week there would be no general removal of
frontier controls on January 1, when the barrier-free European market should
be declared open.
The recent surge of violence against immigrants in Germany, and the EC's
failure to ratify conventions strengthening external frontiers, has
increased pressure on the ministers to toughen asylum policy and maintain
border-checks.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been discussing
the new rules with the EC, estimates that as many as 550,000 asylum
applications could be made during 1992, 440,000 in Germany alone.
Ministers will also be asked to consider criteria for returning asylum
applicants to the first 'safe' country they reached, and for defining such
countries.

FRANCE'S weakened Socialist party renewed calls over the weekend for a

reverse a conservative victory in legislative elections next March.
Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, asked them to
join a broad left-wing coalition of 'forces of progress' also including
independents and reformists. His call, at a meeting to prepare the
Socialists' election strategy, comes nearly a month after Generation
Ecologie and the Verts agreed to an electoral pact, expected to win them
their first significant presence in the national assembly.
Socialists agreed over the weekend to reserve 30 constituencies for
non-Socialist candidates, including ecologists. However, politicians of both
green parties have so far been unwilling to join forces with the Socialists
on the grounds that they would do better alone.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Major sets off to sell British view of EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major embarks on a three-day round of European capitals today
determined to impress on his fellow heads of government that there is a
great deal more at stake at next week's Edinburgh summit than the reputation
of the British presidency.
The prime minister's key message to Mr Felipe Gonzalez, his Spanish
counterpart, when they meet tomorrow morning will be that all sides have a
vested interest in reaching a deal as failure could tip recession into
slump.
'What has to be made clear,' said one British government minister last
night, 'is that agreements at Edinburgh could help market confidence and aid
recovery, failure could turn recession into slump.'
With the peseta, the escudo and the punt all highly insecure within their
exchange rate mechanism bands, anything short of a success could provoke a
fresh bout of jitters in the markets, again destabilising the ERM.
Mr Major's trip begins today with talks in Luxembourg with Mr Jacques
Santer, the prime minister But the crucial visit is on the next leg to
Madrid where he must attempt to calm Spanish anger at what they see as
parsimony by the rich northern countries, led by Germany and the UK, over
the cohesion fund for the poorer south.
Using all his powers of conciliation, Mr Major will claim Spain and its
Mediterranean colleagues have already had a significant victory in the
preliminary negotiations on future financing of the commun-ity.
A key element in the new arrangements means that the Value Added Tax element
in the Community's revenues will be reduced immediately from 55 per cent to
50 per cent, rather than phased over five years. This has long been sought
by Madrid.
Furthermore, Mr Major will stress that the difference between the UK
presidency's financing proposals and those of the commission amount to just
Ecu2.5bn (Pounds 2.02bn) a year.
He will juxtapose that figure with those showing the combination of the
cohesion fund with existing structural funds will double total average
annual provisions over the next seven years from Ecu8bn to Ecu16bn.
What he is desperate to avert, however, is any attempt by Mr Gonzalez to use
an alliance with France involving the threat of opposition to the Gatt trade
deal as fresh leverage on the north. He is also determined to avoid any
opening of the debate on Britain's budget rebate.
Like other UK ministers, he will point out that the UK's commitment to the
Community can be measured in the fact that, even with the rebate, it is the
second largest contributor to EC funds.
One minister pointed out yesterday that the UK is aware that Spain needs a
good deal to help sell the Community to its voters at a time when northern
products and companies are increasingly penetrating its markets.
But the hardnosed bottom line is that Madrid must realise that no deal at
all is a substantially worse option than what is on offer.
In some respects a similar message will be taken to Copenhagen where the
Danes' demands for 'opt-outs' from aspects of the Maastricht deal are top of
the agenda.
The UK presidency appears increasingly convinced that acceptable wording on
subsidiarity and openness can be found. But there are considerable concerns
over Denmark's four additional requirements of exemptions on such common
policies as citizenship rights and internal policing.
In spite of the mounting nervousness and doomsaying, however, there are
still some in London who believe that the sheer complexity of the
negotiation, alongside its urgency, could help rather than hinder a final
successful outcome.
There is even some speculation that Paris could decide to keep its
difficulties with Gatt off the agenda in order not to confuse it with all
the other high-stakes poker now about to be played.
What is certain is that senior British ministers believe that the future
financing of the community will be the central debate at Edinburgh. The
success of the summit in resolving the other highly controversial and
important issues also in play will depend on whether the financing deal can
be agreed.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Spaniards to insist on all of Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN Mr John Major, UK prime minister, arrives in Madrid he will be firmly
told that he is killing the Maastricht spirit.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the premier who led Spain into the European Community in
1986, will also tell Mr Major that he is determined to keep the Maastricht
flame alive at the Edinburgh summit. The Madrid talks are likely to be the
toughest facing the UK premier in his pre-summit tour of Community capitals.
'Major has introduced a whole set of uncertainties over European union,' a
senior aide to Mr Gonzalez said. 'We stand four-square behind what was
agreed at Maastricht. We are very, very firm on this.'
Mr Gonzalez's platform has three planks: that the Community's budget should
be appreciably increased; that the richer partners should increase their
contribution to the budget; that the poorer partners should progressively
receive more in order to catch up. This is essentially the basis of the
so-called Delors II EC budget package agreed at Maastricht and it boils down
to north-south transfers in the form of cohesion funds.
While the Spanish government accepts that recession will introduce some
limits on Community spending it insists that these must be minimal and that
convergence must demonstrably remain as the life-force of the Brussels
budget. It views Mr Major's budgetary proposals as a blatant attack on the
economic cornerstone of European Union and all the more sinister since they
are made by a partner that has delayed its ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Gonzalez is likely to refuse any compromise on Community enlargement
unless there is a more generous approach on cohesion funds.
What most deeply irritates the Gonzalez government is the manner in which
the EC's northern tier, which is the net contributor to the Community
budgets, views the poorer Mediterranean rim, together with Ireland, as
'begging bowl' partners. Mr Gonzalez's long experience of leadership, and
Spain's ranking as by far the richest and biggest economy of the Community's
less developed members, makes Madrid the most articulate spokesman of the
convergence process that would erode economic imbalances that lie at the
heart of the European Union ideal.
'Spain may be net a recipient now but in 5 to 10 years' time it could be a
net contributor,' says Mr Carlos Alonso Zaldivar, the head of the Madrid
government's policy planning unit. 'What the UK and the richer members
forget is that we provide the markets that fuel EC growth.'
Spain has narrowed its gap with the Community's northern tier - between 1985
and 1991 its per capita gross domestic product rose by 6.4 points to 79.2
per cent of the EC average - although EC funds flowing into Spain in the
past six years have averaged only 0.3 per cent of the Spanish GDP. In
contrast Community transfers to Greece and Ireland over the period have
represented 3 per cent and 5 per cent of their respective GDPs.
In the meantime, Spain's trade balance with the EC, which accounts for 70
per cent of Spain's exports and 60 per cent of its imports, has deteriorated
sharply since joining the Community. A 1986 deficit of Pounds 935.9m in
trade with the EC had grown to Pounds 7.9bn by 1990.
Mr Major received a taste of Spanish feelings at last Friday's 'conclave' of
EC ministers in Brussels. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister,
said that Mr Major's package was 'not even rhetorically a compromise
proposal'. According to Mr Solchaga, 'nobody who wanted to demonstrate that
the spirit of Maastricht remains alive would have made such a proposal.'

FT  30 NOV 92 / Nordic threat to EC moves on oil drilling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A NORDIC alliance of Norwegians and Danes is threatening to postpone
approval of European Community measures to increase competition in North Sea
oil and gas exploration and drilling.
The meeting of 12 EC energy ministers in Brussels today could become the
first council to bow to objections to Community legislation raised by a
member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which includes Norway.
Norway has had no direct part in negotiations on the EC directive and will
not be represented at the meeting. But some EC countries are worried that
Norway and the six other Efta countries could try to veto the EC legislation
next year under the terms of the European Economic Area (EEA), the 19-nation
free trade zone which comes into force on January 1.
Germany, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have suggested a three- or
four-month delay to win over the Norwegians.
But Britain, which holds the EC presidency, will press for political
agreement on the substance of the measure today.
Denmark, like Norway, has fundamental objections to the directive, because
it would outlaw discrimination against applicants for drilling or
exploration licences on grounds of nationality. Norway wants to continue to
give Statoil, the state company, 50 per cent of every licence granted, while
Denmark's state-owned group, Dansk Olie og Naturgaz, currently has an
automatic right to be included in any licence.
Denmark could be outvoted, but influential Danish opposition parties want
their minister to use the 'Luxembourg compromise' veto on grounds of
overriding national interest if a deal seems likely. Mr Ove Fich, energy
spokesman of the opposition Social Democratic party, said: 'This is more
important for Denmark than the Gatt accord is for France.'
Natural resources companies are also worried that the legislation might
affect long-running licences for exploration and drilling, although British
officials claim that existing licences will be safeguarded.
Ministers are also set to discuss controversial plans for liberalisation of
gas and electricity networks. But Britain, the strongest supporter, is not
going to push for a decision.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Yeltsin urges creation of pro-reform political party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Mr Boris Yeltsin called yesterday for the establishment of
a pro-reform political party, of which he pledged to be part.
He made the call as it became apparent that his government has no effective
agreement with the Civic Union centrist bloc on the eve of a critical
Congress of People's Deputies session which starts tomorrow. Civic Union
support is thought to be essential if the government is to avoid defeat.
Democratic Russia, the group which supported Mr Yeltsin in his successful
bid for the presidency last year, has split into a number of factions, and
prospects for effective unity among reform forces with weak party structures
are remote.
As reformists and the Civic Union continue to trade charges and veiled
threats, Mr Yeltsin told a meeting of his supporters in Moscow that a
reformist party must be created - and that he 'would be with that party and
in that party'.
To applause from the audience of representatives of democratic groups from
all over Russia, he said that 'economic reform at the beginning of this year
looked more dead than alive - but now, market mechanisms are beginning to
fully work'.
Civic Union leaders spoke in different tones yesterday, but it was clear
that no final deal on the shape of the government reform package and on the
membership of the cabinet has yet been reached.
Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, leader of the Renewal party within the Civic
Union and deputy head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, said he believed that the government saw the need for a
stronger and more interventionist state - a key demand of the Civic Union -
and that the administration should not resign as long as it introduced
'corrections' into its reform programme.
However, Mr Vassily Lipitsky, head of the executive committee of the Party
of Free Russia, was quoted by the official news agency Itar Tass as saying
further cabinet changes were required.
Government ministers appeared to accept that no agreement had been reached
and that none was likely. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, told
the democrats' conference that behind the Civic Union's words of support for
reform lay an attempt to take the economy back to administrative control.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, used the same gathering to appeal
to 'democratic allies' in the west for 'more participation and a more
serious approach to what is happening in Russia'.
The fate of Mr Yeltsin's government might also be affected by today's
constitutional court ruling on his decision to ban the communist party
following last year's failed coup attempt.
A ruling in his favour would provide a moral boost to his authority. A
decision against him could provide grounds for impeachment.
The seventh Congress brings together some 1,045 deputies, many elected under
a Soviet system which meant their candidacies were selected by the Communist
party or one of its affiliated organisations. The Congress will focus on the
economic programme, but it is also expected to discuss a new constitution
and a law which would determine the powers of the parliament and the
president.
The news agency Interfax reported yesterday that Mr Yeltsin had sent back to
parliament a bill passed by the deputies which curtails the president's
powers to appoint ministers.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Matsushita staff sent on sales odyssey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA, the world's largest consumer electronics group, has launched an
unprecedented drive to boost sales with a plan for staff to visit 10m
Japanese households in three months to find out what would encourage
consumers to spend more.
About 500 Matsushita staff have been sent from Osaka and Tokyo to work with
more than 19,000 local retailers from Hokkaido in the north to the island of
Okinawa in the far south in making the household visits, usually in the
evenings and at the weekends.
Matsushita earlier this month reported a 65.6 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits to Y67.9bn (Pounds 359m) in the six months to September, largely as
a result of a slide in Japanese demand for videocassette recorders,
televisions and audio products.
The company, which sells internationally under the Panasonic and Technics
brand names, launched the campaign at the start of last month and plans to
complete most of it by the end of the year. Staff are using computer records
of customers kept at local shops to visit regular customers, check whether
their Matsushita products are working properly, make repairs free and ask
customers what sort of new products they would buy.
The results will be analysed at Matsushita headquarters in Osaka in the
spring as part of a broad review of group strategy.
About 60 per cent of Matsushita's Japanese sales are made through about
19,000 small independent retailers which serve local markets. Matsushita has
told the retailers that their ability to compete with department store
chains will depend on their ability to build strong links with local
customers. The retailers will be expected to make at least five home visits
a day for most of next year.
Matsushita's main competitors such as Toshiba and Sony are less dependent on
small retailers, making about 60 per cent of their sales through large
chains.
In common with other manufacturers, Matsushita is attempting to discard the
orthodoxy of the late 1980s that it needed a huge variety of consumer
products. It is concentrating on making fewer, simpler products, with fewer
model changes.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Major warns of market risks if EC summit fails: PM will tell
counterparts to compromise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will this week warn of the danger of fresh turmoil in
international financial markets if the European Community fails to resolve
its differences in a comprehensive accord at next week's Edinburgh summit.
As he embarks on a new round of diplomacy today, the prime minister is
preparing to tell fellow heads of government that a series of complex deals
must be reached to restore market confidence, fuel recovery and thereby
prevent the recession deepening into a slump.
With mistrust of the British presidency of the EC still running high in
European capitals, Mr Major must persuade his counterparts to compromise on
issues ranging from the Community budget to enlargement and the political
crisis caused by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
In Brussels, senior EC officials are concerned that Mr Major may be gambling
too much on his powers of personal diplomacy to forge the alliances
necessary to avoid failure at Edinburgh.
The prime minister's task has become trickier as France has stepped up its
campaign to peel away support for the EC-US compromise on farm subsidies in
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks.
A solid EC majority remains opposed to scuppering the deal, but some
countries such as Spain and Belgium appear to be wavering. Mr Major is in
Luxembourg today and will hold crucial talks in Madrid tomorrow with Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister. His support is needed to meet
Danish requests for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty and to overcome
Madrid's opposition to opening talks early next year on EC enlargement with
Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.
But Mr Gonzalez is bitterly disappointed at the UK's tough new proposals on
the shape and size of the EC budget leading to the end of the decade. The UK
plan was presented to a meeting of EC foreign and finance ministers in
Brussels last Friday, and drew a storm of protest from poorer EC countries
led by Spain.
A British minister said last night, however, that it was becoming
increasingly clear that agreement on the future financing of the community
would hold the key to the summit. Although almost every country is seeking
agreements on a wide range of issues, an accord on the new shape of the
Community's financing would 'unlock everything', he said.
Britain wants to freeze EC spending for the next three years, and to limit
growth to a 'ceiling' of 1.22 per cent of the Community's gross national
product in 1996 and 1997, before lifting it to 1.25 per cent in 1998 and
1999. The approach won support from Germany, the Netherlands and richer EC
members, but Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal denounced the compromise
and called for the allocation of greater resources known as 'cohesion
funds'.
France has been wooing Spain in an effort to build a coalition in favour of
renegotiating the deal with the US on farm subsidies on the grounds that it
is not compatible with the EC agreement last May to reform the Common
Agricultural Policy. The aim is to end France's isolation within the EC on
the Gatt trade talks, thus avoiding the exercise of a French veto which
would provoke a serious split in the Community.
Speaking on French television yesterday, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's
industry and trade minister, described a French veto as akin to using a
nuclear weapon. At the same time, he brushed aside fears that reopening the
farm subsidies deal could jeopardise hopes of a wider Gatt agreement.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Lamont case adds to pressure for cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON Mr John Major to conduct an early cabinet reshuffle grew
yesterday after disclosures that Mr Norman Lamont had received a Pounds
4,000 payment from the Treasury towards private legal costs last year.
The report that he received the sum in a case involving the eviction of a
tenant from his London home was confirmed in a statement by the chancellor
on Saturday night. The incident has led several senior Conservative
backbenchers to question Mr Lamont's judgment in accepting help from public
funds.
The prime minister's office yesterday rallied to the embattled Chancellor,
dismissing speculation that either Mr Lamont's resignation or a cabinet
reshuffle might be imminent.
The Cabinet Office also released details from the confidential Guidelines
for Permanent Secretaries that appeared to establish that the payment to Mr
Lamont was in order and followed past precedents.
Whitehall also rallied to Mr Lamont, with Treasury officials insisting the
idea for the payment had been proposed by civil servants on the grounds that
it met well-established criteria and that taking legal advice had been in
the public interest to defend the chancellor's reputation.
But Labour is determined to raise the case in the Commons today by demanding
a statement from Mr Lamont justifying his decision to take taxpayers' money
to meet a personal expense. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader,
led the protests yesterday, asking why the payment was kept secret if it was
all in order.
The Commons public accounts committee is also expected to examine the
payment, which met part of a Pounds 23,000 legal bill, incurred in evicting
a Ms Sara Dale from Mr Lamont's Notting Hill home. The balance was paid from
Conservative party sources.
The new disclosures, following last week's leaking of Mr Lamont's unpaid
credit card bill, fuel the belief among some Tory MPs that the chancellor is
irredeemably accident-prone.
Many believe Mr Major has little alternative but to move him to a less
prominent cabinet post in a reshuffle during the Christmas recess.
Speculation on his likely successor has centred on Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, and Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary.
One theory has it that Mr Clarke would move to the Treasury, to be replaced
at the Home Office by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Mr Lamont would
move to defence.
Some Tory loyalists came out firmly for the chancellor, blaming the media
for launching a 'witch-hunt'. Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons
Treasury committee, said: 'If this was approved within the Treasury I would
think there is no question of impropriety.'
As Mr Lamont returned to Downing Street last night from his official country
residence, Dorneywood, Bucks, he said: 'I am not going to resign.'

FT  30 NOV 92 / Tietmeyer firm on re-entry to ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Italy should put their economies on a stable footing before
being allowed back into the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, has suggested.
Speaking at a conference in London at the end of last week, Mr Tietmeyer
also said he hoped the recent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo had 'cleared the air', and that no more ERM adjustments
would be needed in the foreseeable future.
In a broad swipe at European governments, Mr Tietmeyer said they should
continue to put their faith in the Bundesbank's ability to act as the
linchpin of the ERM.
He also hinted that European monetary arrangements were more likely to
evolve around the concept of a two-speed system, with specific countries
excluded from an inner core of nations centred on Germany.
Echoing the tone of Mr Tietmeyer's comments, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, also urged caution before Europe proceeded
to a common economic and monetary policy. He told the conference that while
many EC nations were 'tackling deep seated structural shortcomings', it
would be unwise to fix exchange rates across the continent as part of
economic and monetary union.
Mr Tietmeyer, who is due to step up next summer to the top job at the German
central bank, blamed the recent strains in the ERM on 'economic policy
discrepancies' within Europe.
While agreeing that high German interest rates related to German unification
had been one factor, he said another reason for the summer's turbulence had
been the divergence of the economies of the 'core group' of ERM nations from
those of Britain, Portugual, Spain and Italy.

<TEXT>
THE head of Germany's industrial federation said in a newspaper interview
published yesterday that wages should increase no more than 3.5 per cent,
about the expected level of inflation for the coming year, AP reports from
Berlin.
Several large unions are in wage negotiations or preparing for them while
the German economy is on the brink of recession, and the public sector
workers' union, which struck for 11 days last spring, has announced an
unexpectedly low bid for 5 per cent pay increases.
Mr Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of German Industry, was quoted
in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper as saying 3.5 per cent should be the
upper limit of wage rises because inflation is expected to be at that level.
Asked about possible strikes, Mr Necker replied: 'Resistance against
excessive claims of the unions is far higher in the current economic
situation than in boom times.
'With zero (economic) growth there is nothing to share out.'
The steel industry last week offered 3 per cent raises during talks with the
IG Metall steel union, which is demanding 7.5 per cent.
The public sector workers' union said on Friday it would seek 5 per cent
increases for its 2.1m workers. The union, the second largest after IG
Metall, is a pace-setter for wage negotiations, and its initial demand was
considerably lower than the 6.5 per cent demanded by the bank workers'
union.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Eemland hopes auction will cut
Gillette link - Six unnamed groups will bid for Wilkinson Sword this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CRITICAL phase in the disentangling of a bizarre international business
imbroglio is set to open this week, as an auction gets under way for
Wilkinson Sword, the shaving products and toiletries group.
Six unnamed prospective bidders will enter detailed discussions with
Eemland, Wilkinson's owner, and its advisers, the Swedish Enskilda bank and
Goldman Sachs International, which put the business on the market last
month.
Eemland hopes the planned sale, which it aims to agree in principle by the
end of the year, will rid Wilkinson of a deeply unwelcome financial
involvement by Gillette of the US, its biggest competitor, which has aroused
fierce opposition from competition authorities worldwide.
A change of ownership should also relieve Eemland - a consortium owned by
Swedish financial institutions, the JP Morgan Bank and Gillette - of
mounting debt and give Wilkinson the financial and industrial muscle it
needs to survive.
The auction has been preceded by tense negotiations, as Eemland has haggled
over the terms of the sale with Gillette, with which it has long had uneasy
relations. Indeed, until recently the Eemland camp claims to have been
uncertain whether Gillette was prepared to co-operate fully. 'It has been a
poker game up to the last minute,' says one source close to the talks.
Gillette's role and motives have been widely questioned since late 1989,
when it helped finance a highly-leveraged Dollars 650m buy-out from Stora,
the Swedish pulp and paper group, of the consumer products operations of the
latter's Swedish Match subsidiary. As well as Wilkinson, these included a
matches and lighter business.
Gillette, with about 70 per cent of the world wet shaving market, wanted to
buy Wilkinson's non-EC businesses. However, Stora insisted on selling
Swedish Match, later renamed Eemland, as a package.
Gillette's answer was a complex deal whereby it invested Dollars 13.7m to
acquire a 22 per cent non-voting stake in Eemland and granted the consortium
Dollars 69m of mezzanine debt. In exchange, Eemland sold Gillette
Wilkinson's non-EC assets, while disposing separately of the matches and
lighter business.
The US company has always insisted it has no control over Eemland and would
withdraw once the latter was able to repay the loan or could be publicly
floated. However, it failed to convince competition authorities in Britain
and Germany - or in Brussels, which issued a decision earlier this month.
Concluding that Gillette was in a position to influence Wilkinson, the
various authorities have ordered it to sever its links with Eemland and hand
back Wilkinson's former non-EC businesses in Europe. Gillette has appealed
against the UK and German rulings, though it did comply with a US order to
return to Wilkinson its US operations.
Eemland says Gillette never sought to meddle in its affairs. However, the
consortium argues that its financial structure, of which Gillette was a
principal architect, has kept Wilkinson on a tight leash.
The terms of the Gillette mezzanine debt are particularly onerous. A roll-up
loan with an interest rate 6 per cent above the London inter-bank offered
rate (Libor), it will have grown to Dollars 112m by the end of this year,
twice Eemland's Dollars 55.5m of equity.
Though Wilkinson is in the black, with operating profits of DM46.8m (Dollars
29.4m) on sales of DM 316.3m last year, its margin is well below the 25 per
cent assumed in its original business plan. It is unclear when, if ever, it
would be in a position to repay the Gillette loan.
Two developments brought matters to a head. One was the reluctance of
Eemland's Swedish shareholders to inject further capital. The other was
Gillette's apparent conclusion that it could not continue to stave off
indefinitely pressure from competition authorities, particularly the EC,
which is able to enforce its orders faster than national bodies.
The opportunity for an exit was provided by the unexpected success of
Wilkinson's Protector, an advanced shaving system launched in March.
Developed on a shoestring budget, it is said to have overtaken sales of
Gillette's rival Sensor in Germany and to be doing well in Britain -
Wilkinson's two main markets.
Eemland argues that the product offers a buyer willing to invest fresh
resources a unique opportunity to re-build Wilkinson into a substantial
market force before Gillette responds with a comparable razor of its own.
There are also whispers of further Wilkinson innovations in the pipeline.
However, the eventual buyer will have to limit its ambitions to only part of
the world market. Gillette has agreed, as part of the sale, to hand back
Wilkinson's former European businesses outside the EC.
However, it has balked at requests by Eemland that it also return those in
fast-growing regions such as Latin America and south-east Asia. In these
markets, the Wilkinson brand is used on Gillette products.
The consortium hopes to raise as much as Dollars 300m from the sale of
Wilkinson, which will be sold debt-free. That sum should be enough to cover
Eemland's liabilities, though it seems unlikely to provide its shareholders
with much of a return on their investment.
But it is likely to take several more tense hands of poker during the coming
weeks before it becomes clear whether any of the prospective bidders - which
include both financial groups and industrial companies  - are prepared to
raise their stakes to that level.

FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: German subsidiary drags Kewill
into midway loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH COSTS and poor sales at one German subsidiary forced Kewill Systems
into a small loss midway and cast a pall over prospects for the full year.
The Surrey-based computing services company, which markets a portfolio of
manufacturing and accounting software products, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 172,000 for the half year ended September 30, compared to a profit of
Pounds 1.7m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 21.46m to Pounds 15.42m, reflecting the continued
shrinking of Weigang, one of the German companies, and a movement away from
hardware distribution in Europe.
Losses per per share amounted to 3.58p (earnings 13.56p).
Mr John Overstall, chairman, said once the Weigang situation had been
resolved the company would apply to the Court to approve a capital reduction
to eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves.
He said most of the operations had continued steadily. Triffid Software, in
particular, had contributed Pounds 600,000 of UK operation's total pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1m. Han Dataport, the other German subsidiary, made Pounds
500,000.
Weigang lost Pounds 1.3m, however, after a sharp fall in orders at the end
of 1991. Interest costs rose to Pounds 413,000 (Pounds 279,000).
Mr Overstall said marketing efforts had been stepped up in Germany and staff
at Weigang should be reduced to 29 people by April next year. The company
still retained some 400 German customers and should break even next year.

FT  30 NOV 92 / People: Biwater ripples
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Gardener, recently appointed chairman of Bournemouth and West
Hampshire Water companies, has been appointed chairman of East Worcester,
the third supply company in the stable of privately-owned water contractor
Biwater.
Consequently, Anthony Marris relinquishes the chairmanship he has held since
May 1991 and becomes deputy chairman, replacing Martin Copp who has
resigned. Marris has been on the board since 1985, before Biwater took a
stake in East Worcester.
At the same time, Colin Ryder, who has been chief executive since January
1991 but did not previously have a seat on the board, has been made managing
director.
Biwater has effected the same change at Bournemouth and West Hampshire;
hence Tony Cooke is also made managing director and goes on the board of the
two companies, which are to be merged.
The appointments follow the three companies' recent conversion from
statutory to PLC status.
Robin Cadbury, a director since 1975, has retired, to be replaced by Douglas
Benfield, who is a main board director of Biwater and chairman of the supply
subsidiary, Biwater Supply (Holdings).

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl said yesterday Germany would not be in a position to
accept a permanent seat on the UN Security Council if one were offered
today, Reuter reports from Bonn.
He said Bonn's post-war constitution for now barred Germany from shouldering
an international role and sending troops on UN missions outside Nato
territory.
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the General Assembly in September that
Germany would not take the initiative, but would seek a permanent seat if a
change in the council's composition was considered.
The council now has five permanent members with the power of veto: the US,
Russia, Britain, France and China.
Mr Kohl's coalition wants German troops to be able to take part in UN
peacekeeping missions and eventually fight alongside its allies on missions
like the US-led Gulf war that drove Iraq out of Kuwait last year.
But the opposition Social Democrats are denying him the two-thirds majority
he needs to amend the constitution, written to contain German military might
after the war.
Mr Kohl said it was unacceptable that Germany had to withdraw the destroyer
Hamburg from a UN-mandated force monitoring the embargo in the Adriatic
after the Security Council decided ships sailing for Yugoslavia could be
stopped and searched earlier this month.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Private View: Fantasies in the dust - Sol Kerzner built the
notorious resort Sun City. He is about to open the grandiose sequel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHITE Rolls-Royce shone in the street outside. A butler opened the door of
the flat. A cool blonde in black stockings rose from a plump sofa; at the
further end of the split-level room another smart blonde helped a little
girl to her breakfast.
When people begin to look like fashion accessories you know you are in the
presence of the ruthlessly rich. The adornments of Sol Kerzner's London flat
 -human and material - say more about him than a hundred breathless reports
by the dazzled hackettes whom Kerzner has squired round his leisure empire.
Kerzner is a very successful South African hotelier, best known for Sun
City, the sin-and-fun resort he built in the scrubby black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana out of reach of the republic's sex and gambling laws and
where in the heyday of apartheid white politicians could safely consort with
their black mistresses.
In a few days time he is due to open his sequel: the Lost City, a Pounds
180m resort next door. It comprises a fantastically-designed 350-room hotel
pretending to be the restored palace of a lost civilisation, surrounded by
80 acres of imported jungle with huge water slides, artificial surfing lake,
golf course, casino, bars and restaurants. The opening celebrations are to
include a Jean Michel Jarre sound-and-light show, a golf tournament and the
Miss World contest with Jerry Hall and Ivana Trump on display.
Sol Kerzner, chairman of Sun International, proves two adages: audacity
pays, if you give value for money, and publicity is all. At the age of 57
this son of poor Ukrainian immigrants has managed to acquire the aura of a
Khashoggi - private jet, celebrity parties, late-night whisky sessions,
leggy escorts, many homes and several wives.
No doubt he varies his act according to the publication he is talking to,
but after the advance billing I found Kerzner disappointingly restrained. He
appeared the typically cautious, hard-headed businessman, a bit flashy,
maybe, but hardly flamboyant. Of his reputed vile temper there was no hint.
Kerzner is very short with big shoulders, broad chest, a modest beer belly
and skinny legs. His eyes are unusually clear and at some angles he looks
uncannily like the actor Richard Burton. He sat on the edge of the sofa
running a set of worry beads through his fingers. The beads, and occasional
shortness of breath, testified to the fact that he was once a heavy smoker
and suffered a heart attack nine years ago.
I said: It's quite a lot of money to spend on a fantasy.
'It's not quite a lot. It's a lot.' He laughed. 'It's a lot of money to be
spending when world economies are not great, when we're looking to attract
foreign visitors and when the domestic economy is dreadful.' He laughed
again.
I don't expect you to frighten the punters ahead of opening day, I said, but
there is still a danger of civil war in South Africa. Doesn't that keep you
awake at night?
'Well, you know, one cannot predict what the outcome will be. I believe the
various leaders realise that even to prolong this hiatus period is going to
wreck the economy to a point where it's going to be unimportant who wins.
Our economy can't stand much more. We've had disinvestment, the sanctions
period. What one needs now is investment, foreign investment. I think they
all realise that.'
Kerzner has been accused of profiting from apartheid, exploiting the pseudo-
independence of the homelands to establish 'casinostans'. Four years ago he
admitted to a government commission having paid some R2m to George
Matanzima, former prime minister of Transkei, to secure sole casino rights
in the territory. Kerzner says it was not a bribe, but extortion. These
days, naturally, he is paying court to leaders of the African National
Congress.
You have been accused of making money on the back of apartheid, I said.
'If we had built gambling halls and movie houses purely for porn movies,
that sort of stuff, then I agree with you. That would have been
exploitation. But what we did was go in and develop a tourist industry; we
give employment to over 18,000 people. That's not exploitation, that's
development. We have trained people: 90 per cent of our personnel are from
southern africa, indigenous.
'We've said in our annual reports going back years that the system is
something we didn't subscribe to. There is no discrimination in our resorts
or within our people.
'It wasn't within our power to break down the apartheid system. It was
there. I think what we did was positive. We developed an industry - not a
gaming industry, a tourist industry, of which, I agree absolutely, gaming
was an important element.'
I notice you're making friends with the ANC, I said.
'We have always spoken with the various political leaders, not specifically
ANC. Tourism cannot be developed unless the government is behind it. My
interaction with government is only at one level . . . to get
infrastructure.'
Have you invited Nelson Mandela to the opening?
'No, not to the opening. That really revolves around entertainment. This is
not a political event.'
Kerzner does not seem worried that gambling may be legalised in South Africa
and kick one of the props from under his bantustan resorts. He already faces
competition from illegal casinos in the urban areas.
'One would hope that it would be legalised in relation to tourism
development. That's why we have developed Sun City to its present size, to
give variety against the day when we compete.'
That may also be why Kerzner is trying to erase Sun City's tacky reputation
(though people who have been there say the place is actually very well run),
and push the 'Bop' resorts as family places.
Isn't sex part of the fun? I asked.
'Sex is not part of our marketing. Others project this singles sort of
scene, We're not competing with that. I mean perhaps the stuff that we are
projecting may look sexy, I dunno. But specifically looking to sell sex -
absolutely not. We are definitely selling an experience, a discovery of what
Africa is all about.'
Even without the violence and uncertainty surrounding South Africa's move to
universal suffrage, the Lost City fantasy is a gamble. Why should
foreigners, in particular, fly to one of the most beautiful regions of the
world in order to hole up in an ersatz creation like the Lost City? I asked
Kerzner what made him so confident people would go for it.
'I think it's a combination of things. Instinct plays an important role.
That's got to be part of it. Hilton, Sheraton, Interconti can go round the
world with sliderules doing their feasibility studies. Their stuff is easy.
When you get into the unknown it becomes more difficult. You've got to have
an understanding of what the people of tomorrow want, not the people of
today.
'People have said to me over the years 'Wow] Sol, how could you do that]'
Like when I put every cent of the family money into our first hotel. 'It's
far too luxurious,' they say, 'South Africans won't pay that]' They say I've
got courage, this or that, and I think to myself: not at all. I felt good
about it from Day One.'
But what makes you so sure?
'Well, I think I know people reasonably well when it comes to leisure. I've
done it since 1964. I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but I think I must
have a reasonable feel for what will excite people.
'In our business the secret is to know how far to go, how much to spend. Not
to overcapitalise, but if you get nervous and you cut back on the real
concept that's the kiss of death.
'Everyone knows the ruins are just built. Everyone knows the palace is new
and is a hotel. Yet it's got to be done on a scale and in terms of detail
and quality that people are gonna believe it.'
You think fantasy is what people really want?
'No, I think what people want is a mix of fantasy and reality. This thing is
so good that when you walk in there you've gotta wonder when you look at the
murals if it hasn't been there the last coupla hundred years. Take our
forests. When you walk into this rainforest, you're going to believe it -
you're gonna get lost in there.'
Sol Kerzner believes the future of tourism lies in what he calls 'the total
resort'. The idea is not exactly new: the Butlins holiday camps were based
on the same concept, while Disney invented the fantasy. Kerzner is marrying
the two and multiplying by ten. But he insisted: 'You've got to give value
for money. If you take 'em for a ride, you're going to fail. But the total
resort is where it's going. No doubt.'
The cool blonde on the opposite sofa - a public relations girl she was  -
started shifting about in that way they do when the time is up.
Do you gamble?
'Not really. Yeah, I'll enjoy it if I go to Las Vegas. I'll sit there and
have a bit of fun. But it's fun, it's not big money.'
He thought for a second.
'I guess I could be. I just haven't allowed myself to be.'
Well, I said, as I got up: good luck.
Kerzner was matey.
'Perhaps we'll see you at Lost City one day'
Thanks, I said. Perhaps.

FT  28 NOV 92 / The death of the peasant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peasants are the great sanctuary of sanity . . . When they disappear, there
is no hope for the race.
Virginia Woolf
IT STILL happens in remote parts of the Peloponnese, or in the heel of
Italy. Rambling through the groves and terraces of Mediterranean
polyculture, you come across a figure in the landscape. He is dressing
vines, perhaps, or switching his goats to new pasture.
You, a trespasser, give your most ingratiating smile. He, the proprietor or
tenant, returns a toothless grin - and goes further. He bids you stay and
take a draught of wine with him; then a slice of bread, some olives and a
tomato; then, to send you on your way, some fruit of the season.
It is a perfect encounter. It is the sort of humane simplicity for which
bourgeois north Europeans yearn. It is the constitution of Arcadia - and has
been for at least two centuries.
From the safety of our stripped pine kitchens, it is easy to allow false
honour to the peasant. Get chatting to that shepherd and, soon enough, you
realise that he would swap his donkey for a Mitsubishi Shogun if he could.
The peasant is most admired by those who (like Woolf) do not have to share
his existence - and, still less, his wife's.
Any decent study of rural history dispels visions of the picturesque
felicity of subsistence as a livelihood. In Britain and France, during the
last century, the state of agricultural labourers was wretched. Even writers
prone to the idyllic were honest about this.
In the French countryside around 1850 only three-fifths of the population
ever got to drink wine, and meat - scrag end of rabbit, most likely - was a
rare family indulgence. French peasants were kept poor and benighted by an
alliance of taxmen, landlords and the clergy. The bon viveurs who broke the
ground for Elizabeth David were not, as we would like to think, the
peasantry, but city types.
So, one can, in this sense, dismiss Woolf's apocalyptic dictum. If she still
were with us, I think she would qualify her warning.
Originally, it arose in a discussion of Thomas Hardy's Dorset yokels, and
the type she had in mind - phlegmatic, besmocked, hands calloused by the
dung fork - has long been consigned to sepia postcards. His disappearance
can hardly be lamented although, naturally, one feels elegiac about the
fading of certain techniques of cultivation and animal husbandry, and
worried lest, one day, technological agriculture should collapse and we are
left incapable of producing our own food.
But no: it is not the end of the world; and in the case of the Dorsetshire
labourer, or the Languedoc serf, probably good riddance. But it is the end
of Arcadia, and it is the beginning of the end of pastoral values in
European society.
The companionship of strangers; food whose abundance is governed by season;
pure water from a freshet brook or spring; a full panoply of stars at night
. . . these are things and spiritual sensations we think we can do without.
Ploughboys, these days, do not get seats in parliament; nor stewards of
hedgerows, nor even shopkeepers who sell nails by weight and wrapped in
newspaper. Call it progress, or the loss of collective sanity: the fact is
that it is happening, and it demands a revision of earthly delights.
Pastoral hankerings die hard. Britain's nabobs of urban development rarely
face up to their own conquest by tarmac: they sneak down to the converted
barn in the Dordogne, or the Provencale farmhouse abandoned by the farmer no
longer permitted to farm.
Here, there is still kindness from strangers; here, you can fulfil a part of
the national curriculum, and show your children the stars in the sky. A
month in this sort of country is what many of us take to be a marvellous
retreat and writers, whether good (AS Byatt) or mediocre (Peter Mayle), have
no trouble in its celebration.
But we should face up to the truth: Provence is not guaranteed toujours
Provence. Provence ultimately is no better inoculated against the 20th
century than Merrie England.
To cries of English indignation, a motorway is being driven through the
Dordogne. And the statistics are simple enough: they show that the numbers
employed on the land in France have roughly halved since the mid-1960s. As
anyone who sojourned in France this summer will know, numbers are decreasing
palpably still. French farming is bound the Euro-way of consolidation and
homogeneous efficiency.
Virginia Woolf is not around to express her views on Maastricht, the Gatt
talks and the French peasants' revolt. But I take her message to extend that
far; and I see, in the probable failure of rural France to prevent the
treaty, a last hope vanished. The peasant is dead. Long live the peasant]

FT  28 NOV 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Steeped in beauty beyond the Norm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I DON'T imagine I would ever spend Pounds 1m-plus on a David Hockney
painting, as some people have. And I think I agree with the critic who said
that while Hockney is 'one of the most successful and acclaimed artists of
his generation, in demand wherever today's western art finds a ready and
eager public,' he is also 'preposterously over-rated . . . superficial,
turning out a kind of 19th century saloon art refurbished from the stockroom
of modernism.'
But I like and admire Hockney, especially his mixture of bluntness and
sensitivity. And I enjoy what he says about art. Recently, in an interview,
he said he was not sure that tragedy was a suitable theme for painting.
'Strauss always said: 'I thought artists were for providing beauty'.'
Hockney described how he had been captivated by a small picture in the
Matisse exhibition in New York, a vase of flowers with a bust on a table. 'I
looked at the date, and it was 1942. And, of course, Europe was ripping
itself apart. But I thought: 'Well, I'm glad he painted it. I'm glad that
there was somebody . . . making something beautiful from the world around
him'.'
So inspired was I by Hockney's sentiments that this week I suddenly hurled
all the papers on my desk into the air, stabbed the computer Off button and
dashed in search of something beautiful. I rushed to the Tate Gallery, paid
Pounds 4, and dived into the Swagger exhibition - 300 years of grand manner
portraiture in Britain, from Van Dyck to Augustus John. 'Swagger'
portraiture can be showy and ostentatious, but also rhetorical, glamorous,
exuberant and sexy.
There are 79 paintings in this exhibition, all of them beautiful. You can
drown yourself in sumptuousness - Batoni, Zoffany, Reynolds, Gainsborough,
Millais, Sargent, and so on. I had only one bad moment. I was admiring Sir
Thomas Lawrence's Catherine Gray, Lady Manners (1794) when two twitterers
strode up to it. I expect they were part of the Barnes mob. The thing about
Lady Manners is that it sorts the men from the boys. It is glittery,
luscious and showy, the highlights of the dress laid on in thickly impasted
white. It even has a peacock.
Is it chocolate-box art, or something much weightier? Weightier, I rather
think. I find it immensely sad. But the Barnes pair were outraged. 'Dear God
in Heaven,' moaned the female, when confronted by Lady Manners. 'God, what a
mess. She looks like a chicken.' I have been known to start arguments in
galleries on less than that, but I let the fools go, so wrapped had I become
in the glamourousness of swagger.
I went home. I felt uplifted. I decided that for the next 24 hours I would
look only at beautiful things, would let the world and its sorrows pass by
unheeded.
Just as I was settling down, Miss Lee, my executive assistant, burst in.
Dressed in designer gear. Expensively rouged and carmined. Bosom rising and
falling. She had obviously been to Harvey Nicks with one of her dreadful
friends. 'The world is going mad,' said Miss Lee. 'The government is shaking
and heaving. Iraqgate's exploding. The French are revolting. And a comet's
heading for Earth.'
'I don't want to know,' I said gently. 'For 24 hours I am ignoring the world
and its comedies. I am steeping myself in beauty. Please don't disturb me.'
For the next four hours I idled through a favourite book, Ruskin Today, an
anthology chosen and annotated by Kenneth Clark 'to reintroduce this
fascinating and complex figure to the modern reader.' I read Ruskin on the
sacredness of colour - 'the loveliest (colour) is melancholy'; on the
snobbishness of English painters, and on the evil of decorating railway
stations.
At 7pm, Miss Lee burst into the room again. Her hair was awry. There were
Beaujolais stains on her front. 'Michael, you have got to snap out of your
reverie,' she shouted. 'Amazing things are happening. A dozen members of the
cabinet have assassinated Norman Lamont. They stabbed him at the Commons.
Heseltine plunged the first knife in, then Howard and Hurd and so forth.
Lamont did not go quietly. Squealed like a pig, they say. The blood you
wouldn't believe. Finally, John Major stepped from the shadows and finished
poor Norman off.'
I smiled kindly at my assistant. 'I am afraid you will have to remind me,' I
said. 'Who was Norman Lamont?'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: They're playing a Finnish tune in Japan - Andrew
Clement reports from the Kitakyushu International music festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KITAKYUSHU sprawls across the north-western tip of Kyushu, the most
southerly of the main islands of Japan. With a population of a little over a
million it is the country's seventh largest city, created in 1973 from the
amalgamation of five industrial towns. Its hectic jumble of expressways,
factories and urban development receives the thumbs-down from the guide
books to Japan, which generally urge visitors to pass through as quickly as
possible and head on to the volcanoes, hot springs and lush evergreen
forests farther south.
There is much hard work going on to change that unprepossessing image, and
the arts are strongly featured in the city's immensely ambitious plans for
the millennium. A handsome art museum already commands a panoramic view, air
pollution permitting, across the whole of Kitakyushu, and the Kitakyushu
International Music Festival has put down firm roots - five years old now
and generously supported by the city authorities.
The festival is the creation of the violinist Yoshiko Arai, and her cellist
husband Seppo Kimanen. Kimanen founded and still directs the Kuhmo Chamber
Music Festival, the exuberant midsummer celebration in central Finland that
has established itself as one of Europe's leading chamber-music feasts. The
couple's idea of creating a Japanese sibling to Kuhmo in Ms Arai's home city
was eagerly received in Kitakyushu, and it has prospered mightily, now
drawing musicians from Europe and the US each November to Japan. There was a
full week of concerts and recitals this year and every one was immensely
well supported and warmly received.
The Kuhmo model was the starting point for Kitakyushu and chamber music
remains its raison d'etre with the final evening given over to a mammoth
programme of 'chamber music fever'. Along the way, though, some aspects of
the Finnish programme have been adapted to local conditions, and slowly
other, new traditions have evolved. There was never quite the sense of
prodigal informality, the spontaneity and unpredictability, which is one of
Kuhmo's most engaging characteristics; the Japanese concern for order and
firm planning saw to that. Concerts began and ended with most un-Kuhmo-like
punctuality, with never a suggestion of music-making stretching on into the
small hours.
The nature of the place, and the diverse venues for the concerts were partly
responsible. For Kitakyushu has at least three concert halls that would be
welcomed in almost any European city - certainly nowhere in the British
Isles outside London is so well endowed - and all played host to one or more
concert. Chamber music in big, 2000-seater halls is a very different
proposition from the intimacies of the Finnish performances.
Yet a series of lunchtime concerts (immensely expensive and exclusive) in
the beautiful Western-style headquarters of the Industrial Club of West
Japan generated their own kind of cosiness; there the British cellist Robert
Cohen gave marvellously eloquent performances of solo suites by Bach and
Britten and was heard with the closest attention, while a programme of
Sibelius's chamber music given in a Buddhist temple with the audience seated
cross-legged on the floor had a kind of rapt intensity that made a very
suitable substitute.
Sibelius and Brahms were the themes of the Kitakyushu week. Japanese
audiences are only just getting to grips with Western music of the
20th-century, and Sibelius, one suspects, was largely unknown to them. Two
concerts by the orchestra of the Korean Broadcasting System under Okko Kamu
brought a Sibelius symphony, the First, sketched in rather approximate terms
(decent string playing, raucous, insecure wind); in the Shokakuji temple the
Jean Sibelius Quartet (Arai's and Kimanen's own group) gave a beautifully
conceived, small-scale account of the Voces Intimae quartet, and the
remarkable violinist Mark Peskanov played the rarely heard (and still
unpublished) Five Pieces Op. 81.
Peskanov and his regular Kuhmo colleagues provided the personnel for the
other, less thematic chamber evenings too. In these happily assorted
programmes the music-making seemed at its most unbuttoned and exciting.
Scattered through the week there were thrilling accounts of the Dvorak piano
quintet with Peskanov and Cohen, Jukka Pohjola and Teemu Kupainen from the
Sibelius quartet, and the pianist of the Tchaikovsky Trio Konstantin Bogino,
and of the Brahms Piano Quintet with Peter Csaba and Arai, Vladimir
Mendelssohn, Kimanen and the pianist Etsuko Terada. Peskanov with Juhani
Lagerspetz gave as crisp and musical an account of Beethoven's Violin Sonata
Op. 12 no. 1 as one could hope to hear, the Tchaikovsky Trio dug out a
typically full-blooded account of Rakhmaninov's Trio elegiaque and Charles
Neidich was wondrously fluent in Brahms' E flat Clarinet Sonata and Berg's
Four Pieces.
Such were the most Kuhmo-like highlights of a packed week, but the concerts
by the Korean orchestra also provided a platform for young soloists from
Finland and Japan to go through their paces. The Finnish-based Valeria
Resjan coped well with Mozart's B flat Piano Concerto K595, even though the
KBS Symphony is hardly the Mozart orchestra of anyone's dreams. Most
remarkable of all was a 15-year-old violinist Yuko Kawami, who despatched
Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy as if its technical challenges were negligible.
Both young ladies were invited to next summer's festival in Kuhmo, while
Kuhmo's own youth policy is now reaping its rewards in the shape of the
Virtuosi di Kuhmo, a splendidly accomplished string orchestra conducted by
Peter Csaba that spent the week in Kitakyushu touring schools in the area.
Their performances at the final jamboree demonstrated what a finely honed
group Csaba has produced and what a useful broadening of Kuhmo's scope it
provides; even transplanted halfway across the world the festival preserves
a special flavour and its energy and enthusiasm most of all.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Petrified at the wedding - Music theatre / David
Murray reviews Mecklenburgh Opera's latest east European experiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE adventurous Mecklenburgh Opera has a penchant for east European
experiments, and now it has staged the 'first performance of a Slovak opera
in England'. Petrified - 'Skameneny' in the original - is a sort of
ballad-opera in one hour-long, seven-scene act, composed in 1974 by Juraj
Benes, who is now 52. The programme-notes assure us that it represented
(rather belatedly?) the low state of communal morale after the collapse of
the Prague Spring in 1968. What we see, however, is a timeless
village-tragedy, rather on the lines of Lorca's Blood Wedding.
Hanka, 'a young girl', is just that; Janko, 'a young poet', is the
rebellious local romantic (we first see him flinging crumpled-up poems at
the villagers, who fail to appreciate them). They connect, run away together
 -to widespread disapproval - and disconnect; back at home Hanka is pressed
into marrying a much older man; years later Janko makes a dramatic return,
and it all ends in grief. Besides the principal pair there are male and
female trios of village character-types, who both comment and interfere,
sometimes violently.
Heroic efforts in the programme-book to explain the sense in which they are
all 'petrified' remained opaque. Perhaps Skameneny conveys more to Slovaks.
In any case, John Abulafia's production - formal groupings, stereotyped
miming of anguish and loss - leaves the progress of the action frustratingly
unclear. For all we can see, it is hard to tell just how and even when the
unhappy wedding takes place, or what exactly happens when Janko returns. The
words might have helped (and Ewald Osers' Englishing was an expert job, as
far as one could tell), but except from Richard Halton's outstanding Janko
they were mostly indistinguishable.
The worst offender was Rebecca de Pont Davies' anxious Mother, whose fine,
pungent mezzo - nearly a real contralto, rare nowadays - disgorged scarcely
one recognisable English vowel, even at a mere ten yards' distance. But all
the singers were regularly foxed by their long-drawn-out lines: again and
again, we waited impatiently through an extended 'Maaa' or a 'Teee' for some
final consonant to reveal what word we were hearing. Presumably the text
sings better in Slovak.
It is drawn from poems by the 19th-century Janko Kral, which the composer
enlisted in the service of his newly-devised story, and apparently they
prompted his music toward ballad-inflections for the first time. But they
seem to be self-contained, introspective effusions, not narratives - and
Benes supplies no stage-directions: the producer has had to make theatrical
bricks with very little straw.
The attraction of the piece lies in its music, rather than its clouded
action. In post-1968 'Czechoslovakia' (which has just now ceased to be),
Benes had minimal access to developments further west; his idiom has grown
along post-Bartok paths, untouched by anything as radical as postwar
serialism or doctrinaire atonality. The lean score of Petrified touches
down, regularly and reassuringly, upon tonal bases. Christopher Baugh's
stage-designs offer a close analogy, with traditional Czechoslovak forms
copied in arrangements of raw, mass-produced panels and blocks, each
blazoned with its factory-code.
In tutti the seven-strong instrumental ensemble, including cembalom - here,
Anne Manson conducts a first-class band - sometimes goes into strident,
dislocated polyphony. On the other hand, whole scenes are accompanied by
just one or two players, keening away in ethnic style beneath grateful,
expressive vocal lines (especially Patricia Rozario's as the winsomely
unlucky heroine). There is enough palpably fresh and consistent character in
all this to nullify any fashion-oriented complaint that Benes has missed out
on western developments.
Mecklenburgh has already commissioned a new Hamlet 'opera' from him (for
1995-96), which is predicted to explore madrigal-territory. One may hope
that it will recapture some vital dramatic territory, too.
Further performances at The Place, Duke's Road, WC1, on November 28 and 30,
December 1, 3, 4 and 5; and another at the Phoenix Arts in Leicester on
January 12

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Birtwistle's bloody ballad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWDOWN is one of the those rare pieces of music theatre that manages to
extend and revitalise an age-old tradition while remaining absolutely true
to its contemporary self. It was the first collaboration between Harrison
Birtwistle and Tony Harrison, born out of workshops at the National Theatre
in 1977 where Birtwistle had just been appointed the first Music Director
and Harrison had been working on his Phaedra Britannica, well before poet
and composer were involved on the National's Oresteia and their 'mechanical
pastoral' Yan Tan Tethera.
It is a ballad, based upon the legend of the Two Sisters, a violent story of
family murder which appears in folk lores throughout northern Europe and
America. Harrison's text for Bowdown intertwines conflicting versions of the
tale, moving between English, regional dialects and Danish, constantly
breaking the thread and rejoining it so that the speech rhythms are varied,
the perspective changes, and the listener is moved between frames of
reference and narrative styles.
Birtwistle's music does the bare minimum (though he has added some new
material for the new staging): the text is underpinned with pulses, primeval
interludes are based upon the slenderest scraps of melody, piercing drones
pick out the bloody climaxes. Yet the cumulative effect is monumental; the
dramatic world created by both music and text is totally absorbing and
consistent, and quite unlike anything in the repertory.
The new production by Graham Devlin's Major Truck Theatre Company is touring
the country under the auspices of the Arts Council's Contemporary Music
Network; it reached the Queen Elizabeth Hall (and a disappointingly small
audience) on Thursday. Devlin's approach retains the essential ritualised
aspect of the original; one of Bowdown's most extraordinary characteristics
is its invented sense of communal story-telling, of a drama pieced together
from shards of collective memory, in which the actor-musicians pool their
resources and seemingly invent their roles as necessary.
There is more extraneous movement in this production than in previous
versions I've seen, and perhaps a little less cumulative energy too;
something tighter and more controlled might give the action a greater
tension and impact, but this remains a finely wrought realisation of an
extraordinary piece, which continues to defy categorisation. It's arguably
both Birtwistle's and Harrison's most perfectly achieved stage work to date,
a genuine alliance of equal partners wonderfully matched in their
sensibility.
Queen Elizabeth Hall; touring next week to Southampton, Sheffield and
Lancaster

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Family Bliss hits West End - Malcolm Rutherford
reviews a new production of Hay Fever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOEL Coward's Bliss family is worth revisiting every five years or so.
However well you may think you have remembered them, there will be always
something that you have forgotten. Despite their internal quarrels, Mr, Mrs,
Master and Miss Bliss are the only happy family in a game where the rest of
the cards do not fit. They are remarkably pleased with themselves and the
only real argument between the children is whether this makes them normal or
abnormal.
The Blisses do not change much with time. For regular visitors the chief
attraction is the subtle difference in the way they play their parts. In
Alan Strachan's new production of Hay Fever at the Albery Theatre, the
family is in pretty good form but the guests are allowed to run them close.
Maria Aitken plays Judith, the actress-mother whose heart has never really
left the stage. Her best moment is when she effortlessly kicks off her
wellington boots without sitting down or using her hands. Her weakest is
when, in a curiously subdued scene, she sings in French at the piano. For
the rest, she does all that Coward could have asked: an actress who commands
attention playing an actress who tends to ham. If this part went wrong, the
play would fall. Ms Aitken never lets it do that. She gets the balance
between Judith as wife and mother, and Judith as actress, exactly right.
Note the malicious glee with which she reads in the theatre column of a
Sunday newspaper that 'Mary Saunders has got another failure'.
The trouble with the play is that Judith is so much the dominant character
in the family that the rest of the Blisses are overshadowed. In this
production they accept their subsidiary role with perfect discipline, which
is presumably what the director intended.
Where Strachan scores is how he draws in the visitors. Anyone who saw the
production of Coward's Private Lives with Joan Collins as Amanda a couple of
years ago will recall how much Sara Crowe made out of playing the silly
girl, Sibyl. Here Ms Crowe does it again as the flapper, Jackie Coryton.
Possibly she is in danger of being type-cast, but she plays the role of the
dumb blonde to perfection.
In the end, all four visitors come together in a symmetry of their own,
united in their desire to get out of the Bliss household as soon as Sunday
trains permit. Some of their best moments come not in Coward's lines, but in
his situations and the facial expressions they permit. Watch them eating
haddock for breakfast. See the blood rising in Richard Garnett's face when
he succumbs to hiccoughs and is made to hold his breath for a count of over
30.
Hay Fever has some splendidly laconic lines as well. When Garnett, the
athletic young man playing Sandy Tyrell, tells Judith, his would-be
conquest, that he is boxing again in two weeks' time, she responds sweetly:
'I must come to your first night.' Coward's fascination with place names
comes out in a wonderfully halting conversation between the flapper and the
visiting diplomatist (Christopher Godwin) as they wait for the Blisses to
receive them. 'Italy's awfully nice, isn't it?' 'Oh yes, charming.' And
'Dear little place, Dieppe'.
The set as well as the costumes are designed by Anthony Powell. He allows
the closest physical contact to take place on the central sofa, but leaves
plenty of room for estrangement. More overtly sexual scenes, such as
kissing, occur off-stage, in the library or the garden. In retrospect, it is
astonishing how much Coward managed to convey about sexual attraction
without being explicit.
In short, the Blisses are worth another visit. If you have not been to see
them before, go at once in case they do not come back, for I have just the
slightest suspicion that their charms may be beginning to fade.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: A 'Last Supper' to savour - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government's green paper on the BBC was covered in this paper on
Wednesday, now we wait for public reaction. Myself, I believe the BBC's
local radio stations are a pointless challenge to the independent
franchises; and I would not be against privatising Radio 1. Otherwise the
current set-up seems to me workmanlike; the question of programme quality is
the business of the various controllers.
Heaven knows, they have enough criticism from the public. It may be argued
that its value, as revealed in Radio 4's Feedback and the correspondence
columns of the Radio Times, is pretty low, but the solution to this hardly
lies in the hands of the Corporation. The fortunes of Classic FM suggest
that there is a more thoughtful public as well. I heard an enjoyable
recording of Bruckner's 3rd Symphony on Tuesday when I might have heard
Alexander Goehr's Psalm IV on Radio 3 or Kaleidoscope on Radio 4.
The nicest thing I have heard this week has been Rabbi Lionel Blue's Last
Supper on Radio 3 on Sunday. His guests were presenter Leslie Forbes and a
Dominican monk; his basic dish was of almonds, grated apple, red wine,
cinnamon, and parsley, which he reckoned was the mortar that the Israelites
used to build the Pyramids. Then eggs in salt water. The synoptic Gospels
differed from St. John on the date; they said it was on the Passover, John
says Jesus was crucified before the Passover. There was talk of other things
too - for example, St. Paul wrote of 'women co-workers', but such references
were edited out. It was a friendly meeting of beliefs, but no one answered
the serious questions - who cooked the Last Supper? who washed up? In this
case it was Rabbi Blue; he gave us a commentary.
Radio 3's Sunday Play, The Pool at Bethseda by Allan Cubitt, was not a
biblical piece, but about death from cancer. Dr Daniel Pearce, very ill,
sees visions, and finds himself at Bart's in 1735, where Hogarth, painting
the eponymous picture, casts him as Christ. There is much correspondence
between the 18th-century figures and the folk that surround him in his own
day. The scheme is clever, though not ideally worked out; the doctor's
ultimate death, for instance, is too prolonged, and there are some rather
self-conscious soliloquies. But I thought it a moving play, the author's
first for radio, and well directed by Susan Hogg, with Mick Ford as Dr
Pearce and Danny Webb as Hogarth and his 20th-century version.
Two new series on Radio 4 seem unpromising to me. The Locker Room on
Saturdays is like a man's Woman's Hour, presided over by Tom Robinson, only
the talk is less intelligent, just changing-room chat. The Friend in the
Corner, on Wednesdays, is a wireless set, and gives a taste of broadcasts in
past years, the first being 1936. What did we have? A lot of religion. Who
were our heroes? Gipsy Petulengro, Malcolm Campbell, CB Fry. The Crystal
Palace burnt down, there was a bus-strike, the abdication speech of King
Edward VIII was read by the Speaker. The news was copyright by Reuter, the
Press Association, Exchange Telegraph and Central News. Next week we have
1943.
I try to warm to the young people's serials on Radio 5, but it is not easy.
Guards] Guards] is adapted by Michael Butt from Terry Pratchett, a
well-liked comic writer; but the first instalment on Monday was hard to
follow, despite having a narrator among its starry cast. Carrot (Robert
Gwylim), a young volunteer in the Guards, is built up as the hero, but
players like John Wood (Guards captain) and Melvyn Hayes (corporal) get the
publicity. There are dragons offstage, and Elucidated Brethren, and a Guild
of Thieves. Michael Butt directs. I must wait for a few more episodes.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Illustrating 'Once upon a time' - Michael Glover
reflects on the story of children's picture books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY 1802, the year in which Wordsworth wrote his great 'Ode on the
Intimations of Immortality', the notion that children were a unique species
deserving of attention in their own right, and not merely dwarfish
adults-in-the-making, was already in popular currency. And what better as a
means of educating this species than books with pictures in them?
The publishing of childrens' books with accompanying illustrations began in
earnest in the 1840s and accelerated as the 19th century moved towards its
close. Sophisticated methods of using engravings beside printed text were
invented and refined; and the middle decades of the century saw the
appearance of three great talents who were to revolutionise the world of
illustrated childrens' books: Hans Hoffman in Germany, whose Struwelpeter of
1845, a ferocious tale originally devised for some hapless, cowering
three-year-old, was rapidly translated into many other European languages,
including English; Edward Lear, that morose painter of bird-life, whose
nonsense rhymes were first published in 1846; and the Rev Charles Dodgson
(better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll), the Oxford logician, whose
partnership with the successful professional caricaturist (of Punch), John
Tenniel, was to produce perhaps the greatest illustrated childrens' classic
of all time, Alice in Wonderland. And then, as the capacity to print in
colour developed, other great names appeared: Caldecott, Crane and Potter,
for example.
Some of the finest achievements in childrens' book illustration, spanning
the period from 1840 to the present day, are on display at the National
Gallery of Scotland until the end of December and they demonstrate how
haphazard the process of writing and publishing books for this untested
market must have been. So much seems to have depended upon relationships
between illustrators and particular children, for example. Beatrix Potter's
earliest tales developed out of her habit of writing letters to child
friends, in which she would describe the antics of her own pet rabbits, with
appropriate doodles in the margins. The Tale of Peter Rabbit was rejected by
publishers so many times that she decided to produce it at her own expense
in 1901, with a single black-and-white illustration as frontispiece. After
its appearance, Macmillan offered to publish the book with colour
illustrations and Potter was able to take advantage of the recent discovery
of the 3-colour printing process to achieve the harmonious greens and browns
of her now-so-familiar garden settings.
The exhibition shows her studies of rabbits, minutely observed, and a
watercolour of that garden in Wales where so many of the early stories were
set. All this preliminary work demonstrates a remarkable capacity for
prolonged and detailed academic preparation.
Lewis Carroll, too, was a great perfectionist - and he, too, paid for the
publication of the first edition of Alice in 1865, though Macmillan
distributed it. His relationship with the equally pedantic Tenniel (some of
whose Alice engravings are on display in the exhibition) was a stormy one,
the artist on one occasion flatly refusing to illustrate 'a wasp in a wig'.
Carroll withdrew the chapter altogether.
The exhibition also enables us to compare how different illustrators have
interpreted the same text - Stevenson's Treasure Island, for example. Ralph
Steadman's remarkable depiction of Long John Silver in a tavern, surrounded
by carousing piratical types, is full of violence and blood-lust; little, if
anything, remains of Stevenson's description of Silver as a 'clean and
pleasant-tempered landlord.'
Mervyn Peake's wonderful pen-and-ink illustration of Billy Bones, which
appeared in an edition of 1949, strips Bones back to his meanest essentials,
grotesquely simplifying the features to such an extent that the character
looks positively haunted by the evil in his heart. For every illustrator, it
seems, there is a new Stevenson to be discovered.
The exhibition's greatest and most pleasurable surprise is Randolph
Caldecott, clerk by profession, whose marvellous watercolours of frogs and
mice in motion, skipping and leaping about, or at supper, looking like
bloated bon viveurs in their ridiculous 18th century costumes, accompanied
his 'Toy Books' of the 1880s.
Caldecott is scarcely in print these days and certainly not in editions that
show his achievements off to any advantage; and that is a tragedy because,
from the evidence available in this exhibition, he was perhaps the most
influential illustrator of the 19th century. And evidence of that enduring
influence is to be found in almost every new picture book for children
involving anthropomorphised animals on the run.
Once Upon A Time, an exhibition of children's bookillustrations, is on
display at the National Gallery of Scotland, The Mound, Edinburgh, until
December 27

FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Before and after Munch - William Packer reviews the
Scandinavian exhibition at the Baribcan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS dangerous but irresistible to generalise on national, even
pan-national character and sensibility. We tell ourselves how unreasonable
it is to expect two people, let alone millions, to act and think and feel
alike, and yet we happily go on as though Latin volatility, British phlegm,
or Gallic charm were established, concrete, verifiable facts. And here we
have Border Crossings at the Barbican doing just such a thing, bringing
together the work of 14 artists from the five Nordic countries, from the
late 19th century to the present, to see what, if anything, they have in
common.
Tender is the North, the umbrella title of the current festival in London of
the arts in Scandinavia, addresses by direct contradiction the similarly
generalised assumption that the far North is dark and dreary, its peoples
gloomy and angst-ridden. And here within it, Border Crossings oddly sets out
to prove the opposite, that the prejudice might well be truth. The show does
not start with Munch, but it presents him in strength, and what with the
fine exhibition of his work of the 1890s, 'The Frieze of Life', running at
the National Gallery, which I reviewed last Tuesday week, it is a prejudice
hard to gainsay.
Whatever we might have to say about his work, Munch was, to say the least,
emotionally unstable, most especially through the 1890s and 1900s, ending up
in a sanatorium. And he used his work in this period as the direct
expression of his problems, if not their therapeutic resolution, taking on
the universal subjects of love and sexuality, death and despair. The
difficulty is that, in the arbitrary way of international reputation, Munch
has been celebrated not merely as Norway's, indeed Scandinavia's greatest
artist in the modern period, but virtually its only one. What a model by
which to set a general character.
He did not spring fully-formed from nowhere, and the northern schools of the
19th and early 20th centuries remain grossly neglected by the world at
large. Within Norway alone, Christian Krogh especially, who was Munch's
teacher, and such artists as Munthe and Thaulow and Harriet Backer, deserve
far wider recognition. Krogh, indeed, directly and splendidly anticipated
Munch by some 15 years in the subject of the sick girl.
But even so, that working context was one broadly of social-realism and
domestic genre painting, with the sophistication of a romantic impressionism
creeping in. Munch, in the directness and freedom of his technique, and the
psychological intensity he brought to his treatment of his subject-matter,
was certainly far more radically advanced. Yet even in this respect, he was
never entirely on his own, which is the premise of this small but intriguing
show.
Its subject is effectively the emergence and continuation even to the
present day, of an expressionist tradition in the northern schools, more
particularly a romantic expressionism as much founded in a response to
landscape as to any human drama, and inclining ever more towards
abstraction. The first of the artists is Carl Fredrik Hill, a Swede, with a
series of surreal and symbolist drawings of dubious beasts and figures, and
some exquisitely rich yet simple landscapes, romantic in their desolation.
Then comes Munch's friend, the writer, August Strindberg, whose wild sea and
sky-scapes come as close to an emotional and expressionist abstraction as
anything of so early a date.
So the show continues, more or less chronologically, by way of Munch, then
Kjarval (Iceland), Weie (Denmark), Sallinen (Finland), Jorn (Denmark),
Lundquist (Sweden) and others, and so on to the present generation with Per
Kirkeby (Denmark), Jenssen (Norway) and Marika Makela (Finland). These last
are all abstract painters, but their work is fraught with landscape or
organic associations. Here Sigudur Gudmunsson (Iceland), is technically an
odd-man-out, though not in spirit, working playfully in the landscape, with
the photograph at once record and resolution of his intervention.
Iceland is strongly represented in this exhibition, as in the festival at
large, to an extent remarkable for a national population no larger than that
of Plymouth. That presence is further confirmed by a programme of
exhibitions and events elsewhere in London, that continues until December
15, under the title of Art from Above, notably an extensive group show of
painting, craft and sculpture at Butler's Wharf, SE1, just downstream from
Tower Bridge.
Border Crossings: 14 Scandinavian Artists; Barbican Art Gallery, until
February 7, as part of the festival of Scandinavian Arts, Tender is the

<TEXT>
THE TURNER Prize fulfils one of its major aims in getting contemporary art,
and the Tate Gallery, widely discussed, usually unfavourably. Much of the
criticism is blinkered, but as the sculptor Grenville Davey collected his
Pounds 20,000 on Tuesday night you could not help wondering whether the
claque behind the Turner was even more blinkered. All of the last five
winners have been sculptors, with four coming from the same gallery, the
Lisson.
Nicholas Logsdail, who runs it, has been largely responsible for the
currently exalted global reputation of British sculpture, but there must be
other developments in art happening in the country. Most people have an old
fashioned idea that art has something to do with paint: it would be nice if
an artist working in this medium was given a look in, among the short list
for starters.
It might also be a good idea to choose a work of art that a private
collector could buy: most of the previous winners, like Davey, produce art
aimed at museums. It is vast, public, didactic, impersonal. An opportunity
for change is presenting itself. Current sponsors of the event, Channel 4,
seem set to withdraw after 1993. A new sponsor, a new set of guidelines, a
new type of winner?
In the meantime grab your Davey, still modestly priced at Pounds
8,000-Pounds 20,000. Logsdail took ten calls on Wednesday from potential
buyers.
This weekend London should offer an extraordinary sight - people in Cork
Street. This brief West End thoroughfare has become synonymous with the
modern art trade, and modern art dealers like to be away to their country
cottages by lunch time on Saturdays. But pressure of events, namely a severe
shortage of customers, has encouraged them to stay open through until Sunday
evening, just this once.
All 16 galleries will be offering a bewildering array of art, from the pop
screenprints of Roy Lichtenstein at the Mayor gallery, which has been in
Cork Street since 1933, to the aboriginal art at the street's latest
occupant, Corbally Stourton. In between there is a figurative, traditional
'Sickert and the Theatre' show at Browse and Darby; Sean Scully and a whole
host of moderns at Lelsie Waddington's four Cork Street outlets; and so much
more.
Cork Street is putting on a merry face partly because dealers are sick of
sulking in lonely galleries waiting for the occasional browser and are going
on the offensive; and partly because it feels it gets an unfairly bad press.
'Cork Street' is used as shorthand for the art trade, which is going through
its worst recession for 60 years. But the Cork Street dealers, a varied and
quite friendly crowd, are faring better than most.
Only three galleries have disappeared and two were immediately replaced. Two
of the three went because the owners, Kasmin and Nicola Jacobs, got fed up
with excessive business rates and preferred to trade privately. Odette
Gilbert just folded, but her gallery has been taken over by an art book
shop, Atrium. In terms of numbers Cork Street is just one gallery off its
peak.
Most dealers reckon that trade has picked up since the devaluation of
sterling, especially those who cater for a mainly foreign clientele. Will
Darby, for example, has just sold important sculptures by Henry Moore and
Barbara Hepworth. Significantly he was handling both on consignment for the
owners; significantly both went to the Tate - museums are still buying in a
modest way. Other dealers confirm that there is now a trickle of business.
For Leslie Waddington the trickle has almost grown into a rivulet. In the
last month he has sold Pounds 2m worth of art, including paintings by Leger,
Dubuffet and Rauschenberg. But, perhaps ominously for the future of Cork
Street, the great majority was sold at Fairs in Paris and Hong Kong.
Waddington has already signed up for eight overseas fairs in 1993.
Waddington moved quickly to adapt to hard times, and over the past two years
has written down the value of his stock by 35 per cent, which he reckons is
the rough fall in the value of modern art. He has saved on staff and other
costs. As a result he expects to break even in 1993, and to return to profit
in 1994. The devaluation has prompted the change. A painting priced at
Pounds 200,000 cost Dollars 400,000 (the art world deals in dollars) in the
summer, and only Dollars 300,000 now. Hence the flurry of trade.
But it is has little to do with Cork Street, which is rapidly becoming two
market places. One group of dealers concentrates on regular British buyers
(many of whom, in the good old days, spent their Lloyds of London dividend
on art), while the others sell overseas. While business rates remain around
three times higher than in comparable art centres like Paris, a dealer like
Leslie Waddington, most of whose sales are overseas, must be asking whether
he really needs four outlets in Cork Street (plus one round the corner in
Clifford Street).
There is another worry overshadowing the Open weekend. The Government seems
intent on imposing 17.5 per cent VAT on the work of living artists sold in
the UK as against nearer 7 per cent VAT levied on artists in Germany and
France. For Cork Street, it is another unnecessary cost increase and part of
a vendetta against the arts world, apparent in the unsatisfactory budget
negotiated by the Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, in the recent
expenditure round. So go along to Cork Street this weekend and cheer up the
depressed dealers.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Books: My Book of The Year - Our reviewers choose the books
they have enjoyed most, published this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Reviewers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I CHOOSE Robert Skidelsky's John Maynard Keynes, The Economist as Saviour
1920 -1937 (Macmillan, Pounds 20.00). It is the second volume of the life of
one of the most influential economists and civilised figures of the 20th
century. Like its predecessor, it is admirably written and based on massive,
though unobtrusive scholarship. The 'official' biography by Roy Harrod came
out in 1951 five years after Keynes's death. It was a splendid book. But the
lives of great men need to be reassessed at intervals. Fifty years is not
too long. Much can be said today, especially about Keynes's sexual life
which Harrod felt he could not reveal then. 'Keynsianism' has latterly been
under a Thatcherite cloud but there are signs that it may be lifting. This
is not only a wonderful portrait of a man often described as 'the last great
liberal'. It is also remarkably topical.
ROBERT BLAKE
TO ALL those baffled by the mindless savagery of the present civil war in
what was Yugoslavia, I warmly commend The Making of Eastern Europe by Philip
Longworth (Macmillan, Pounds 40.00). He is of course not solely concerned
with Yugoslavia. His aim is to trace the pattern in a complex ethnic carpet
spreading from the Baltic to the Black Sea; and to this end, he has adopted
the unusual method of working back from the present to the past, to those
early Christian centuries in which unfortunately, the seeds of so many later
conflicts (eg between Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were sewn. This
may seem a cumbersome procedure, but it has resulted in a first-rate piece
of historical analysis; and I find Professor Longworth's comments constantly
illuminating, on a region of Europe which I had up to now thought I knew
reasonably well.
ERIK DE MAUNY
I CHOOSE Humphrey Carpenter's Benjamin Britten (Faber, Pounds 20.00). The
author trains his well-focused biographer's beam upon areas of the life
previously preserved largely in shadow. In doing so he manages to raise many
thorny questions (almost all of them incapable of clear answer, he readily
admits); in particular, it is the speculation about whether the composer was
sexually abused at school, and to what degree his fondness in adult years
for young boys amounted to paedophilia, that has already caused the book to
be so widely publicised. But this is not the reason why Carpenter's Britten
is so completely engrossing. Lucidly laid out, judiciously balanced, it
never allows the reader to forget that Britten is one of the geniuses of
music - which is why all the questions arise, and are worth grappling with,
in the first place.
MAX LOPPERT
MY CHOICE is The Granta Book of the American Short Story edited by Richard
Ford (Granta Books Pounds 16.99) because it is at once so idiosyncratic and
so pleasing - idiosyncratic because it ignores the whole history of the
American short story up to the Second World War and pleasing because it
keeps its eye on the object. Ford starts with most of the well known names
from Paul Bowles through Flannery O'Connor to Donald Barthelme, but the real
hero is Raymond Carver, whose contribution, embedded in the middle of the
collection, is a sombre masterpiece.
GEOFFREY MOORE
HOW CAN an author control his reputation after he is dead? Should papers be
kept or destroyed? Should the will bind the executors or give them
discretion? Ought the widow to have a veto? I much enjoyed Michael
Millgate's Testamentary Acts (Oxford, Pounds 27.50), a wry but understanding
account of how four famous writers prepared for the immortality of
biography. Browning left too many decisions to his son. Tennyson foolishly
believed that a pious commissioned memoir would pre-empt the public's
curiosity. Henry James spent years carefully reinterpreting his early life
with the benefit of hindsight. Hardy's friends preferred the nation's wishes
to his own. From these and more modern examples (including Auden, Eliot,
Maugham and Larkin) Millgate explains the techniques of literary myth-making
and how they can be rumbled.
WILLIAM ST CLAIR
BRONCHIAL asthma is beastly - volcanic sneezes, hacking coughs bouncing back
from rock-hard lungs, even newspapers are almost impossible to read. A
book-loving friend always bombards me with the latest paperbacks in the hope
 -usually forlorn - that one might hook me. This year he succeeded with the
paperback of Julian Critchley's Hung Parliament (Headline, Pounds 4.50). The
first paragraph, often the furthest frontier I reached when asthmatic,
pushed me on. I was gripped. I read it through non-stop.
J. H. PLUMB
IT HAS NOT been a year for reading new books, other than those connected
with my own subject, let alone buying them as a means of outfacing the
recession. I did, though, enjoy Miranda Seymour's study of Ottoline Morrell:
Life on the Grand Scale (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25.00). But nothing could
rival returning (for the umpteenth time) to Randall Jarrell's Pictures from
an Institution, which really is the Great American Novel, and makes life
better.
CLEMENT CRISP
NOBODY ELSE even reviewed it, that I ever saw, but the book I most enjoyed
this year was Pettibone's Law (Bloomsbury original paperback, Pounds 8.99)
by John Keene. It is a first novel by a former US fighter pilot, set in
Vietnam and written very much in the spirit of Catch 22. Better books may
have been written about the absurdities of Vietnam, but if anybody has ever
written a funnier one, I have yet to come across it.
NICHOLAS BEST
IN THESE days of dismal European news, I found Emilie Carles' A Wild Herb
Soup: The Life of a French Countrywoman translated by AH Goldberger
(Gollancz Pounds 6.99) a rich and life-restoring brew. A peasant-teacher who
lived most of her life in the mountains around Briancon, in south-eastern
France, Mme Carles chronicles through her own life story, (1900-1979) the
impact of two world wars on a peasant community. Her autobiography reveals
more about the complex politics of inter-war France than most historical
accounts. The translation almost catches the full flavour of the French
original.
ZARA STEINER
IT IS sometimes too tempting to nominate an obscure volume which no one else
has spotted. This year - in utter contrast - I am happy to admit that for me
from the first pages the great book of 1992 had to be Michael Ondaatje's
novel The English Patient (Bloomsbury, Pounds 14.99) which as I said at the
time on this page, is a masterpiece and had to be the Booker prize-winner.
The judges half-agreed with me. I stand by what I said and urge sceptics of
the Booker brouhaha to give this one the attention it deserves.
JDF JONES
I ENORMOUSLY enjoyed the account of one of this century's most famous
literary love affairs, that of W B Yeats and the Irish revolutionary Maud
Gonne, as told through their own correspondence in W B Yeats &amp; Maud Gonne:
The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938 (Hutchinson, Pounds 25.00). This
50-year-long romance and friendship had everything: longing, rejection,
passion, renunciation, rancour, envy, idealism, all set against a backcloth
of extraordinary literary energy and political engagement.
JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
MY CHOICE is The Medieval Cookbook by Maggie Black (British Museum Press,
Pounds 14. This is much more than a collection of recipes, 80 of them that
range from the Saxons' basic fare, frumenty to such delights as rose pudding
made with rose petals. But the volume's real point and joy lie in the social
history it contains; its setting of the medieval scene, its literary asides,
its magnificent illustrations, and its views on such topics as deportment,
medicines, dress, pilgrimages, bee-keeping, life in general.
ISABEL QUIGLY
FOR SHEER volume of fine writing enclosed within a single cover, you cannot
beat The Granta Book of the American Short Story (Granta, Pounds 16.99),
edited by Richard Ford. Forty-four of them, most good, more than a few
great, all of them demonstrating that the short story is alive and well in
the US. And do not let Ford's modesty in not including one of his own
stories fool you - they rate with anything on offer here.
STEPHEN AMIDON
FITTINGLY in this Year of the Danes, far and away the best book I have read
celebrates a great Danish artist, Poul Vad's Vilhelm Hammershoi and Danish
Art at the Turn of the Century (Yale University Press, Pounds 45). Vad is a
scholar who writes about paintings with a brilliance and delicacy foreign to
most art-historical monographs. From the first page, we are swept along by
Vad's intense commitment to fathoming the mind of a creative artist. And
what an artist] Hammershoi, who died in 1916 at the age of 53, is often
called 'the Danish Vermeer' - although there is more to his genius even than
that. For the pictures alone, then, this is a covetable art-book. But read
it, too, for Vad's portrayal of a melancholy Danish genius who, his face
always turned against the prevailing wind, must now be seen as an artist of
truly European stature.
PATRICIA MORISON
THE 1992 book which I expect to be still taking down from the shelf 10 years
from now is Sex (Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 25.00) by Madonna. Like The Sgt
Pepper LP it is a striking departure in concept: 14 inches by 11 with a
spiral back and brushed metal covers, it depicts a sexual odyssey - well,
all right, a sexual eclecticism - in photographs, accompanied by personal
jottings. Some parts are mannered, naive or embarrassing, but others are
funny, honest and arousing. Some of the photographs are superb (the
'Boticelli Venus') some hilarious (the straddled fish fountain) and some
erotic (the full page kiss with a long haired youth). None of it is great
art and some of it is confused. But it is utterly unlike any other book
appearing this year, or any other year.
CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY.
I ESPECIALLY enjoyed Kwame Anthony Appiah's In My Father's House: Africa in
the Philosphy of Culture (Methuen, Pounds 20.00), which provides an elegant
and lucid analysis of some of the problems of African cultural politics.
Discussions of African culture, he suggests, should focus less on identity
than on diversity. Engagingly, he emphasises, the value of such diversity by
affectionate reference to his own childhood: he grew up in Ghana, as the son
of an English mother and a father who was a close relation of the Asante
king.
CHLOE CHARD
MICHAEL Ondaatje's The English Patient (Bloomsbury, Pounds 14.99) is a
masterpiece. In an Italian villa ruined from the German retreat, a complex
story unravels of exploring the Libyan Desert before the War. The story is
rich in coincidence and disaster, sparsely told.  But is not cruel, just
unsentimental. Endless moments of truth make it a must for all who have
travelled in hard places and wondered why they are there.
GERALD CADOGAN
THE BEST novel to come my way this year was Death and Nightingales by Eugene
McCabe (Secker &amp; Warburg, Pounds 13.99), a dramatic masterpiece and a lesson
in verbal economy. It transports you bodily to Fermanagh 1883, and kindles a
curiosity that will keep you up all night. The religious divides of Ulster
are brought vividly to life, giving the reader a fresh understanding of the
continuing conflict. I expected it to be an obvious front-runner for all the
major prizes but as far as I know it has consistently escaped notice.
ALANNAH HOPKIN
I AM addicted to books on the visual arts and architecture. And some
subjects seem inexhaustible: so it is with Monet, about whom so much has
been said, written and shown; how can we bear any more? But there is more,
and I cannot imagine how we have done without it: Virginia Spate's The
Colour of Time Claude Monet (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 38.00) a decade in
the making, and dazzling in the result. Spate has produced an enormous
synthesis of political and cultural history focused on the immense oeuvre of
one seminal artist in his time.
MARINA VAIZEY
I BECAME addicted to David Lodge's The Art Of Fiction (Penguin, Pounds 5.99)
when it was newspaper-serialised; now here is the book. Lodge tells us
everything we ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask structuralist
friends, about the tics and tropes of the novelist's art. Deftly and
readably, the book roams from allegory to stream-of-consciousness via
aporia, metafiction, time-shift, suspense, magic realism and 40-odd other
headings. Here is scholarship made human, and illustrated with chunks of
great writing from Fielding to Fitzgerald. There has been no better populist
study of fiction since Forster's Aspects Of The Novel.
NIGEL ANDREWS
THE DIFFICULT, painful, tedious enterprise of observing friends dying from
AIDS has hurt the poet Thom Gunn into writing some of the most vital poems
of his life in The Man with Night Sweats (Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 11.99 or
Pounds 5.99 paperback). It is the most powerful collection of new verse to
have been published this year. Gunn has not been a poet who has ever worn
his heart on his sleeve; for many years he seemed all too content to
describe emotions in the abstract. The 1960s ambience and San Francisco,
where he has lived for the past quarter of a century, loosened his tongue
and his feelings. The sequence of elegies to dead friends, all named, with
which the book concludes, not only stares death in the face unflinchingly,
but also reminds us that for Gunn, an out-and-out hedonist, there is no
alternative to the lures and the delights of the flesh. Dead or alive, its a
hard road - but there is no other.
MICHAEL GLOVER
NOT ONE of the political memoirs or biographies, although there have been
several good examples this year, but a book by a politician turned
reflective: Denis Healey's My Secret Planet (Michael Joseph, Pounds 16.99).
Healey describes it as an attempt to explore his inner life. It consists of
extracts from writing that influenced and moved him, plus commentary. The
writings are diverse. Healey says that among his favourites are Wordsworth,
Heine, Yeats, Auden, Virginia Woolf, Traherne and Emily Dickinson. Yet you
will also find extracts from the memoirs of Ellen Terry. There was always a
reflective side to Healey: his reading and his memory are prolific, not only
in English. It is good to find him enjoying himself and finally shedding the
reputation of the old bruiser. He ends with lines from Traherne: 'This busy,
vast enquiring Soul/Brooks no Control:/'Tis hugely curious too.'
MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
MY BOOK of the year is a provocative piece of political incorrectness
entitled The Seven Fat Years and How to Do It Again (The Free Press, Pounds
15.99), a brilliant defence of President Reagan's 1980s supply-side economic
reforms by Bob Bartley. He points out that in the seven fat years in which
American real GNP grew 31 per cent, 18 million new jobs were created,
charitable giving increased, and the tax burden on lower income groups fell
and their real incomes rose compared with the previous half-decade. At a
time when the best lessons of the 1980s threaten to become unlearned,
Bartley's book provides a seasonal pick-me-up for supply-side fogies
everywhere.
MARK ARCHER
AMONG the books that most significantly alert and instruct us this year are
Edward de Grazia's Girls Lean Back Everywhere (Constable Pounds 19.95) about
censorship and the arts, and Helena Kennedy's Eve Was Framed (Chatto and
Windus, Pounds 16.99) about the difficulties experienced by women in
conflict with the British criminal justice system. But for my prime
selection I nominate PN Furbank's Diderot (Secker and Warburg, Pounds
25.00), an insightful study, by an exemplary biographer, of an outstanding
man in an outstanding age. Wide learning is gracefully purveyed in this
account of admirable endeavours and ideals - a discerning reader's delight.
AC GRAYLING
I HAVE a soft spot for novels like E M Forster's The Longest Journey that
re-create the period when an individual takes his first heady sips of adult
freedom at some college or university. It is a time of life when the
ultimate questions that have perplexed thinkers throughout the centuries
coincide with a continual pondering of more immediate amorous prospects; the
two trains of thought merge together intoxicatingly in a painful wonderland.
Donna Tartt has, in her first novel, The Secret History (Viking Pounds
15.99) made a glowing addition to this genre. I am happy to give it my
accolade in return for the happiness it gave me. Her Vermont collegers and
their classics tutor-guru are uncompromisingly elitist cultural snobs, some
of whom have far too much money for their own good. They are utterly
ruthless beneath the surface charm. They represent everything we are taught
nowadays not to admire. Was it because of that I adored it so much?

FT  28 NOV 92 / Travel: A Moslem outpost of the Chinese empire - Peter
Harris drinks tea with old men in Dali, in China's south-west province of
Yunnan, and listens to a tea planter's stories of his life and times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an old Chinese saying that heaven is high and the emperor far away.
In China you cannot get much further from the emperor (or rather, Deng
Xiaoping), than the town of Dali in the south-west province of Yunnan,
across the border from Burma.
The old town gates of Dali can be seen for miles around, rising from the
plains. The town is flanked on one side by a long narrow lake, and on the
other by a ridge of hills running north from a mountain called Buddha Peak.
It is located on a major road junction, one branch going north to Tibet, the
other south to the Burmese border. The road south is the original Burma
road, which Allied lorries plied 50 years ago to supply the Chinese
nationalists, holed up by the Japanese in Chungking.
Nowadays the main travellers to Dali are traders from south China, Tibet and
Burma, and backpackers from Australia, Germany and elsewhere. The
backpackers give the town an oddly familiar air. Signs in English hang from
wooden house frames, advertising bicycles for hire and eggs for breakfast.
Weary, suntanned travellers sit in open-air cafes nursing bottles of local
beer. Women of the local Bai minority clad in vivid blue costumes and
head-dresses catch you by the arm, smile disarmingly, and ask in English:
'Change money?'
'When I first came to Dali, I loved it,' the Cantonese who served me coffee
and rolls in the cafe near the hotel, told me on my first morning. One of a
growing number of people from south China who roam around looking for casual
jobs, he had been in and out of Dali for years.
'But now everyone here just thinks about money, and there's a lot of
backbiting and rivalry. As for these foreign travellers,' he went on, 'they
come mainly for the dope.' In fact, drugs are not much in evidence in Dali,
in spite of a growing cross-border heroin trade that worries the
authorities. Nor is there much sign of the money-making fever that is
gripping other parts of China.
But this remote outpost of empire has not been immune to the winds of
change. In the spartan old days, I was told, my hotel was just the Dali
Number Two Government Guest House. Now it has a new name, and a new look. It
is the Red Mountain Camellia Hotel, and sports a roof with gold tiles and
fresh paint on the eaves.
A huge, rambling affair, it is the best in town and good value for money. A
comfortable room with bathroom and closed-circuit colour TV - no satellite
dish here - costs about Pounds 8 at the official exchange rate, and on my
first night a dinner of mushrooms, Yunnan ham, greens and dumplings cost
less than 50p.
Dinner was served with a flourish by an ebullient chef, anxious to please
his foreign guests. He turned out to be an exception, though. On the whole,
service in the hotel still came socialist-style. The woman on the front desk
was amazed by my request to have my laundry ironed (no irons). And the maid
was equally bemused when I asked for my room key (no keys, other than the
ones on her key-ring).
The view from my hotel window included one of Dali's four Tang dynasty
pagodas, heavily restored but still elegant, and the courtyard of the public
library. Each morning the courtyard filled with old people going through the
slow, graceful movements of the Chinese callisthenic exercise taijiquan.
Less graceful was the clatter of machine-gun fire that broke the calm on my
first evening. This turned out to be a contingent of the People's Liberation
Army on the firing range of the local barracks. The army has a high profile
in Dali, in keeping with the town's frontier location. It runs a hospital -
on the basis of 'revolutionary humanitarianism,' as the notice on the gate
declares - and men in green uniforms and plimsolls are to be seen on the
outskirts of town planting trees and digging ditches.
The guidebooks say Dali dates back 3,000 years. It was a flourishing kingdom
during the Tang and Song dynasties, after which it was overrun by Kublai
Khan and the Mongols. One legacy of Dali's history is that most of its
inhabitants are Moslem. There are two delapidated mosques tucked away on the
west side of town, both of them in the Chinese style, with a large prayer
hall and an imam but no minarets.
One of them was full of old men drinking tea and gossiping when I dropped
in. A sheet of red paper was pinned on the front door. Usually, in China,
red paper is used for messages and slogans from the communist party. But
this displayed a list of the names of local Moslems who had given money for
the mosque's upkeep.
The centre of Dali's old town is a delightful place in which to stroll.
Unlike most Chinese cities it is virtually free of traffic, and consists of
narrow cobbled streets, secluded courtyard homes and noisy street markets.
The markets sell hats and sweatshirts made from the local blue-dyed cloth,
and cups and bowls cut from the local marble (known throughout China as Dali
stone). An enterprising Tibetan has a permanent art show ('The Neeman
Gallery') at the Dali museum, with oils by masters of the Yunnan School on
display. Their work, better known in New York than Dali, is a cross between
Miro, Gauguin and the murals on the London Underground.
Beyond the old city gates, on the outskirts of town, are the homes of the
Bai people. The Bai's two-storey houses are in striking contrast to the drab
brick dwellings of the local Han Chinese. Bai houses are trim and
whitewashed, with carved wooden balconies overlooking well-kept vegetable
and flower gardens. It is some time since I have seen an English country
garden, and I must confess the sight of these gardens warmed my heart.
Above the Tang pagodas to the west of Dali are fine walks in the hills. On
my second day I found my way up through an Islamic graveyard scattered with
Arabic epitaphs to a secluded stone pathway winding into the forest. It was
like a poem by the great Tang poet Wang Wei - rather, it would have been if
there had been a temple at the top.
Instead, all I found was a stone wall and a space full of bracken. I assumed
this was the work of Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. Certainly
Dali suffered a great deal of damage then, or so I was told by a local tea
planter, who stopped me on my way up. He told me stories of his life and
times, and ended up asking whether I was a Christian or a communist. (For
some reason it seems I had to be one or the other).
More adventurous holidaymakers can take boats across the lake, hire
horse-drawn carriages, or hike to the many historic sites scattered around
the Dali region. The only real problem with Dali is getting there. The best
bet is probably the 12-hour trip on the Polish-made night bus that plies the
Burma road from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province. There are also
taxis and minibus tours, but the latter have to be fixed in advance.
A railway line, an airport and a luxury hotel by the lake are all in the
planning stage. If and when they are built - the rail line will have to be
cut through mountainous terrain - Dali's tourism industry will boom.
The town will also lose much of its present sleepy appeal. Doubtless,
though, the Bai women will learn to smile even more disarmingly than they do
at present.
Air China and Dragon Air fly from Hong Kong to Kunming. The best hotel in
Kunming, where travel to Dali can be arranged, is the King World, Kunming,
fax: (0871)-31910, tel: (0871)-38888. Telephone for the Red Mountain
Camellia (Hong Shan Cha) Hotel in Dali: (0872)-70427, but lines are poor and
reservations best made through an agent in Kunming or Hong Kong.
Malaria has been reported from Yunnan, and some doctors advise travellers in
the area to take prophylactics.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Travel: Nepal beckons keen trekkers - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE many reasons to go to Nepal, but trekking is one of the best.
Whether your aim is to live out macho fantasies as a latter-day Edmund
Hillary or to amble lackadaisically through the Himalayan foothills, Nepal -
home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks - offers an unmatched range of
options.
There are two basic types of trek. First is the teahouse variety where one
follows well-worn mountain paths, staying at lodges-cum-restaurants dotted
along the way. Teahouse expeditions suit independently-minded travellers who
are wary of joining a group. Staying in lodges may also bring you into
closer contact with the Nepalese who inhabit the mountains in surprisingly
large numbers.
For the first-time trekker, going it alone effectively confines you to two
regions - the Annapurnas and the hills around Khatmandu. The latter is often
overlooked, but offers scenic rewards. Going to Everest alone is possible,
but tricky.
About three-quarters of trekkers make for Annapurna, an area of often
spectacular beauty where lurid green rice terraces, yellow bamboo, white
mountains and yelling children vie for your attention. Annapurna treks start
in Pokhara, an eight-hour bus journey or a short flight west of Khatmandu.
Flying (Pounds 40) affords magnificent views. Book early and ask for a seat
on the right of the aircraft.
You will need a trekking permit (which includes a conservation fee),
available from the central immigration office in Khatmandu or Pokhara. The
latter is reputed to be slightly saner.
There are several Annapurna treks, the best-known of which are the Annapurna
Sanctuary (9-12 days), the Jomosom trek (14 days) and the Annapurna Circuit
(16-21 days). You may wish to hire porters (Pounds 3 a day) and an
English-speaking guide (Pounds 5). Ask at any Pokhara hotel or trekking
agency.
Mountain lodges, which are fairly spartan, are unlikely to cost more than
Pounds 5 including food. Accommodation is usually in dormitories (there are
some double rooms) and you will need a sleeping bag. Other essential items
to take include trainers (or worn-in hiking boots), sturdy backpack, torch,
medical kit, high-factor suntan cream, hat or cap, waterproof jacket,
lightweight pullover and sunglasses.
The alternative to going it alone is to join a group, which makes it much
easier to visit Everest and remoter areas in the east and west.
Expeditions with Sherpa guides and porters are generally more luxurious than
the teahouse alternative. Porters carry your backpack, tents are erected for
you, food prepared and tea and hot water (for washing) brought to your
tentside in the morning. Food, usually prepared on kerosene burners to avoid
deforestation, is often surprisingly sophisticated.
I went with London-based Promotion Nepal (tel: 071-229-3528), which offers
treks in all parts of the country. Its Classic Everest Trek (Pounds 886 for
20 days) approaches the mountain from Solu, the route followed by Edmund
Hillary in 1953, and ascends the Khumbu region to 18,000ft. A 28-day trek on
the Tibetan border of far western Nepal works out at Pounds 1,595 per
person. International flights on Royal Nepal Airlines cost a further Pounds
630.
Sherpa Expeditions (081-577-2717) grades its treks: A-types take less than
eight days and can be tackled by anyone able to run for a bus, while D's
(the most difficult) are for hardy souls used to mountain walking. Sherpa's
Manaslu High Trek (21 days' walking) visits a previously restricted area in
central Nepal and costs just under Pounds 2,000 including flights.
Other UK-based operators are: Exodus (081-673-0859); Classic Nepal
(0773-873497); Five Valleys Treks (0752-567617); Himalayan Quest
(0926-450835); Himalayan Kingdoms (0272-237163) and Worldsaway
(0373-827914).
The best time to trek is October and November when the air is clear and the
vegetation lush. December to February may be cold at high altitudes. In
spring you need to go quite high to get above the haze. Monsoon time (June
to late-September) should be avoided unless you like leeches.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Motoring: First glimpse of a star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
THIS IS the first officially-leaked picture of the Xantia, Citroen's
upper/medium-segment car that will be one of the stars of the Geneva show in
March. But while it succeeds the BX - the first of the marque that ordinary
motorists, although not car buffs, took to their hearts - the Xantia is more
than a mere replacement.
Citroen says the elegantly styled Xantia will compete with the Ford Sierra
(and, one assumes, its successor, the Mondio), Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel
Vectra), BMW 3-Series, Nissan Primera and Toyota Carina E. To avoid a family
squabble, Citroen does not mention the Peugeot 405, with which it shares
components.
The Xantia, at 14ft 6in (4.44 metres) long, is bigger than the BX which
comes between. It will go on sale in France in March, with a choice of three
petrol engines: 1.8-litre, 103 horsepower; two-litre, 123 hp; or two-litre,
16-valve 155 hp. Diesels will follow quickly and an estate car will come
later.
The top Xantia models will have computer-controlled Hydractive suspension
like that of the big XM. Cheaper Xantias will be steel-sprung, but all will
have the passive rear-wheel steering sytem which gives the smaller ZX models
such good handling.
A lot can happen in the next nine months, but you can be sure the Xantia
will be priced keenly when it arrives in the UK next summer.
EUROPE'S Car of the Year 1993 is the British-made Nissan Micra super-mini.
It beat the even smaller Fiat Cinquecento by 338 votes to 304.
While I picked the winner last week, I would have lost money on place bets.
I thought the Fiat would be third and that the runner-up would be Toyota's
Carina E. But the international jury placed Renault's Safrane executive car
third with 244 votes, followed by a brace of Mazdas: the plush Xedos 6 with
124 and the 626 with 101. The Carina E trailed in sixth with 79.
As Car of the Year contests go, it was no cliffhanger. The entries were on
the thin side and it was a pretty safe bet that, for the first time a
Japanese car would win.
Next year, though, will be different. Among the competitors will be
replacements for three of Europe's best-sellers: the Xantia, Ford's Mondio;
and a new Mercedes 190.
'A tremendous accolade for the new car and everyone at Nissan in Britain who
contributed to its design,' said a jubilant Ian Gibson, the Nissan Motor
Manufacturing (UK) managing director.
Yet , while the award does not guarantee commercial success. If the winner
is not perceived as the best buy in its class, having the title will not
make it a profitable product.
Being Car of the Year did not help the NSU Ro80, Chrysler Alpine and
Horizon, Rover 3500, Renault 9, Lancia Delta and Fiat Tipo to keep their
makers in the black.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Property: How to make life less rewarding for Burglar Bill -
Charles Patmore looks at ways to keep your home safer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES PATMORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO NOT spend your money on elaborate locks and bolts, whatever home security
advertisements claim, because burglars say that locks rarely stop them. This
is a surprising but consistent finding from a growing body of research based
on interviews with burglars themselves.
But while you cannot stop burglars once they have picked your home, the same
research offers clear guidance for avoiding getting chosen in the first
place.
Cambridge University researcher Dr Trevor Bennett pioneered this research
through interviewing convicted burglars. By discussing video recordings of
houses or going for walks with them, he investigated their rationale for
choosing particular homes.
'They just weren't interested in whether there were security locks, for
instance, or certain types of window,' Bennett says. 'They generally said
that they would be able to overcome any problems that these aspects of the
house represented. So, beyond a minimum level of security, locks give only
limited benefit.'
If there were troublesome locks, for instance, the burglars said there were
invariably other points for entry. As one put it: 'if you want to get in,
you will get in. There's no lock in the world going to stop you.'
Deterring them from choosing your house is, therefore, likely to be more
effective. 'Whether a house seemed occupied was the factor which influenced
burglars' decision-making most', says Bennett. 'From what they told us,
effective deterrents would be things like house lights programmed to go on
and off at random at night, and all the old advice about removing milk
bottles and not giving cues that you're on holiday.'
But the burglar also needs the opportunity to operate unseen. Anything which
hides suspicious actions from view helps him, be it thick front hedges,
porches, or unhindered access to the rear of the house.
Bennett notes: 'Stopping them getting round the back is very important.
'Very many burglaries occur round the back of the premises. Burglars say
this is because of the cover which the house gives them. So, gates to
prevent rear access to the dwelling may be effective.
Besides blocking rear access, try making your home's exterior appear open to
surveillance by neighbours. That might mean some loss of privacy but, as
Bennett points out, thick hedges and high walls mean privacy for burglars,
too.
Although burglars seek homes which are empty, where they can work on doors
or windows unobserved, and without burglar alarms or dogs - conventional
wisdom, which burglars themselves confirm - a house also must look as if it
contains goods worth stealing. 'Burglars make an overall assessment of the
life-style of the people who live there from many, many, says Bennett.
'Rather than signs of affluence, burglars look more for care over
maintenance of the property.
'Often, they mentioned recent painting and repairs to us. Their logic seems
to be: 'If people care about the outside of their property, they're probably
home-lovers who'll buy nice things for inside their homes as well. If they
don't care about the outside, that's probably reflected inside as well'.'
There is a final, crucial influence on your home's vulnerability - how it
compares with neighbouring houses. 'We found burglars made an advance
decision to commit a burglary somewhere,' says Bennett. 'They would then go
to one particular area and select a house just from among those dwellings.
And the most attractive within that small group of dwellings would be the
one that they would go for. So, targets which were difficult would be
bypassed till they found something which was suitable.'
Burglars say suitable houses are so plentiful that problematic ones can be
bypassed with ease. As one of Bennett's informants put it: 'Why bother with
a house with an alarm when there are hundreds without them?'
On this reasoning, assess your home's vulnerability by taking a stroll down
your street. Make your own burglar's short-list of houses which combine good
maintenance with such giveaways as concealed access to doors or windows and
no alarms. If your house fails the test, then remedy the situation.
But what if everyone takes precautions? It is a pertinent question because
whole housing estates are being designed where each home features every
crime prevention feature conceivable.
Two years ago, for instance, ten south-east police forces launched the
'Secured by Design' initiative which offers a police approval logo for new
properties with sufficient crime prevention features.
New estates can only achieve this logo if they protect every individual
house. The overall lay-out must also promote mutual surveillance. Lighting
must be good. Footpaths which give access along the backs of houses are
excluded. Some builders even plan a deliberate age mix of residents, so
there will be people around on the estate at all hours.
If everyone shares the same precautions, though, won't this cancel out their
effectiveness and simply make everyone equally vulnerable? Or would burglary
be displaced altogether to other neighbourhoods?
'I can't answer that with certainty,' says Inspector John Houlgate, who
works on the Secured by Design scheme at Scotland Yard. 'It's arguable that
once everybody has a burglar alarm, it will cease to be a deterrent. But, at
the moment, there are enough soft targets elsewhere and I think the burglar
would move to other, easier neighbourhoods.'
Estates designed with anti-crime features create an uneasy, intimidating
environment for burglars. Some may be deterred altogether. Others may still
tackle a house, but in future avoid that estate.
'It may not deter every determined thief,' says Houlgate. 'But they know
places where they feel comfortable and unnoticed and, conversely, where they
feel the eyes of the world on them. We deter a percentage every time with
every measure we take.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Property: Sellers get a painful lesson - Instead of house
prices in Kent getting a boost from the Channel Tunnel, they're back to the
levels of 1986/87
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING house prices are a tender subject in Kent, despite the ever-nearer
advent of the Channel tunnel. It had been expected the Chunnel would boost
prices but this has not happened so far. Indeed, they are back to their
pre-boom level of 1986/87, which is roughly half what they were only two
years ago. That has been a painful lesson for sellers.
Richard Page, of Savills in Sevenoaks, cites two examples. Meopham Bank, a
Regency house near Tonbridge offered at Pounds 1.25m in the spring of 1990,
has just been sold for Pounds 550,000. Pilgrim House at Trottiscliffe, which
was sold in 1987 for Pounds 500,000, was re-sold recently at the same
figure.
Then there is Wardes, a nine-bedroom, Grade I-listed medieval hall/house in
four acres in the conservation village of Otham, near Maidstone. It is the
finest of several timber-framed houses in Otham and was restored in 1912 by
Sir Louis Mallet, the diplomat. There is a mural in the living room of a
stag being stalked by a hunter and a panther. It was painted by an
architect, Philip Tilden, to represent 'the unsuspecting income tax-payer
assailed on all sides.'
It now needs further restoration and modernisation. Wardes failed this
summer to attract a buyer for Pounds 450,000 and the house is being offered
by tender - closing on December 15 - at a guide price of Pounds 250,000. The
agent is Knight Frank &amp; Rutley at Tunbridge Wells (0892-515-035).
Having sold the Grange, a rundown, Grade II-listed 17th century house on the
edge of Goudhurst (which just failed to reach its guide price of Pounds
250,000), KF&amp;R's Robin Tillett is confident Wardes will find a buyer. 'We
are having considerable success in selling rundown properties at formal
tender,' he says. 'This will be the fifth since August. I believe going to
tender concentrates people's minds, and rundown houses inspire the
imagination.'
Meanwhile, the recent sale of another notable property at Otham provides
further evidence of the fall in prices. The 15-bedroomed Gore Court House,
set in 20 acres and listed grade II, came to market in June 1990 at Pounds
750,000. By the summer of 1991, the price had drifted down to Pounds
450,000. Two months ago, the property was sold at auction by Cluttons for
Pounds 317,500.
Nearly 18 months ago, I reported that the owners of the 428-acre Henden
Manor estate at Ide Hill, near Sevenoaks, had dropped the asking price of
their beautiful 16th century house from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3m because they
'now have a very real desire to sell.' That desire has assumed even more
urgency: the price has been reduced to Pounds 2m through Savills
(0732-455-551) and KF&amp;R.
Savills also is selling the home of journalist Jean Rook, who died last
year. South Riding, a six-bedroom country house in seven acres south of
Edenbridge is priced at Pounds 325,000. Howard Cundey (0342-833-333) is
joint agent.
'Prices have to be extremely sensible and realistic to achieve a sale,' says
Anthony Brooks, director of GA Town &amp; Country at Tunbridge Wells
(0892-542-711). 'People don't want to listen when we say that properties are
selling at 1987 prices - or even 1986 prices.'
He cites Sissinghurst Park, a Grade II-listed Edwardian house in 20 acres of
gardens not far from the better-known gardens at Sissinghurst Castle. It was
offered at Pounds 1.2m in April 1991 but now can be had for Pounds 650,000.
Brooks has just completed the sale of the six-bedroom Woodsden Farmhouse in
two acres near Hawkhurst for more than Pounds 250,000, reduced from its
original Pounds 460,000. Its former barn, now converted into a five-bedroom
house, is still for sale at Pounds 230,000, down from Pounds 325,000.
Simon Backhouse, of Strutt &amp; Parker's Canterbury office (0227-451-123),
explains: 'We have got through the pain barrier of explaining to vendors
that prices are lower.' He is looking for offers around Pounds 375,000 for
Tonford Manor, a Grade II, 18th century moated house in nearly six acres at
Harbledown, near Canterbury; and is seeking Pounds 285,000 for the
11-bedroom Colkins, a Grade II Georgian house in almost two acres at
Selling, near Faversham.
'There are a lot of cash buyers about,' says Mary Grieves, of the Canterbury
office of Cluttons. Acting jointly with GW Finn &amp; Sons, it has just
exchanged contracts at around Pounds 350,000 on Jossenblock, a Grade II
Georgian house in more than two acres at East Langdon, near Dover. But Peter
Bell, the Cluttons' partner at Folkestone, is still seeking a buyer for his
own Grade II-listed country house: Jacques Court, near Canterbury, for which
he has been asking Pounds 550,000.
Those seeking flats might, however, have better prospects - in Folkestone,
at least. Says Bell: 'Until 1988, we had never been able to obtain corporate
rentals here, but we let 25 flats at a time in new blocks to Eurotunnel and
Trans-Manche Link for their senior managers. There will be a slight glut of
flats when the last people move out in 1994.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Gardening: How to turn prose into a good mulch - A new
textbook for gardening makes grandiose claims. Robin Lane Fox finds one good
use for it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY SO often, gardeners sneak off to a work of reference. It may be a good
nurseryman's catalogue; it may be an informative issue of Gardening Which?
or the excellent volumes from Reader's Digest, published in the 1970s. In my
case, it is usually an earth-stained title by Arthur Hellyer, of which my
favourite is his small Pocket Guide, published under the aegis of Amateur
Gardening. This year, we have another choice: the Royal Horticultural
Society's Encyclopaedia of Gardening (Pounds 29.95, Dorling Kindersley). The
editor is Christopher Brickell, a director of Royal Horticultural gardens at
Wisley, Surrey. If I say that the many contributors include Hellyer, the
alpinist Jack Elliott, the tireless Roy Cheek and the rosarian Michael
Gibson, you will see that the enterprise is heavily armoured.
The publishers clearly believe that this is a knock-out blow. 'For amateur
and professional alike,' they tell us, it is 'the one and only practical
guide you'll ever need to own . . . all you need to know about every facet
of practical gardening . . .' It is the encyclopaedia to end all
encyclopaedia.
But on the shelves my old and trusted guides are still smiling. The new
encyclopaedia has a wet layer of eco-speak, nouns piled up like adjectives,
gaps, inconsequential bossiness and photographic oddities. In the old days,
Amateur Gardening was a magazine written in good English; societies of
specialist gardeners had members who knew how to use words. Recently, I
nodded with pleasure when the king of our travel writers, Norman Lewis,
recalled that his short list of formative reading included the bulletins of
the Alpine Garden Society. This encyclopaedia is horribly written. Nouns are
strung together like birdscarers on a line of polythene; trees are 'design
elements'; we are not designing gardens or views, but we are 'designing with
bulbs' or 'designing with trees'. One of the main features - which the
editor might call a design consideration - is called Creating The Garden.
Where Genesis was reticent, the RHS jumps in. It tells us to be 'creative',
an idiotic word: heaven help us if we choose the wrong 'cultivar'. After
hard days in the flowerbed, I sometimes picture the Young Cultivar, riding
south in some Border Botanical Ballad with universal pansies knotted in his
locks of chopped bark.
Do readers and gardeners have to flannel around with this awful word,
invented by botanists who had problems about classification? The
encyclopaedia has more than 3,000 photographs and I must say how much I have
enjoyed them. 'High brick wall supports magnificent purple swathe of a
clematis', but the wall is at Sissinghurst, Kent, (unacknowledged) and so I
happen to know that the clematis is the sky blue perle d'Azur and is only
purple because this ultimate encyclopaedia has printed a photograph which is
over-exposed.
'A mature rambler rose in full, glorious bloom', transforms a 'trelliswork
arbour' but I happen to recognise the arbour because it is my eldest
brother's (unacknowledged) and so I know that the rose is actually New Dawn.
When 'designing with trees', we are told to avoid flowering prunus if we
want to underplant it: at the bottom of the page, the photo and caption
applaud an 'informal walkway' of flowering cherries which 'draw attention up
and away from the borders which will in turn fill out and become the centre
of interest as the blossom fades.' What are we to believe: text or
photograph?
Sometimes, neither. We are shown how an upright conifer forms a 'tableau'
beside the blazing red leaves on a tree in late autumn: 'richly coloured
rose blooms' complement the 'golden tones of gravel' I'm glad I did not pose
for the snap showing how to dig with a straight back. Many of the
photographs and almost all the sketches of suggested colour schemes have the
look which appeal to the management at Wisley, but not to the great amateur
gardeners whom history will remember for their artistry. 'To display dwarf
conifers to their best advantage, add heathers to the planting scheme for
bright splashes of year-round colour.'
If this encyclopaedia is all we need, it ought to mention more things which
we need most in the 1990s. Protection in winter is discussed and
illustrated, but there is no mention of Fibre Fleece at this point, although
this water-permeable blanket has changed the game for amateurs. 'Whether it
is a pot, tub or windowbox, any container is a potential focal point in the
garden', but why is there not a word about water-retaining crystals which
have transformed the 'maintenance consideration' of these popular features?
Throughout, there runs a seam of airy bossiness. The section on vegetables
is the best and some (not all) of the basic techniques are clearly
illustrated and described. However, about a fifth of this book is a painful
statement of the obvious, often in the passive voice, leading up to cheery
imperatives which command the self-evident.
'Tulips and daffodils are highly valued for the bold splashes of colour they
bring to the garden in spring.' Or 'containerised trees are long term
features, so use containers that are durable and attractive.' Some
suggestions seem odd. We are invited to plant a honeysuckle up a Clematis
armandii, although honeysuckle will try to throttle it; we are advised to
plant mixed hedges of different species but 'species used must have similar
rates of growth if over-vigorous species are not to dominate.' Why not tell
us which species grow at a similar rate?
I am tempted to quote the ultimate encyclopaedia on cottage gardens, but the
section on Restoring Old Historic Gardens seems more apt for authors or
readers who fear they may need no other book.
'If renovating or restoring an old and historic garden the work will vary
widely . . . as well as surveying the site and assessing the condition of
the main features (see 'Appraising the site' page 15) try to research the
history and development of the garden . . . clearing paths, steps and other
hard elements may also be helpful . . . unusual plants may have survived
such as rhododendron cultivars . . . if trees are diseased or dangerous they
should be removed (see 'Cutting down a tree' page 45) . . . lawns and other
turfed areas may not be beyond restoration. . . .'
To be fair, this modern reference book does omit one valued technique:
shredding the experts. If the creative aspect sections are disbound, waxed
paper can be laid horizontally on bare earth surfaces with fixatives and
will decompose as a mulch alternative to chopped bark (see 'Mulches as Weed
suppressants' page 574). You never know: your cultivars might love it.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Best of the year's book vintage -
Edmund Penning-Roswell's selection of books for wine buffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROSWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the greatest dry white wines in the world come from the village of
Puligny, a few miles to the south-west of Beaune. Yet, as Southwold wine
merchant Simon Loftus Puligny-Montrachet (Ebury Press, Pounds 19.99, 304
pages) shows in penetrating detail, its prosperity has not produced the
joie-de-vivre that we outsiders might expect.
Instead, it is rather sad, with a declining population, vineyards 40 per
cent owned by growers and companies elsewhere, fewer and fewer small
independent viticulturists, no school, no cafe - and a bitter rivalry with
Chassagne next door.
But this does not make the inhabitants, the petits vignerons and the owners
of the big domaines such as Leflaive, Chartron and Sauzet any the less
interesting or agreeable; and, over a series of prolonged investigatory
visits, Loftus has produced a fascinating picture, sharply delineated and
with a fine turn of phrase.
The book's core is of course the vintage (1988), of which he gives a vivid,
engaging account based on Olivier Leflaive's, with whom he has close
personal connections.
Even among keen wine amateurs there is often a surprising lack of historical
and viticultural interest in the grape varietals from which their favoured
wines are made, but Harry Eyres is editing - and Viking is publishing - a
useful, well-organised series of Guides to Grape Varieties (each Pounds
13.99) of which there are four new volumes: Chardonnay by Tim Atkin (366pp);
Pinot Noir by Andrew Barr (278pp); Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon by Stephen
Brook (255pp); and Syrah, Grenache and Mourvedre by Weekend FT colleague,
Giles MacDonogh (228pp).
Written to a common pattern, each contains an introductory chapter in which
the historical background and vinification of each grape is fully described,
with a section on the appropriate food to accompany it. It includes a
gazetteer, listing the countries or regions where the variety is grown, with
detailed notes on leading growers, holdings and output, a one-to-five
quality rating and relative price range.
Chardonnay is the world's most fashionable grape grown in 25 countries, yet,
20 years ago, was virtually unknown in the New World. Atkin is by no means
uncritical of the frequent heavy oaking of this grape. He quotes a typical
American grower as saying: 'We can't make Meursault in the United States,
but we can buy new barrels'.
Pinot Noir is obviously dominated by red burgundy, and Barr's gazetteer
includes more than 100 of the most notable growers and merchants, all
examined critically. He also pays close attention to the US north-west,
which provides the best opportunity to rival burgundy.
Giles MacDonogh's three varieties are grapes of the hot south. Syrah
originated in the northern Rhone, the other two in Spain. Less space is
given to production description as, apart from Syrah, the grapes are parts
of varying blends, but the 50 pages allotted to the Australian Shiraz will
be particularly helpful to its followers in the UK.
In Portugal's Wines and Wine-Makers (Ebury Press, Pounds 19.99, 229pp),
Richard Mayson says: 'Among the wine-making countries in western Europe,
Portugal has more untapped potential than any other.' However, as is clear
from his detailed, critical account of the table wine regions, they are only
now emerging slowly from a peasant viticulture, based on a large number of
local varieties and high-yielding hybrids banned by the EC.
In the Vinho Verde region, 80,000 growers are farming 25,100 hectares. Yet
there are growers and merchants with more advanced techniques and they are
identified and described. He also deals with port and madeira, delicious
wine which, he believes, may be facing terminal decline. This is certainly
the most comprehensive, well-written guide to the mostly unfamiliar,
inexpensive wines of the world's seventh largest producer.
Port Wine Quintas of the Douro (Sotheby's, Pounds 25, 232pp) is not just
another book about different ports and their shippers but a detailed account
of almost 100 quintas (farms) that line the mountainsides of the Douro
Valley which Alex Liddell visited. Although an ample index supplies all the
technical data, he mostly writes about the history, the farm buildings and
the way of life - until recently very primitive if not degrading for
inhabitants and workers, paid about one fifth of French estate vignerons. At
a time when single quinta wines are on the increase, this is an attractive
and agreeable read. There are 71 outstanding photographs by Janet Price, who
caught the severe valley between the excessive heat of summer and winter's
bitter cold.
After a century of post-phylloxera and economic devastation, the Midi, which
contains a third of France's vineyard area and produces up to half the
national output, is now beginning to look up. For it has 37 AOC and VDQS
wines and 63 local vins de pays - between them nearly 50 per cent of the
total.
Increasingly, a proportion of these 100 varying wines, all subject to
official regulation, will be found in shops, and Liz Berry's The Wines of
Languedoc-Roussillon (Ebury Press, Pounds 19.99, 179pp) is a timely work of
reference. Numerous grape varieties are described, and full technical
details given of the AOC/VDQS wines, the grapes employed and the average
output of each of the vins de pays. It also makes useful recommendations for
the growing number of visitors to the world's largest vineyard area.
The democratic way of life and EC membership has spurred Spain to develop
its huge wine resources: in vineyard size the largest in the world, but in
output a poor fourth. Few Spanish wine drinkers here have any knowledge of
the wines other than Rioja and Penedes but Hubert Duijker's Wine Atlas of
Spain (Mithell Beazley, Pounds 25, 240pp) covers the 39 districts delimited
on the Fench model. Excellent detailed maps are provided, backed by
comprehensive information on leading bodegas, as well as travel information
about sights and recommended hotels and restaurants. The illustrations, at
least one to a page, form encouraging appetisers.
As I published three issues and contributed to eight of the original 12 of
Cyril Ray's Compleat Imbiber, I should perhaps declare an interest in
reviewing The Compleat Imbiber, No 16 (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 16.99,
192pp). Almost completed before his death last year, to the end, Ray
retained his skill as a selector of widely differing items relating to food
and drink. Wit has always been prominent in the series, and there are
several examples of his witty verse.
Together, the contributions marry to conclude a multi-volume gastronomic
anthology of which the earlier volumes are in steady demand.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: An expensive whiff of smoke -
Frank Gray on changes in the Havana cigar market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY

<TEXT>
NEVER MIND what else Columbus did in 1492, so far as the Cubans are
concerned, he discovered the cigar. For those who are sticklers for detail,
the Taino Indians he encountered on the Caribbean island were seen puffing
some rolled-up leaves they called Cohiba. Anyone visiting Havana these days,
as I did earlier this month, will find much evidence of the famous admiral.
Columbus's presence is manifest not only in statues, busts and paintings but
in the Cohiba cigars made famous by his fortuitous landfall five centuries
ago this month. The name Cohiba, in fact, was revived only a few decades ago
by Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and was applied to a tiny selection of
special cigars destined for various heads of state and the diplomatic
community.
Cubatabaco, the state tobacco company, began giving the brand a commercial
push in the 1980s, but its creation to be the 'best-of-the-best' of the two
dozen or so famous marques of Havana cigars meant supplies falling well
short of demand.
In planning last year for the 1992 anniversary, Cubatabaco started to take
customer demand seriously by increasing output and broadening the existing
six-size range to a full family of 11 different sizes, the five new ones
simply being called Linea 1492.
This means that Cohiba now comes in all the basic sizes, but there is room
for further expansion as the market develops. No-one is predicting that its
range will be as varied as the popular Romeo y Julieta, which has 22
different lengths and widths. The new Linea 1492 types are known simply as
Siglo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or, in English, Century 1 to 5. Their lengths range from
4in to 6 3/4 inches, and their widths, or ring gauge, take a middle path
from a minimum 40/64th of an inch in diameter to 46/64.
These will add to the existing six sizes which form the outer edges of the
range - the Lanceros, Coronas Especiales and Panatelas at the narrower end
and the hefty Esplendidos, Robustos and Exquisitos at the other. Prices for
the full Cohiba family range between Pounds 5 per cigar to Pounds 15.
The Cohiba has generally been described as a full-flavoured cigar but the
various sizes and shapes will each have individual flavours thanks to
careful leaf selection and use of special leaves that have undergone a third
fermentation, which gives them a special heft.
Cubatabaco admits that one of the incentives to expand the Cohiba range came
from the departure from the Havana trade a few years ago of Davidoff, the
Swiss-based cigar maker. Most merchants take the view that eventually all
roads taken by discerning cigar smokers will lead to Havana, so the Davidoff
move to the Dominican Republic represents something of a risk.
Davidoff only shifted manufacture after a prolonged and complicated row with
the Cuban authorities, mainly about money, marketing and brand ownership.
This year, Davidoff has its 16 different Dominican sizes on the UK market.
These range in price from Pounds 4.60 apiece, to its top range Anniversario
No 1 at Pounds 20, one of the most expensive cigars on the market. Its
continued high prices reflect its confidence that its Dominican dash will
pay off. Smokers will have to decide for themselves, but a case can be made
for saying that Davidoff has bridged the gap between Havana and non-Havana.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: A guider's guide - Nicholas Lander
goes on his armchair food travels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AS A restaurant reviewer, I never lack for advice. 'Go there', 'Try that',
'You will never finish what's on your plate there'. But over the past year I
have been lucky enough to receive two pieces of advice I hope not to forget.
The first came from my counterpart at the New York Times, Bryan Miller.
'Never criticise local restaurants too harshly,' he told me, 'they fulfil
many other roles than just trying to please the critics.'
The second came, almost inadvertently, from one of London's most successful
restaurateurs after his business had been lauded in a national newspaper. On
the night the reviewer was in, two adjacent tables had to wait a long time
for their food. The review appeared on the same day as an angry, but
justified letter of complaint from the occupant of one of the tables landed
on the restaurateur's desk. This strengthened my belief that to do my job
properly I should scrutinise other tables as well as my own in a restaurant.
These convictions were reinforced when the last of the six 1993 guides to
the restaurants and hotels of the UK thudded through my letter box. My
spirits have never sunk so low as on the two occasions a publisher has
proposed that I write a restaurant guide and working my way through these
guides I am glad I declined.
Lunch in Liverpool would be lovely, dinner in Doncaster a delight - but not
on the same day, a routine many inspectors have to follow. Familiarity would
bring contempt and indigestion.
The Ackerman and Ronay guides are so bubbly that it is almost as if there is
nothing wrong with the quality of British restaurants. This is not a
criticism that could be levelled at the Good Food Guide. Comments in the
Harden guide are understandly terse because they are trying to include so
much information. Time Out's is aimed at the readers of its magazine and the
AA' s slightly impersonal voice is typical of a big organisation with an
extensive data base.
Two guides have sought financial security via sponsorship, two by accepting
advertising.
My strongest reaction to the sponsorship involved in the Egon Ronay and
Ackerman guides is that I feel both have been done so tastelessly. Ronay's
sponsorship list reads like a badly put-together menu: British pork followed
by Haagen-Daz ice cream eaten off a Wedgwood plate, the lot paid for with a
Diners' Card on which the restaurant asks for approval on a Cellnet phone.
Cleverly, Ackerman has gone for a champagne house's sponsorship but someone
has forgotten to tell the illustrator how appetising an open bottle of
champagne can look. Although Ackerman honestly details his restaurant
interests, his desire to include all his many friends in the business makes
him write about private dining clubs not open to the general public.
The two guides which accept advertising - the AA guide and the Time Out
Guide to London - are also the most comprehensive of their kind (in the AA's
case the heaviest, too). Given that the AA guide is weakest on London (not
to mention graphic design and layout), these two together would make a good
fit.
The Time Out guide is unusual, and perhaps most consumer friendly, in that
it has divided its entries into cuisines - French, Jewish, vegetarian etc -
not a practical option for a national guide.
The Good Food Guide relies strongly on readers' reports. This is a
structural weakness. However, Tom Jaine, the guide's editor, is undoubtedly
beginning to show his teeth and to convert the guide into something that
conveys information as well as opinion. The round-up lists are particularly
useful.
The difficulty of being as up-to-date as possible is a problem that has
preoccupied Richard and Peter Harden with the second edition of their London
guide. In the 1993 edition, the lists and the maps are improved but in an
effort to be comprehensive the guide includes details of restaurants that
were not open at the time of publication.
The Hardens maintain that these restaurants are the ones most likely to make
an impact in 1993 and are therefore what their readers will want to know
about.
My reaction is that the restaurants which will succeed in 1993 are those
which manage to please their customers regardless of pre-publicity. Who, for
instance, would have predicted that one of London's most successful
restaurants in 1992 would be a restaurant in Camden Town serving Belgian
food? Certainly not me.
Harden's London Restaurants (Pounds 6.95), The Time Out Guide to Eating and
Drinking in London (Pounds 6.99), The AA Hotels and Restaurants in Britain &amp;
Ireland (Pounds 12.99), Egon Ronay's Cellnet Guide (Pounds 13.99), The Good
Food Guide (Pounds 14.99) and The Ackerman Guide (Pounds 14.99). A useful
accompaniment to all these would be the 1993 Michelin Great Britain &amp;
Ireland Motoring Atlas (Pounds 9.95).

FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Burgundy, good but not great -
Edmund Penning-Rowsell assesses the merits of an early vintage and finds
that prices are falling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER AN early vine flowering and a warm summer, including a very hot
August, Burgundy this year had the most successful vintage of any French
wine region.
The vintage began in mid-September, a fortnight earlier than usual, and
before that in the Maconnais. A heavy day's rain on the 22nd caused little
dilution of grapes that were very ripe. Alcoholic degrees were high and the
red wines have very good colour and plenty of fruit. They and the whites are
rather low in acidity and probably will develop fairly quickly - or that was
the view of the oenologist of the Hospices de Beaune wines. In the Cote
d'Or, the crop was at least a good average, but it was large in Chablis -
indeed, it was described as outstanding.
To generalise early on about the quality of a vintage in the Cote d'Or and
Chalonnaise is very difficult because of the way the vineyards are parcelled
up and the deep divisions in ownership. In the Cote d'Or this year a good
deal depended on the growers' and merchants' views on the necessity or
otherwise of summer pruning: a recent practice in Burgundy, imported largely
from Bordeaux.
Robert Drouhin, head of one of the most distinguished Beaune negociant
houses, which also owns or manages vineyards, said that quality this year
depends on grape thinning, as did Louis Latour - although Claude Bouchard,
chief of Bouchard Pere et Fils, the biggest vineyard owners in the Cote,
declared it unnecessary.
Louis Latour's company thinned vigorously this year, but nevertheless made a
third more Corton Charlemagne than usual, compared with a normal 150 casks.
Thinning is an expensive, expert operation and another view is that it is
better to prune more severely earlier in the year before the budding.
It is generally agreed that 1992 will be accepted as a good vintage - good,
but not outstanding such as 1989 and 1990. Marginally the whites may be
superior to the reds; but it all depends how both were made. Those who
restricted their yields certainly produced the best wine.
The market has not yet opened; the recession and excessive unsold stocks in
growers' and merchants' cellar mean that it may not do so until at least the
spring, so it is premature to quote prices. However, if results of the
recent Hospices de Beaune's auction of sales of its new wines are any guide,
they will certainly be down. From their 1989 peak, the Hospices' prices fell
for the third year running at auction. The average price of the 567 casks of
the red cuvees was Ffr17,243 (Pounds 2,113); that of the 96 casks of white
was Ffr21,625.
Prices would certainly have been lower still but for the frequent
intervention of Andre Boisseau of Patriarche Pere et Fils, who maintained
his traditional support by buying 250 casks of the 663 sold: nearly 40 per
cent of the total. Prices were also influenced by the threatened Gatt trade
war. The US normally takes 25 per cent of all white burgundies exported but,
significantly, there was not one US purchase at the auction.
It was a Japanese company that bought the first lot - 10 casks of Pommard
Cuvee Raymond Cyrot - for Ffr60,000 a cask, though the second lot went for
only Ffr15,000. Although 110 more casks were auctioned this year the sale
total of Ffr11,853m compared with Ffr12,852m last year: the lowest since the
small crop of 1981.
Such steep falls will not be reflected in the Burgundy trade, which is
active at the regional and lesser appellations level. But in the Grand Crus
(Chambertin, Musigny, Montrachet, etc) and Premiers Crus (leading Nuits-St
Georges, Pommards and Volnays), business is very difficult, and for these a
drop of 10 to 15 per cent may be expected on the 1991 prices, though the
1992s are finer. At the end of the campaign year in August, growers' unsold
red and wine stocks were at record levels. They face not only cash-shortage
problems: with their 1991s largely unsold they have no room for two crops.
Unless the economic difficulties deepen, the first 1992s - mostly whites -
are unlikely to be on Burgundy shippers' lists until next autumn, and on
growers' until they have bottled their wines in 1994. Meanwhile, until the
more attractive of the variable 1991s can be selected by those merchants in
the UK that specialise in burgundy, the best buys for the consumer are the
1990s, in both colours.

Cookery

<TEXT>
GOOSENECK pudding is, I believe, a recipe worth waiting for. Which is just
as well, since I mentioned in September that I planned to make one with the
neck of my Michelmas goose, and some of you have been waiting patiently to
hear how it is done.
Gooseneck pudding is not, as one reader hypothesised, a goose giblet
variation on steak and kidney pudding - although that idea might be worth
trying. It is a pudding as in black or white pudding or boudin: in other
words, a sausage, the neck skin of the bird being used as a casing.
In First Catch Your Peacock, Bobby Freeman refers to Welsh cooks making
gooseneck puddings filled with goose blood, oatmeal and onions. These were
boiled, sliced when cold, and fried in bacon fat. In Goosefat and Garlic,
Jeanne Strang describes the far richer confections of south-western France
where goosenecks may be stuffed with foie gras, truffles, wild mushrooms,
wine-soaked currants and pistachios, and cooked in a deep pot of simmering
goose fat.
I was thinking along more English lines - a stuffing meatier than the first
sort but more modest than the second. And I planned to 'roste hym and serve
hym forth,' much as English court cooks did in the 15th century.
For pudding purposes, the neck of a goose is best chopped off as close as
possible to the body and close to the beak, as this gives maximum length of
skin. A busy butcher is apt to cut the neck only as far as it has been
plucked. But if you buy a long-legged bird - ie, one with its head and feet
on - you can pluck the full length of the neck and head (white ruffs of
feathers usually are left on purely for aesthetic reasons) and cut it
accordingly.
Even if the neck skin is long the pudding, when parcelled up with stuffing,
is unglamorous. Mine, admittedly on the short side, looked more like haggis
than the stylish Cumberland coil I had expected. Clearly, a swan-neck
pudding would make a more elegant dish - and I dare say it did in royal
circles once upon a time. But taste is the main thing, and I suspect that
the rich savour of the skin and the liver of a goose is hard to beat.
Start skinning gooseneck at the wide (body) end. Ease the skin away gently
from the flesh of the neck and then roll it back on itself, turning it
inside out as you do so - like peeling off a glove. This is much easier done
than said. Quite a lot of fat may cling to the skin at the wide end. Scrape
and shave it away carefully with a knife.
Remove the two tubes that run the full length of the neck: an elastic,
hollow, worm-like windpipe and a whopping gullet (I realise now how easy
force-feeding must be when fattening geese for foie gras). Wash them under a
cold running tap, using a bottle brush or teapot spout cleaner to 'chimney
sweep' them if you want to add them to the stock pot.
Use strong eyebrow tweezers or small pliers to pull out any quill stubble
that might remain in the neck skin. Sprinkle the skin inside and out with
coarse salt and set it aside while preparing the filling.
For my first gooseneck pudding, I used some of the meat picked from the
gooseneck itself (only scraps that were pulled away easily - enough remained
on the bone to produce a small quantity of light stock); the heart and
gizzard of the bird; two or three rashers of green, streaky bacon; and some
very lean belly of pork, well seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and thyme
plus a tablespoon of brandy for good measure.
As many people may prefer to save most of the giblets to make gravy to serve
with roast goose, my second attempt at gooseneck pudding used only the
liver, pork meats and seasonings. Not quite such a rich and unusual mixture,
but very good indeed nonetheless.
Either way, you need a total of 1 lb of meats (prepared weight) for the
stuffing. Chop the goose liver into little nuggets by hand. Mince or process
the rest to chop them more finely.
Wipe moisture and salt from the goose skin and, while it is inside out, sew
it up along the wide end. Turn it right side out so the stitches are hidden
neatly inside. Spoon in as much of the stuffing as the skin will hold
comfortably (but do not pack it too tightly: the pudding will swell a little
in cooking) and sew up the second end.
Leftover stuffing, if any, can be packed into an earthenware dish, covered
with foil and baked like a pate. If time is short or you have no neck skin,
the entire mixture could be cooked en terrine, of course, but that strikes
me as missing the point. The little ritual of preparing the pudding, albeit
time-consuming, is half the fun and the distinctive rich character of the
pudding depends on cooking it in its goose skin casing.
Rest the pudding in the fridge overnight to allow flavours to blend and
infuse. (You could probably freeze it, but I have not tried this).
To cook, check that the skin is perfectly dry. Rub it with a modicum of salt
and lay the pudding on a rack in a roasting tin. Roast for 50-60 minutes at
350-375'F/180'-190'C (gas mark 4-5), turning the pudding once or twice so
that the skin becomes crisp and well coloured all over.
If serving it hot, let the cooked pudding stand for around five minutes
before slicing. Carving is a joy - this is the stage when the cook's labours
are rewarded. The slices fall firm and neat from the knife. Suddenly, the
pudding looks professional and the contrasting textures enticing: a crisp
ring of skin encircling the solid, meaty centre studded with nuggets of
liver and fat.
Best of all is the eating. Gooseneck pudding makes an excellent first
course, and a very pretty one if slices of the cold meat are laid on
individual plates garnished with a few frizzy endive or chicory leaves. I
served mine with pickled prunes and toasted ciabatta.
Gooseneck pudding is even more delicious served hot. We tucked into it
greedily, served on a bed of potato puree, sauced with juices from the
roasting tin and accompanied by slices of lightly fried Cox's apple, mounds
of toastily fried bread crumbs seasoned with salt and crushed fennel seeds,
and clumps of peppery watercress.
This is rich and comforting food, and it would be more substantial still if
the potato were replaced by a puree of lentils, marrowfat peas or butter
beans. That is how I imagine it might be served to stoke one up for the
rigours of tramping out to midnight mass on a freezing Christmas eve.
The only improvement I can think of is to heed the words of Patience Gray in
Honey From a Weed: 'The best prelude to goose is oysters.' Half a dozen
apiece should do nicely.

wine. The books shortlisted for this year's award are:
Food: In Search of Plenty by Oded Schwartz (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 17.99); Real
Fast Food by Nigel Slater (Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99); The Curious Cook by
Harold McGee (HarperCollins Pounds 15.99), La Tante Claire by Pierre Koffman
&amp; Timothy Shaw, (Headline, Pounds 19.99), Vegetable Pleasures by Colin
Spencer (4th Estate, Pounds 9.99) and Dr William Kitchiner, Regency
Eccentric by Tom Bridge &amp; Colin Cooper English (Southover, Pounds 14.95).

One book that will never win any literary prizes but should be in the glove
compartment of anyone planning a trip to France is Richard Binns's French
Leave Encore (Chiltern House Pounds 9.99).
This is Binns's first book for five years because of ill health but it is
worth waiting for. He and his wife, Ann, have acted as researchers,

FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Independents offer most excitement
 -Jancis Robinson selects wines that are a class apart from the supermarket
norm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON TWO Saturdays near Christmas, I will devote this column to the better
last-minute wine buys from the supermarkets and the high street chains. But,
in many cases, I will do so with a heavy heart.
It is the independent wine merchant which is most in need of a sales boost
derived from column inches - and yet inconveniently, with name, address and
telephone number, it takes up so many more of them than the simple word
'Tesco' or 'Sainsbury'.
Pure price comparisons rarely flatter the independent, yet in terms of wine
excitement per penny, the better independents often win hands down.
Here are some wines I have particularly enjoyed over the last few weeks.
Their individuality sets them aside from what is all too often the anodyne
supermarket norm, selected not because they art too good to miss but to sell
at a certain price. The following are mostly red, mainly because so many
whites taste the same nowadays:
Domaine d'Escausses 1991, Gaillac, Denis and Marc Balaran, Pounds 4.99,
Madeleine Trehearne, 20 New End Square, London NW3. (Tel: 071-435-6310).
Imported from the Trehearnes' neighbours in France, the worst possible
recommendation one would have thought, and yet this was one of my favourite
cheaper wines this autumn - plummy yet complex and very well made from a
typically Gaillac blend of local grape varieties. A gold medal winner in
Paris and Toulouse. For drinking now (unlike its oaked white counterpart).
Syrah 1990 Domaine Fadeze, Pounds 5.25, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester.
(0206-764446). A distinctly superior oak-aged Vin de Pays from the Languedoc
that held its own when compared with a Crozes-Hermitage from one of the best
producers at nearly twice the price. For current drinking.
Malvoisie, 1990, Jacques Guindon. Pounds 5.45 Yapp Bros, Mere, Wiltshire.
(0747-860423). A real oddity from the Loire - scented, rich to the point of
sweetness but with lovely acid and concentration. A truly interesting
aperitif.
Dr Loosen Riesling, 1991. Around Pounds 6 from: David Alexander of
Maidenhead (0628-30295); Hampton Wine of Thame (0844-213251); Bottleneck of
Broadstairs (0843-861095); the Hazlemere Cellar (0843-861095); Philip Eyres
of Amersham (0494-433823), David Alexander of Maidenhead (0628-302950); and,
soon, the Wine House of Wallington (081-669-6661) - see what I mean about
space. A consistently lively Mosel demonstrating the usefully open character
of this vintage in Germany.
Cape Mentelle's stunning Australian reds, especially Zinfandel at Pounds
8.95 and Cabernet Sauvignon at Pounds 10.60 from Adnams of Southwold
(0502-724222). The West Australian mother operation of Cloudy Bay, New
Zealand's famous Sauvignon Blanc, is even better at making red wines to my
mind, and outclasses most Californians with its delightfully accessible
Zinfandel grape. The 1990 Cabernet impressed some fastidious French palates
recently, but both 1989 and 1990 were excellent vintages.
Ch Roc de Cambes, 1991, Pounds 75 a dozen, ex-cellars from Windrush Wines of
Cirencester and 1990, Pounds 11.63 a bottle, from Corney &amp; Barrow, London
EC1. This is Cotes de Bourg as you have never known it. Made by the
passionately meticulous Francois Mitjavile of St-Emilion Ch Le Tertre
Roteboeuf, Roc de Cambes provides the opportunity to drink exceptionally
well-made claret at non classed-growth prices. The 1989 was ridiculously
cheap and is already drinking beautifully. Roc des Cambes is unfortunately
no longer a well-kept secret and prices have risen, but it was one of the
few properties unscathed by the 1991 frost.
Ch La Mission Haut-Brion 1987. Pounds 144 for 12 bottles or Pounds 149 for
six magnums from Layton's of London NW1 (071-388-5081) or Andre Simon shops
of London W1 and SW1. This large independent has Pounds 3m worth of fine
wine to sell and La Mission 1987 is one of the best priced. One of the most
concentrated 1987's, to savour now and throughout the decade.
Domaine Leroy 1990 burgundies from Farr Vintners of London SW1.
(071-828-1960) Quick] Buy some of its tiny allocation of quite sensational
classics (at classic prices) before US wine guru Robert Parker raves about
them. He has already scored those from the Cote de Nuits from 90 to 100 out
of 100 so they sold out in a trice, but some from the Cote de Beaune remain
out of the clutches of those who buy numbers not flavours - until the next
issue of Parker's newsletter in December, that is.
The Wine Society Champagne, Pounds 150 a dozen, and Fino, Pounds 4.75 a
bottle from The Wine Society of Stevenage (0438-741177). This special offer
will hold until January and gives members Pounds 4 off a well-matured bottle
of champagne, non-vintage but based on the 1988 cuvee, from the delightfully
traditional house of Alfred Gratien.
The case price works out at Pounds 12.50 a bottle - a bargain for those who
like the idea of drinking Bollinger-like champagne at an own-brand price.
The Wine Society also boasts probably the finest range of sherries in the
UK. Its Fino really is fresh, and tangily dry without being a wine for
specialists only.
In the same week I was told by Tesco that any wine priced at more than
Pounds 3.99 a bottle was a struggle to sell, Fortnum &amp; Mason's wine buyer
introduced me to its 'house Pauillac', the delicious second wine of top
bordeaux Chateau Pichon Lalande 1989, no less, which is selling pretty well
in Piccadilly at Pounds 14.50.
Meanwhile, Morris &amp; Verdin, the London SW1 fine wine importers which I
reported on a month ago, concerning currency-enforced repricing, enjoyed
record business last month. Perhaps some people are beginning to realise
that the independent wine merchant is a breed that deserves our attention.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Malts to savour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SEVERAL years now, Oddbins has been the high-street leader for its
excellent range of wines. Its secret seems to lie in its openness to new
ideas as well as an adventurous young team of buyers who receive the very
minimum of interference from their parent company, Seagrams.
Oddbins has always had a good range of malt whiskies, but in recent years
its list has got better and better. Now, in the run-up to Christmas, it has
pulled a new plum out of the Scottish pudding in a range of cask-strength
malts.
The mention of cask strength naturally requires a note of both explanation
and warning. Whisky runs off the still at around 65 per cent alcohol.
When the time comes to bottle the whisky the strength is broken down to
somewhere between 45 and 40 degrees depending on the targeted market (the
lowest strength is generally reserved for Britain).
Most people put a splash of water in their whisky, even at 40 per cent, and
this is thought to make the whisky 'blossom' and reveal further aromas.
Kenny Fraser, the distiller at Aberlour on Speyside, merely rinses the glass
with water, adding that the few drops left clinging to the side will do the
trick. Nor should tap water be used. Scottish spring water is available just
about everywhere these days.
Oddbins cask strength whiskies are nearer 60 per cent so prepare to add a
little more water to your glass to bring out the best in the spirit.
Oddbins has selected individual casks belonging to the brokers Cadenhead.
They represent small quantities of different batches of whisky each with its
own distinct character. Some of these have been in relatively new Bourbon
casks which give the spirit a toffee or fudge character which for me at
least, detracts from the flavour of the malt. Others have been run into
casks previously used for Oloroso sherry. In some cases I found the fruity,
sherry character had overwhelmed the whisky.
Here then is my personal selection from the list. Some are released in
Scotland only:
Clynelish 1972, cask 5641, northern Highlands. This is the undoubted star of
the range. Like Islay's Bruichladdich, this is a sensationally fruity whisky
with a bouquet of strawberries and peaches (Pounds 35).
Glendronach 1970, cask 26 Speyside. This is something of a classic with its
aromas of honey, lavender and heather.
The cask 25 had rather more sherry character which obscured its bouquet a
little (Pounds 37.50).
Springbank 1980, cask 182, Campbeltown. There was considerable cask
variation here, but 182 was a clear winner with its redolence of burnt sugar
and bananas. On the other casks, the toffee character of new casks - or the
raisiny tastes of sherry wood - appeared to mask the basic flavour of the
whisky (Pounds 29.99).
Lagavulin 1978, cask 128, Islay. The iodine character associated with Islay
malts was unmistakable here, yet the whisky had a certain elegance of
structure. Cask 14 appeared to have a light intriguing sea-weed character.
Cask 127 smelled too strongly of new Bourbon wood (Pounds 29.99).
Glen Albyn 1975, cask 3344, Speyside (Scotland only). This comes from a
distillery that has since been demolished. Like Clynelish is is a fruity
whisky with a bouquet of apples, pears and honey (Pounds 33).
Talisker 1978, cask 2, Skye. Extremely peaty whiskies of this sort tend to
be an acquired taste. Tasting this might be likened to walking through a
hospital ward. An outdoor whisky: put a bottle in your pack before you next
go yomping. (Pounds 29.99).
Many of the other malts in the Oddbins range seemed to have overdone the
cask. The disadvantage of releasing individual lots in this way is that you
may not blend up the whisky to balance out these defects. Not that malts
such as Alt-a-Bhainne 1980 (Pounds 29.99) and Pittyvaich 1977 (Scotland only
 -Pounds 29.99) will fail to find admirers.
Glenugie 1980 (Scotland only - Pounds 29.99) had gone overboard on the
sherry cask, leaving it the colour of teak with a aroma one might have
easily mistaken for Spanish brandy. Clearly its owners had second thoughts
too: the distillery has been demolished and on its site stands a motor
mechanics workshop.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Sport: Gloucester glory fades into crisis - Rugby Union /
John Hopkins chronicles the decline of a club that has failed to keep pace
with progress and faces relegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN the years, watching Gloucester play rugby at home has offered several
pleasures. They nearly always won at their beloved ground, Kingsholm, and it
is so close to the city centre. When covering a match there, the routine is
to park in the cattle market or near the cathedral, lunch at Moran's, and
then stroll to Kingsholm to see the elver-eaters consume another hapless
victim.
Sadly, though, this last ingredient has not been available this season.
Moran's flourishes, the cathedral remains a brooding presence and the
spectators are as partisan as ever. But Gloucester, for years one of the
strongest clubs in England, are in crisis. In the Courage leagues, the first
half of which ended last Saturday, Gloucester have tumbled to a position
perilously close to the relegation zone of the first division. The division
is being shrunk to 10 teams next season so four of 13 members will be
relegated this year.
At the start of the season, the clubs that seemed the likeliest relegation
candidates were West Hartlepool and London Scottish, which had come up from
the second division; Rugby, which had just avoided going down; and Bristol
or London Irish. You would never have thought of Gloucester as being in
danger. After all, last season they were semi-finalists in the Cup and
finished fourth in the league. Yet, the unthinkable has happened.
They have played six matches in the league and won only two, the second
being the victory over Saracens at Kingsholm one week ago. They have four
points and are equal ninth with another surprising struggler, Orrell. Last
season, Orrell finished second in the league, level on points with Bath, the
champions. Now, they and Gloucester hover just two points ahead of West
Hartlepool, Saracens and Rugby. Tenth place means relegation.
The troubles at Gloucester began last summer when 12 men, including England
star Mike Teague, left to join rival clubs. Undoubtedly, some of them were
poached, attracted by offers of a better job, a car, money, or some other
inducement. Gloucester officials refuse to dirty their hands in what they
regard as a rather grubby trade. Theirs is a one-sport city and there have
always been plenty of good local players from which to choose. When
Gloucester faced Leicester recently, every player was born within 10 miles
of the cathedral.
'We will not break the rules,' says Keith Richardson, the club coach. 'If
the RFU change the rules then that is a different matter but, at the moment,
we abide by the present rules. If we do not run a centre of local
excellence, who will? Somebody has to. If others have different systems, it
is up to them. It would be a tragedy for rugby union if a club like
Gloucester were stuffed by this sort of thing because the worst kind of
people would then be in the driving seat.'
Gloucester's style of play has, however, been rendered out of date by the
new laws. They have always played to their forwards; but forward dominated
drives, moving upfield in 20-yard surges, do not work now because if the
forwards are stopped and do not release the ball quickly, then a scrum is
awarded to the defending side.
If there is one scene that sums up everything about Gloucester rugby club,
its style of play and its supporters, it is this. Picture a night of stygian
gloom at Kingsholm with rain slashing across the pitch. Gloucester win a
ruck or a line-out and the ball moves to the stand-off, who hoists a
steepling kick. From the 10,000 spectators comes a roar of 'Glaw-ster,
Glaw-ster'. Meanwhile, all the forwards and many of the backs converge on
the man who is trying to catch the ball.
'Gloucester used to be a club you measured yourself against,' says Tony
Russ, the coach of Leicester. 'If you went to Kingsholm and won, that was a
mark of a reasonable side. But that is no longer the case.'
At times like these, of course, everything that happens is for the worse.
Gloucester could have beaten Leicester in September. In spite of having a
player sent off, they fought back from 8-22 to 21-22. Against Wasps a couple
of weeks later, they had territorial superiority, only to lose 14-9. In
fact, they lost each of their league matches by one score. To cap it all, in
beating Saracens they lost Marcus Hannaford, their scrum-half, to a wild
punch. They do not have a reserve. It never rains, it pours.
Even at their best, Gloucester were far from all-conquering away from home.
At Kingsholm, however, they were well-nigh unbeatable. So, although those
losses at Leicester and Wasps hurt, they were as nothing compared with the
home defeat by West Hartlepool, which had lost all its previous league
games.
There were signs of a revival when, first, Welsh club Pontypool and then
South Africa's Transvaal province were defeated. Drastic team changes lay
behind these victories. Out went the entire front row - including Peter
Jones, who had played for Scotland last season - and in came the front row
from the second team, the United. The team that beat Saracens showed seven
changes from the team defeated by West Hartlepool.
When the leagues started in English rugby, they increased the pressure on
first-class clubs. With this season's change in the structure of the
leagues, which means that four clubs go down to the second division, the
pressure is increased even more. Thus, Gloucester look vulnerable.
'We have always said here that as long as we can keep our own players, then
we do not need to worry,' says Peter Ford, the chairman. 'But we lost 12 in
the close season. It may be time to change our policy.'
The leagues start again on January 9 and, in the second half of the season,
Gloucester face London Irish, Northampton and Bristol away and Bath, Orrell
and Harlequins at Kingsholm. They need to win two and probably three of
these games - otherwise, they will be relegated. This does not bear thinking
about. But it could happen if they are unable to come to terms with the
modern game - both its playing and its administration.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Sport: The Dollars 1m birthday for a player bred to succeed
 -Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a majestic performance. Boris Becker's destruction of the world No 1
Jim Courier in last Sunday's final of the IBM/ATP Tour Championship in
Frankfurt - a 6-4 6-3 7-5 drubbing that spanned 143 electrifying minutes -
ranks in my mind alongside Lew Hoad's 6-2 6-1 6-2 execution of fellow
Australian Ashley Cooper in the Wimbledon final of 1957.
In full flight, the muscular Hoad was a formidable sight, a supreme athlete
whose sheer physical presence dwarfed those around him. Even with a wooden
racket, Hoad's strength of forearm and immaculate timing allowed him to
flick his early winners with awesome arrogance. It is the same with Becker.
In his thrilling semi-final against the Croatian left-hander Goran
Ivanisevic that ended in a third set tie-break, his ability to return the
cannonball service with interest turned a close match his way. The pace of
shot from both men was quite exceptional and the lack of error remarkable.
'I don't think I can play any better than that,' was the winner's
assessment.
But he did, as Courier will confirm. Becker's spectacular victory on his
25th birthday earned him a handsome present of more than Dollars 1m
(incidentally, Hoad's amateur prize was a silver trophy) but, more than
that, it brought Boris the relief of a first big success on German soil.
Watching the emotional scenes in the cavernous Festhalle - the ecstatic
German supporters singing 'Happy Birthday To You', the smiling Boris holding
arms aloft and turning to each corner of the arena to acknowledge the
cheers, and then huffing and puffing over the candles on his huge birthday
cake in the shape of a racket, then the champagne, the speeches, the awards.
Watching all this, I could not help wondering if I would ever witness such
scenes in Britain.
It is a long time since Britain's men have given their country anything to
cheer. Magnificent as Virginia Wade's Wimbledon success was in 1977, it does
not compensate for the men's failure there since Fred Perry won the last of
his three successive titles in 1936. No British man has won a Grand Slam
title since that year. Roger Taylor was the last British man in the world's
top 10 - he was ranked equal 10th in 1970 - the first to achieve that level
since Michael Sangster in 1963.
Why can the nation which runs the world's most successful tournament no
longer produce any male players to challenge the world's best? The answer
can be given in three words: cricket, golf and complacency. It is a problem
peculiar to Britain and, to a lesser degree, Australia.
In both countries cricket and golf are part of the fabric of society, as
they were long before tennis made its appearance in the last quarter of the
19th century. In the period up to 1939, British and Australian players were
the equals of their American and European cousins to whom the game was still
relatively new.
With the return to normal life in 1945 tennis in continental Europe embarked
upon a period of expansion that was absent in Britain where the schools
devoted their energies to cricket and the wealthy turned to golf. Club
tennis limped along without any large investment in facilities. I grew up at
The Hale, Mill Hill, a typical club of the 1950s where tennis was the poor
relation of the cricket club. We shared a wooden pavilion built in the 1930s
where there were no showers, and we played on the bumpy old grass courts or
the dusty red shale.
Meanwhile, Wimbledon was investing in the future, constantly upgrading its
facilities to maintain its pre-eminence. With the continuing success of the
Championships, the Lawn Tennis Association did nothing to promote the club
game actively, beyond organising a series of county and national
competitions. There was no awareness of the need to provide improved
facilities or to promote the game against the claims of other leisure
pursuits - particularly the well entrenched rivals - cricket and golf.
In continental Europe, there was no cricket and hardly any golf. The wealthy
invested their time, money and energy in building magnificent tennis clubs.
It was the only ball game in town. While British tennis withered,
continental tennis thrived. Here are the figures to prove it. In Britain,
with a population of 59m, there are 2,426 tennis clubs with 225,000 active
members and 35,000 'rated players' who compete in tournaments. There are
750,000 club cricketers and 2.5m regular golfers. In France (with almost no
cricketers and only 214,000 golfers), the figures are: population, 57m;
tennis clubs, 10,000; members, 1.34m; tournament players, 160,000. In
Germany (no cricketers, 180,000 golfers) they are: population, 79m; 9,350
tennis clubs; and 2.1m members, most of whom compete in tournaments and
matches. Even in the Netherlands with its 15m inhabitants there are 1,737
tennis clubs and 750,000 players.
It is when you look at the indoor facilities that you begin to understand
why tennis thrives on the continent. In Britain, the 500th indoor court has
just opened. In France there are 4,000, in Germany 3,948 and in the
Netherlands 3,500. Now you know why there are nine Frenchmen, seven Germans
and four Dutchmen among the top 100 players in the world.
If the England cricketers Ian Botham and Graham Gooch had been born in
France or Germany they would probably have become tennis players. It is the
only hand-eye co-ordination sport available.
That is why the Lawn Tennis Association's initiative, announced this week,
to invest Pounds 63m in facilities over the next five years to bring Britain
level with the rest of Europe, is so welcome. When the base of the tennis
pyramid widens significantly then the top standards will rise through the
natural process of competition.
The imminent appointment of a director of marketing to sell the game to the
young people of Britain is another piece of welcome news. The moment a tough
kid with the talent and competitive nature of a Daley Thompson decides to
make tennis his chosen sport, then there is at least the chance that a
champion will emerge to inspire a real tennis boom in Britain. Perhaps it is
a little premature to reserve our seats at the Festhalle for the year 2,000
in anticipation of a British victory, but at least the prospect is within
the realms of possibility.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Skiing: Scaling the heights of gastronomic pleasure -
Nicholas Lander on the unexpected joys of ski-resort dining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASKED for my ideal job I would have not the slightest hesitation. 'To review
all the restaurants in the world's ski resorts.' Aside from satisfying my
desires to ski, see the world and eat well, the job would also contain
enough contradictions to make the finished report - and I would certainly
take my time about it - useless.
For the fact is that although you can eat wonderfully well and with
spectacular views during a day's skiing, some of the most satisfying meals,
while being exactly what you want, are not that special.
No matter, they are served at exactly the right time - usually after you
have fallen, probably more than once; failed to conduct yourself perfectly
on a ski lift; or were made to look slow and old by a posse of
eight-year-olds obviously born with their skis on.
Soup tastes as though your mother has made it. Pasta joins body and soul. A
region's local specialities - raclette, tarteflette, roesti - justify fully
your decision to have chosen that particular resort. And that is before you
move on to the cakes, hot chocolate or schnapps that may see you down the
last run faster than you had thought possible.
But how do these restaurants manage it? It is hard enough in normal
circumstances to hire staff and find supplies and suppliers. The only
apparent advantage these eating houses in the sky seem to have is a
relatively captive audience.
According to Annie Schwab, who now runs Winteringham Fields in Yorkshire but
who met her husband while running a restaurant above Zermatt when he was a
chef in the Swiss village, the answer is meticulous planning.
All the heavy items to the highest restaurants - wine, water, gas tanks -
must go up on the 'rat track' in the autumn before the snow has fallen,
although helicopters are being used increasingly. 'Skidoos' can take
supplies to the lower places.
The rubbish and dirty laundry comes down every night in black bin liners on
the 'blood wagon' used for injured skiers.
Staff is actually not a problem as all resorts are inundated with ski-mad
chefs and waiters, many from Down Under and keen to see Europe. The
restaurants in the villages get the pick of the crop, however. With their
main business in the evenings, the days are free for staff to ski.
Communication with the outside world - or lack of it during an electricity
cut - can be a special problem. If a restaurant does not know something
special is happening on the other side of the valley, it can be left with a
lot of food on its hands. And any restaurateur in the sky must realise that
after a fascht nicht - when bars and restaurants in the village can stay
open all night - he will not see many skiers the following morning.
Schwab says the food on offer in these restaurants has changed. Twenty years
ago, when those who went skiing were predominantly 'serious' sportsmen,
lunch was a prompt invasion that lasted no more than half an hour and
involved, at most, a glass of mulled red wine. Today, it can be champagne
and lobsters flown in live from the south of France.
But not for me, and not just on the grounds of expense, either. Last winter
in Morzine, perspiring gently and with my boots unclipped, the pleasure of
eating a local speciality cooked simply cannot be bettered by restaurants
which recreate the cuisine outside the region.
The place was Cousin Michel (tel: 50 79 15 06), a shop that sells local hams
and cheeses with a restaurant behind. After a morning's skiing we ordered
the local speciality, a vacherin roti, without really knowing what the
cooking technique involved.
They began by delivering platters of the local hams and potatoes baked in
silver foil over a wood-burning oven. Then, from the pizza oven, came a
whole vacherin - a soft, creamy cows' milk cheese - that had been roasted in
its wooden box. The crusty top was sliced off and the ham, potatoes and
bread dipped into the warm, runny cheese. This, with a salad and a bottle of
Mondeuse, the local red wine, was nectar.
On our last day I bought all the raw ingredients - vacherin, salamis and
hams - packed them in my suitcase and brought them home. I cooked them all
just as I had remembered; but without the sun, snow and sore feet, they
really were not that special.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Skiing: Turkish delights for skiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DOES the thought of soaking in an ancient and genuine Turkish bath,
followed by a vigorous rub-down, appeal as an alternative form of apres ski?
No? Well, there are other things you can do after skiing; and for those who
connect Turkey automatically with silk carpets, bazaars and long, sandy
beaches, it might be time to discover the country's hidden face: its winter
attractions.
The delights of Mount Olympus, as it was known in mythology, have long been
enjoyed by Turkey's rich and privileged, even though appearances tend to
outshine performance. For those in the know, a few runs on the slopes, with
a quick break for shish kebab, Turkish coffee and a soak in the sun, have
been a popular pastime since Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey,
decided that his country should join the International Ski Federation.
With its surprisingly good snow record and eclectic culture, Turkey is an
intriguing ski destination but, until fairly recently, it has failed to make
much impact on anyone but the natives (although most of them can only dream
of affording the money or the time to indulge in winter sports).
Then, just as British tour operators started to flirt with the idea of
skiing in Turkey, the Gulf war broke out and Turkish slopes seemed suddenly
to be rather vulnerable. Now, their star seems to be rising. After all, how
can you overlook a mountain range with 89 peaks, all over 10,000 ft and
within driving distance of Istanbul, one of the world's most cosmopolitan
cities?
The fascinating mixture of mosques and ski slopes is appealing and, for
those who want more than just snow and gluhwein from their holidays, Turkey
provides adventures of a different kind.
Uludag - 'God's Mountain' - is the highest peak in western Anatolia and, at
8,476 ft, is the largest and most developed of Turkey's eight commercial ski
centres. The picturesque village is purpose-built, set in national parkland
surrounded by an ancient forest inhabited by bears and wolves.
The dramatic setting, combined with skiing from your doorstep and a distinct
lack of lift queues, gives it many advantages over other resorts.
Thirty pistes, served by seven chair-lifts and six T-bars, provide plenty of
scope for beginners and intermediates and there is some quite testing skiing
off-piste, too. More experienced skiers could find Uludag rather limiting,
but there is a challenging mogul field and the more adventurous can hire a
helicopter to get to the summit of Mount Zivre (8,340 ft) where there is
virgin snow in abundance.
One of the main obstacles facing travel companies moving into the Turkish
ski market was the problem of lifts, and it is easy to see why. Most drag
lifts belong to different owners.
Music blares from loudspeakers attached to the lift pylons. You can take
your pick between the likes of Vanilla Ice's hit single 'Ice Ice Baby' at
full volume, or traditional Turkish music, to inspire you before you launch
yourself down a challenging run.
Uludag is about 140 miles south-east of Istanbul and was virtually unknown
outside Turkey until 1987 when Ski Turkey became the sole agent in Britain
for the resort. Even now, the slopes are practically deserted during the
week when locals are at their desks trying to earn enough for the next
weekend's skiing.
The resort offers lively, affordable apres ski including swimming pools, an
ice skating rink and a casino. There are plenty of bars and nightclubs where
Turkish staff are welcoming and generous with the glasses of raki.
At the foot of the mountain is Bursa, once the Ottoman capital and famous
for its thermal baths, green mausoleum and bazaar.
Most people get there by road but there is a cable car which offers
breathtaking views over Mount Olympus, the Sea of Marmara, and the minarets
and mosques of the ancient city which has some of the holiest sites in
Islam.
One of the main attractions of Turkey as a ski destination is the chance to
visit Istanbul's palaces, bridges, mosques and museums. The Grand Bazaar,
with its maze of streets and 4,000 shops, never fails to fascinate, even
when the strictly-observed Ramadan fast is in full swing in March.
Allegedly, many Turks put on weight indulging in midnight snacks during
Ramadan, by day the hungry look in the eyes of the Turks can make you feel
so guilty that you want to swallow your baklava whole.
Ski Turkey is at 316 Reigate Road, Bromley, Kent BR1 5JN. Tel: 071-495-4168.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Fashion: Queen of inspiration - Brenda Polan talks to
Vivienne Westwood, the fashion world's enfant terrible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH like to think of the French as culturally inflexible and, in
some ways, not least their chauvinism, they are. But in their concept of
culture itself and what may constitute one of its vital components, they are
much broader and more open-minded and experimental than the British.
So it is highly significant that it was in a modern art museum in a French
provincial town last week that Vivienne Westwood received a standing
ovation.
In Anglo-Saxon culture, the designer is artisan not artist and, should he or
she become uppity enough to forget it, astonishment, mockery, contempt and
ridicule will be the reward.
Vivienne Westwood OBE, twice British Fashion Designer of the Year (1990 and
1991), has experienced all that. She is used to it, but not inured. Highly
intelligent, well-read and intimidatingly (and, according to many
commentators, inappropriately) cerebral, she would say, before the British
fashion industry's tardy recognition, in a bewildered tone: 'I don't know
why I am not given the esteem I deserve. My clothes are wearable. They are
commercial.'
Yet they have never sold in large numbers and they have never made her rich
(although her ideas have made others so), and even as it acknowledged her,
the British fashion industry remained nervous.
It still regarded her, affectionately of course, as a creative genius whose
work needs to be interpreted by a less eccentric designer before it becomes
wearable. And interpreted it has been.
Vivienne Westwood is probably the most copied designer of the last two
decades. Her peers, the international community of designers, are unstinting
in their praise and, often, shameless in their borrowing of ideas. It was
the designer Azzedine Alaia, a man who acknowledges her overwhelming
influence on late 20th century fashion, who began the process which
culminated in adulation in Bordeaux when he invited her to show her
collections at his premises in Paris.
The audience smiled delightedly and applauded throughout as an enormous
catwalk was populated by the seminal fashion ideas of the past two decades.
First came the Let It Rock collection which dates from 1971 and her
collaboration with Malcolm McLaren, creator of the Sex Pistols, and which
evoked the soot-suited Teddy Boys of the 1950s. Next on was Punk (1976-79)
which, with its overtones of sado-masochism, was described by Umberto Eco as
'semiotic guerrilla warfare'.
Then the Pirates (1979-81), trigger for the New Romantic movement of the
early 1980s, swaggered on. This revived a late 18th-century cut which,
instead of following the lines of the body, opposed them, creating folds and
sags.
'I was interested,' says Westwood, 'in the effects of garments made from
squares of fabric, shaped only with gussets, and how such clothes affected
posture and movement. We tend nowadays to assume that people used to cut
clothes like that because they didn't know any better. They did. They just
liked the effect.'
The Savages collection for spring 1982 pursued this theme, but looked at
versions from the folk dress of other cultures. It inspired other designers
to experiment with asymmetric layering. The collection which followed,
Buffalo Girls (autumn 1982), was possibly the most influential Westwood has
ever done. She focused on the Indian women of Latin America, recreating
their layered skirts and petticoats, their bowler hats worn on top of a head
scarf, their sturdy brassieres worn over their blouses because, above all, a
bra is for them a status symbol, an expensive north American artefact.
From this moment stemmed all the various experiments with corsetry as
outerwear which culminated in Jean-Paul Gaultier's costumes for Madonna and
hundreds of thousands of adolescents worldwide sporting Wonderbras on the
dance floor.
Hobo-Punkature (spring 1983) came next, triggering bag-lady chic and the
passion for prematurely aged or 'distressed' clothes.
Then, with Witches (autumn 1983) Westwood presaged the return to a
body-delineating style of dress when she began to work with tubes of knitted
and Lycra-impregnated fabrics. She continued in this fabric-led direction
with Hypnos (spring 1984) which explored the erotic possibilities of the
silky, stretchy fabrics created for sportswear. Gym wear and cycling shorts
became a staple of young women's daily wardrobes.
For the following autumn, she changed direction and, with the Clint Eastwood
collection, supplanted Hollywood's glossy, tight-trousered Wild West with a
more authentic mix of unpressed 19th century city clothes, cannibalised
denim and native American pieces, mixing in a mass of 20th-century American
logos.
During the following two years, 1985-86, she developed the mini-crini, in
her version hooped and bell-like, swinging seductively as the wearer walked.
'We assume nowadays that the crinoline and the corsetry that went with it
were uncomfortable and constricting and hampered women,' she says. 'But
people wore corsets for comfort and posture. They liked them. I liked the
crinoline because it took up space, made its wearer imposing and I suspected
that it felt very sexy to wear. I liked the strong femaleness of the
archetypal fertility-symbol shape as well.'
Her next preoccupation was to be the Englishness of English style and its
class associations. From Harris Tweed (autumn 1987), through Britain Must Go
Pagan to Time Machine, she concentrated on tailoring, juxtaposing elements
from the wardrobe of the Queen with classical draperies, boned bustiers and
1940s platform soles.
BY spring 1989 and Civilizade, she was in a rococo mood, inspired by the
Commedia dell' Arte and using rich fabrics, ornate decoration, a theme
developed by other designers, especially Gianni Versace.
In Voyage to Cythera and Pagan 5, she dispensed with the skirt, proposing
the bodysuit adorned only with a gold fig leaf or stylised, graffito-like
erection (to be flashed when the wearer opens her jacket). Soon everyone was
going skirtless.
Westwood developed her theme of clothes as definers of gender in Portrait
(autumn 1990), cross-dressing her models in chalk-stripe menswear-style
suits, shirts and ties and contrasting it with the Boucher-printed corsets
and body suits sporting a pretty, frilled satin codpiece.
With the following collection, Cut, Slash and Pull (spring 1991), she looked
to the street fashion for torn and frayed jeans and related it to the
Renaissance fashion for slashed clothes. The undergarments were pulled
through the slashes in the overgarments, adding the age-old erotic charge of
the intimate on display. 'All clothes,' she says, 'have to be about sex. As
soon as you do a new cut, you look at the body differently.'
Starting with Dressing Up in autumn 1991, Westwood has, through collections
called Salon, Always On Camera and Grand Hotel (spring 1993), explored two
versions of glamour: the work of the great couturiers, particularly
Christian Dior, and Hollywood's vulgarisation of it. 'We have forgotten,'
she says, 'how anarchical Dior was, how, with the cut and structure of New
Look, he changed the relationship of clothes to the body. He spent a lot of
time underneath frocks in museums, working out how they were constructed.
That's my method, too.'
But neither could be called copyists. 'Historical clothes are, if you like,
an inspiration, a starting point for experimentation. Couture is getting
more and more crude because people are not experimenting enough with cut,
they are not working on the body, so they recycle the same basic shapes and
play only with detail. That's why people who copy me often get it wrong.
They think it is a matter of detail when it is all in the cut.'
Westwood trained as a teacher, primarily of art, and brought to her
accidental profession (McLaren had a shop to fill and told her to fill it)
an analytical curiosity which had rarely been applied to clothes before. In
clothes-making, she was to discover her own credo: 'An idea is pointless
unless you have the technique to give it form.'
She is also a natural heretic and particularly likes to quote Bertrand
Russell: 'Orthodoxy is the grave of intelligence.'
'Conservatism leads to stagnation,' she says. 'Only scepticism is creative.
It is the job of anyone who claims to be civilised to oppose and question
accepted ideas.' When she filled McLaren's shop with studded leather and
slick rubber and the other accoutrements of sado-masochism, she explained
that she was interested in the 'control' of sexuality inherent in the
clothes and accessories. The consensus then was that sado-masochism degrades
women; just as she was later to speculate about the crinoline and the
corset, Westwood wondered whether it might not, conversely, empower them.
Nor, of course, is her current preoccupation with the couture of the 1950s
at all straightforward. 'I am into elegance now,' she says. 'I think, in
this tasteless world, elegance can be subversive.' Certainly clothing has
been used politically throughout history. The couturier, however, descended
as he/she is from the court dressmaker, is traditionally on the side of the
establishment, of orthodoxy. It is the role of the artist, the philosopher,
the writer to question orthodoxy. Perhaps that is why Westwood is so
disconcerting to her domestic audience. Fortunately for her self-esteem,
boosted to the point of euphoria last week, the French see things
differently.
Vivienne Westwood's current collection, Always on Camera, stars extravagant
fake furs including pink leopard, mohair coats, tweeds, elegant Dior-style
suits, the rococo corset and lace-printed denims as well as witty costume
jewellery and watches designed for Swatch. From Vivienne Westwood, 430 Kings
Road, London SW10 (tel. 071 352 6551) and 6 Davies Street, London W1; Smith
and Westwood, Unit 2, Clayton Square, Liverpool. Pieces from previous
collections at the Westwood Sale Shop, 41 Conduit Street, London W1.

Jack-in-the-box Christmas fun
CRAFT FAIRS are, of course, one of the best places to look for presents if
what you are after is something fresh, original and unlike the
mass-manufactured goodies that most of us unwrap on Christmas morning. This
year there are more fairs than ever to choose from - standards vary widely
but almost all offer something of the fun of the treasure-hunt, with bits of
tat to be found sitting next to pieces of stunning beauty. Covent Garden has
its Apple Market stalls every day from Tuesday to Saturday which sell
everything from handmade silver, jewellery and sweaters to this jolly
collection of Jack in the Boxes by the Jack in the Box Company. Small sizes
are Pounds 9.95, medium, Pounds 14.95 and large, Pounds 19.95. On December 5
and 6, from 11 am to 5 pm (admission Pounds 2.50) the Richmond Fellowship's
annual crafts fair will be held at Peacock House, 8 Addison Road,
Kensington, London W14 8DL - all proceeds to the fellowship which helps
rehabilitate the mentally ill. Thousands of hand-made items will be on sale
 -everything from food to jewellery.
Hand-painted original glass
FUNKY STUFF is the place for wild and whacky glass, all hand-painted, all
original, all the work of two young designers, Emma Kennedy and Cathy
Ashley. The pair started by finding what they describe as 'the perfect
champagne flute' (photographed above) and then experimented in techniques
for painting on glass. Now they paint anything from glass-topped tables to
original perfume bottles. There are vases and jugs, tumblers and goblets,
all can be painted to order and prices vary from Pounds 29 for a champagne
flute to Pounds 45 for a large vase.
Funky Stuff is at 637 Fulham Road, London SW6.
Mary Fellows designs and makes original ceramics in an equally irreverent,
colourful mode. Her work seems inspired by Mexican crafts. She decorates
things such as candelabra, mirrors, clocks, lamps and jewellery with her
sunny decorative themes. Candlesticks start at Pounds 9, a double one at
Pounds 13, a clock is Pounds 95, while mirrors range from about Pounds 30 -
Pounds 40. See and buy her work at Unit B4 &amp; B5, The Wren Centre, Hampshire
Farm, Westbourne Road, Emsworth, Hampshire or tel: 0243-370111 for a mail
order leaflet.
Turning to the wood craft folk
THOSE IN the Sussex area or prepared to make the journey to Lewes, will find
some truly beautiful work at 14 Star Brewery Workshops, Castle Ditch Lane,
Lewes, East Sussex.
There, a clutch of crafts people have workshops as well as a gallery from
which they sell unique pieces. Open every day from Tuesday to Saturday, from
10.30am to 6pm, craftspeople will be holding open house today, showing
exactly how they produce their wares.
Rose-Marie Yeh is a wood turner who makes marvellous decorative bowls, such
as the one photographed left, crafted from spalted beech (Pounds 60). She
also produces some wonderfully original boxes, hand-carved from redwood, at
prices that start at Pounds 30.
David Weeks recycles glass to produce some stunning coloured lead crystal,
candlesticks, glasses, goblets, bowls, vases and jugs.
A triple rim bowl, in Delft blue, lapis blue and violet is just Pounds 28.
Mo Hamid sells her hand-thrown stoneware pottery, much of it using blue and
white glazes, influenced by Islamic Art, Continental Majolica and Dutch
Delftware. A tiny jug, 5in high, is just Pounds 5.90.
Wine with a birthday twist
I ALWAYS feel that it is a great pity that around about now our old friend,
The Man Who Has Everything, seems to get the very best of the presents while
the the poor chap who has precious little and who probably needs some
serious cheering-up gets the left-overs.
So here is an idea for He Who Has Had A Lousy Year or for He Who Deserves it
 -a bottle of finest vintage wine to coincide with the year of his birth.
Stephen Williams, whose brainchild the Antique Wine Company is, has been
collecting vintage wines from houses such as Latour, Pauillac, Petrus, and
Cantenac-Brown for many a long year. So far has never been stumped. He has
already supplied individual bottles from vintages as far back as 1901 to
customers all over the world.
Anybody broaching the idea ought to give Stephen Williams a ring first, give
him the year and then discuss with him the options and the prices.
Prices will vary according to the finesse of the wine, its age and rarity.
Stephen Williams pays great attention, too, to how well it has been stored
and cared for in the years since it was made. Tasting notes can be supplied
with the wines for those who are interested.
The wines are all seriously fine and frequently rare so prices are not cheap
 -you would need to think in terms of spending somewhere between Pounds 170
and Pounds 500. The wine comes in an important-looking box accompanied by a
copy of The Times of the exact day of the birthday, wedding anniversary, or
other celebration you choose. A splendid present for a real wine buff.
For the full wine list and further details write to The Antique Wine
Company, PO 19 Albert Road, Tamworth, Staffordshire, B79 TJN. Tel:
0827-64174.
If wine is not his scene, give him a special day out - Red Letter Days will
organise anything from a day's rally driving or microlighting to a bungee
jump or a day at a health spa. You could give a one-day cooking course, a
trip to the theatre, a lesson in anything from falconry to golf and target
shooting.
Prices range from Pounds 25 to more than Pounds 500, the recipient chooses
days to suit himself and the present arrives in the form of a Red Letter
pack with details of the present, how to take it up and even the option of
changing it for another of the 200 different experiences on offer. For the
catalogue of ideas write to Red Letter Days, Freepost, London N12 ORG. Tel:
081-343-8822.
Travelling in good order
THE TRAVELLING Companion range sports a limited collection of attractive,
useful travelling bags designed to bring order and tranquillity to the most
disordered of packers. There are some 14 different designs, some - like the
collection photographed here - aimed specifically for men, others aimed at
women.
For Him there are broad stripes in burgundy and white or navy and white and
the bags include designs to take shirts, shoes, socks, boxer shorts,
slippers (comes complete with a pair of slippers) and laundry. The briefcase
packer, seen here, is designed to hold a shirt, tie, pair of socks and boxer
short and fit neatly into a standard-size briefcase.
For Her the fabric is also striped cotton sateen but this time in pink and
white or ivory and white and the range includes bags for stockings and
tights, lingerie, brushes and combs, shoes and hair accessories.
Designed by Jenny Mort of Mort Sellars Designs, The Guardship, Church
Street, Chiswick, London W4 2PH (tel: 081-995-0023) the range can be seen in
the toiletries department in Harrods, other stockists from Mort Sellars
Designs. Prices range from Pounds 14.50 for a brush and comb bag to Pounds
25.95 for a briefcase packer.
A certain animal attraction . . .
A READY-FRAMED picture is one of the nicest of presents.
For those whose tastes run to the nostalgic and traditional, Martin Wiscombe
has produced a limited edition of 150 prints of three animal portraits
painted originally by himself in the manner of 18th century English naive
art.
These were the sort of animal portraits of prize stock usually done as a
record for the gentry and farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Martin Wiscombe goes to immense trouble to ensure that the finished product
looks authentically aged - he paints in oils and acrylics on wood, finishes
the painting with several layers of an ageing varnish, then finally crackle
glazes them. All the frames are hand-painted and finished with gold-leaf.
Choose from The Gloucester Old Spot Pig, The Shropshire Ram (photographed
above) or The Shorthorn Steer.
Each is Pounds 55, including the frame, postage and packing (three cost
Pounds 145) and are available direct from handmade in Wiltshire, Allington
House, Allington, Devizes, Wiltshire SN10 3NN. Tel: 0380-860-214.

FT  28 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: Christmas with bells on it - Lucia van der
Post tests designer trees, pulls tasteful crackers and examines inventive
alternatives to paper streamers and battered baubles
</HEADLINE>

HALF THE fun of Christmas, it seems to me, is the chance it gives to dress
the house up to the nines. No need for quiet, restrained, good taste - more
a chance to indulge your decorative fancies to the full, to be as opulent,
as self - indulgent, as over-the top as you fancy.
These days there is no excuse for just hauling out the cheap paper streamers
and the battered box of baubles - for the well - heeled and lazy the shops
are filled with decorative delights, while for the enterprising with
initiative and energy to spare lots can be done for very little.
Habitat has some well-priced decorations this year with pine-bedecked boughs
and cone trees starting at Pounds 9.95. For decorating the tree choose from
three different themes - circus (acrobats at Pounds 1.95, strongmen at
Pounds 2.50, lions at Pounds 1.95), American folk art (carved wooden animals
such as fish and reindeer) or Shades of White (in more traditional mode with
frosted icicles, garlands, white wooden wreaths and doves).
Every Christmas Thomas Goode of 19, South Audley Street, London W1 asks a
clutch of celebrities and designers to come up with a festive table theme.
This year's collection is as inspirational as ever. Many, but not all, of
the components are individually expensive but the ideas come free and can,
with some ingenuity, be re-invented at home. Elaine Paige, for instance,
uses a rich red and gold theme and though her wonderful Michael Szell print
cloth of golden fans on red is expensive much the same effect can be
achieved at lower cost. She uses red and gold fabric bows, gold lay-plates,
gold and red napkins (the rings finished off with musical instruments) and
hangs a central candelabra with tiny oval and heart-shaped mirrors, tassels,
crystal clusters of grapes and ribbons.
Lady Kathleen Grade goes in for cream and gold with a cloth-of-gold
undercloth topped by another of rich cream woven with golden roses. Viscount
Linley's Breakfast for Two (a dashing black stocking for his Christmas
guest) is in the new Basic Goode's department and is much more contemporary
in mood - he uses a breakfast table in sycamore, inlaid with macassar ebony
and vavona burr. Hugh Johnson takes a gardening theme and uses a painted
watering-can as a centre-piece and twisted twigs as decoration.
Jane Churchill, 135 Sloane Street, London SW1 and 3 Christopher Place, St
Albans, Herts. has expanded its range of accessories on the home-front and
for Christmas has masses of small decorative ideas. There are miniature
chocolate Christmas puddings (Pounds 3.95 for eight), plain creamy candles,
tartan-wrapped if you want to give them as a present, tartan terracotta
flower pots and gold-embellished decorations for tree, table and room, all
at accessible prices.
Greenwood &amp; Lacey, Richmond Bridge House, 417-421 Richmond Road, Twickenham
TW1 2EX (telephone 081-741-1377) is a source of stylish decorations - not
cheap but they are original and most will last for years. A poinsettia
topiary tree in a tartan pot, some 14 in high, is Pounds 44; a Mediterranean
Olive Wreath, made from dried globe thistles, hydrangeas, love-in-the-mist,
paper roses, fabric hydrangeas and zinnias is soft, enchantingly pretty and
costs Pounds 49.
There is a splendid collection of rose hips, seed heads, cinnamon sticks,
berries, hazelnuts, eucalyptus leaves and tiny terracotta pots centred round
a candle, for Pounds 45. A 24 in long Christmas Swag of preserved foliage,
artificial plums, gilded walnuts, mushrooms and lots of red, red roses, is
Pounds 58.

NO HOUSE ever seems properly decked out for Christmas without a tree. One of
the quintessential Christmas images, the tree is a marvellous decorative
device besides being a useful focal point for the presents.
Notions of how to dress the tree vary. Some families have rituals that can
never be altered, others prefer to ring the changes. Anybody wanting
inspiration might like to know that from December 2 to December 8 12
different designer-decorated trees can be seen on display at Sotheby's,
34-35 New Bond Street, London W1. The trees have all been donated to the
Save the Children Fund and will be auctioned at a gala dinner on December 9.
Anybody wanting one of the trees does not have to go to the dinner - sealed
bids can be left at Sotheby's.
Decorative ideas range from the almost impossible to copy (such as Garrards'
enchanting pearl pagoda tree alight with strings of pearls, crystals and
silver bells) to Simpsons of Piccadilly's Teddy Bear tree (sketched below)
which would not be beyond the talents of most of us to emulate.
When it comes to real trees, the word is that prices are up this year - in
the region of 5 per cent for home-grown trees and between 15 per cent and 20
per cent for imported ones, due to the devaluation of sterling.
Many families like to buy directly from the grower - the British Christmas
Tree Growers Association, 12 Lauriston Road, Wimbledon, London SW19, will
supply a list of places where they can be bought in return for an SAE.
Artificial trees are improving all the time. Pulbrook &amp; Gould, Liscartan
House, 127 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS (mail order available) has found
some beauties. Made by hand with very fine pine needles, some are very hard
to tell from real. The prices may at first sight seem horrendous (Pounds 95
for 5ft 6in, Pounds 129.50 for 6ft 6in) but bear in mind that they can be
packed away into a 4ft by 18in box and brought out year after year looking
fresh.

CRACKERS go on getting better and better. Times were when to find a cracker
that one could bear to look at, let alone one which made the spirits soar,
meant a trek to decorator shops whose stock-in-trade was chic and which had
a vested interest in keeping up taste levels - with prices to match.
These days the wares offered by even the humblest chain store have vastly
improved. BhS, for instance, offers miniature crackers in good plain colours
like silver, red, green or gold, at just Pounds 2.99 for 12 and grown-up
sized ones filled with Belgian chocolates, at Pounds 2.99 each. But for
those who want something a little different there are several companies that
will do crackers to order.
Minds Eye Crackers sells crackers which you can fill yourself. A set of six
in green, red and gold, costs just Pounds 5.99 and comes complete with a
joke and hat to add to the present you choose. Find them in in most good
stores - Harrods, House of Fraser, John Lewis, Selfridges, Hamleys, WH Smith
and more.
Completely Crackers offers what you might call a bespoke cracker service.
There are nine designs from which you choose first the look and then the
filling. Presents include such things as pot-pourri, beeswax candle, a
natural sponge or sunglasses. Standard crackers are Pounds 21.95 for six,
luxury ones (presents like a rosewood box, pewter photo frame) Pounds 24.95
for six. From Completely Crackers, Mandara House, 56 High Street, Pewsey,
Wiltshire, SN9 5AQ. Tel: 0672-63229.
Designer Crackers offer 17 designs, all hand-made, ranging from The
Businessman's (made from the FT, what else?) to Glitz at the Ritz (day-glo
colours and sparkles). Choose the fillers from a comprehensive list - finest
Belgian chocolates, bottle openers, cufflinks, tape measures, finger puppets
and the like. From Designer Crackers, Church Cottage, East Morden, Dorset
BH20 7DW. Tel: 092945-514.

FT  28 NOV 92 / FT schools 1,000 - the examiners' notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT months is an eternity in school league tables. When the FT published
its first survey of private school A-level performance in March, complaints
at the very idea of publishing 'raw' results flooded in. Now, after two FT
surveys, a host of rival exercises from other papers, and finally last
week's marathon effort by the Department for Education, almost everyone
outside the teachers' unions realises they are here to stay.
Our latest survey, the FT-1,000 published on November 1, provoked hardly any
letters objecting to the principle of publishing comparative exam data.
Jonathan Riley, headmaster of Emscote Lawn prep school in Warwickshire, was
a lone voice, 'looking forward to reading about chairmen of governors
clandestinely approaching head teachers in plush hotels with fat signing-on
fees and even larger salaries. Second division soon becomes second best'.
However, the issue of what the tables reveal remains controversial. The
critics, in full voice since John Patten's efforts, suggest they are little
more than snap shots of the deprivation with which a school has to contend,
and / or the degree of selection it employs. The two are essentially
different points, though often conflated. Selective schools draw many of
their pupils from deprived backgrounds, while many a comprehensive has a
thoroughly middle-class clientele. Judging by our responses, parents are not
blind to the social and selective characters of schools. They focus mainly -
and rightly - on the differential performance and fees (in the private
sector) of institutions of similar type.
The question of selection featured prominently in responses to the FT-1,000.
Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, wrote: 'I hope the
message that comes through will be that a whole variety of factors affect
the performance of schools, and none more important than the quality of the
entry into a school.'
However, the idea that even top schools have the pick of the bunch is
strongly denied by many of their heads. Tony Evans, headmaster of Portsmouth
Grammar, which came 144th in the survey, said any notion of his school being
free to choose its pupils was a 'serious oversimplification'.
'There are no fewer than seven sixth-form colleges within easy distance,
with five other schools mentioned in your table equally accessible. There
are very few schools which now have a monopoly.'
Much pleasure, and some surprise, was expressed at the strong A-level
performance of some state schools and colleges. 'It is gratifying that you
note what good value can be found in the state sector,' wrote Alan Hiscock,
chairman of the governors of Brooklands College, Surrey.
'It is worth restating that the private sector as a whole does not earn
higher examination results in strict proportion to the fees charged.' His
only concern was that we had not been able to rank further education and
tertiary colleges in the survey.
John Howson, deputy director of Oxford Polytechnic's school of education,
thought performance tables were 'fraught with danger,' but necessary, 'not
least for the benefit of parents whose work requires them to move around the
country'.
His concern was that 'the variables that go towards producing any set of
results are too complicated to allow easy comparison between schools'. The
five-year score was a help, 'but not if it forces any school to say to any
child that they cannot be entered for an examination because their entry
might adversely affect the score the school could achieve.'
Howson was also concerned that with the growth of vocationally-oriented
qualifications at the post-16 level 'there is a danger that your survey, by
using just A levels, has selected too simplistic a measure which does not
reflect the direction post-16 education should be taking at this juncture'.
The question of how good schools expand, explored in the survey through
articles on Bristol and Forest School, London, was taken up by Will
Bartlett, a research fellow at the School for Advanced Urban Studies at
Bristol University. 'If a popular school faces an excess demand for places,
there is no mechanism whereby extra funds can be channelled to that school
to allow for an expansion of capacity,' he wrote, highlighting a serious
weakness in the government's plans to promote market principles in
education.
Bartlett also pursued the question of funding. Minimum fees charged by
private schools in Avon are around Pounds 3,000, whereas Avon county council
provides only Pounds 2,153 per sixth form pupil in the county - 'and
considerably less than that for other secondary school pupils'.
The 1988 Education Act, by linking recurrent funds to pupil numbers, was
intended to create a quasi-market, directing funds to successful schools.
But, says Bartlett, its main effect 'has been to bring about a reduction in
funding for inner city schools, and a further deterioration in the service
offered to the least advantaged pupils'.
The FT score, which gave equal weight to performance per entry and per
candidate, caused some anxiety. Mrs B Hamnett, head of the sixth form at
Jews Free School in north London, told us that of JFS's 115 candidates, 37
took only 2 A-levels, and 8 one only, mainly for health reasons. 'The
objectivity of any particular indicator does give us cause for concern.'
Valerie Bidwell, headmistress of Norwich High School for Girls, took issue
with the decision to exclude general studies.
'General studies is, in fact, a good discriminator: students who will
achieve A and B grades in other A-levels will tend to achieve a similar
grade in general studies. . . Should A-level results in modern languages be
discounted if the candidate is a native speaker? What about the candidates
who may take A-level art without attending classes if sufficiently gifted?'
Answers on the back of a post-card, please.
Alas, like the education department's, our survey was not free from slips.
Some were caused by incomplete information, some were our fault.
Alsager Comprehensive should be in Cheshire, not Staffordshire.
Clifton High School for Girls should have got a mention as one of Bristol's
leading independent girls schools.
Honley High School, Huddersfield, has 36 per cent of its pupils studying
maths and science and six per cent modern languages, against the 20 and 11
per cent given.
Longridge Towers School, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, should have
been ranked third equal in the value for money table for boarding schools,
with its annual boarding fees of only Pounds 7,110. It is also the
top-performing school in the county.
St Helen's School, Northwood, Middlesex, was ranked twice in error. The
entry giving it 572 pupils, and placing it 120th, is the correct one.
St Peter's School, Bournemouth, is a church (Roman Catholic) School, with
1,462 pupils (not 137). It achieved 2.4 passes per pupil, and its FT score
was 0.87 (not 0.68), giving it a ranking of 738th.
Southampton Technical College gained 1.9 passes per pupil, not the 0.3
stated.
Wirral Grammar School: the proportion taking science/maths courses was 38,
not five per cent.

FT  28 NOV 92 / As They Say in Europe: Let's hear it for nostalgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH proposal to veto the plan for the sun to rise in the east and set
in the west ended a rough week for the Paris government at the hands of the
press. The papers felt that the nation's leaders had made a mess of
defending those central figures of French society, rapeseed farmers (whose
emergence has at least ensured there is one more role for Gerard Depardieu
in his continuing depiction of the nation's emblematic figures).
The day before the Washington deal on oilseeds was struck, the farm
minister, Jean-Pierre Soisson, gave a vastly entertaining interview to
Liberation which demonstrated the isolation of the British. The next day,
there was the barrage of attacks on the 'calamitous' British presidency -
just before John Major found himself able to gloat for the first time since
April.
Thanks to bad tactics, French ministers had helped to produce a result that
looked like a British victory.
The resulting furore has led to an explosion of nostalgia that seems part of
a wider wave of Euro-atavism. One paper, the Tribune Desfosses, wrote:
'France has 1.3m active farmers but 60m citizens are farmers at heart. All
proud of their provincial origins, all attached to a piece of land. The
United States argues in economic terms, France opposes it with national
identity.' There is a corner of a beetroot field that is forever Francois.
Humanite described farmers as 'the tree of rurality protecting the forest.
Behind these indebted, broken men, there is only wasteland, an inheritance
of unemployment. . . Rurality, the life of the countryside, its schools, its
postmen, its bars. . .'
Whether you see such stuff as noble romanticism or sentimental claptrap,
clearly it contains more than a whiff of the 1930s. It owes more to
imagination than analysis, though.
Reality is far removed from the bucolic fantasies of la douce France
supplying the world with a cornucopia of bread and wine, the succulent
offspring of a fertile land.
In the 1930s, France was a net importer of grain; today, it is the world's
second largest exporter. Before the second world war, France harvested less
than Canada and accepted grain from the cheapest source.
French ministers foster the myth that France's natural role is to provide
competition for the US. A corrupt subsidy system is responsible for that.
If France ceased to be a major food exporter, cheaper suppliers - including
the southern hemisphere and eastern Europe - would immediately take its
place. We know too well what happens when countries in that part of the
world, with enormous rural populations and nothing to sell but the produce
of their fields, find themselves thrown on their own resources.
The European Community remains obsessed, however, with its own esoteric
internal problems - ratifying the Maastricht treaty and so on. It is like
the householder who concentrates on nothing but his plans for repainting the
house while groups of potentially violent beggars are gathering on the front
lawn.
In the eyes of the France's political leaders, the redecoration has to take
a vernacular, traditional form. The traditional France, implied by the vote
in the National Assembly and most leader writers, is one of smallholdings
and gross inefficiency, a single broken telephone at the poste which is
always closed. Nobody would imagine from the rhetoric this week that French
prosperity rests on foundations that differ from those of, say, Lower
Slobovia.
And even when it comes to the five per cent on the farm, it was left to a
newspaper in the Pyrenees to get near the truth: 'To speak of the interests
of farmers as if they were all the same is a destructive myth. . . the
richest five per cent earn 35 times as much the poorest five per cent.'
Now here are two very, very difficult questions which the finest minds of
the Assembly could not answer on Wednesday: which group benefits from the
present system? Which group does the government say will lose from any
change?
After the vote for a veto, opposed only by those who felt it did not go far
enough, Liberation wrote that the Europe of Maastricht was at risk: 'History
has overtaken the dream and devoured it, and so it is, all things
considered, quite logical that history should now have clad herself in
peasant finery. . . A compromise must be found.'
Liberation added: 'The least one can say is that unanimity, overweaning
demands and recourse to a worn-out lyricism hardly prepares one for it.' But
who is prepared to compromise with France?

FT  28 NOV 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Hard costs of child care - Keith
Wheatley meets a woman who combines a top job at Price Waterhouse with
running her own childcare consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELEN Jameson is a mother used to measuring costs. As an accountant, she
works in a senior management role with the capital markets section of Price
Waterhouse. As an entrepreneur, she is one half of Lilliput, a consultancy
focused on all aspects of non-parental childcare and running its own nursery
in a former Bible-printing works in Hackney. This is a business dealing
every day with an attitude problem.
'There's a perception in this country, shared by the government, that child
care should be cheap,' says Jameson, a maths graduate from Newnham College,
Cambridge, and mother of Emma, aged two, with a second child due in January.
'So people either cut corners to keep costs down or the whole business of
child-care ends up outside the formal economy - cash wages to nannies who
have no National Insurance contributions. Everyone with a child knows the
scenario.'
Charges at the Lilliput nursery, opened two years by Helen and her partner
Madeline Watson, range from Pounds 95 a week for a rising-five to Pounds 148
for a child under two. There are 15 children, with room for 30. Demand is
strongest for under-two places, but the age structure of the nursery roll
must remain balanced.
'Any mother tends to think that running a nursery will be just an extension
of home skills, but to run
it as a normal profit-making business is very challenging,' says Helen, 35.
'It's a highly regulated environment and because of that there is relatively
little scope for economies of scale.
'More children means more staff. In addition you have to compete with a
subsidised voluntary and public sector group of nurseries.' The nursery, in
east London, currently needs a manager, four nursery staff and a cook /
housekeeper.
As Lilliput's first nursery it is trading at an operating profit. It took
around Pounds 40,000 in capital to get it up and running; a mixture of
private investment from the two women and finance from the National
Westminster Bank.
Helen was a high-flier at Price Waterhouse but found that, what she
describes as, 'its traditional Up or Out company culture' began to make
unacceptable time demands on a young woman probably destined for a
partnership if she had not also wanted to start a family - and her own
business.
When Helen told PW what she wanted to to, she thought they would tell her it
was all or nothing and to pack her bags. To her surprise, they asked her to
work three days a week at the practice - leaving her two days for her
business.
'I guess their reasoning was that it would add to my experience,' she
reflects. 'I certainly feel that it has added to my skills base and how I
approach my work. It's made me far more entrepreneurial.'
Initially Helen and Madeline concentrated on offering a consultancy service
to companies thinking of offering child-care to employees, and tendering to
manage workplace nurseries. This strategy had the advantage of using the
client's capital rather than Lilliput's.
However, they found themselves coming second in the bid process to
competitors who already had at least one nursery up and running.
'It was a credibility thing, I suppose. At least if we did it we would know
if our costings were right or wrong,' said Helen. 'It was also a chance to
set up a model of what a nursery could be.'
The issue of workplace nurseries has undergone some revision in recent
years. In the mid-80s it seemed to be on the agenda of every caring, sharing
employer. Now many are not sure if children and the office are such a good
mixture - for either side.
'Amongst predominately male management there's an unspoken fear of the
creche on the third floor,' said Helen. 'Workplace nurseries are expensive
and not always appropriate. We like to demonstrate to the employers we
consult for that there are many routes you can take in helping staff with
childcare.
'In London most parents find their own commute to work bad enough without
inflicting it upon their children. But in provincial and rural settings it
can work very well.'
In many countries, child-care is a large and profitable service industry.
The US has some very big nursery operators, often regarded with some
trepidation by the inheritors of a rather different tradition in the UK.
Nevertheless, Helen believes Lilliput can grow without become a
child-processing centre.
'I think we will see small chains of nurseries in this country, and I hope
we can grow to that sort of scale. At present it's very much a cottage
industry,' Helen said. She points out how much a reputable 'brand-name' in
this field could reassure anxious parents.
It seems to be a field ripe for setting uniform standards and procedures;
then licencing ownership and operations? 'Franchising is not a route I'm
happy about,' said Helen. 'Child-care is a terribly personal service.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Friendly answer to budget problem
 -Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I COMPLAINED in these pages a year ago that there was no home budget
computer program on the British market with the versatility of the American
ones. Now there is: Quicken, one of the best American programs, has been
intelligently Anglicised, no small feat, and offered for sale here.
It does home and small-business accounting and portfolio management. It is
easy to use, with one of the best manuals I have ever seen for any program,
well-indexed and full of useful cross-references. It lacks any tendency
towards American cuteness and at Pounds 50, it is not expensive.
I have met budget programs which were hectoring and nannyish, insisting on
the maintenance of proper standards of accountancy. In Quicken, entries can
be changed or annotated after the event. Expenditure does not need to be
assigned to a budget category - Quicken will sweep up the left-overs and
label them 'Other'. Throughout, the program is singularly relaxed, without
sacrificing efficiency or usefulness.
Two big difficulties in most budgeting systems, computerised or not, are
getting started, and finishing off a year. Quicken makes both easy. Getting
started can be something like entering a revolving door in a crowd - all
right once you've done it. I have seen budget programs that expected you to
start at the beginning of a financial year. Others insist at least on
starting on the first of a month.
In Quicken, anything will do. I started off our current and credit card
accounts from the last statements. I have an 'Asset Account' (very grand)
for our National Savings certificates: that dates from when we bought them.
I set up the share portfolio from last month's valuation out of laziness,
but I could have gone back to the purchase of the separate shares.
Finishing off a year can be worse, if your program forces you to spend a
month or so hopping back and forth between this year's file and last year's
file. In Quicken, you never need finish off a year at all, but just go on
and on adding transactions. If that idea makes you nervous, as it does me,
Quicken will copy past transactions to an archive and then delete them from
your current file, once a financial year has, in effect, closed itself.
Quicken offers a variety of reports and some nice graphs. The reports can
start and stop with any date - you do not have to view your finances month
by month. Flexibility here is precisely the feature which makes starting a
budget or finishing a financial year so easy.
I found the reports hard to work with at first - there was so much detail,
and so much space between the lines, that it was like trying to survey a
landscape through binoculars. All right, we spent Pounds 48.75 on newspapers
last month, but how are we doing? Then I discovered that individual budget
categories can be collapsed by pressing the minus key. 'Salary', 'interest
income', and 'dividend income', for instance, can appear as one item:
income. Alternatively, they can be expanded right up to a list of the
separate sums received. And when a report has been reduced or expanded to
the point where it becomes useful to you, the program will memorise the
settings for next time.
Quicken has an impressive roster of smaller virtues to support the big ones:
it will print cheques, on special, rather expensive forms with
sprocket-holes for use on a computer printer. It will remember standing
orders and direct debits, and deal with them automatically. It can handle
foreign currencies.
It can use data from the popular Money Manager program. There is an
excellent on-screen calculator. If a computer has extended memory, Quicken
can use it.
The business features of the program are meant for sole traders, such as
carpenters or computer consultants, and small retail businesses, clubs or
charities. It is not a complete double-entry accounting system, but it is
not just domestic accounting warmed-over, either. Quicken can track VAT,
draw up a balance sheet and forecast cash flow. The chapters in the manual
on business uses are crisp and clear.
I have only one complaint: it will not calculate the tax element in interest
received net of tax. The manual describes a clumsy way to record tax credits
with dividend payments, and you could use the same stratagem for interest
received. But a program as good as this ought to do it automatically, for
interest and dividends both.
In the last year or so, Quicken has been so successful in the US that it
threatens to elbow the competition off-stage altogether. I would not be at
all surprised if it managed the same feat in the UK.
Quicken costs Pounds 49.95 including VAT and carriage from Intuit, Manor
Court, High Street, Harmondsworth, West Drayton, Middlesex UB7 0AQ;
telephone 0800-585058; Fax 081-759-2077.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: What can I pass on?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM 77 and a widow. I have some questions on inheritance tax.
Am I right in assuming that Pounds 3,000 can be distributed every year and
if not taken up one year can be carried forward to the next year making
Pounds 6,000 for distribution by one person? Some people have told me,
however, that it is Pounds 5,000 which can be distributed each year and not
out of capital.
I understand that Pounds 250 can be gifted to any one person in a year but
not from capital. I also understand that at the moment Pounds 147,000 of an
estate is free from inheritance tax.
Is it possible for gifts of cars, maintenance at university etc, to be
excluded from inheritance tax and given freely from capital?
If trusts are set up for grandchildren, allowing interest on demand but
capital to be passed over at an agreed age, obviously the services of a
solicitor as trustee is very necessary. What are the fees and how do they
vary?
You are correct in assuming that you have an annual exemption of Pounds
3,000 and that if you do not make use of the Pounds 3,000 exemption in one
year, you can carry that forward to the following year, so that a total of
Pounds 6,000 can be gifted free of inheritance tax.
I believe that the Pounds 5,000 exemption you refer to is a gift by a parent
to a child in consideration of marriage. An exempt gift of up to Pounds
2,500 can be made to a grandchild in consideration of marriage.
In addition to the annual exemptions, you can make a gift of Pounds 250 to
any one person free of inheritance tax and this can come from your capital.
You could therefore make eight individual gifts of Pounds 250, (a total of
Pounds 2,000) and this would not erode your Pounds 3,000 annual exemption.
The inheritance tax nil rate band has been increased to Pounds 150,000 for
the current tax year.
The gift of a car would be treated as a capital item and would need to come
out of the above exemptions. If a regular sum from income is paid to
maintain a person at university, then this could be deemed to be a gift out
of income rather than capital. This would apply if the gift is of a regular
nature, for example it is to be for a three or four year period during their
university education, and if your income after tax and your normal
expenditure is greater than the maintenance payment.
The trust you are referring to appears to be a life interest trust so that
the income will be payable to the grandchildren and the capital would only
be payable at an agreed age. The solicitors' fee will depend upon the time
involvement but I would expect it to be in the region of Pounds 500.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Contracting out of Serps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WORK for a company which until recently operated a non-contributory
pensions scheme which was additional to Serps, the state earnings-related
pension scheme. This was replaced by a money purchase scheme - 'Nexus', from
Scottish Equitable, also non-contributory.
I find that I have been contracted out of Serps without my prior knowledge
or permission. Can my company do this? I am told that this is because the
company is putting so much into my pension that I would be over-funded.
However, the brochure informs me that this can be varied at a whim. I have
no contract on this pension scheme, and on asking for more information -
projected figures, etc - I was accused of ingratitude and told that I can be
opted back into Serps at the press of a button.
I produced news articles about age, transfer values and so on. It transpired
that my company director and broker had never heard of the '40 plus' rule.
Bearing in mind that I am a woman of 44 and am unlikely to remain in this
employment until the retirement age of 60, what would you advise? Can I get
back into Serps without incurring a loss in transfer fees? Can they legally
put me in / out of Serps at 'the press of a button'?
In a company pension scheme, it is the employer who makes the decision to
contract-out of Serps, or not, for the scheme as a whole. He is meeting the
cost of providing you with benefits that are as good as, or better, than
Serps and so you have no reason to complain that you are contracted-out.
Arguments about picking and choosing the ages below which contracting-out
has the greatest advantage are relevant to a personal scheme. An employer
cannot pick and choose on an individual basis and will therefore often be
guided by an average age formula for his staff as a whole.
Employers must also bear in mind the political risk with Serps. The
government has cut Serps entitlement once and is likely to do so again,
because it constitutes a rapidly escalating unfunded drain on National
Insurance finance, whereas future rights under your own funded scheme are
based on real money invested for the future.
If your employer is aiming to provide a reasonable level of retirement
income for its staff as a whole it will tend to favour greater reliance on a
funded scheme than on Serps. If Serps is cut back in the future this would
leave more for it to top up.

I AM A Paye employee. My base office is in London and I live 30 miles
outside London. I frequently go directly from home to work at clients' sites
and return home directly, for which I claim expenses. Which of the following
expense claims would be accepted by the Inland Revenue:
The return journey by car between home and client.
The lesser of the above claim and the return journey between my base office
(in London) to the client.
Is the eligibility of the claim affected by:
My rail season ticket between home and office.
The fact that the direct route by car from home to the client sometimes goes
close to my base office.
Calling into my office on the outward or return journey to collect mail and
messages.
Section 198 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 only entitles you
to tax relief on 'the expenses of travelling in the performance of the
duties of the . . . employment', and presumably your duties do not commence
(each day) until you arrive at the office or at the client site - and
presumably your duties end (each day) just before you leave the office or
the client site. That being so, it is only a journey between office and site
and between site and office, or between one site and another during the day,
which satisfy the tough rules laid down by parliament, so far as we can tell
from your letter.
The rules are not so tough for employees who are required to travel on
horseback or in a horse drawn vehicle, if they have to look after the horse
themselves.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY NEIGHBOUR has cut down some trees which were overhanging his garden but
were growing on land owned by the Forestry Commission in Scotland. (He had
no permission to do this). These were beautiful crab apples planted, I
believe, to be viewed from my window (possibly at the time of the Queen's
Coronation). There are others planted strategically around the village and
he has kept the ones to be viewed from his window. He is building a large
shed, the roof of which will be my new view. He tells me that as it is a
shed he can build it up to a third of the size of his garden without
planning permission. Have I any redress in law against him? Can I sue for
loss of amenity? I am a songwriter and one of my songs (which has been
performed in public) was inspired by these trees. I have been so unsettled
by his action that I have been unable to write since. On the facts as you
describe, you have no remit in respect of the fact that your neighbour has
either cut down or pruned the trees planted on Forestry Commission land
which were overhanging his property. The details which you have given of the
proposed shed are not sufficient to advise with certainty - if the shed does
not exceed 9 ft in height, then planning permission would not be necessary.
However, we suggest that you intimate your disquiet to your local planning
department as a coterminous proprietor and request that they take the matter
up formally if appropriate.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax (CGT) allowances for assets sold in
October. To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure
shown for the month in which you bought it. If you subtract the result from
the proceeds of your sale, the result will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought some shares for Pounds 7,000 in April 1987 and sold
them in October 1992 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
April 1987 figure of 1.374 gives a total of Pounds 9,618.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 14,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 4,382, which is below the 1992-93 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.
If you sell shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home loans under fire - Centralised
lenders fail to keep up with base rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE most home-owners are pleased that interest rates are coming down,
those who have mortgages with centralised lenders are less happy. They are
paying up to two percentage points more than other mortgage-holders.
Existing borrowers with National Home Loans, for example, are paying 12.15
per cent compared with between 9.95-9.99 per cent for their counterparts at
most banks and building societies.
Some borrowers at First Mortgage Securities are paying 11.65 per cent, while
those with Household Mortgage Corporation and Mortgages plc (formerly CIBC)
are paying 11.45. Rates at the Mortgage Corporation are 10.99, while UCB's
existing borrowers, who are also paying 10.99 will see a reduction to 9.79
per cent next week.
Most of these rates will be coming down soon - in many cases, by well over
1.5 points. First Mortgage Securities, for instance, is cutting the rate for
existing borrowers to 9.65 per cent on January 1, and to 8.65 from February
1. The Mortgage Corporation will bring down its rate to 9.5 fron January 1.
Despite the projected cuts, many borrowers with the centralised lenders will
still be paying higher rates than those with most banks and building
societies. The latter, in most cases, will pay about 8.5 per cent between
mid-December to the beginning of January.
One reason for the higher rates charged by centralised lenders is the way
their loans are funded. Unlike banks and societies, which take in money from
savers and lend to home-owners, they get their funds by borrowing on the
wholesale money markets.
Most use the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) to determine
what they charge mortgage-holders and argue that, unlike banks and building
societies, they cannot react quickly to sudden base rate cuts since they buy
money forward.
'We don't have 8m savers whom we can immediately penalise in order to cut
mortgage rates,' said Barry Meeks, commercial director of The Mortgage
Corporation. 'If the base rate is cut today, it does not filter through to
our cost of funds for three months.'
The centralised lenders emerged in the mid-1980s when property prices were
moving up rapidly and demand for mortgages from prospective house-buyers was
insatiable. They were able to undercut the banks and building societies
because the Libor then was lower than base rates.
To gain market share they brought in new products, such as deferred payment
loans, and were happy to take on borrowers who could not prove their income.
Within a few years, their market share rose to 20 per cent - but this form
of market-driven, imprudent lending has resulted in tears.
The fall in house prices and the recession have blackened the books of some
of the centralised lenders, and a fall in credit-worthiness means that they
cannot borrow on terms as favourable as the top grade banks and societies.
The property slump and a rise in repossessions also mean some of the
centralised lenders cannot afford to take on new business, although others
are operating profitably and are marketing fixed and capped rate mortgages
to attract custom.
Adrian Coles, of the Building Societies Association, advises those who are
paying above market rates for their mortgage to examine the costs of
shifting to another lender. Re-mortgaging is an expensive business,
particularly for those tied into a fixed rate loan, but it might be the best
option in the long term.
Chase de Vere, the London-based mortgage broker, will work out the costs and
savings of switching to a lower rate scheme without charge.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The cheaper way of insuring your
treasures - Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds that specialists often can offer
policies to cover high-value possessions at lower rates than elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLEASURE of acquiring a pair of Art Deco vases, some Persian carpets or
a little Hockney sketch can be ruined by worries about the cost of insuring
them.
Most home contents policies restrict what they will pay out - usually, to no
more than Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 1,500 - on any single personal possession
unless it has been specified separately.
The type of extra insurance you need depends very much on the items you
have. Jewellery, unless antique, normally can be covered adequately under a
conventional home contents policy by describing the pieces and submitting a
valuation. (If you do not wear the jewellery often, of course, a cheaper
alternative is to keep it in a bank vault). But if you are a collector, or
own a variety of valuable furniture and paintings, you could find it cheaper
to consult a specialist fine art insurer.
The choice of these has increased in recent years. Fine art broker Richard
King says this is partly because insurance companies are losing less money
from this part of their business - known as the 'high net worth' sector -
than on claims arising from subsidence and theft. King  - who works for
Artscope, a division of broker Leslie and Godwin - estimates that people
with fine art and antiques can, in some cases, get wider cover at a third of
the price charged by a high street insurance company if they go to a
specialist insurer.
He adds: 'We have a client whose insurance company was charging him Pounds
6,000 in premiums this year for the contents of his London home. But he has
switched to a specialist and is paying Pounds 4,000.'
Hiscox Underwriting Ltd deals with high-value household business for
Syndicate 33 at Lloyd's of London, and claims to give more competitive rates
than others. The minimum sum insured for house and contents is Pounds
250,000; but if you already have satisfactory building insurance, the
minimum sum insured for contents is Pounds 75,000. The minimum annual
premium is Pounds 500.
The policy has a specialised all-risks section for fine art, with no maximum
item limit for objects other than gold, silver and plate. Hiscox does not
insist on valuations but encourages a schedule to minimise the risk of
dispute when a claim arises.
Nor will it necessarily survey every house, relying instead on the potential
client's background before taking on risk. Nigel Prescot, of Hiscox,
explains: 'The person is more important than the security of the house. Then
we make a judgment.'
Wellington Personal Insurance, a Lloyd's-approved service company, also
provides a high-value buildings and contents service. The minimum sum
insured on both is Pounds 150,000 but Steve Windich, the managing director,
says the average is Pounds 300,000 with average annual premiums of Pounds
1,100.
'The package is designed along North American lines,' says Windich. 'We
automatically include contents cover worth 50 per cent of the buildings
insurance. In most cases, this provides more than enough insurance and the
customer does not have to worry about being under-insured all the time.'
If your house is insured for Pounds 400,000, you will be entitled to Pounds
200,000 of contents cover. But items excluded are jewellery, silver and
furs. The standard excess on the policy is Pounds 500; thus, if an item
worth Pounds 2,000 is stolen, the insured would get Pounds 1,500 from the
company. The excess is waived on claims over Pounds 10,000, though.
Wellington does not require valuations but it does demand a list of items
worth more than Pounds 10,000. Although the package is not cheap, it is
competitive for those with many valuables who want to combine contents
insurance with buildings.
Another combined package was launched at the end of September by Sun
Alliance and Chubb, which have produced a policy called Masterpiece
providing an all-round service.
Marketing manager John Spink says Masterpiece is aimed at 'the top 5 per
cent of wealth-owning people in the country.' The minimum annual premium is
Pounds 1,500 a year for building and contents but the average, Spink adds,
is Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000.
Masterpiece is an all-risks building and contents policy and includes
world-wide cover on contents; a 24-hour help-line facility; payment for loss
of market value of a valuable item (more than Pounds 2,500) following
damage; and a broad 'pairs and sets' clause for valuable articles.
This means you could claim for the set even if only one item was stolen or
destroyed.
The policy involves a full appraisal, and the home and contents are surveyed
before the risk is taken on. Full valuations are required.
Collectors may prefer a policy provided by Star Assurance, which is owned
jointly by Eagle Star and Nordstern, a German insurance company. It does not
cover buildings or general contents but concentrates on fine art and
antiques. The minimum sum insured is Pounds 50,000 of contents; the minimum
annual premium is Pounds 175.
Star's Clare Pardy says the policy, which provides all-risk cover within the
premises, is aimed at collectors rather than wealthy individuals. 'We employ
people with a fine arts background and are able to give the client advice on
the value of their items,' she says.
'We would expect a professional valuation but there would be no need for the
client to have subsequent valuations, which are an expensive business, since
we could advise them on the present-day value of the collection.'
Like Masterpiece, the policy also includes depreciation following damage.
So, if your prize painting fell off the wall, you could claim for the cost
of the repairs and the loss in market value.
These policies are sold mainly through insurance brokers, who receive
commission from the companies but are able to get a variety of quotations
and help to determine which policy is suited best to the individual case.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A scheme with benefits for all -
Planning Your Pension / Marilyn McKeever and Tony Foreman on the virtues of
FURBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARILYN MCKEEVER and TONY FOREMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUNDED unapproved retirement benefit scheme (FURBS) offers tax benefits
with flexibility to both senior executives and their employers and looks set
to become a useful element in the remuneration packages of high earners.
How does it work? For executives:
It can be set up for individuals so that the fund is earmarked for them.
They pay income tax on the company's payment to the FURBS as if they had
received a bonus.
Once funds are in the FURBS, the investments made are subject to a maximum
rate of income and capital gains tax of only 25 per cent.
The normal restrictions on benefits from pension schemes imposed by the
Inland Revenue do not apply. Accordingly, there are no limits on the amount
of the benefits under a FURBS. There is great flexibility as to when the
executive can take those benefits, and all can be taken as a lump sum.
There is no tax liability when, eventually, they cash in their FURBS for a
lump sum.
If they die before cashing in the FURBS, the whole fund can be paid to their
family free of inheritance tax.
What does a FURBS offer for employers?
They will get tax relief when they makes a contribution to the FURBS in the
same way as if they paid salary or a bonus.
They will not normally be liable for the 10.4 per cent National Insurance
contributions which they would pay if they increased the executive's salary
or paid him a bonus.
It can be used as a 'golden handcuff.' The scheme rules can be framed so
that the executive benefits only if he stays with the employer for a
specified period.
A FURBS will be particularly attractive for an executive who has a greater
salary than he needs for his living requirements and can save some of the
excess.
Provided that the employer's contributions to the FURBS take account of the
fact that the executive will pay tax on them, the up-front tax charge need
not be a disincentive.
So, how can a FURBS complement other tax-favoured investments?
There is, of course, a place for investments such as personal equity plans
(Peps) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) in an executive's
portfolio but, by their nature, such investments generally are limited in
amount or relatively inflexible. FURBS are not limited.
Nor is a FURBS intended to replace an approved pension scheme. It can,
however, complement an approved scheme in providing funds for retirement
investment and in tax planning generally.
The benefits payable under an approved scheme always have been limited by
reference to the employee's salary at or near retirement. The maximum
permitted pension is only two-thirds of that final salary figure, and there
also are restrictions on the amount of the benefits which can be taken as a
lump sum.
In 1989, the government imposed a 'cap' on the amount of final salary which
could be used to calculate pension benefits. The present cap is Pounds
75,000, so the maximum possible pension that can be paid under an approved
scheme is Pounds 50,000 while the maximum lump sum is Pounds 112,500. This
applies whatever the executive's salary.
Further, the Revenue prescribes a minimum age from which a company may pay
an approved pension. This is usually 50.
Pension schemes can be very valuable and sometimes are worth more than the
employing company itself. In the past, private companies have been able to
use schemes as a source of corporate finance but now there are stringent
restrictions on investment by most approved schemes in the employer company.
None of these difficulties applies to a FURBS. Contributions and benefits
can be of any amount. Indeed, the rules relating to unapproved schemes were
relaxed at the same time as the cap was introduced, with the object of
letting employers provide additional retirement benefits for their high
earners through unapproved arrangements. FURBS can, thus, be used to
'top-up' the pension from an approved scheme where this would be inadequate
to support the executive in retirement.
A FURBS also is much more flexible than an approved scheme where it is used
as part of the employee's general investment and tax-planning strategy.
An employee can 'retire' at any time and any age, and the meaning of
'retirement' is wider than you might think. It includes retiring from one
job and taking up another.
Even if an executive continues in the same employment, he can still take his
benefits under a FURBS where there is a change in the conditions of his
employment. The employee may also receive his benefits if the scheme is
wound up - something that can happen at any time. In addition, the whole of
the fund which has built up for the executive's benefit can be taken as a
tax-free lump sum.
A FURBS will be particularly attractive to private companies. The investment
restrictions which apply to approved schemes are irrelevant so far as
unapproved arrangements are concerned.
A FURBS has many benefits. As part of a tax-efficient remuneration package,
it will help an employer to recruit and retain high-flying employees. It is
an attractive investment vehicle for the employees themselves. It can
supplement an otherwise restricted pension from an approved scheme. And a
director/shareholder of a private company can take advantage of the tax
breaks offered by a FURBS while using it as a source of finance for the
company.

THE main interest in GEC's interims, due on Wednesday, will be not so much
in the profits figure as in the dividend. Last year's interim payment was
merely held. But the final was raised by 5 per cent, in spite of unchanged
earnings per share for the year overall.
This time, profits are expected to be only modestly up, in the range Pounds
350-360m from Pounds 346m last year. But GEC is still accumulating cash at a
ferocious rate. At the start of the year, net cash - including GEC's share
of cash held in joint ventures - stood at Pounds 1.4bn. It is expected to
reach Pounds 1.6bn by the year end.
Lord Weinstock can thus certainly afford an increase. The question is
whether the outlook has brightened enough to allow an increase materially
ahead of growth in earnings.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to have suffered its first
ever year on year fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its full-year
results on Thursday.
Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen to around Pounds 1.24bn from
Pounds 1.31bn. The fall is less than it might have been because more than
Pounds 100m of exceptionals will be taken above the line in accordance with
the new accounting rules.
Allied-Lyons is expected to report first-half profits on Tuesday of Pounds
280m against last year's Pounds 276m, restated after adjustments of charges.
Most of the gain will come from the spirits and wine business, helped by
cost-savings from the restructuring of distribution in North America and a
resilient performance in Spain and Japan.
Brewing and pub retailing has been under pressure from the UK recession and
the disruption caused by the government's beer orders.
Forecasts of full year results from Bass on Wednesday range from Pounds 515m
to Pounds 538m - an increase of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent on last
year's Pounds 430m. The figures will be affected by the levels of
exceptional restructuring charges and property disposals. Underlying trading
profits are expected to be flat.
Well-publicised trading difficulties for Grand Metropolitan's North American
foods business will be reflected in a decline in full year profits on
Thursday from Pounds 950m to about Pounds 920m. IDV, the group's spirits
division, is expected to record another solid advance in trading profits but
lower earnings are forecast from the retailing sector.
Trafalgar House, the construction, engineering and property group, which is
reporting its full year results on Tuesday, is expected to announce that
Pounds 90m of profits were wiped out by a big tax charge and Pounds 50m of
writedowns on housing and commercial property.

THOSE who want to build a high income might find the temporary annuity a
valuable tool writes John Authers.
Temporary annuities, offered by life insurance companies, take a capital sum
and, in return, guarantee fixed income payments over a fixed period. This
income is high, as your capital, as well as interest earned by the life
company, is repaid over the period. If you die before the term is completed
the life company keeps the rest of the money.
This is not generally a deal worth much consideration in its own right. But
a temporary annuity can be useful when combined with another investment
aimed at capital growth. Such annuities are sold as part of easy-payment
packages for school fees and residential care bills, but can be used in any
package aimed at securing long-term growth while maintaining a regular
income.
The income is secure and known in advance, and so is the term. A typical
'back-to-back' scheme would put a chunk of money into a temporary annuity,
and then put the remainder into a growth investment - typically a Personal
Equity Plan (Pep), with-profits bond or Business Expansion Scheme company.
Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, says there can be big tax advantages,
because annuity income is taxed on the assumption that most of it is return
of capital. Combine this with a tax-efficient growth investment and your tax
bill has been cut.
What rates can you earn from a temporary annuity? Rates will improve
slightly as you grow older, and you can also choose between level annuities
or escalating contracts, where the income rises by a fixed amount each year,
having started from a lower base.
According to Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau, the best rates for a
five-year level annuity for a man aged 40 come from RNPF Nurses with Pounds
2,557 annually, followed by Pearl Assurance with Pounds 2,444 and Standard
Life with Pounds 2,387. Rates for women tend to be lower, reflecting greater
life expectancy. Over nine years, using the same assumptions, Pearl leads,
according to Quinton, with Pounds 1,691, followed by RNPF Nurses on Pounds
1,684.

THE HUGE sale in Betterware dominates the week. With the bulk of the shares
retained by the founding Cohen family, this disposal of 1.25m was executed
by a trust of which the children of managing director Andrew Cohen are
beneficiaries.
The trustees are not members of the family and the sale was made to
diversify the portfolio. Betterware interim results were far in excess of
brokers' expectations.
Shares in Etam, the high street clothing retailer, have outperformed the
market over the past 12 months. Rodney East, the group managing director,
has sold 120,000 at 240p, thereby reducing his stake to 880,000.
Following on from last week's reported sale in Photo-Me International, Serge
Crasnianski, of Imaging Systems, has sold a further 325,000 shares at just
over 306p.
Peter Stormonth Darling has sold 33,853 shares in Warburg at 482p.
Stormonth Darling has just been succeeded by Hugh Stevenson as chairman of

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bonds bonus for savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL institutions have recently launched fixed interest rate bonds, which
allow those who want to keep their money in the building society a way of
obtaining a guaranteed rate for a given period.
Portman Building Society is offering a fixed-rate bond paying eight per cent
gross for one year. The minimum investment is Pounds 500, the maximum Pounds
10,000. Portman claims a deposit of Pounds 10,000 or more would be needed to
obtain a higher fixed rate at the top 20 building societies. Withdrawals are
not allowed and the bond is available until Tuesday, November 30 only.
Abbey National has also launched a fixed-rate bond this week, paying 6.7 per
cent gross until December 1, 1994 for deposits over Pounds 10,000.
Withdrawals are not allowed before maturity, with early closure subject to
180 days' loss of interest. Given the high penalty and the relatively
unattractive fixed rate, the bond may not have wide appeal.
Two issues are hybrids, giving some element of guarantee, diluted with a
variable component. Skipton Building Society has launched the third issue of
its Imperial Bond, which is paying 8.5 per cent gross (6.38 per cent net)
fixed for seven months until June 30, 1993.
After this period, the rate until maturity on May 5, 1995 is guaranteed to
be at least 1.5 per cent higher than the gross variable rate paid on the
Pounds 5,000 band of Skipton's Sovereign Shares Account. The rate on this
account at the moment is 5.5 per cent gross.
Withdrawals are allowed after the first 30 days and, although notice is not
required, they will be subject to 30 days' loss of interest.
Skipton Financial Services, a subsidiary of the building society, launched
the second issue of its Deposit Bond with Providence Capitol this week. This
is a single-premium investment bond and is of little use to non-taxpayers,
since tax cannot be reclaimed. It does, however, give top rate taxpayers the
opportunity of deferring payment of tax.
The bond guarantees to pay a half point above the average gross rate paid by
the top five building societies on Pounds 25,000 in their instant access
investment accounts. The guarantee lasts until October, 1996.
The rate on the deposit bond at present is 10 per cent gross (7.5 per cent
net) on a minimum of Pounds 10,000. During the first two years, minimum
withdrawals of Pounds 1,000 can be made, subject to 30 days' loss of
interest. Penalty-free access is allowed after that but the balance must not
fall below Pounds 5,000.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Shift in pension tax incentives
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Social Security has let it be known that it is studying
how to shift its system of tax incentives for personal pensions to give
greater benefits to older people at the expense of younger ones.
For the personal pension policyholder, this could be the best news for some
time. Depending on how tax rebates are restructured, it could offer large
tax incentives to those in their 50s earning high salaries. However, it will
mean that people in their early 20s will no longer be offered the generous
tax incentives which have encouraged millions to sign up for personal
pensions.
The debate over whether the government should maintain its system of flat
tax rebates or stagger them according to age is a complex one. Initially,
the government chose flat rate rebates for two reasons: administering
staggered rebates would be difficult; and the life insurance industry
believed that unless young people were offered big inducements, they would
not buy pensions at all.
From the government's point of view, the question is how tax incentives can
best be structured to encourage people to choose personal pensions over
those provided by the state. Evidence suggests that the current structure
does not do so. The National Audit Office in 1991 estimated that the tax
rebates offered to personal pension holders between 1988 and 1993 will cost
Pounds 5.9bn more than they will save.
Under the current system of flat-rate rebates, all working people are
offered the same tax rebate to opt out of the State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme. This has proved a big advantage for young people because the amount
of rebate available allows them to buy a far larger pension with their
contribution than they will get by contributing the same amount into Serps.
However, as people age, larger contributions are theoretically needed to
purchase a pension of the same size. Thus, the tax rebate is of little value
to people in middle age and it is in their interest to opt back into Serps.
The effect of this tax structure is that large amounts of revenue are spent
encouraging people to buy personal pensions with only very small ensuing
reductions in payouts by Serps.
'Only by moving to a system of age-related rebates can the government bail
itself out of its embarrassment,' said Ron Spill, head of pensions at Legal
and General, a big seller of personal pensions.
Actuaries differ as to when it becomes unattractive to remain contracted out
of Serps. But at the current level of rebate of 5.8 per cent of tax on the
upper band of average earnings, most actuaries believe that men in their
late 40s and women in their early 40s would be better off contracting back
into Serps.
On Monday, Peter Lilley the Social Security secretary, is to lay a bill
before Parliament reducing the tax rebate to 4.8 percent with a one per cent
additional rebate for those over 30. This is expected to cost Pounds 165m in
tax rebates in the 1994-95 year but will save an estimated Pounds 200m in
Serps expenditure by keeping individuals out of the system. Spill estimates
that without that rebate, 1m to 1 1/2 m of the 4.7m personal pension holders
in Britain would have had to opt back into Serps.
Figures from the government actuary's department show that unless there is a
shift to age-related rebates, the flat-rate rebate will reduce sharply into
the next century. This is because the government had to set the rebate high
enough to encourage older people already in Serps to opt out of it. But as
those people retire, the need to maintain rebates at that high level eases
and by 2016, the rebate need be no more than 3.5 percent.
The department estimates that a 3.5 per cent tax rebate means that
contracting out will be attractive for men only into their early 30s and for
women in their late 20s. 'Women after a spell would just have to stay in
Serps. It would not be worth it to contract out at all,' Spill said.
If the current system remained, many people would return to Serps and no net
savings would ensue.
However, the government has said that it is considering a system of
age-related rebates from April 1996. In addition, the government is
considering whether to offer the rebates simply to personal pension holders
or to members of other pension schemes such as occupational plans.
Actuaries believe that because of the complexities of staggering rebates
through the average 40-year working career, it is most likely that the
Department of Social Security will devise a series of 'bands'.
As people age and move into upper bands, they will become entitled to larger
and larger tax rebates. Legal and General estimates that if the state
pension age is equalised at 65, the rebate for teenage personal pension
holders could be as low as two per cent rising to 11 percent for those
reaching 60.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: For those with Pounds 50,000 to spare
. . . - Five financial advisers explain to Philip Coggan how they would
spread their investment portfolios to maximise capital growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL growth, rather than income, is normally the goal for savers who are
working. This is especially the case as few people use up their annual
capital gains tax (CGT) allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93) but most
income-producing investments incur an immediate income tax liability.
So, the Weekend FT asked a group of financial advisers to recommend a
portfolio of Pounds 50,000 for an investor seeking capital growth. For
simplicity, it was assumed that the investor was a single person paying top
rate tax.
Investors should remember that, with some of the policies recommended,
commissions and other initial charges will take a chunk out of their
capital. But four of the five advisers have recommended index-linked
National Savings (NS) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas),
where there are no additional charges, while the costs involved in buying
index-linked gilts through the post office are relatively low.
Unit trusts and single premium bonds will incur bid-offer spreads of 5-8 per
cent, however, and investment trust dealing will also involve stamp duty,
brokers' commission (in some cases), and a bid-offer spread (which will vary
with the liquidity of the trust).
The costs mean these portfolios should be considered only for long term
investment. Note also that the advisers recommend a broad spread of
investments with exposure to bonds, equities, tax-efficient products and a
measure of inflation protection.
DAVID HARRIS, of Chantrey Financial Services in London, says: 'I believe
that economic uncertainty in the UK, and turmoil in the exchange rate
mechanism, makes it paramount for investors seeking capital growth to retain
a prudently balanced portfolio, seeking to protect them from fluctuations
within equity, cash or fixed interest markets.' He includes both
index-linked gilts and NS and stresses: 'Individuals must recognise the
threat of inflationary trends, even though predictions are for lower
inflation rates in the foreseeable future.'
In the equity field, Harris says: 'My selection of Newton for the Pep
(personal equity plan) investment is based on the fine historic record of
the Newton Income fund. Both the Mercury and Schroder selections reflect
broadly based, conservatively managed UK portfolios. The Fidelity Special
Situations trust has had a poor record during the recession, but is the type
of trust that is ideally placed to benefit from an upturn in the UK
economy.'
Harris also includes the Fleming Far Eastern investment trust which 'should
offer individuals good long term performance prospects from the wide range
of economies available in this geographical sector.'
He adds: 'The Baring and Kleinwort Benson fixed interest funds provide a
sensible balance to this equity exposure.'
His recommendations are:
6th issue of index-linked NS certificates. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Treasury 2.5 per cent index-linked gilt 2003. Amount Pounds 6,000.
Tessa account. Pounds 3,000.
Personal equity plan in Newton Income unit trust. Amount Pounds 6,000.
Baring's offshore International Bond fund. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Kleinwort Benson's offshore gilt fund. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Schroder's UK equity unit trust. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Mercury's British Blue Chip unit trust. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Fleming Far East investment trust. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Fidelity Special Situations unit trust. Amount Pounds 5,000.
RICHARD ALLEN, of Willis Corroon Financial Planning, says: 'Advantage should
be taken of most of the tax-exempt investments appropriate to a higher rate
taxpayer, with the final portfolio consisting of approximately 50 per cent
in equities and 50 per cent in secure or balanced investments.'
He first chooses a Pounds 3,000 Tessa investment with the Leeds Permanent,
which pays 7.5 per cent tax-free, and adds the 6th issue of index-linked NS,
which will pay 3.25 per cent above inflation tax-free if held for five
years. Allen would then split Pounds 16,000 between three single premium
investment bonds - a with-profits bond from Prudential Holborn, and
unit-linked bonds from Sun Life and Standard Life. He says income could be
accumulated but withdrawals could be taken later.
He also suggests investing Pounds 6,250 (allowing for charges) in a Pep with
TR City of London investment trust, and a similar sum in a Clerical Medical
High Income Pep, when the new tax year starts in April. Extra equity
exposure would be gained through the Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust and
Framlington's Recovery unit trust, re-investing income in all cases.
Allen adds a Pounds 5,000 holding in Whittingdale's Short Dated Gilt fund,
pointing out: 'Assuming interest rates continue to fall, the value of this
fund should increase. But it should be encashed in about two years' time to
fund a Newton Income Pep for the 1994-95 tax year. Finally, Allen is left
with Pounds 500, which could be invested in premium bonds 'or into a case of
Chateau Mouton Rothschild which, if it fails to appreciate, could be
appreciated at a retirement party.'
His selections:
Tessa with the Leeds Permanent. Amount Pounds 3,000.
6th issue of index-linked NS. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Whittingdale Short Dated Gilt fund. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Prudential Holborn with-profit investment bond. Amount Pounds 6,000.
Sun Life Deferred Distribution bond. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Standard Life Managed bond. Amount Pounds 5,000.
TR City of London investment trust Pep. Amount Pounds 6,250.
Clerical Medical's Equity High Income Pep. Amount Pounds 6,250.
Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust. Amount Pounds 4,000.
Framlington Recovery unit trust. Amount Pounds 4,000.
Premium bonds/Mouton Rothschild. Amount Pounds 500.
CLIVE SCOTT-HOPKINS, of the Windsor-based Towry Law, has chosen a portfolio
with a strong equity bias. 'With interest rates on the decline world-wide,
there are growth opportunities in world equity markets - especially the UK,
US and Far East, with Europe and Japan likely to pick up later in 1993 -
that we have not seen since the crash of 1987.'
Scott-Hopkins chooses Perpetual's Growth &amp; Income unit trust in a Pep. He
says the international fund has been 'second in its sector since its launch
in 1989. Its assets are 50 per cent in the UK/Europe and 50 per cent in the
US/Far East.' He adds a single company Pep run by Kleinwort Benson.
For investment and unit trusts, Scott-Hopkins puts half the portfolio in his
own company's discretionary service, managed by Mercury Asset Management. He
adds a Pounds 6,000 investment in Exeter's zero preference unit trust which,
he says, is 'the only authorised unit trust specialising in the management
of zeros, with average redemption yields of 9 per cent and greater immediate
growth as interest rates fall further.'
Finally, Scott-Hopkins recommends putting Pounds 10,000 in a bank-backed
business expansion scheme (BES). He says there are a number in the pipeline,
with banks providing a contractual exit route in five years and a six month
loan-back option. (Note that the latter is not available for basic rate
taxpayers).
His recommendations are:
Personal equity plan. Perpetual's Growth and Income fund. Amount Pounds
6,000.
Single company Pep. Kleinwort Benson's managed plan, present choice Cable &amp;
Wireless. Amount Pounds 3,000.
Towry Law's investment and unit trust discretionary service. Amount Pounds
25,000.
Exeter Zero Preference unit trust. Amount Pounds 6,000.
A bank-backed BES. Amount Pounds 10,000.
JAMES HIGGINS, of London-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says it is
pointless trying to distinguish over the long-term between pensions and
investment.
If the individual's pension needs are not met fully, he feels the maximum
possible investment should be held in this area. Otherwise, Higgins suggests
a portfolio designed for medium term growth and tax efficiency.
First, he proposes a single company Pep, with a high yielding utility such
as Bristol Water. He then adds a general Pep using the income shares of
split capital investment trusts.
'As well as generating a high yield, they can offer the prospect of capital
growth,' says Higgins. 'For example, Jove and River Plate both offer yields
of over 12 per cent. As interest rates fall, there is some scope for the
price of these shares to rise.'
Another class of split trust shares favoured by Higgins is the zero
preference. 'For reasons of security, we like the fully covered shares which
offer a fixed redemption price at a given date,' he says. 'Compared with
deposit rates, these returns are very attractive indeed. 'For example, TR
Technology offers a gross redemption yield of over 8.5 per cent, a return
which will be classed as capital gain for tax purposes.'
Higgins puts Pounds 14,200 in zeros and Pounds 1,800 into a Tessa on the
ground that many investors will be past their first year of contributions by
now. He adds index-linked NS and a 'cash-back' BES, covering a further
Pounds 15,000.
Finally, he puts a further Pounds 10,000 in a managed currency fund, saying:
'While there is blood being spilled in the currency markets, these funds
have the opportunity to make money - much more so than in relatively stable
times. We particularly like the Hambros EMMA Managed fund because that
covers bonds as well as currencies.'
His recommendations are:
General Pep in income shares of split level investment trusts, for example
Jove and River Plate. Amount Pounds 6,000.
Single company Pep in Bristol Water. Amount Pounds 3,000.
Zero coupon shares of split level investment trusts - for example, TR
Technology. Amount Pounds 14,200.
6th issue of index-linked NS certificates. Amount Pounds 5,000.
A cash-back BES. Amount Pounds 10,000.
Managed currency fund. Amount Pounds 10,000.
Tessa. Second year instalment. Amount Pounds 1,800.
JOHN COLE, of London-based adviser Berry, Birch and Noble, says: 'A balance
needs to be struck between what we believe are opportunities for
above-average returns in equity-related areas and the need to maintain an
investment spread which includes more secure areas of growth. There is a
danger of inflationary pressures growing in the economy.'
Cole chooses the 6th issue of index-linked NS certificates, plus a further
Pounds 6,000 in an index-linked gilt, and adds: 'Although relatively small,
a Tessa is worth including. We would also like to set aside Pounds 10,000 of
capital for investment in a BES - in particular, a scheme with an assured
exit route. The tax relief of Pounds 4,000, which would come back next year,
would be used to fund part of 1993-94's Pep entitlement.'
As a Pep, Cole chooses the Murray Income trust which, he says, has a
'reasonable yield.' Finally: 'We would like to see more geographical spread
into international sectors and, in the circumstances, would recommend NM's
discretionary Unit Trust Portfolio Management Service.
'Their capital growth portfolio allows unit trust selections to be made from
the market place without restriction and, most importantly, is a fee-based
service.'
His suggestions are:
6th issue index-linked NS certificates. Amount Pounds 5,000.
Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 2006. Amount Pounds 6,000.
BES. Amount Pounds 10,000.
Tessa from Leeds &amp; Holbeck. Amount Pounds 3,000.
Murray Income trust Pep. Amount Pounds 6,000.
NM Unit Trust Portfolio Management Service. Amount Pounds 20,000.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bonuses feel the squeeze again - Drop
in with-profits pay-outs angers policyholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH-PROFITS bonuses are on their way down again, arousing anger from
policyholders. Normally, bonuses and pay-outs rise steadily and nobody pays
much attention to the complicated way they are worked out, or the massive
discretion left to actuaries. But investment returns have been so bad over
the past few years that final pay-outs are sliding, revealing the creakings
of the life office system.
The system is based on two types of bonus: reversionary, which are declared
each year and, once announced, cannot be taken away; and terminal, which are
added once the policy has matured.
Reversionary bonuses have an element of security because they are backed by
gilts or other fixed interest investments. Using terminal bonuses permits
more flexibility to profit in the long term from equities. The system also
allows the peaks and troughs of the market to be smoothed out.
Unfortunately, the drop in markets in 1990 was not followed by reductions in
bonus because companies continued to anticipate a recovery that never
arrived. That bad year must soon be reflected in pay-outs to investors.
Terminal bonuses can easily be altered, making final pay-outs volatile. And
reversionary bonuses can be an awkward drag on a company's reserves when
times are hard. So, both are under pressure.
Scottish Equitable announced this week that it will cut its terminal and
interim reversionary bonuses from December 1. The general effect is to
reduce the cash amounts paid to policyholders on maturity by around 5 per
cent, with cuts being greater for short-term policies. The company will not
be writing to individual policyholders, however.
Marketing director Bill Stewart denied the move was needed to shore up
reserves, and said: 'The rates of return available on investments world-wide
are such that it doesn't matter how good you are at investment - it just
hasn't been possible over the past three years to earn returns to maintain
bonuses at current levels.'
Beale Dobie, which makes a market in endowment policies by buying them from
investors who need cash and then selling them, has decided to cut its prices
on the assumption that there will be a 10 per cent reduction in all
reversionary bonus rates as well as terminal bonus rates on policies with an
original term of 18 years or less.
Beale Dobie expects terminal bonuses to fall by only 5 per cent for
longer-term policies of 19 years or more because the bad stock market
returns since Black Monday in October 1987 have had a proportionately
greater effect on shorter policies.
This makes policies cheaper by about 3 or 4 per cent. The company admits
that the assumptions are crude but believes them to be realistic.
A change in the assumptions used by secondhand policy marketmakers seems
overdue. One Weekend FT reader, Benjamin Lemer, was angry to discover that
the pay-out on a Scottish Amicable policy he had bought, which matured in
October this year, was Pounds 14,457.60.
When he bought the policy secondhand, it had been calculated that it would
make Pounds 15,218.53 if bonus rates were maintained. He then discovered
that terminal bonuses had been cut on September 1.
Lemer complained that policyholders were entitled to full information and
that Scottish Amicable was 'attempting to hoodwink them into believing your
performance is better than it is.'
Scottish Amicable responded by providing a list of the 16 times it has
altered its terminal bonus over the past 10 years (none of which was
announced generally to policyholders) and made clear that 'the rate of
terminal bonus can be altered or suspended at any time whatsoever.'
The company claimed it would be 'totally inappropriate' to make
announcements of all terminal bonus changes because it 'would not wish to
build up anticipation of the amount of the terminal bonus in the minds of
individual policyholders.'
Maurice Paterson, of Scottish Amicable, said that any projection of the
maturity value provided by the office itself would have been conservative,
and added: 'I suspect the secondhand price might have been less if our more
conservative quote had gone out.'
Another reader, SJ Martin, noticed in his statement from Pearl Assurance
that his terminal bonus had been reduced from Pounds 9,892.29 for 1990 to
Pounds 8,742.17 for 1991, meaning that the on-going value had dropped.
In response to his complaint that his 'with-profits' policy had made 'no
profits' for 1991, Pearl made a telling response: 'You have not lost any
money as the terminal bonus was not guaranteed and would only have been
applicable if the policy had become a claim in that year.'
Terminal bonuses are fragile things, and investment returns on with-profits
policies are much more variable than many people realise. But it is
important to remember that life insurers are acting prudently and taking
steps which are, ultimately, in the interests of policyholders.
What the present difficulties do suggest, however, is that the public does
not understand the policies they are sold. The case for providing investors
with much more information when they buy looks even stronger.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lords rebuff taxman - Right to perks
is upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of employee benefits was put on firmer ground this week because
of a landmark ruling by the law lords. But it has come only at considerable
cost: the need to take politicians more seriously.
The case of Pepper vs Hart, which was settled in a lengthy statement on
Thursday from seven law lords instead of the normal five, has safeguarded
many employee benefits from additional tax in the short term.
At stake was whether 10 masters from Malvern school should be assessed for
tax on the difference between the reduced fees they paid for their own
children and the average cost per pupil of attending the school.
The teachers - led by John Hart, a senior master - argued that they should
have been assessed merely on any difference between the reduced fees and the
marginal cost of the fees - covering expenses such as books, food and
laundry.
The Inland Revenue had been arguing with the teachers since 1983 that the
benchmark should be the average cost. Had it won, the implications would
have stretched far beyond Malvern. Perks provided by thousands of other
companies to their employees - particularly in London - would also have been
affected.
That would have included staff receiving subsidised travel or cheap food,
using a company's sports facilities or club memberships, or buying goods
from their employer at a discount if they worked for a manufacturer.
The final House of Lords appeal has determined that the teachers' use of
marginal cost should be upheld. That has caused considerable relief from tax
experts and companies around the country. Many employers were delaying
re-structuring their benefit programmes as they awaited the outcome.
Some had threatened to simply scrap the perks on offer to staff rather than
change them if the ruling found in favour of the Revenue. Others which have
followed the Revenue's guidance already and structured benefits around
average cost, will have to re-think their position. Some which use marginal
cost - but where this cost exceeds average cost - will also be affected
adversely.
More fundamentally, there is still the risk that the Revenue - which had
been confident of victory - will now try to introduce new legislation
explicitly using average cost. It says it is considering its position. Next
year, it has the luxury of two budgets in which it could make these
proposals.
Strict interpretation of the letter of the law in the 1976 Finance Act meant
that Pepper vs Hart almost certainly would have been settled in the
Revenue's favour. But in a remarkable break with tradition - with
potentially huge consitutional implications - the law lords agreed to go
beyond the strict letter of the law.
They considered the intention of ministers when debating the bill before it
was converted into legislation. Whatever the future changes in tax on
benefits, ministers' speeches will have gained a new prominence.

</HEADLINE>

GEORGE Bush is probably still gagging on his turkey and trimmings. While the
rest of the country celebrated Thanksgiving this week, the outgoing
president must have felt there was precious little for which to give thanks
on Thursday, the most popular holiday in the American calendar.
Less than a month after his election defeat, the economic recovery that Bush
trumpeted repeatedly throughout his campaign - the economic recovery that no
one else believed existed - looks to be picking up a nice head of steam, and
the stock market is sitting up and taking notice.
We have been through this before, most recently in the spring and early
summer of 1991 when economic activity gathered pace in the immediate
aftermath of the Gulf war, only to drop back into a swamp of stagnation a
few months later. Two new factors, however, make the recent bullish economic
data convincing.
First, there is plenty of it: enough, at least, to suggest a sustainable
trend is developing. Second, many of the numbers date back to a period
before November, so a good deal of the improvements in business activity
cannot be put down to a giddy post-election euphoria of the kind that
created a false economic dawn in the UK.
Equity investors certainly seem convinced that something genuine is afoot
this time. Blue chips have done well in the past 10 days. The Dow Jones
index is up more than 100 points in the past week and a half; by mid-morning
yesterday, it looked as if it might break the 3,300 mark for the first time
since mid-September. It is the broader market, however, that has really
caught fire. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is trading at an all-time high
of just over 430, while the Nasdaq composite index is also in virgin
territory. Yesterday morning, it was at 649.95 and rising to a new record.
These gains have not been achieved in a thin market, either. Turnover has
been unusually strong of late. In only eight of the past 29 sessions has the
volume of shares traded dropped below 200m and turnover has been in the
240m-250m range on several occasions, even topping 285m on one day.
Investor demand for equities is picking up because market conditions must
look particularly appealing at the moment. The economy is growing at a solid
pace, interest rates remain low, and inflation still appears subdued. There
is also a plentiful supply of new cash - low interest rates mean that
individuals are continuing to move out of poor-yielding short-term assets
and into equities - and the IPO (initial public offerings) market has once
again burst into life to mop up some of that new money.
It is the economic numbers, though, that have generated the most enthusiasm.
On Tuesday, the news came out that durable goods orders had risen by 3.9 per
cent in October, a much bigger increase than analysts had anticipated.
Although the goods orders are notoriously volatile, and the latest data was
affected by unsustainably high transport and defence orders, there were
promising signs of life in electronic and electrical equipment and unfilled
non-defence orders.
On the same day, the Conference Board announced that its index of consumer
confidence had soared nearly 11 points to 65.5 in November, reinforcing the
growing perception that consumers are beginning to feel appreciably more
positive about their earning and spending prospects. With the all-important
Christmas shopping season already beginning, this is especially good news
for the retail sector.
The biggest statistic of the week was the newly-revised third quarter gross
domestic product figure. When the original estimate of a 2.7 per cent
increase in GDP was reported just before the election, many Wall Street
sages voiced doubts about the veracity of the data, arguing that the numbers
had been massaged to cast a more positive political light on economic
conditions. In the event, the doubting analysts were right that the figures
were off-track. But they proved to have under-estimated the extent of
economic growth. According to the new data, GDP grew by a handsome 3.9 per
cent in the July-to-September period.
The news must have made sad reading in the White House, where Bush's chief
spokesman said valiantly that the 'Bush recovery' was under way. But for
President-elect Clinton, the growing economy is a double-edged sword.
It might make his job easier next year, but delivering the substantial
fiscal-stimulus package he promised voters during the campaign becomes a
riskier proposition. The last thing the US and its markets need next year,
and in 1994, is an overheated economy.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: A new flag is flying over the City - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lutyens cupola on the Midland Bank building opposite the Bank of England
carries a new, startling flag these days: the red and white triangles of
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
That symbolic presence in the heart of the City is reflected in the stock
market. Silently, almost without anyone noticing, HSBC Holdings, the
Hongkong Bank's parent, has become a powerful influence on the market's
movements.
HSBC Holdings now makes up three per cent of the value of the FT-SE 100
index. Since its purchase of Midland Bank in July, when HSBC joined the
index, its shares have more than doubled, pulling the index up with them.
The sterling-denominated line of stock (there is also a line denominated in
Kong Kong dollars) was selling at 236p earlier in the summer; it is now
523p, down from its high of 570p.
Why such a big rise? One analyst who follows the group closely offers a
number of reasons. 'Very crudely,' he says, 'one third of the rise was due
to the devaluation of sterling - HSBC is probably the largest dollar earner
in the UK market. Another 20-30 per cent is due to the rise in the Hong Kong
stock market.'
A third element is a greater familiarity with the share among UK investors
and analysts. 'In the past, when nobody here knew much about it, there was
an obvious reaction: discount the growth. They now trust it more than they
did, so that discount has dropped. And finally, the results in August were
exceptionally good, and contrasted with yet another dismal set of earnings
from UK banks.'
The outlook for the stock hinges in part on political developments in Hong
Kong - the shares have dropped back from their highs as a result of the row
between Chris Patten, the colony's governor, and the government of China.
But it is noticeable that the sterling line of stock, which originally
traded at a 6-7 per cent discount to the Hong Kong dollar line, is now
trading at a slight premium. Though the shares may still be
under-represented in UK institutional portfolios, they are becoming a
routine part of City life - just like the red-and-white flag.
HSBC stands out when you look at how the equity market has performed between
May, when the FT-SE index marked a record close, and the fresh record set
this week. On Friday, the index closed at 2,760.6, 28.2 points higher than
the week before and 22.8 points above the record set on May.
Before turning to individual shares' performance, start by looking at the
upper line in the chart. Since the index was launched, it has traced out -
the collective frenzy of 1987 apart - a set of uneven oscillations around a
strong central trend. Each new leg of the market is greeted with great
excitement from the equity-watchers; lines drawn on charts; predictions of
glory and despair. And all for nothing, because the underlying trend is
quite clear: averaged over the period, a steady 12 per cent a year growth in
the values of the country's leading stocks.
There are two ways, however, in which that tidy pattern is misleading. One
of them is shown in the lower chart, which tracks the index in real terms,
adjusted for inflation. The underlying performance is halved, to a trend
growth rate of six per cent. More important, the steady pattern disappears.
Instead, the index traces out three stages: double-digit real growth from
1984 to 1986; a wild surge up and down in 1987; and sideways movement
thereafter. In real terms, share prices have budged very little in the past
seven years.
Second, the neat pattern traced by the index conceals much bigger swings by
industry sectors and companies. Between May and Thursday of this week, the
index was unchanged. But bank shares have risen 16 per cent; and telephone
and electricity utilities 14 per cent. Just as important, contractors have
dropped 40 per cent and aerospace companies 37 per cent. Even related
businesses have performed quite differently: composite insurers rose 11 1/2
per cent, but insurance brokers fell 29 per cent.
Within those industry sectors, performance has varied widely. That is where
HSBC comes in, pushing the banks into first place. Otherwise only Lloyds
Bank, up 17 per cent, and National Westminster, with a rise of 7 per cent,
can claim any glory. Bank of Scotland, Barclays, TSB and Royal Bank of
Scotland all fell in value. (This week, interestingly, Barclays was a strong
performer, closing up 17p at 373p - thanks to a sudden burst of unanimity
among analysts who follow the stock that the dividend was safe.)
HSBC apart, none of the FT-SE gainers had a really outstanding performance
over the period. But the real FT-SE basket cases would have lost you nearly
half your money in six months. BET has fallen 48 per cent since May; Arjo
Wiggins Appleton 46 per cent; and Rolls-Royce 45 per cent.
Such tales of woe apart, the market was driven on this week by one of its
recurrent waves of optimism about the economic outlook. Leo Doyle, of
Kleinwort Benson, drew attention to the fact that the volume of retail sales
is back at record levels. (The shops only seem empty, he says, because
there's Sunday opening and all that extra out-of-town space.) SG Warburg's
economists listed nine separate pieces of positive news - though most of
these were of the things-aren't-actually-getting-worse variety.
Still, as they point out, BT reported a 1-2 per cent year-on-year increase
in inland telephone calls during the three months to end-September, in place
of an expected 1 per cent decline. We do not know, of course, how many of
those callers were Access employees trying to speak to the chancellor of the
exchequer about the little matter of an overdue account . . .

FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: The sweet side of Tate's investment - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Biblical tag that appears on Lyle's Golden Syrup tins 'out of the strong
came forth sweetness' might be reversed when applied to Tate &amp; Lyle itself.
Out of the sweet came forth strength could be its motto.
In spite of a disastrous year in a couple of its main activities, the
company increased its dividend by 7 per cent to 12p. This show of confidence
by the directors should indicate to investors that the sugar and sweeteners
group will endeavour to increase its payout come what may.
That will mean that in the good years dividend increases may not match rises
in earnings per share. But a smooth dividend progression makes up for a lot
from a company subject to the vagaries of the weather as well as business
cycles.
That said, the fall in profits for the year to September 30 from Pounds
230.8m to Pounds 189.5m, reported this week, was the first drop in 14 years.
The wide range of countries in which Tate operates protects it from most of
the swings.
But in the past year Tate's Staley business in the US, which makes
high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener used in soft drinks, was faced with an
unusually adverse combination of events.
New capacity brought on stream by others made the market for HFCS
particularly competitive just when the US was suffering the second coldest
summer weather this century, dampening demand for soft drinks.
Lower volumes and lower prices have a powerful effect on profits in such a
high fixed cost business.
Profits from Staley dropped by more than Pounds 30m to Pounds 65.3m before
interest. Market circumstances cannot have been entirely to blame. Tate has
appointed a new chief executive in the division with experience in the corn
milling industry.
The group appears confident that volumes will recover filling surplus
capacity in the industry and helping prices.
The other problem area was US sugar beet processing, and profits in the US
sugar division were down nearly Pounds 20m despite a good performance by the
cane sugar side. Again the weather was to blame. Beets dug up and stored in
the fields awaiting processing first froze and then thawed unseasonably,
making them hard to process.
In spite of these reverses, and a number of one-off costs relating to
redundancies and write-downs, the group was still able to cover an increased
dividend more than twice. And it continued to invest at a high level,
despite gearing of 89 per cent. While this level of borrowings would be a
concern in many companies, Tate's strong cash generation should prevent it
from becoming a problem.
Tate's investment should turn it into a worldwide player in the sugar and
sweeteners industry. Long established in the UK, and for some time in North
America, Tate moved into Australia in 1991, and is expanding in Eastern
Europe.
While sugar might be regarded as a mature, commodity-type business in the
developed world, consumption in places such as Russia is much lower than in
the decadent west. Neil Shaw, Tate's chairman, is fond of remarking that the
growth in the world sugar market is equivalent to a new market the size of
the UK opening every year. This gives Tate opportunities to expand.
Decent returns from these businesses are likely to be some years on.
Meanwhile, a full recovery in earnings is expected in the current year. The
shares have risen 34p since the results were announced on Wednesday, closing
yesterday at 390p. A rebound to 33p of earnings gives a prospective p/e of
under 12, which is still on the cheap side.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Unit trusts reach Pounds 59.4bn - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of unit trust funds under management reached Pounds 59.4bn at the
end of October, the second highest figure ever. The number of unit trusts
also reached a high at 1,436, reflecting a wave of recent launches. There
was particular enthusiasm for international fixed-interest trusts and money
market funds, which attracted a net Pounds 34m and Pounds 24m respectively.
But the main impetus for the growth was the rise in share prices over the
month.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Tokyo stock market rises - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment that the Japanese government will embark on a programme of fiscal
expansion next year has helped push the Tokyo stock market into its most
prolonged run of price rises since February last year. This was not
difficult, as the index fell steeply during the first few months of 1992.
Sentiment persists among foreign investors that the market is over-valued.
The Nikkei index hit a low for the year of 14,309 in August, and on Friday
stood at 17,470.61. However, this is still below the year's high (in
September) of 18,908.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Irish investors do well out of poll turmoil - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Irish investors have done very well out of the nation's turmoil of the last
few weeks. While the country went to the polls foreign exchange dealers
decided that the punt was overvalued, forcing short-term interest rates to
apparently unsustainable levels.
All that uncertainty might have been expected to hit shares. But instead,
the market rallied by 6.68 per cent in a week after a very poor year.
Dealers wanted a devaluation, assumed it would take place, and priced stocks
accordingly. Remember on Black Wednesday, just before the UK left the
exchange rate mechanism when base rates hit 15 per cent, the FT-SE actually
rose by 8.3 points.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Odds in favour of fixed-rate offers - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW IS the time to get a fixed rate or capped mortgage while you can.
Depending on the term, you can get a fixed rate mortgage charging anywhere
between six and nine per cent. These represent very low rates by the
standards of the past 20 years.
While Britain was in the exchange rate mechanism, one could have argued that
the experience of the past 20 years was irrelevant; a new era of low
inflation and low interest rates had dawned. But now Britain has left the
ERM, it seems likely that the 'good old days' of stop-go economics, higher
inflation and volatile interest rates will be back.
In a sense, you are gambling whether you opt for a fixed or a variable rate
mortgage; in the former case, you take the risk that interest rates might
fall further; in the latter, you will lose out if rates subsequently rise.
There is never a perfect answer, since no one can predict the future level
of interest rates with any certainty. All homeowners can do is compare the
potential downside with the upside.
It is hard to imagine, even on the most extreme assumptions, that UK
mortgage rates could fall below five per cent. We can take that figure as
the bottom of the potential range. For argument's sake, we could take the
15.4 per cent which most building societies were charging in 1990 as the
highest level which rates might reach.
On that basis, current fixed rate offers are close to the bottom of the
potential range. The most you might miss out on, if rates fall to historic
lows, is two or three percentage points.
But if one looks back to September 1990, Nationwide was offering a five-year
fix at 12.9 per cent. That rate was a lot nearer the top of the 'range' than
the bottom, and thus the downside risk was greater than the upside
potential. And the bad news for those who opted for that deal is that there
is a redemption penalty of six months' interest. So the odds are far more in
favour of those opting for fixed rate mortgages now than they were in 1990,
or earlier in 1992, when rates were still over 10 per cent.
But when you do opt for a mortgage, make sure that the lender does not tilt
the odds too far in the opposite direction. Look at the arrangement fee; is
it substantial and how many months of interest saving (compared with the
current variable rate) does it represent? This is most important with very
short term fixes.
A second factor is to check for the 'extras' on which lenders frequently
insist. Is the loan available on repayment or interest-only terms, or are
endowment or pension policies required? And if the latter, can existing
policies be used, or must the borrower take out a new plan?
IS contents insurance via the lender a condition of the loan and, if so, is
the premium far in excess of that you would pay elsewhere? It is also
important to discover whether the loan is 'portable' - whether you can take
it from house to house, if you need to move. And portability needs to be
carefully defined; few people need a loan of exactly the same size when they
move house. So what happens if the loan needs to be increased?
If there is no portability, check the redemption penalty carefully. A
penalty of three or six months' interest could be very hefty if, for
whatever reason, you need to stop the loan.
Then there is the status of the lender. The fixed term will eventually end,
and then you will find yourself stuck with a variable rate. If you have
chosen a high street name which is committed to the mortgage business for a
long time, then you have a greater chance of being offered a competitive
deal at the end of the fix.
And finally, there is the term of the loan. Given that the odds are
currently in the borrower's favour, the longer the term of the fix, the
better. However, the rate for a longer term loan will be higher than those
available short term.
So how do the current offers stand against these principles? Unfortunately,
the Halifax's capped deal, which offered rates no higher than 9.29 per cent
until the year 2000, has sold out. But the society is now offering a fixed
rate of 8.65 per cent until January 31, 2000.
The application fee is a modest Pounds 175; the loan is available on
repayment, as well as other types of mortgage; the lender is a well-known
name; and the loan is portable (after 1994). If you move house and increase
your loan, then the fixed element can remain; any excess will be charged at
the standard variable rate. Should you stop the loan for any reason, the
redemption penalty is three months' interest.
A lower rate deal, but for a shorter term, is on offer from Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester - 7.99 per cent for five years. It is available on all types of
mortgages, and no other policies are needed. The application fee is Pounds
250, and the mortgage is portable on the same basis as that from Halifax.
Redemption penalty is six months' interest.
NatWest has a ten-year offer on the stocks, at 8.99 per cent, but this is
only available on endowment and pension mortgages (although existing
policies are acceptable). The arrangement fee is Pounds 250, but is waived
for first-time buyers.
Many fixed rate deals are being snapped up within days of launch. Other
deals are coming out all the time, so do not despair if you miss out on a
particular offer. But do consider the option seriously; as Black Wednesday
showed, you never know when the market might change for the worse.

FT  28 NOV 92 / The Long View: Playing the percentages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING DEALT with inflation by means of a two-year cold shower in the
European exchange rate mechanism the government now feels able to move on to
tackle today's more pressing problems, like rising unemployment and lack of
economic growth.
Unfortunately old habits - of which inflation is a persistent British one -
die hard. Yet there is a surprising diversity of opinion over the
seriousness of Britain's inflation after a substantial devaluation. Some
economists are relaxed, seeing no dangers in the monetary statistics, and
expecting inflation of no more than 1 to 3 per cent over the next year.
Other pundits, however, see inflation (currently 3.6 per cent on the October
reading) picking up next year to 5 or 6 per cent, where it would stay in
1994. This would, of course, be above the government's 1 to 4 per cent
target range.
The Society of Business Economists seems to want it both ways, projecting
this week that the Retail Price Index will rise by only 2 per cent in 1993
but by 6 per cent in 1994. As for the financial markets, the inflation rate
implied by the gap between the yields on fixed interest and index-linked
gilts is about 5 per cent, significantly higher than the 4 per cent just
before Black Wednesday.
As always, it depends on precisely what you mean by inflation. Recent falls
in interest rates are serving to reduce the headline rate of inflation
because of the impact of lower mortgage outgoings. By next spring, assuming
a further one-point cut in bank base rates, the cost of money could be as
much as 4 1/2 percentage points less than a year earlier. That might not all
be passed on to housebuyers, but the corresponding reduction in headline
inflation might be as much as two full percentage points, before dwindling
later in the year. But then interest rates might easily rise again,
producing a sharp flip upwards in the headline rate.
At least there will be no great new push from pay inflation over the next
year. It looks as though average earnings growth will subside from 6 to
perhaps 5 per cent. This would still be a bafflingly high figure in any but
a British context, considering the rate at which unemployment is rising. But
given the fall in the number of jobs and the possibility of a modest
recovery in gross domestic product the cost of labour per unit of output may
rise only slightly.
However, pay has risen much too fast for several years now. Average pay has
climbed by 7 per cent in real terms since 1988 although the British economy
is not producing any more than it was then. No wonder that the economic
numbers simply do not add up. There has to be a cut in real incomes which
will come about through rises in prices and indirect taxes.
Already food prices are jumping because of adjustments to the green pound.
One economist, Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming, has warned of the wider
potential impact of January 1 price lists as all kinds of import price rises
are pushed through. In September the main problem was the devaluation
against European currencies but some of those are being forced down too; the
problem has shifted to the dollar against which sterling has come down by a
quarter since August and by nearly 20 per cent since the beginning of the
year. This affects not just imports from the US but also a wide range of
dollar-priced commodities and many manufactures from the Far East which have
a dollar link. Import penetration is heading towards 30 per cent of the
goods consumed in the UK, and the overall trade-weighted devaluation has
been 15 per cent.
The monetarists tend to brush this aside. Monetary growth has slowed, to 5
per cent on the M4 basis. But it is not easy to assess what is a
non-inflationary rate of monetary growth. In the late 1980s the M4 growth
rate of 16 per cent or so only partly came through to inflation because of
rapid economic growth and a structural shift of savings into deposits (which
were not really to be regarded as spending money). In the 1990s the shift is
likely to be the other way, as savings are withdrawn and invested in assets
outside the M4 definition, such as gilts or National Savings products. Given
that economic growth is slightly negative at present you could argue that
any M4 growth above zero could give warning of future inflation. Meanwhile
the narrow money aggregates are beginning to accelerate.
For myself, I believe that imported price pressures will keep underlying
inflation at 5 per cent next year, to which you can add at least a
percentage point from the indirect tax rises which the government will be
forced to implement next spring (there is already a warning of higher taxes
on motorists to pay for the recent abolition of car tax). However, the
mortgage interest effect might hold the headline rate at something near 4
per cent.
Beyond that, the risks multiply. Inflation is not going to get seriously out
of control while the recession lasts, but what about the impact of a
recovery?
Indeed, there is a chance that sterling will be forced much lower next year,
certainly against the dollar, as the British government seeks to stimulate a
sluggish growth rate. The 1993 balance of payments deficit, officially
forecast at Pounds 15 1/2 bn and put by others at over Pounds 20bn (we would
be living beyond our means to the tune of around Pounds 1,000 per family)
could prove dangerous.
At this stage it is hard to see a way through the maze. If we are to find a
non-inflationary route we will certainly need stronger institutions than we
have now, and clearer guidelines than Norman Lamont's eclectic pot-pourri of
money growth ranges, inflation targets and house price indices.
In 1993 the inflation statistics may be more misleading than usual, and in
1994 they could produce some unpleasant surprises. We may wish we could find
another cold shower.

FT  28 NOV 92 / One man's war against the evils of society: Fifty years ago,
Sir William Beveridge battled to establish the welfare state amid the
horrors of world conflict. John Willman asks, did he succeed?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ALLIED guns had turned the tide of war at El Alamein in North Africa.
The Nazi advance across the frozen Soviet Union was held up at Stalingrad,
but mainland Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals was still under Hitler's
thrall.
Winston Churchill was at his desk as usual in Downing Street on a bleak
November day in 1942 when a heavy report dropped on to the maps and
directives spread before the prime minister. This volume was to change the
face of Britain in a way that no German blitz could do. It was the blueprint
for a welfare state.
Now 50 years later, the shortcomings in Sir William Beveridge's vision of a
comprehensive welfare system can be seen all too clearly - even though some
of the faults stem from the way in which his plans were implemented. At the
time, the Beveridge report sent shockwaves throughout Whitehall and
Westminster, fatally damaging Churchill's hopes of post-war re-election as
he strove to balance the huge potential cost of a welfare state against
public enthusiasm.
Ministers had expected the proposals to be much more modest. Beveridge's
inquiry had been set up in June 1941 at the request of the Trades Union
Congress to tidy up the confusion of inadequate social and medical insurance
schemes. No one expected him to start a revolution.
But the opening phrases showed the grandeur of his vision: 'A revolutionary
moment in the world's history is a time for revolutions, not for patching. .
. Want is only one of the five giants on the road of reconstruction. The
others are Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness.' The defeat of these
evil giants would require sweeping changes and big money.
As soon as the Treasury counted the costs, it opposed the reforms - and
Churchill was joined by other influential ministers in questioning the
expense, scope and timing of such an ambitious plan. Beveridge, indeed,
received no support from the cabinet except from Brendan Bracken, the
information minister. But after some skilfully-engineered press leaks, he
succeeded in getting the report published on December 2, 1942.
The reception was rapturous. A mile-long queue formed outside the government
bookshop for the 300-page report. It became a best-seller, with 250,000
copies sold that year. A cheap edition was sent out to the armed forces,
50,000 copies were sold in the US, and summaries in many languages were
parachuted into occupied Europe.
One Londoner quoted by Mass Observation, the opinion research organisation,
said that the publication of the Beveridge report ranked with VE Day (for
Victory in Europe) as one of the two most memorable days of the war.
A Gallup poll at the time showed that 95 per cent of the population knew
about the report and overwhelmingly approved of it. A complete translation
was circulated in Germany, marked 'Top Secret'. Copies of the Nazi response
to Beveridge were discovered in the remains of Hitler's Berlin bunker.
Beveridge even made it on to ITMA (It's That Man Again), the popular radio
comedy programme starring Tommy Handley and listened to by millions. Handley
was introduced as 'His Fatuity, the minister of Social Hilarity', who had
'been up the last three days and nights reading the first chapter of a book
called Gone with the Want by that stout fellow Beveridge'.
But the report's transition from vision to reality took three more years.
The delay hurt the popularity of Churchill and the Conservatives in his
coalition government, in spite of three white papers on the subject and the
introduction of the Family Allowances Act. The public's impatience for
change was one of the main reasons for the Labour party's landslide election
in 1945. The baton for social revolution passed to Clement Atlee.
Ironically, Beveridge had become chairman of this inquiry because his bosses
at the Ministry of Labour wanted to be rid of a turbulent academic and gave
him a job where they fancied he could do little harm. He remained master of
University College Oxford when he was co-opted into the service of the
wartime government, along with other distinguished academics, such as
Maynard Keynes and James Meade.
He took charge of manpower planning in the Ministry of Labour in 1940 and
soon began to annoy his minister, Ernest Bevin, the former trade unionist,
with unsolicited advice on how to win the war. He drew this from his
experience as a civil servant in the first world war when he helped to
organise mass mobilisation and food rationing.
'He was a very clever man, and had done a good job on manpower,' according
to Tom Wilson, later the Adam Smith Professor of Political Economy at
Glasgow University, who met Beveridge while working in the Cabinet Office
secretariat. 'But he was vain and terribly difficult to work with.'
Bevin took the first opportunity to rid himself of this difficult man and
when Beveridge accepted the chairmanship of the inquiry into social and
medical insurance, he had tears in his eyes. Eighteen months later, his
report with the unappealing title Social Insurance and Allied Services, was
on the desks of unhappy ministers.
Churchill himself was not opposed to the idea of a more comprehensive
welfare system. He had been responsible in 1909 for setting up labour
exchanges and launching the world's first statutory social insurance scheme.
But other compelling - and expensive - plans were being prepared: for
educational reform, for slum clearance and for the reconstruction of
industry. Churchill wanted to wait until after the war before committing the
country to any particular scheme.
Beveridge recommended the creation of a comprehensive system of national
insurance. Compulsory flat-rate contributions would be paid by employers,
the insured and the state, to pay for universal benefits such as a
retirement pension, sickness and unemployment benefit. These would provide
bare subsistence and would be paid to everyone, unlike pre-war benefits
which were subject to the hated means test. Those not covered by the
national insurance system could receive national assistance as a safety net.
These recommendations alone required a sharp rise in spending, sweeping away
the existing provision by friendly societies and the insurance companies.
But the plan also vastly increased the power of the state, which for the
first time would assume responsibility for the relief of poverty. Since the
Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601, this had been the job of local authorities.
The report's revolutionary heart lay, however, in three explicit assumptions
set out by the author. The abolition of want, squalor and the other three
giants could be achieved only if family allowances were paid for each child;
a free health service were made available to all; and the post-war
government would guarantee full employment.
The Treasury, as guardian of the public purse was almost bound to fight the
plans. In an effort to deflect this opposition, Beveridge discussed early
drafts of his report with Maynard Keynes, who was then an economic adviser
in the Treasury. Keynes was sympathetic and made several recommendations
designed to minimise resistance by reducing costs in the early years.
Unfortunately for Beveridge, Keynes's optimism was counterbalanced by
Treasury heavyweights such as Hubert Henderson, whose ability to foresee
disaster was legendary. Treasury jeremiads found a willing listener in
Churchill, who was angered by Beveridge's press leaks. Churchill's
colleagues in the war cabinet also found Beveridge's activities a
distraction from the main business of defeating the Germans, at a time when
victory was far from certain. The report was published only after Bracken
persuaded the cabinet that to suppress it would cause an outcry.
'Even the enemy took notice,' says Peter Baldwin, Professor of History at
the University of California (Los Angeles). 'The Nazis were piqued that, by
promising the state's concern for the material well-being of its citizens,
Beveridge had appropriated what they regarded as one of their best
propaganda weapons'
Not everyone was so admiring. The insurance industry objected to the
prospect of a state takeover of a large amount of its business. The
Prudential even produced a briefing to enable the 'man from the Pru' to
argue the case against Beveridge on the nation's doorsteps.
But how was the government to react? Churchill's policy adviser, Lord
Cherwell, told him that he should accept the report entirely, or shelve it
until after the war. The worst thing for the government, Cherwell thought,
would be to appear to accept it half-heartedly and under pressure, while
diluting its proposals.
But this was just what the War Cabinet did, partly because of pressure from
the Treasury and partly because Beveridge's abrasive style had antagonised
so many ministers. By the time the report was debated in Parliament in
February 1943, the government had accepted 16 of the 23 recommendations. But
even then, the event was turned into a public relations disaster. The
colourless John Anderson, Lord President of the Council, appeared lukewarm
just as the report was becoming a banner of hope amid the terrors and
privation of war.
In a radio broadcast a month later, Churchill said he supported a national
social insurance scheme for all classes 'from the cradle to the grave'. But
this was too little and too late to save him from electoral defeat in 1945.
Ironically, Beveridge was also rejected, losing Berwick, the seat he had
taken for the Liberals in a 1944 by-election.
But sadly for Beveridge's vision, the implementation of the report after
1945 was flawed. The unified benefit rates for the new national insurance
scheme were nearly a third below what Beveridge had recommended as necessary
for subsistence. There was also no commitment for annual uprating to
inflation-proof the benefit levels. This, in turn, left a growing number
dependent on the means-tested safety net.
Many modern critics also question Beveridge's reliance on insurance as a
basis for eligibility for benefits. Beveridge felt that the payment of
insurance contributions would eliminate the stigma of dependence. Again,
this noble aim has been overtaken by the growing numbers in poverty who have
never been contributors, especially single parents. A two-tier welfare state
has been created, in which one group enjoys contributory, non-stigmatised
benefits and another relies on the means-tested safety net.
Beveridge has also been criticised for his insistence on flat-rate
contributions and benefits. On the contributions side, this simply proved
inequitable - and it was not long before contributions became
earnings-related, implying an element of redistribution as well as social
insurance.
The payment of flat-rate benefits was designed to encourage people to
continue to make their own provision to top up the state pension - Beveridge
was keen not to discourage thrift. But he was too successful: these benefits
are at subsistence levels and most better-off people have made additional
pension provision for themselves, so much so that for many the state pension
has become a relatively unimportant source of income in retirement. This has
undermined their commitment to a welfare state in which all pay into and
draw out of a common pot, allowing the level of the state benefits to remain
at very basic levels.
Beveridge's vision of a health service commanded almost universal support
for most of the post-war era, but his optimism that costs would fall as the
nation's health improved turned out to be completely wrong. This means that
his fundamental assumptions are now having to be reassessed as medical costs
and the demand for health care rise ever more steeply.
However, Beveridge's welfare state was a product of the age. All social
classes shared the same air-raid shelters and suffered the same blitz.
Rationing represented deprivation for the middle classes, but it meant
cheaper food and better nutrition for many working people. And the
evacuation of over 4m mothers and children to the country broke down many
social barriers.
In such circumstances, people accepted high taxation and common sacrifice.
Beveridge's vision was seductive in a regimented wartime society, with the
economy under strong central control and common suffering. But since the
war, rising affluence has eroded that feeling of social solidarity, while
new social problems have overtaken the report's original credo.
As the celebrations begin next week for the 50th anniversary of the
Beveridge report, it would be equal folly to blame him for the defects of
the welfare state as to idealise its conception during the horrors of war.
Those reshaping the system in entirely different circumstances have yet to
find a modern equivalent of Beveridge's vision and sense of the public mood.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Russian army officers train for more taxing profession

<TEXT>
TURNING swords into plough-shares has taken on a new meaning in Russia as
army officers made redundant because of defence cuts retrain as tax
inspectors.
Dr Nikolai Filinov, in charge of a special diploma for officers trying to
find their feet in the new Russia, claims they have a special contribution
to make.
'It's mostly women who work there now, but former officers will be ideal in
situations where tax collectors have to go and persuade enterprises into
paying taxes,' he claimed.
Both the creation of an efficient tax-collection system and the scaling down
of Russia's huge army are essential if the centrally planned economy, geared
primarily to the needs of a bloated defence establishment, is to be
transformed.
The two tasks are fraught with difficulties. Thousands of officers must find
new jobs in civilian life, while an old-style tax inspectorate is having
trouble adjusting to numerous new demands. These include coping with complex
levies such as value added tax and trying to extract money from new
businesses, which pay no taxes, and old state-owned enterprises which are
too indebted to pay taxes to a bankrupt state.
Mr Sergei Alexashenko, a Russian economist specialising in tax and budgetary
issues, said a lack of trained personnel was a big obstacle to efficient tax
collection. He also cited a primitive banking system, which can take months
to effect transfers, and the temptations for poorly paid tax inspectors to
accept bribes.
A Moscow institute named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze, a Bolshevik
revolutionary, is trying to help solve both problems with a four-month
training course giving former officers basic skills in business management
and tax collection.
Prof Mikhail Koptiev, who teaches a class in international finance - which
includes topics such as capital flight, a big problem for Russia - said the
military made ideal students: 'They are very disciplined, very educated, and
learn fast.'
Almost half this year's intake of 200 are military men, 33 of whom are
already working as tax inspectors. But many of the future graduates hope to
use their skills to go into business instead. Military skills may come in
handy there too.
Air force Col Viktor Kondratiev, 45, said he wanted to set up a civilian air
transport company. But Lt-Col Igor Anikeev, 38, had not made up his mind to
leap into the unknown. 'We are used to living in an orderly world, and
government service has a certain security about it.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Financier faces probe into Castor collapse
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WOLFGANG Stolzenberg, the secretive German-Canadian financier, has agreed
to be examined under oath in Montreal next week over the collapse of Castor
Holdings, the international property finance group which he controlled.
Mr Stolzenberg, accompanied by a legal representative, is due to be
questioned from Tuesday by officials of Richter &amp; Associates, Castor's
bankruptcy trustee. The examination, lasting up to four days, will be in
private.
Castor, which specialised in high-risk second and third mortgages and
construction loans, was put into receivership in July. Although the value of
its assets was set at CDollars 1.9bn (Pounds 960m) in 1991, creditors are
expected to lose at least CDollars 1bn.
The creditors are mostly European banks and private investors, attracted by
the 1980s North American property boom and tax benefits Castor obtained by
channelling much of its business through offshore tax havens.
The trustee is also due to provide creditors next week with a second
progress report on the wind-up of Castor. They will be told investigations
are at a delicate stage and little information can be divulged.
Mr Stolzenberg is one of about 20 people Richter officials are interviewing.
The trustee also wants to question Mr Karsten von Wersebe, co-founder of
Castor with Mr Stolzenberg. Mr von Wersebe's other interests include a
controlling stake in York-Hannover, another troubled Canadian property group
with strong European links. Until earlier this year, he also controlled
Coutinho Caro, a bankrupt Hamburg steel, shipping and construction group.
Mr von Wersebe's companies have been at the centre of allegations in
Switzerland that Rothschild Bank of Zurich, an associate of N M Rothschild
of London, contravened banking rules by advancing more than 20 per cent of
its capital in unsecured loans to a single customer.
Among the subjects on which Mr Stolzenberg is likely to be questioned are
his links with Castor and Imry Merchant Developers, the UK property group in
which he acquired a controlling stake in 1989.
Imry's affairs were discussed at a meeting in London last week between Mr
Stolzenberg, Imry's other directors and officials of Barclays Bank, which
has an exposure of just under Pounds 400m to Imry and faces huge losses on
these loans.

FT  28 NOV 92 / German pay demand set at 5%: Consumer price increase sours
mood after moderate wage claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CLAIM for a basic 5 per cent pay increase for 2.3m west German public
sector workers next year was cautiously welcomed yesterday as the first sign
that wage-driven inflation might be brought under control.
However, the mood was soured by provisional figures which showed consumer
prices had risen 0.5 per cent last month, leaving the annual inflation rate
unchanged at 3.7 per cent. Most economists had expected a small decline.
The pay demand, agreed by national leaders of the oTV union yesterday,
compares with last year's 9.5 per cent basic claim. This led to a bitter
11-day strike in the spring.
It raised hopes that a deal could be struck around the 3 per cent level that
the Bundesbank considers necessary in all sectors in the west if inflation
is to be combatted effectively and interest rates reduced.
But the claim also raised the prospect of a difficult negotiating round for
the federal government, the main public sector employer. Professor Herbert
Hax, leader of the 'five wise men' who give Bonn independent economic
advice, recommended a pay freeze for public officials.
Although private sector groups, including banking, insurance and steel
workers, are pressing claims of 7.5 per cent, the oTV leaders appear to have
taken account of the accelerating economic downturn and non-stop campaigning
for pay restraint by government, employers and the Bundesbank.
'Such a realistic demand can only be positive,' said economist Mr Peter
Pietsch at Commerzbank. He expected oTV to settle for
'three-point-something' and a similar pattern in the private sector. Other
unions appeared to be showing much more flexibility than in the past two
years, when settlements of between 6 and 7 per cent contributed to inflation
increases, he said.
Although steel workers' representatives earlier this week refused a 3 per
cent offer, the rejection came without the threats which characterised last
year's wage negotiations.
'Much too high,' said Mr Dietrich Beier at Berliner Bank. Taking into
account oTV's as yet undefined demands for a 'social component', he guessed
the claim was worth 6 per cent or more. 'The right number is 3 per cent; 3.5
per cent is too high for the Bundesbank and too high for the solidarity
pact,' he said.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seeking agreement on a solidarity pact involving
opposition parties, unions and employers, aimed at solving the economic
crisis in the east and countering recessionary tendencies in the west.
Government officials, who are expected to start negotiations with oTV before
Christmas, will enter the talks with little room to manoeuvre. Bonn is
pledged to limit increases in spending next year to 2.5 per cent.
If it sets an example to the private sector with a settlement deemed
'unsuitable' by the Bundesbank, then prospects for lower interest rates in
the new year would be damaged.

FT  28 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Medeva
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market might be forgiven for being left behind by the whirl of
acquisitions and disposals at Medeva. In last year's annual report the
chairman was still talking about building the largest generic
pharmaceuticals company in the UK. Most of that business has now been sold.
Getting out of low-margin commodity generics looks sensible. But Medeva can
hardly expect the market not to worry about what the next twist of strategy
will bring.
Having seen its shares fall by 25 per cent from their peak this year, Medeva
will struggle to fund its grand ambitions by issuing new paper. That being
placed in the US to acquire the Armstrong respiratory drugs business could
be an unwelcome drag on the price. Some solid growth from the remaining
hodge-podge of businesses would not go amiss. Whether the management can
deliver such growth remains an open question. Niche positions in areas like
narcotic pain killers look secure, but the growth prospects are less
obvious. The asthma market looks a better bet with Glaxo's Ventolin losing
its US patent next year. New accounting standards should at least help
separate the wheat from the chaff by making Medeva strip out the
contribution of discontinued business.
The shares have still out-performed the market by some 200 per cent in the
two years since Mr Bernard Taylor arrived from Glaxo. Investors must decide
whether the recent weakness is simply a blip in a longer upward trend. There
was little underlying yesterday's nine-month numbers, however, to prove that
Medeva has the skills to regain its premium rating.

FT  28 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must come as a relief to Allied-Lyons that it is finally free to go ahead
with its Carlsberg venture, especially on slightly less onerous terms than
those originally proposed by the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission. Instead of
rationing supplies to its tied outlets, Allied faces the simpler task of
freeing a further 400 from the tie. That was not enough, though, to prompt a
share price reaction yesterday. The market has assumed for some time that
the venture would go ahead and that the short-term earnings impact would be
small.
Consummation of the deal will produce a cash inflow of some Pounds 135m in
the current half, which should cut the interest bill on the company's Pounds
1.9bn debt. But those savings will probably be offset by rationalisation
charges in distribution and administration.
Of more immediate interest is what the company says about current trading at
next week's interim results. Worries on that score, though more particularly
over food and spirits than beer, have been the ostensible reason for a 3 per
cent share price fall since Tuesday. That looks odd against a rising market,
but Allied has outperformed Guinness by over 15 per cent since Black
Wednesday - all the more ambitious since the two are now trading on an
almost identical historic multiple of 15.

FT  28 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A week after the latest half-hearted realignment, the ERM is holding
together, but only just. Several factors may have helped stave off the new
crisis that seemed imminent on Monday. The Irish election was a distraction.
Trading was subdued by the US Thanksgiving Day holiday. Countries in the
immediate firing line raised short term rates. And the French franc was
bolstered in midweek by a large Far Eastern commercial order. None of this
is enough, though, to obscure the fact that basic tensions in the system are
unresolved.
Indeed, without a background of currency strain, the Bundesbank might even
have reasons for increasing rates. Money supply growth is in double digits.
The latest regional inflation figures are particularly disappointing: the
state of Hesse yesterday reported a year-on-year consumer price rise of 4.2
per cent. True, the emphasis could change if next week's industrial output
and unemployment figures point to further economic weakness. But the
Bundesbank is more concerned with inflation than offsetting the cycle. The
trouble is that as long as it persists with tight money, other ERM countries
must subject themselves to a deflationary discipline which defies
credibility.
Small wonder, then, that the French franc is again looking sickly and the
Irish punt fell below its floor against the Belgian franc yesterday
afternoon. It is just possible that with Christmas approaching and a good
year's profits already in the bag, currency traders may decide the party
circuit holds more appeal than another bout of nerve-wracking speculation.
But sooner or later, something will have to give. The question is one of
timing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an undeniably firm tone to London equities at the moment, even if
the market waited for Wall Street yesterday before going on to conquer
another FT-SE closing peak. The conviction is growing that, even if recovery
comes slowly, 1994 will be a period of strong UK corporate earnings growth;
next year, as a consequence, may not be the time for sitting on the
sidelines.
A curious feature, though, is investor uncertainty about what companies to
be buying. In the wake of sterling's depreciation overseas earners were an
obvious target. But there remains a distinct ambivalence about the relative
merits of defensive and cyclical stocks. Part of the problem is probably
semantics, with the likes of Reuters, Cable and Wireless and BT these days
defying easy categorisation. Investors are also likely to be wary of
cyclicals, which have flattered at least twice in the last couple of years
only to deceive. More pertinently, though, many of the companies which
benefited at this stage of previous cycles may not prosper to the same
extent this time round. Building materials producers and others dependent on
the traumatised property market are one category; hotels and leisure groups
dependent on the unlikely return of high-spending consumers form another.
Conversely, the market may look more favourably on sectors like paper and
packaging, transport, speciality chemicals and even engineering.
The durability of the current rally in equities, meanwhile, will to some
extent rest on where long gilt yields settle. That, though, is a problem for
next year's second half.

FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Optimism lifts Dow in light
trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stock markets continued to advance along a broad front yesterday amid
mounting optimism about the outlook for the economy, although trading volume
was light, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At 2pm, when the market closed early because of the long Thanksgiving
holiday weekend, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.94 at 3,282.20,
its highest point since mid-September. The more broadly based
Standard&amp;Poor's 500, meanwhile, finished 0.97 at 430.16, at another all-time
high. The Amex composite index rose 0.51 to 393.39, while the Nasdaq
composite rose 1.16 to 649.49, a new record high. Turnover on the New York
SE was 106m shares, while rises outpaced declines by 959 to 647.
Many participants extended the Thanksgiving holiday, but there was enough of
a follow-through of buying from earlier in the week to help share prices
post strong gains, although late profit-taking took 10 points off the Dow in
the final half-hour.
Investors are feeling more positive about the economy every day, and in the
wake of Tuesday and Wednesday's promising numbers on GDP, consumer
confidence and big-ticket factory orders, came more good news in the shape
of a 1.0 per cent rise in personal income and a 0.7 per cent rise in
personal spending for October. Both numbers bode well for the economic
recovery, which appears to be gathering pace.
Although the figures depressed Treasury market sentiment - the benchmark
30-year government issue closed down  21/32 , yielding 7.590 per cent - the
rise in bond yields did not upset equities.
Among individual stocks, blue-chips were mostly higher. IBM rose Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 , Merck put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 45 7/8 ,
International Paper firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 , Du Pont climbed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 5/8 and Caterpillar rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54
1/4 . Transportation stocks expected to benefit from increased economic
activity were also in demand, with airlines leading the way. AMR, parent of
American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/8 , Delta climbed
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 52 3/4 and UAL added Dollars 1 at Dollars 120 7/8 .
USAir was the exception, easing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 7/8 . On the
Nasdaq market, Ohio Bancorp surged Dollars 4 1/4 , or 16 per cent, to
Dollars 30 1/4 on the news that the banking group is in takeover talks.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended higher, buoyed by gains in Canadian gold and bank
shares. The composite index rose 4.3 points or 0.13 per cent to 3,276.5 on
volume of 32.1m shares valued at CDollars 290m, compared to turnover of
25.9m on Thursday.

FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Swiss equities uneasily calm before EEA
vote - Ian Rodger assesses the possible impact of a 'yes' or 'no' to closer
ties with the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss stock market has entered a period of uneasy calm ahead of the
national referendum next month on the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty.
The campaign in the run-up to this vote has been the most passionate seen in
Switzerland since a plebiscite on foreign residents in the early 1970s.
Opinion polls show an extraordinarily large proportion of Swiss - 20 per
cent - still undecided about whether to make this large leap towards closer
economic integration with the European Community (EC).
The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) oscillated from a low for the
year of 1,053 at the end of August to more than 1,150 in early November
before contracting the EEA blues which brought it lower, and kept it down
last week before it recovered 12.9 yesterday to close at 1,138.7. This
leaves it still 8.2 per cent up on the year.
As might be expected, the SMI index of leading shares has diverged from the
overall market plan as investors have taken refuge in the blue-chip issues.
At its closing level yesterday of 1,914.6, it is up about about 12 per cent
since late August.
Analysts agree that, barring further large external shocks, the EEA issue
will dominate the market until the December 6 vote. The outcome is of
critical importance to many quoted Swiss companies.
If the treaty is accepted, export-oriented machinery makers such as the
machine tool maker, George Fischer, and the lifts producer, Schindler, will
benefit, while hitherto protected domestic retailers and breweries will
suffer from increased competition. If the treaty is rejected, the patterns
will reverse.
For the big banks and multinational industrial companies, such as Nestle,
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Ciba Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, the consensus view -
encouraged by these organisations themselves - is that the impact of the
vote will be negligible. This is because they are already well-established
in the EC through subsidiaries and factories and depend to a very small or,
in the case of the banks, a diminishing extent on the Swiss market for their
earnings.
The market would prefer a 'yes' vote, because it is felt that a rejection
would further dampen an already weak economy. Many economists believe that a
'yes' vote would add about 4 to 6 per cent to Swiss GDP over the next two
years. Thus, when opinion polls last week indicated that the anti-EEA view
was gaining ground, the market fell.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich believes that the market
has still not entirely discounted the likelihood (in his view) of a negative
outcome. 'Not all participants have discounted a 'no', especially those from
abroad, so I believe that the market could be surprised if there is a
rejection, and could decline by about 4 per cent,' he says.
Mr Stephan Meier, head of Swiss equity investment research at Swiss Bank
Corporation, agrees. 'If 20 per cent of the people have not decided on the
outcome, how can the market be expected to decide?' he asks.
The anticipation of a negative result can already be seen in the recent
performance of some key shares. Ascom, the telecommunications group which is
pushing aggressively into EC markets, has plunged from SFr1,260 at the
beginning of November to SFr1,090. Schindler bearers have fallen from
SFr3,020 to SFr2,870 over the same period.
SBC has analysed 60 companies which make up 90 per cent of the Swiss
market's capitalisation and has concluded that earnings of 40 of them would
decline in the event of a negative vote. Put another way, their average
profit growth next year would drop from 20 per cent to 16 per cent. Still,
the main negative effects would be in the longer term, Mr Meier argues, as
many Swiss companies would lose their competitiveness in Europe.
As for the stock market, he fears that there would be a loss of confidence
by foreign investors in all but the top Swiss stocks, and he recommends that
investors use derivatives, such as puts on the SMI, to safeguard their
positions during this uncertain period.
Once the EEA vote is out of the way, analysts believe that investors'
attention will once again focus on fundamentals, and there is not much
optimism on that front either. Earnings reports this week from Nestle and
ABB have indicated that times are getting tougher. 'They were not bad, but
they were worse than expected,' says Mr Wolfgang Strub, an analyst at Swiss
Volksbank.
Mr Sangiorgio agrees. 'Our adjustments to earnings estimates are all on the
downside these days, and that process is not finished,' he predicts.
Baer has just revised down its forecast for Swiss GDP for next year, now
anticipating a decline of 0.4 per cent instead of a flat result. The only
support for the market will come from declining interest rates and
inflation, Mr Sangiorgio says.

FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases after
seven-day climb
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POSITION adjustment ahead of the weekend pushed prices down, and share
prices fell for the first time in seven trading days despite buying by
arbitrageurs and public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 8.43 to 17,470.61, falling after its longest
consecutive rise since February last year though still up 2.6 per cent on
the week. The index fluctuated between the day's low of 17,368.61 and high
of 17,569.21.
Volume fell to 250m shares from 311m. Although the Nikkei fell, other market
indices reflected the underlying, positive sentiment. Gainers led losers by
531 to 426 with 173 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 4.48 to 1,307.54, while the second section also advanced. In London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.95 to 1,055.96.
Dealers covered short positions while public funds were seen small-lot
buying. However, traders said that genuine buying by institutional investors
was absent.
Securities issues recovered after a fall on Thursday's announcement by
Nomura Securities of compensation totalling Y23bn to individual clients, due
to slack sales procedures. Nomura Securities gained Y50 to Y1,450 and Daiwa
Securities Y25 to Y835.
Banks, which annnounced interim earnings results on Thursday, were mixed.
Dealers adjusted positions on bank issues as brokers noted increased
inquiries from financial authorities concerning share price movements.
Traders said short-selling hedge funds, wary of being questioned by the
ministry of finance, were reluctant to take out new positions. Bank of Tokyo
fell Y10 to Y1,340 and Sakura Bank remained unchanged at Y1,150.
Some high-technology issues which rose on Thursday on buying by public
funds, fell on profit-taking. NEC fell Y12 to Y671 and Hitachi lost Y3 to
Y723.
Precision makers gained ground on hopes of a recovery in the US economy.
Canon rose Y20 to Y1,330 and Citizen Watch gained Y11 to Y905. Honda Motor
also advanced, by Y60 to Y1,380.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 55.20 to 18,788.59 in volume of 29.1m
shares.
Roundup
DOMESTIC and international influences lifted most of the region's markets,
but Australia failed to regain its momentum.
NEW ZEALAND extended its bull run yet again, the NZSE-40 index closing 20.26
higher at 1,545.27, up 6.9 per cent on the week, in moderate turnover of
NZDollars 29m.
Fletcher Challenge closed up 11 cents at NZDollars 2.11 amid rumours that it
is about to announce an asset sale.
HONG KONG got a boost from London traded stocks and the Hang Seng index
climbed 73.49 to 5,986.67, 1.8 per cent higher on the week, in turnover up
from HKDollars 1.81bn to HKDollars 1.97bn.
Banks posted the sharpest increases, with HSBC Holdings and its Hang Seng
Bank unit both rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 60 and HKDollars 54
respectively.
BANGKOK rose as a Bt10bn rescue fund pooled by brokers had started buying.
The SET index rose 11.25 to 869.49, fractionally down on the week, in
turnover of Bt5.82bn.
SINGAPORE took its gain on the week to 2.4 per cent as the Straits Times
Industrial index closed 10.97 higher at 1,447.96.
AUSTRALIA stayed flat in mixed trade, still 2.9 per cent higher on the week
as the All Ordinaries index finished 0.1 lower at 1,450.8. Turnover was
ADollars 385m and CSR was the star of the day, rising 14 cents to ADollars
3.75 on improved earnings.
SEOUL fell on pre-election jitters. The composite index shed 10.09 to 650.85
but stood 2.4 per cent higher on the week, in turnover down from Won587.5bn
to Won504.9bn. BOMBAY opened weak at the start of the new account but
finished mixed on late institutional buying. The BSE index ended 0.70 down
at 2,460.80, down 0.8 per cent on the week.

FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm bourse resumes
post-devaluation rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES traded quietly after an eventful week during which renewed currency
tension monopolised investors' attention, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM resumed its post-devaluation rally after Thursday's pause. The
Affarsvarlden general index rose 22.7 or 2.6 per cent to 885.2, up 7.8 per
cent on the week, in turnover of SKr811m, down from SKr1.12bn. Trading
concentrated on blue chips and Ericsson B shares added SKr5 to SKr177 in
volume of SKr122m.
With the exception of bank shares, all sectors posted advances. A sharp jump
was registered for the real estate and construction sector, up 14.2 per cent
on speculation that lower interest rates will bring about a recovery in
property prices.
The banking sector dropped 5.5 per cent, after its 30 per cent surge over
the previous two trading sessions. Handelsbanken B fell SKr1 to SKr33.5
while S-E-Banken C eased SKr2 to SKr15.
PARIS continued to speculate about the future of the franc, and the CAC-40
index ended 10.11 higher at 1,749.79, up 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover
was a paltry FFr1.5bn.
The most significant faller of the day was Michelin which dropped FFr6.8 or
3.7 per cent to FFr178.70 on news that the tyre manufacturer had introduced
short-time working, including extended Christmas shutdowns, at a number of
its European factories.
The television stock, Canal Plus, fell FFr23 to FFr1,045 after Carolco
Pictures, in which it has a 12 per cent stake, said again that it was unable
to pay its debts.
Risers included Rhone Poulenc CIs, up FFr6 to FFr514 following its meeting
with analysts in London and Lafarge, FFr6.70 higher at FFr312.50.
MILAN ended mixed in thin trading and the Comit index eased just 0.05 to
442.58, down 3.6 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at not more
than Thursday's L170.5bn.
The agro-industrial and food group, Montedison, made early gains after
Thursday's announcement of management changes in the company and at its
parent group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria. The stock added L49 or 4.3 per cent to
L1,200 at the fixing but eased back later.
Other stocks which had been bid up for speculative reasons fell back as the
retailer, Rinascente, dropped L381 or 5.2 per cent to L6,900. But the
state-controlled food group, Sme, rose L25 to L5,645.
FRANKFURT closed a grey week, featuring moderately depressing inflation
reports, worrying Volkswagen results and disappointment with interest rate
prospects. The DAX index ended at 1,522.93, down 0.23 on the day and 1.4 per
cent lower over the last five.
Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM3.8bn. VW fell again, by DM3.70 to DM267, as
other carmakers recovered. Retailers were also inclined mostly to move back
up again but dealers said that they did not believe this to be a
pre-Christmas rally.
The retail sector - with Hornbach, in do-it-yourself, as the exception  - is
rated underweight in a James Capel review which underweights the Frankfurt
market as a whole; and it is underperforming. The DM5 rise to DM430 in
Douglas left the luxury-oriented specialist down 5.5 per cent on the week
and, in department stores, Karstadt fell another DM3.80 to DM500.20 for a 4
per cent drop over five days.
OSLO fell in thin trading as speculation about a devaluation of the crown
receded. The all-share index ended 3.61 lower at 353.74, down 0.7 per cent
on the week, in turnover worth NKr172m.
BRUSSELS closed lower and Solvay was one of the main victims, falling SKr175
to SKr11,050. The Bel-20 index lost 4.07 to 1,125.56, down 1.5 per cent on
the week.
AMSTERDAM saw the recovery in chemical stocks continue as Akzo picked up Fl
1 to Fl 131 and DSM added 60 cents to Fl 72.80. But the troubled shipping
company, Nedlloyd, shed another 90 cents to Fl 29.40 following Thursday's
news of a net loss this year. The CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at
103.2, down 0.2 per cent on the week.
MADRID's reawakening on Thursday proved short-lived, and block trades
provided most of yesterday's Pta13.23bn turnover as the general index
finished 0.52 higher at 215.29, 1.2 per cent up on the week. Utilities saw
support on hopes that they would maintain their dividends, Sevillana closing
Pta18 or 4.4 per cent higher at Pta426 and Union Fenosa, the day's most
active stock adding Pta12 to Pta401 in 1.75m shares.
ISTANBUL rose 2.4 per cent for a two-day gain of 5.2 per cent on the
prospect of a tax decree favouring equity investment. The 75-share index
closed 88.27 higher at 3,843.06.

FT  28 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: New UK peak as Wall Street returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE INDEX pushed ahead to new peaks yesterday after Wall Street
returned from its Thanksgiving holiday in good spirits, apparently
signalling satisfaction with the better news on the US economy released
earlier this week. The London market turned ahead strongly when the Dow
Industrial Average gained 28 points in early trading.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at a new closing peak of 2,760.1
for a net gain of 18.3 points. Trading volume increased sharply and the
stock market was driven ahead by arbitraging pressure from the stock index
market where the December contract came within seven points of 2,800 at one
stage.
Some US buyers were seen in the futures sector but UK traders pointed out
that yesterday was also the final session of the two week trading account in
London, and that some of the buying pressure was speculative.
The market opened quietly, with London evidently waiting for Wall Street to
return to business at mid-afternoon UK time. Share prices edged higher but
the stock market made little response to a cautious report from the
Confederation of British Industry that manufacturing order books had rallied
and that a slow recovery in the domestic economy next Spring seemed likely.
But early gains were lost as buyers stayed resolutely on the sidelines and
the market was little changed when the first hints of Wall Street's mood
reached London.
The rise in the Footsie was dramatic and at best the Index showed a gain of
more than 20 points at a new trading high of 2,761.9. Yesterday's rise
enabled the Footsie to close with a gain of 27.7 points on the week and of
around 2.3 per cent over the two week trading account. Seaq volume jumped to
665.9m shares from the 601.7m of the previous session; Thursday's retail
value of equity trading remained high at Pounds 1.28bn.
As expected, it was the US-orientated stocks which led the way forward, with
Reuters, the global information group standing out strongly.
However, oil stocks were restrained by uncertainty over crude oil prices and
demand for the pharmaceuticals was selective.
Optimism spread to the domestic consumer stocks, which would respond to a
recovery in world economies.
But government bonds fell yesterday, reviving worries about the impact of
impending government funding.
Although restrained by uncertainty in currency markets, equity retail
business has remained above last year's average daily levels.

FT  28 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY TRADING in derivatives markets played a leading role in driving the
London stock market ahead yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
Buyers flooded into stock index futures when Wall Street came back from
Thanksgiving Day sending the December contract sharply higher.
At best the December contract was at 2,793. By the close, the contract stood
at 2,785, a premium of 30 against cash and about 20 on the fair value
premium, which allows for dividend flows and carrying costs. There was heavy
arbitraging between cash and futures. The contract traded 7,786 contracts.
However, traders warned that some of the dealing reflected position closing
and speculation ahead of the end of the equity trading account. In the new
account which opens on Monday fair value premium will shrink to around 5
points.
Turnover in traded options, however, slipped to 24,489 contracts from 25,759
on Thursday. United Biscuits was the top traded stock option with 2,185
contracts.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Week in the Markets: Smelter closure boosts aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAJIKISTAN WAS the word on every aluminium trader's lips this week as their
market climbed to the highest level since mid-October.
Until two years ago few London Metal Exchange traders had even heard of the
small Soviet republic just to the north of the Hindu Kush. But since the
collapse of the Soviet Union it had become something of a dirty word on the
exchange as a major contributor to the flood of CIS aluminium in which the
western market was floundering.
This week, however, it was rumoured, reported, denied and finally confirmed
that production at the republic's giant Regar smelter had ground to a
virtual halt because of a lack of raw materials. The smelter, which has a
nominal capacity of 520,000 tonnes a year, produced 370,000 tonnes of metal
last year, virtually all of it going to swell exports to the west, which are
estimated to have totalled between 800,000 and 1m tonnes.
A month ago output had been cut to an annual rate of 200,000 tonnes because
of a dispute about ownership, which dried up money for spare parts and shut
down two of the three anode lines.
What appears to have been the final blow was the cutting of rail links
between Russia and Tajikistan, which is troubled by increasingly violent
ethnic disputes. Russia has been the sole source of alumina (aluminium
oxide) for the smelter since Azerbaijan cut off supplies some time ago,
complaining that no aluminium was being shipped back in payment.
A National Security Committee (formerly the KGB) official had a similar
explanation for the loss of Russian supplies. He told the Reuter news agency
that alumina shipments had been halted 'because of overdue debts'. That
prompted analyst Nick Moore to comment in yesterday's issue of Ord Minnett's
Daily Metal Market Monitor: 'One cannot help but wonder just how many of the
other 14 (CIS) smelters are in a similar position'. He also recalled a
speaker at the Oslo Aluminium Conference in September saying that 'no-one
pays any bills in Russia any more'.
Mr Moore calculated that the drying up of Tajik supplies was equivalent to
western aluminium demand growing by more than 2 per cent. 'Now that's worth
having,' he said.
The market response was more cautious, understandably perhaps, in view of
the long term problems of the aluminium sector. The three months price on
the LME climbed to Dollars 1,222 a tonne at one point, before closing
yesterday at Dollars 1,219.50 a tonne, up Dollars 33 on the week.
Copper was another strong market as base metals traders responded to
constructive US economic data. The three months price yesterday broke
through resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 2,190 a tonne to close at
Pounds 1,474.25 a tonne up Pounds 30 on the day and Pounds 43.75 on the
week.
Nickel continued the rally that began in the middle of last week with three
months metal gaining another Dollars 597.50 to Dollars 6,075 a tonne.
Dealers said Chinese buying encouraged the rise, and added that there was
talk of production cuts in Australia and the Dominican Republic.
Zinc's upturn was also maintained, with the LME's three months position
rising Dollars 71 on the week to Dollars 1,138.50 a tonne. The market found
good buying support after absorbing stop-loss selling early in the week and
was later underpinned by renewed trade buying, which touched off covering
purchases against short positions and triggered stop-loss buying orders.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the opening of a fresh round of
talks in London on negotiating an international coffee agreement with
price-stabilisation mechanisms did little for market sentiment. As the
meeting got under way London's robusta coffee prices went into a gentle
slide that took the January futures position down from Dollars 968 at the
end of last week Dollars 938 on Wednesday.
The market then picked up a little, for no apparent reason, before getting
some encouragement yesterday from reports of modest progress at the
producer-consumer talks, and the January price ended the week only Dollars
12 down on balance at Dollars 956 a tonne.
The talks, which are to continue through to next Wednesday, have
concentrated so far chiefly on the issue of 'selectivity' - allowing
producers to choose in what proportions the various types of coffee should
be allowed on to the market under an export quota scheme. Delegates are also
considering the problem of dealing with under-shipment and declared
shortfalls against quota allocations.

FT  28 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Record high for Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Reuters Holdings hit an all-time high yesterday as enthusiasm felt
for some time by US investors spilled over into the UK, partly on the
prospect of a share split. The electronic trading and news agency group
broke through its previous barrier to close 37 up at 1331p on thin turnover.
The US has been buying the stock since an international conference at the
end of October removed any lingering doubts. The stock is appealing when set
against a Standard &amp; Poors multiple but was beginning to look overvalued to
UK fund managers. However, analyst Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite
and a long-time bull of the stock said he had been recommending the stock
strongly yesterday and that investors were responding to the possibility
that the company would announce a one-for-one share split with the figures
in February. While a split would make no difference to the fundamental value
of the group it would leave the equity more liquid. Mr Henderson also argues
that the new electronic dealing products - Dealing 2000-2, Globex and
Istinet - were performing well and the group still had the benefit of a cash
mountain. Nevertheless, agency broker James Capel, which has taken a bear
view for more than a year, argues that the recent UK interest rate cuts will
cost the company about Pounds 15m.
SmithKline busy
SmithKline Beecham was the most heavily traded stock in the London market
yesterday after trustees of the company's Share Ownership Trust bought 14m
'A' shares at 560p per share.
The stock was purchased in connection with the SmithKline Beecham share
ownership plan. SmithKline shares closed 12 1/2 firmer in the A's on
turnover of 22m. The Units, which tend to represent US interest, rose 9 to
488p.
Savoy strength
A second day's hefty rise in the share price of the Savoy hotel group again
centred on the prospect of Forte renewing its interest in the luxury hotel
chain. Sources close to Forte said that, although the two companies may
forge closer ties, the share purchase moratorium agreed three years ago
would be adhered to.
Speculation has followed the death on Wednesday of Sir Hugh Wontner, the
Savoy president and chief adversary of Forte which fought an eight-year
battle for control of Savoy. Forte ended the fight with a 42 per cent share
of Savoy's voting rights and two seats on the board and, under a peace
agreement in 1989, agreed not to buy any more Savoy shares until 1994. But
now, with the recent retirement of Lord Forte, the two leading protagonists
have left the scene and speculation has been renewed.
Savoy shares surged 103 to 588p, yesterday, although the volume was thought
to be tiny. Forte was steady at 173p.
A well-received presentation at County NatWest lifted Thorn EMI, the shares
jumping 17 to 833p. Thorn's shares suffered a pre-results savaging as
worries over the state of the music market knocked them back. However,
impressive results last Tuesday renewed investor interest and Thursday's
presentation added to the positive sentiment. Fund managers have been
particularly reassured over the potential contribution forecast by Thorn for
the Virgin Records group, the subject of disparaging pre-results comment
from some quarters.
Tour package group Airtours continued a steady run, adding 4 at 252p, ahead
of interims early next month. Rank Organisation ran up 15 to 640p, although
turnover was poor.
The oil majors shrugged off volatility in the price of Brent crude which
surrounded an Opec agreement and reflected the strength in the market. Shell
firmed 2 to 548p and BP gained 1 1/2 to 231 1/2 p.
Glaxo was held back following a meeting between the new finance director and
analysts. The meeting was upbeat but there was some realism injected into
the prospects for anti-migraine product Imigran. The shares eased 4 to 792p.
Pharmaceutical company Medeva lifted 6 to 224p as it announced that it
expected the final quarter of the year to produce a good performance and
results to be in line with directors' expectations. The company reported a
sharp increase in profits to Pounds 26.1m for the nine months to September
30 against Pounds 7.8m a year ago.
EC approval of British Airways' purchase of a 49.9 per cent holding in TAT
European Airlines of France helped BA shares rise 8 to 279p.
US demand boosted British Steel, the shares climbing 3 1/2 to 57p. Smith New
Court was said to be recommending GKN, up 9 1/2 to 402p. Smiths Industries
gained 9 to 324p on the news that new Boeing production schedules would
safeguard the 737 in which Smiths has a major interest.
A feeling that the recent good performance of Cable and Wireless had been
overdone left the shares short of support and they closed 5 off at 670p.
Water and electricity stocks were mostly weak on the back of the move into
recovery stocks. In waters, Anglian was one of the worst hit, tumbling 12 to
472p on additional worries over the costs of complying with this week's EC
ruling on nitrates. Among other fallers, Yorkshire fell 14 to 516p, South
West 10 to 488p and Severn Trent the same to 452p.
US buying on the back of a firm Wall Street helped Grand Metropolitan add 11
to 447p. County NatWest moved to a short-term sell on Bass, the shares ended
steady at 588p. Allied-Lyons retreated despite news that its joint-venture
with Carlsberg had received approval from the UK authorities. Analysts are
forecasting flat results in its interims next week. The shares ended a penny
lighter at 642p.
Selected food retailers were still buoyant on Thursday's comment from
Northern Foods on the potential for food price inflation. Sainsbury jumped 8
to 517p, while rival Tesco gained 9 to 257p. A switch was said to have been
recommended into the two from Argyll by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Argyll was off
2 at 371p, Northern lost 3 to 276p. Asda's relentless forward march
continued, the shares added 3 to 55 1/2 p on turnover of 23m. A large buyer
of Unilever helped the stock lift 15 to 1072p.
A positive annual statement from Lloyds Chemist sent the shares forward 11
to 252p. Trading was particularly strong in the last 6 weeks, according to
the group's chairman and chief executive.
Packaging company Arjo Wiggins Appleton continued weak closing 3 off at 152p
after investment bank BZW cut its forecasts for the group. Analyst Mr Tim
Rothwell lowered his 1992 profit estimate to Pounds 167m and for the
following year to Pounds 160m from Pounds 198m. The house also recommended
selling the shares down to 126p arguing that the European carbonless paper
business had seen a significant profit reduction over the past two and a
half years.
In its weekly review, SG Warburg Securities rounded up some of the recent
evidence that it has identified of revival in the domestic economy. It
believes that the recent stimulus to the UK economy should be sufficient to
generate 'an anaemic recovery', resulting in GDP growth of 1 1/2 per cent in
1993, compared with the consensus forecast of 1 per cent growth.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Money Markets: No change expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN interest rate markets ended the week on a depressed note yesterday,
and few dealers now expect any easing in official interest rates in Germany,
France or the UK before the end of the year, writes James Blitz.
A month ago, the speed with which Germany was entering recession made
dealers confident that the Bundesbank would ease official interest rates by
at least 50 basis points before the end of the year. The recent tension in
the European Exchange Rate Mechanism also raised the prospect of Germany
being forced to ease policy in support of vulnerable currencies in the
currency system.
A wave of bearish comments from members of the Bundesbank council has
recently made the market revise that optimism. Yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
the deputy president of the central bank council, added to the mood by
saying that German rates were 'not too high' and that German monetary policy
must stick to its anti-inflationary course.
An acceleration in West German consumer prices in November dashed hopes of a
cut: there was a rise of 0.5 percentage points in November from October,
implying a 3.7 per cent rise on the year.
No market reflects the change in sentiment as much as Euromark futures.
Yesterday the December contract closed down another 3 basis points on the
day at 91.19. That is some 55 basis points below the level that the contract
was at on October 13.
The price now assumes that 3-month German cash will be at 8.81 per cent when
the contract matures in three weeks time. Three-month money was trading at
8.87 per cent yesterday.
Similar sentiment is being felt in French markets. There is still lingering
uncertainty about the franc's position in the ERM, and yesterday the
December contract closed down 23 basis points from its highs for the day at
89.87. With 3-month money priced at 10 3/8 per cent yesterday, this reflects
virtually no change in official French rates.
Now that sterling is out of the European system of fixed exchange rates,
there is no reason why UK market rates should shadow continental moves.
Nevertheless, recent weeks have only underlined the feeling that base rates
will stay at 7 per cent until well into next year. 'We are in for a long
spell of technical markets in sterling,' said one London-based dealer this
week.
Three-month money yesterday closed at around 7 1/4 per cent, unchanged on
the week.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: A new bout of ERM tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a two day lull, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was the scene of
new tensions yesterday, with the French franc falling towards FFr3.40 to the
D-Mark while the Irish punt remained at the bottom of its ERM bands, writes
James Blitz.
The speculation against the French franc and other European currencies
remained weak compared to the tensions of the early autumn.
However, a comment from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Deputy President of the
Bundesbank, that German interest rates 'are not too high' confirmed the view
that ERM pressures are unlikely to be eased soon by a fall in the
Bundesbank's official rates.
A principal beneficiary of yesterday's tension was the dollar rather than
the D-Mark. The US currency rose to a high of DM1.6060, helped by the
impression of it as a safe haven currency. It later closed slightly higher
on the day at 1.5980.
Inside Europe, the focus of interest was the Irish punt. Some dealers think
the currency may be devalued this weekend. The punt continued to hover a
shade above its floors against the Belgian franc and the guilder, but there
was no selling pressure with overnight interest rates at 100%.
Otherwise, the day was marked by another setback for the French franc. Mr
Tietmeyer's comments and a rise in French unemployment to 2.93m combined to
bring the franc down to a close of FFr3.393.
The prospects of a devaluation of the French franc seem slim. The
devaluation of the French franc would be the end of the ERM, the Bonn-Paris
axis, and the basis of the policy of Presidents Kohl and Mitterrand.
But there are gloomy views this weekend about the forthcoming prospects for
the currency.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, says that there is
an increasingly probability that the French will succumb to a devaluation.
He believes that yesterday's rise in unemployment will again focus the
attention of Mr Beregovoy's government on whether short term interest rates
can remain above 9 per cent.
'In the run-up to the national assembly elections in France, the government
will do its best to cut rates,' says Mr MacKinnon.
Mr Brendan Brown, chief economist at Mitsubishi in London, believes that
France's recent intransigence over the US/European trade deal may blossom
into serious tensions in the Franco-German relationship. 'How could the
Bundesbank be persuaded to help out the French again, as they did in
September ?' he asks.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japan's long-term credit banks
hit by securities losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S three long-term credit banks yesterday reported a halving of their
pre-tax profits for the first half, but relatively modest provisions for
loan losses in spite of heavy exposure to collapsed developers and
speculators.
Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) reported a 48.8 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y35.5bn (Dollars 286m) while Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
(LTCB) was 57.8 per cent lower at Y23bn, and Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) was
down 48.3 per cent to Y22.5bn.
Like the country's leading commercial banks, the long-term credit banks
reported sharply higher profits in their core banking businesses, due to a
drop in interest rates, but were forced to book large appraisal losses on
securities holdings.
Core profits rose 29.4 cent at IBJ, 101.5 per cent at LTCB and 109.1 per
cent at NCB. Securities valuation losses, a result of the troubles on the
Tokyo stock market, totalled Y53.9bn at IBJ, Y41.1bn at LTCB, and Y23.8bn at
NCB.
The non-performing loan problem is most serious at NCB, which has been
forced to seek assistance from other banks for the restructuring of three
non-bank affiliates. These leasing and finance companies were large lenders
to the property market and have been left with non-performing loans
equivalent to about 20 per cent of outstanding loans.
NCB increased its loan-loss reserve by Y13.6bn to Y48.5bn - equivalent to
about 0.9 per cent of total loans or a write-off of 1.8 per cent on an
after-tax basis.
One problem for the banks is that Japanese tax laws require them to have
clear proof of non-payment before a write-off is accepted. This makes it
difficult to write off loans from companies which have stopped repayments
but are not technically bankrupt.
However, the three banks reported capital adequacy ratios well above the
target of 8 per cent, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements.
The strongest of the banks, IBJ, had the lowest ratio - 8.71 per cent at
end-September - while LTCB was at 9.07 per cent and NCB at 9.06 per cent.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nomura will repay Y23bn to
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest stockbroker, is to reimburse investors
who lost money on step-up coupon property-backed securities and will halve
commissions on investment trusts to stimulate demand.
Nomura said it will repay Y23bn (Dollars 185.5m) to clients, who have lost
more than 40 per cent of their investments on the bonds.
The move follows an admission that Nomura failed to warn investors of
potential risks of its foreign property backed securities,
Mr Yasuhiro Mizuuchi, Nomura's vice-president, admitted breaching industry
regulations, which require brokers to warn investors of risks involved in
investment products, due to a 'sales accident'.
Investor confidence was shattered by revelations of brokers' loss
compensation on stock losses for favoured clients.
Nomura said it would compensate 14,300 investors the face value of the
property backed securities, and pay 6 per cent interest.
The broker sold Dollars 336m worth of bonds in 1989 and 1990, marketing the
products as high-return investments.
The announcement could encourage other retail investors who feel they were
misled by brokers in making securities investments to seek compensation from
other Japanese brokers.
Nomura claims the losses due to the reimbursement will not affect annual
profits, as it will try to sell real estate assets to raise the funds.
But the Japanese real estate market remains stagnant, and Nomura may face
difficul-ties in liquidating its land holdings.
In a further attempt to appease retail investors, Nomura will also halve the
commission on its new 10-year securities investment trust funds starting
next week.
The move comes as the ministry of finance is liberalising commissions for
investment trust funds, in an attempt to encourage investors back into the
market.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Packer's Westpac purchase keeps
the markets guessing - The Australian bank was an obvious target, but what
is Kerry Packer's strategy?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE question was reverberating around Australia's business community
yesterday: what is Kerry Packer up to? It is a question which has been asked
many times before. As usual, it prompted plenty of speculation, but few
answers.
There was little surprise when Mr Packer, the entrepreneurial owner of the
Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress) publishing group, emerged on
Thursday as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake in Westpac Banking
Corporation, the troubled Australian bank.
Market gossip had linked Mr Packer with Westpac since October, when the
bank's ADollars 3-a-share, ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 825m) rights issue had
closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving dozens of sub-underwriters
holding some 290m shares.
The shares, representing about 19 per cent of Westpac's expanded share
capital, were worth significantly less than ADollars 3 in the stock market,
and were ripe for acquisition by a buyer with plenty of cash.
But why was Mr Packer willing to bail out the underwriters when so many
other shareholders, including many of Australia's institutional buyers, were
unwilling to take up their rights only a few weeks earlier?
Is he simply spending some of his cash on an undervalued recovery stock? Is
he hoping to pick up windfall profits if a rival bidder appears? Or does he
want to run Westpac?
Only three people know the answer: Mr Packer, who is believed to be playing
polo in Argentina; Mr Al Dunlap, the irascible American chief executive of
ConsPress; and Mr Packer's son Jamie, who is being groomed to inherit the
company.
None are likely to explain the strategy unless forced to do so. As Mr Packer
told a parliamentary committee last year, the affairs of ConsPress are no
business of anyone but the sole shareholder - himself.
However, Mr Packer has clearly been poised to make a major investment since
March, when he completed a reconstruction of ConsPress which left the group
debt-free with assets of about ADollars 3bn, including ADollars 1bn in cash.
He spelt out his long-term strategy in broad terms in a rare interview in
April with Australian Business Monthly, one of his own magazines.
'I believe that over the next two or three years there are going to be
terrific opportunities, and that anyone in a position such as ours will be
able to take advantage of anything that comes up,' he said.
Westpac's problems made it an obvious target. Shortly after the rights issue
debacle, five directors resigned, including the then chairman, and the bank
subsequently reported a net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year ended
September, after writing off more than ADollars 2.6bn against bad and
doubtful loans.
The bank's problems were reflected in its share price, which fell from
ADollars 4.52 in January to a low of ADollars 2.39 earlier this month,
presenting a rare opportunity to acquire a significant stake cheaply.
Westpac shares closed at ADollars 2.99 yesterday, suggesting that Mr Packer
has already made a small profit on his holding, which was acquired at prices
of between ADollars 2.52 and ADollars 2.93.
Mr Packer may expect the shares to continue to rise as the bank returns to
profitability over the coming year. He may also be positioning himself for
the possibility of a victory by the opposition conservative coalition in
next year's federal election. That would probably lead to an easing of
restrictions on bank takeovers and open the way for a bid for Westpac from
one of Australia's stronger banks.
However, Mr Packer is rarely a passive investor. His strategy is to buy
undervalued companies, and add value to his holding by restoring
profitability as quickly as possible. To do that, he needs control, and the
key question is what level of control he thinks he will be able to exercise
over Westpac.
By Friday evening, ConsPress is believed to have expanded its shareholding
to the 10 per cent ceiling on individual limit on shareholdings imposed by
Westpac's deed of settlement and the federal Bank Shareholdings Act.
The act allows a maximum individual shareholding of 15 per cent, with the
approval of Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), who
would have to rule that the increased stake was not against the national
interest.
Mr Dawkins' office said yesterday that Mr Packer had not requested
permission to exceed 10 per cent. However, a 1986 precedent involving Mr
John Spalvins' Adsteam group suggests he will be allowed to increase his
stake if he wishes.
A 15 per cent holding would not give Mr Packer control. But it would
probably give him two board seats, and a level of influence comparable with
that wielded by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution,
which also owns 15 per cent of Westpac.
Given his record, Mr Packer's goal would probably be to speed the bank's
return to profitability by accelerating the recovery programme announced
recently by Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing director.
Analysts say it is not clear how that might be done. But Mr Packer's views
appear remarkably similar to those of the AMP, which recently gave Westpac a
six-month deadline to deliver a significant improvement in performance.
Mr Ian Salmon, AMP managing director, was enthusiastic about Mr Packer's
investment yesterday, suggesting that there may be a degree of common
ground. If that were so, Mr Packer's influence could be much greater than
his limited shareholding would suggest.
For the time being, however, there are still no real answers to what
Australia's most enigmatic businessman is up to. But, barring an unexpected
collapse in the share price, he seems likely to make a healthy profit
whatever happens.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: NEC says charges will push it to
Y9bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company that dominates the domestic personal
computer market, yesterday said it would post a consolidated net loss of
Y9bn (Dollars 72.58m) in the 12 months to the end of March next year. The
company earned Y15.28bn last year.
NEC has been hit hard by the decline in domestic capital spending and the
sluggishness of personal consumption, which have eaten deeply into sales in
its main lines of business. In the half-year to September, net profits
declined by 77.3 per cent to Y4.25bn. Sales fell by 7.1 per cent to
Y1,688.2bn.
However, the company expects second-half results to be much worse because of
two factors: rising depreciation charges stemming from the completion of
semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America and Japan, and
charges resulting from a restructuring of NEC's home electronics business in
North America.
On a pre-tax level, profits in the first half of the year plunged by 83.9
per cent to Y8.26bn. For the full year, the company expected Y10bn in
pre-tax profits.
For the interim period, sales of communication systems and equipment were
down 9 per cent to Y452.98bn. Computers and industrial electronics systems
were down 6.3 per cent to Y838.7bn, while electron devices, including
semiconductors, fell 6.9 per cent to Y299.2bn.

SUEZ, one of France's most prominent holding companies, has broken off its
long-running negotiations with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the
largest state-controlled French insurer, over the latter's plan to invest in
Suez's German insurance interests.
The Suez board decided at a meeting late last week to suspend negotiations.
It has for more than two years been locked in intricate discussions with
UAP, which hoped to swap its minority holding in Victoire, a French insurer
controlled by Suez, for part of Victoire's stake in Colonia, a large German
insurance company.
The break-off in negotiations is highly sensitive given that UAP is a
significant minority shareholder in Suez, with 6.5 per cent of the equity
and 10.5 per cent of the voting shares. It also highlights the tension
between Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP's chairman, and his successor as chairman
of Suez, Mr Gerard Worms.
UAP was anxious to use Colonia as a base from which to expand into German,
the biggest single European insurance market. Assurances Generales de France
(AGF), one of its closest competitors, recently sealed its investment in
AMB, another German insurer. Mr Peyrelevade, who has played an active role
in the negotiations, hoped to take a 50 per cent share in Colonia in return
for all or part of UAP's Victoire shares.
But UAP was in a relatively weak negotiating position given that its only
bargaining ploy was a minority stake and Suez already had clear control of
Victoire.
As a result, the two companies argued over price. Mr Peyrelevade was
reluctant to compromise after his involvement with Suez. Meanwhile, as Mr
Worms is well aware, the French financial community has seen the Colonia
affair as an important test of his influence over Suez and of his
independence from his old boss.
The Suez board decided at last week's meeting that the gap between the two
sides was 'too wide' for them to reach agreement.
The board was unanimous in its decision to suspend discussions with UAP,
which did not send its representative to the meeting.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc chief sees
possible bar to sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government's plans to sell a substantial minority take in
Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals group, could be scuppered by a
legal hitch, according to the company.
Rhone-Poulenc yesterday confirmed a warning by Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, its
chairman, that under French privatisation law the state may not be allowed
to sell as many shares as it had intended.
Mr Fourtou, a staunch supporter of privatisation for Rhone-Poulenc, warned
that this plan could fail because it might involve the government selling
below the level permitted by France's privatisation commission. He did not
specify the level, but warned there was a 'one in two chance' of the state
having to scale down the proposed sale.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, this week announced plans to sell at
least 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc (10.6 per cent of its equity) before
February.
This sale, combined with an accompanying change in the status of
Rhone-Poulenc's shares to enfranchise non-voting shareholders, will reduce
the government's share of voting stock from 77.5 per cent to 45 per cent -
although it would still hold an effective majority of the voting shares
thanks to the 19 per cent stake held by other state-controlled institutions.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Disposals aid Brown Shipley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BROWN SHIPLEY, the merchant banking group, yesterday announced an interim
pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.55m after disposals aimed at streamlining its
stockbroking and investment management business. In the corresponding period
the group had reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 13.8m.
However, at the operating level the group incurred losses of Pounds 839,000
(profits Pounds 458,000). Last time continuing operations made losses of
Pounds 2.3m and discontinued activities profits of Pounds 2.76m.
The pre-tax turnround was achieved after an exceptional credit of Pounds
9.73m, derived from the Pounds 24.8m profit from the sale of Holmwoods, its
insurance broking operation, less the Pounds 11.2m loss on the sale of the
banking arm, a Pounds 2m write-off of fixed assets, Pounds 1.2m provisions
against surplus office space, and Pounds 616,000 provisions for
reorganisation. The exceptional debit last time of Pounds 11.5m was for bad
debt provisions.
Brown Shipley has also sold Leasing Management Services, its leasing
business, for Pounds 5.9m. Mr Bill Dacombe, chairman, warned that further
restructuring would involve write-offs and bad debt provisions of Pounds
3.8m.
These moves would allow the group 'to develop a successful, integrated house
providing investment advice and management to private and institutional
clients'. At September 30 funds under management totalled Pounds 2.4bn, with
Pounds 600m managed on a fully discretionary basis.
Turnover was Pounds 8.82m (Pounds 19.1m), earnings 40p (losses 87p) and
again there is no dividend.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Nat Power moves into Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by National Power, Britain's largest electricity generator,
is to buy and operate a 600 MW coal-fired power station already under
construction in Portugal.
National Power's investment of Pounds 60m in the project is the most
significant yet in a planned programme through which it aims to invest
Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the century.
The opportunity to run the Pego power station, being built 75 miles
north-east of Lisbon, arose because of the Portuguese government's decision
to open up the electricity generation market to the private sector.
In the UK, liberalisation of power generation means that National Power
expects its 41 per cent share of the UK electricity generation market to
fall in the mid-1990s as independent gas-fired plants come on stream.
The company hopes eventually to derive about a quarter of its income from
abroad. It already has joint venture projects in Pakistan and, more
recently, Malaysia where it announced last month it was investing Dollars
20m (Pounds 13m) in two gas fired projects with a total capacity of 1,500
MW.
National Power's consortium beat off bids from the US, Germany, Belgium and
the UK to win the Pego agreement signed in Lisbon yesterday with
Electricidade de Portugal (EDP).
The consortium has incorporated a joint venture company, Tejo Energy, which
will own the station. The Pounds 700m project will be financed by the
consortium, providing about Pounds 140m in equity, of which NP will control
40 per cent.
Other participants are Endesa, the Spanish utility which is thought to have
about 25 per cent of the shares, and Electricite de France and EDP, with 10
per cent each.
Portuguese investors will also have an opportunity to buy shares.
The station's first generating unit is due to be commissioned in April next
year. Tejo will be licensed to operate the station for 28 years, supplying
electricity to EDP, and coal supplies will be bought on the international
market.
Mr Graham Hadley, National Power executive director, said demand for
electricity in Portugal was growing strongly. The deal provided an
opportunity to construct a further two generating units on the site.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Medeva jumps to Pounds 26m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA showed considerable expansion in 1992, with pre-tax profits rising
from Pounds 7.82m to Pounds 26m over the opening nine months. Turnover
almost doubled to Pounds 104.9m against Pounds 54.7m.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said the improvement in margins was noteworthy
as the group concentrated on higher value-added products.
The nine-months figures have been issued in conjunction with the acquisition
of Armstrong, a US specialised drug delivery manufacturer concentrating in
the respiratory field, and on the reorganisation of Evans-Kerfoot.
The results consolidate the effects of the purchase in July of International
Medication Systems, a US maker of injectable products, and reflect the sale
of some Pounds 11.4m stock of generic products bought by Norton Healthcare,
reorganisation of Evans-Kerfoot and the disposal of the Horsham facility to
Norton for Pounds 12m cash.
Over the nine months there was net cash outflow from investing activities of
Pounds 87m, leaving net borrowings of Pounds 43.8m at September 30. The
Pounds 12m Horsham cash was received on November 3.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Surrey falls near Pounds 1m into loss and
makes disposals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURREY Group, the bookmakers, reported a Pounds 946,000 pre-tax loss for
the half year to September 30 compared with profits last time of Pounds
117,000.
At the same time the group announced the disposal of 26 betting shops in
Scotland to Stanley Racing, a subsidiary of Stanley Leisure Organisation,
for a maximum Pounds 2.99m in cash.
Mr R Green, the chairman, said the proceeds would be mainly used to reduce
borrowings. Interest payable for the six months totalled Pounds 368,000
(Pounds 272,000).
As a result of the disposals, which follow the sale of the majority of the
group's betting shops in East Anglia, Surrey has been able to renegotiate
its bank facilities with its principal banker, Allied Irish Banks. The
directors consider the new working capital to be sufficient for the group's
current requirements.
Mr Green said that in the half year margins had been lower than for some
years. Since the period-end there had been some improvement but it was too
early to tell whether that was likely to continue.
Turnover improved to Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 26.1m) but cost of sales increased
to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 23m) and there were higher administrative costs of
Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 2.73m).
Losses per share amounted to 0.49p (0.09p earnings).
An extraordinary meeting to consider the disposal proposals will take place
on December 16.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Adam's ownership may change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURE ownership of Adam &amp; Co, the Edinburgh-based private banking group, is
uncertain in the wake of the near disaster in which its banking subsidiary
lost more than twice its capital in unauthorised foreign exchange dealing.
Mr James Laurenson, managing director, said the bank, which caters for rich
individuals, had received many expressions of interest from potential
purchasers. It has appointed Lazard Brothers to advise on possible changes
to the shareholding structure.
In September Adam &amp; Co revealed that it had lost Pounds 21m in irregular
operations by two foreign exchange dealers in its London office. Although
the Pounds 10m capital was wiped out, it was immediately rescued by Mrs
Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a 75-year-old director and principal
shareholder who injected Pounds 21m into it.
Including Pounds 6.5m of the dealing loss, the bank incurred a pre-tax
deficit of Pounds 5m in the year to June 30 1992, compared with a profit of
Pounds 900,000.
Adam &amp; Co has now accepted recommendations made by Price Waterhouse on
improving its internal controls. It is closing the London foreign exchange
dealing room.
It is changing its auditors from KPMG Peat Marwick to Ernst &amp; Young, and is
to strengthen its board by seeking a qualified banker with detailed
knowledge of treasury operations. It has already made Mr Robert Cumming, a
retired clearing banker, a director.
Mr Iain Dalziel, the director who was in charge of the London branch until
June 30, is to leave the board because his new job, 'a management role on
behalf of one of Adam &amp; Co's principal clients' in Geneva, does not leave
him time to remain a director.
Sir Charles Fraser, chairman, says in his annual report that the bank had
seen a 'substantial reduction in its deposit base' after the loss was
revealed but had never lacked liquidity to meet depositors' demands.
However, the banking facilities made available by Royal Bank of Scotland had
'greatly helped the confidence of depositors.'
He said the deposit base had now stabilised and some depositors had
returned. The group had won new custody business and portfolio investment
clients.
Mr Laurenson said that expressions of interest in the bank had come from
'more than one clearing bank,' from foreign banks and small financial
services companies. Those interested included Royal Bank of Scotland, he
hinted.
'We are receiving conflicting signals from our shareholders,' he said. Some,
including fund managers, wanted a sale, while others would like to see Adam
&amp; Co raise new capital and preserve its independence.
The bank believed it could preserve its distinctiveness even under the
majority control of a major shareholder. 'The future is bright,' Mr
Laurenson said.

SHAREHOLDERS in Drayton Consolidated Trust, which specialises in unquoted
holdings, yesterday agreed to appoint liquidators and to wind up the trust.
After the final valuation of the assets, the amount available for
distribution to shareholders will be Pounds 31.9m, or 93.3p per share. First
payment will be made on December 31.
A new trust, Second Consolidated, is being established to manage the
unquoted holdings. Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures will take over primary
responsibility for the management of the trust, with the previous manager,
Invesco MIM, continuing as joint manager.
The aim of the trust will be to realise the assets. However, Mr Rod
Richards, a director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, said that Second
Consolidated would not be a forced seller. 'Some investments will be
realisable reasonably quickly, others however will not achieve satisfactory
prices until the economy moves out of recession,' he said.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Old Lady who took a long time to act -
Robert Peston looks at the downfall of David Backhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANYTHING remains of the City of London's clubbiness, Mr David Backhouse
was until last week a comfortable member of the club.
For generations there have been Backhouses in the City and he made a modest
name for himself as managing director in the seventies and early eighties of
Dunbar Group, the financial services concern now owned by Allied Dunbar. He
also has close links to Cazenove, the leading stockbroking firm.
Mr Backhouse was shattered therefore last week when the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England, blackballed him.
The Bank put pressure on Mr Backhouse to resign the chairmanship of
Henderson Administration, an old established fund management group. Two
weeks before, he had stepped down from the board of TSB, the banking group.
Mr Backhouse and the Bank are constrained from discussing his departure by
the secrecy provisions of the Banking Act. But Mr Backhouse's colleagues say
that the Bank became concerned about his stewardship in the mid 1980s of
Authority Bank, a small bank.
At the end of 1990 Authority, which operated from one branch in London's
Sloane Street, went into administration under UK insolvency procedures. Mr
Backhouse had resigned from the group several months earlier, but from
August 1986 he had been chairman of Authority Bank's parent company,
Authority Investments, which is also in administration.
At the time Authority Bank went into administration it had assets of around
Pounds 48m. These included just over Pounds 20m in deposits with commercial
banks and the Bank of England together with loans to customers of Pounds
28m, according to Mr David Bowen, one of the administrators from the
accountancy firm Pannell Kerr Forster. The bulk of its loans had been made
to small property companies and individual property developers.
Mr Bowen said the loan book was 'not particularly bad' but it was
concentrated on just one sector. When the property market went into
recession Authority Bank's customers had difficulty meeting their interest
payments.
Authority Bank had a particularly large exposure to one customer, a property
and leasing company called Maingreen. A statement sent to Authority's
creditors shows the loan to Maingreen at Pounds 6.57m, which is an unusually
large loan to a single customer for a bank of Authority's size.
However, that figure is Authority's net exposure to Maingreen after
deducting provisions the bank had made against losses on the loan. The gross
exposure was far bigger.
On April 25 1991, Maingreen went into voluntary liquidation. Its estimated
statement of affairs lists Authority Bank as being owed Pounds 74.4m under a
guarantee. The statement also says that Authority is unlikely to receive a
penny of this.
The Bank of England had been keen in the 1980s for Authority to reduce its
exposure to Maingreen. But the original exposure was acquired long before Mr
Backhouse arrived at Authority. It dated from before the property slump of
the early 1970s.
Mr Backhouse is probably acutely aware of the paradox that he has been
haunted by a loan to a property company which went bad in the early 1970s,
which was when he was making his reputation by sailing comfortably through
that recession at Dunbar.
None of his friends say that he is proud of Authority Bank's poor
performance. The bank's depositors, many of whom are foreign, have so far
received 67.75p for each pound of their deposits and are unlikely to receive
more than 75p in total when the administration process is complete.
However, Mr Backhouse's former colleagues at Authority say that the Bank was
fully aware of Authority's loan book both before and after it went into
administration. As one of them said yesterday: 'It was all so long ago. I
can't think why the Bank of England took so long to act'.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Green light for Allied- Carlsberg UK merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS and Carlsberg were yesterday given government clearance for the
Pounds 510m merger of their UK brewing and wholesaling operations.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, gave the go-ahead after
the companies reached agreement with the Office of Fair Trading on measures
to remedy any adverse effects on competition from the joint venture.
Carlsberg-Tetley, the merged business, will include Carlsberg's one UK
brewery and Allied's five beer plants. It will have sales of more than
Pounds 1bn a year and an 18 per cent share of the beer market.
The move will create a third force in the industry, rivalling Bass with 22
per cent of the market, and Courage, with a 20 per cent share.
It will also reduce Allied's Pounds 1.9bn borrowings by Pounds 135m though
that may be offset to some extent by initial rationalisation costs.
In a joint statement yesterday, Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied's brewing
division, and Mr Michael Iuul, managing director of Carlsberg International,
said: 'We are obviously delighted that we have now received final approval
for this merger and look forward with confidence to implementing our plans.'
Thirteen months after the deal was first announced, the companies are now
completing legal work on the venture which is expected to come into
operation early in the new year.
A Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry earlier this year expressed
concern about the effects of the merger on competition in the UK lager
market.
The combination of Allied's Castlemaine and Skol lagers with the Carlsberg
brands would adversely affect regional and local brewers and independent
wholesalers, the MMC said.
Allied and Carlsberg have now agreed to the MMC's recommendations that the
merged company should not worsen the terms of supply to Carlsberg's existing
customers, and that the supply agreement with Allied's pubs should be
reduced from seven years to five years.
However, they have succeeded in renegotiating a third condition laid down
for the merger - that after two years Allied should free tenants of 1,785 of
its pubs to buy half their lager from suppliers of their own choice.
In negotiations with the OFT, Allied argued that such a move, which could
have cost an estimated Pounds 7m profits, would be impractical and
impossible to monitor.
It has now been agreed, instead, that Allied will free 400 of its pubs
completely from exclusive beer supplies. The first 100 will be freed over
the next two years, and another 300 over the following two years.
The compromise is expected to prove far less costly to Allied than the
original condition.

Net asset value per share of the Scottish Investment Trust rose to 217.3p

206.2p of a year earlier.
With 55 per cent of assets overseas the trust was a significant beneficiary

The directors were cautious of equity markets over the next few months but
said any downturn was unlikely to be sufficiently large to warrant reducing
total equity holdings.
Gross income in the year totalled Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 24.5m). Net revenue

Net asset value per ordinary share of the Greyfriars Investment Company fell
by 62.6 per cent to 23.28p over the year ended September 30.
After-tax revenue slipped to Pounds 412,712 (Pounds 477,463), equal to
earnings of 5.9p (6.82p) per share. A final dividend of 4p makes a
same-again 6p total.
The directors said that in order to continue to pay 'the high level of
dividend' Greyfriars had, of necessity, a portfolio yield of some 10 per
cent. They believed this was 'unsustainably high' and therefore have decided
to reduce the yield.
That, coupled with their decision to repay part of the low coupon loan note,
means the outlook 'is for reduced dividends in the short term'.

cutting sites, finished with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 880,000 for the year
ended June 27 1992, but is now trading profitability.
Sales were well above budget and recent trading had been more favourable.
Cost reductions will save about Pounds 500,000 in a full year, certain
branches had and were being closed, and the dry cleaning and laundry
business ceased to trade in September.
The loss, up from Pounds 436,000 at halfway, included Pounds 31,000
exceptional charges; it compared with Pounds 96,000 in the previous 61 weeks
which took account of Pounds 216,000 exceptionals.
Turnover was Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 14.5m) and generated an operating loss of
Pounds 572,000 (profit Pounds 475,000). Losses per share were 13p (3.8p).
Extraordinary provisions of Pounds 402,000 have been made against the
closure of the dry cleaning and laundry business.

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dares Estates cuts deficit to Pounds 2.87m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dares Estates, the property investment and development group, cut its
pre-tax losses from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 2.87m for the half year to June
30.
Mr Ervin Landau, the chairman, said the results had been delayed because the
directors had expected to be able to announce an agreement with its bankers
regarding a financial restructuring. Unfortunately, he said, that had not
proved possible although he expected an agreement in principle very shortly.
Turnover fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 2.9m with rental income at Pounds
2.81m (Pounds 4.34m). The pre-tax result was after interest charges of
Pounds 5.09m (Pounds 7.87m) and an exceptional credit of Pounds 757,000
(Pounds 8.61m debit).
Losses per share were reduced from 8.75p to 1.54p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilclare, the USM-quoted company with interests in lighting and security
products, is calling for Pounds 240,000 net via an underwritten rights
issue.
At the same time the company reported a loss of Pounds 70,000 pre-tax for
the six months to September 30 compared with previous profits of Pounds
52,000. Turnover slipped to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.4m).
Losses per share emerged at 1.7p (earnings 1.4p). There is again no interim
dividend. However, the directors anticipate a 'satisfactory' outcome for the
year and intend to declare a same-again full year payment of not less than
0.5p on the enlarged capital.
The 2-for-7 rights issue at 35p per share is being underwritten by Wise
Speke. The directors believe the proceeds of the issue will further assist
plans to restore profitability to a more satisfactory level.

<TEXT>
PERPETUAL, the unit trust and portfolio management organisation, saw its
pre-tax profit expand from Pounds 2.94m to Pounds 4.79m in the year ended
September 30 1992.
Earnings per share grew from 7.95p to 12.49p and the final dividend is 3.6p
to lift the total from 3.2p to 4.8p.
The investment performance, in comparative terms, was excellent in the long,
medium and short term, said Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman.
Over the year funds under management had risen from Pounds 693m to Pounds
846m, and had now further grown to Pounds 1bn following sterling
devaluation, stock market improvements, and an influx of new money for
investment.
The long-term strategy to effect an entry into the pension fund industry
continued although there were no significant developments to report.
However, there was an encouraging level of interest in the group's unit
trusts by institutions and sales volumes had increased substantially.

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Bank, the New Zealand subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, has bought the
Rural Bank from Fletcher Challenge for NZDollars 450m (Pounds 153.5m).
The sale is part of Fletcher's moves to address its indebtedness and was
signalled at the annual meeting last month. According to Mr Hugh Fletcher,
chief executive, it meant it was 'well on track' to meet its target of
lowering gearing to less than 50 per cent by December next year.
The deal is also seen as important for National Bank, the country's fourth
biggest, as it increases its assets by adding over NZDollars 2bn in extra
loans, representing 30 per cent of all New Zealand's on farm debt.
Fletcher bought Rural Bank from the government in 1989 for NZDollars 550m,
and it has been a highly profitable investment. Under a profits claw back
provision, Fletcher had to pay the government a further NZDollars 137.5m
earlier this year.
Mr Fletcher said the sale represented a good price which was fair to both
parties, and was higher than the net value of the Rural Bank 'under our
present ownership.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Banks continue to give support to
Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL's 220 banks have agreed to give the Channel tunnel company
continued access to its Pounds 6.8bn borrowing facilities until at least May
1994, unless there is a further deterioration in the financial performance
of the company.
The agreement with the banks, which was announced yesterday, should allow
Eurotunnel to complete work on the tunnel without having once again to enter
into tortuous negotiations with its banks.
The banks are believed to be receiving around Pounds 30m in fees in return
for continuing to provide the funds. They had originally asked for Pounds
50m, which prompted a furious response from Sir Alastair Morton,
Eurotunnel's co-chairman.
The company has been in breach of its borrowing covenants and therefore
needed the banks to grant it a waiver so that it could continue drawing on
the borrowing facilities.
The breach was caused by increases in the costs of building the tunnel and
reductions in forecasts of revenues the company is likely to generate in the
next couple of years, due to postponement of the tunnel's opening date and
delays in delivery of rolling stock.
The tunnel is currently due to open at the end of 1993, though opening could
be delayed until the spring of 1994 if a long-running dispute with
Transmanche-Link, the contractors working on the tunnel, is not resolved.
Once the tunnel is open Eurotunnel is likely to raise new equity from
shareholders. The company said yesterday that in the coming year it would
'discuss strategies (with its banks) for meeting funding requirements which
may prove to be necessary after opening'.
Eurotunnel believes it will have used up all the Pounds 6.8bn borrowing
facilities by the autumn of 1994, though the banks fear that the company
will need additional funds earlier than that, probably in the spring of
1994.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Birt plans the endgame: The BBC's next leader talks to
Raymond Snoddy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Birt, the man who will lead the BBC towards the millennium, is talking
again. For more than 18 months his smile and his politeness have been seen
but little has been heard.
The uncharacteristic silence was partly a result of Birt's involvement in
two enormous pieces of strategic planning: the first, to introduce a
modified form of the market into a corporation once likened to the Indian
Civil Service; the second, to work out the future role of the BBC in an age
of growing commercial competition.
But the real reason for his silence was to avoid undermining Sir Michael
Checkland, the out-going director-general, in the difficult 18-month
hand-over period.
That period came to an end on Thursday in Studio 1 at the BBC Television
Centre. There was a symbolic handing over of the baton. Sir Michael, who
retires as director-general at Christmas, was there to endorse the BBC view
of its hoped-for future. But it was Birt who enunciated the BBC's wish to
remain a single, integrated broadcaster funded by a licence fee, but less
bureaucratic, more responsive, and searching for distinctive and innovative
programmes. The presentation came two days after the government published
its green paper of options  - not recommendations - for a new BBC Royal
Charter.
Yesterday, John Birt was still in his rather spartan deputy
director-general's office on the third floor of Broadcasting House, although
he is in the final straight of the journey to the big office along the
corridor.
Above all, he is talking publicly again.
From 9am, media correspondents from the national broadsheet newspapers were
ushered in for a 45-minute audience - a timetable that was enforced. By
1.15pm and the last of the bunch, glasses of fizzy water already poured,
Birt was still answering, or not answering, questions.
The green paper? 'Plainly a lucid, comprehensive delineation of all the
questions that could be raised about the BBC,' he said, adding that he was
completely unwilling to make any guesses about the outcome.
It was reasonable and open-minded, he said. And the green paper had also
been right to include radical options such as a Public Service Broadcasting
Council which could give licence money to other broadcasting groups as well
as to the BBC.
However, if such a council had control of the money it would mean a body
other than the BBC would determine its strategy and the corporation's
coherence and accountability would be threatened.
'It would be a leap in the dark. Is it worth the risk? Is it plainly and
manifestly a better way? I very much doubt it,' said Birt, who came to the
BBC from London Weekend Television in 1987 because he saw an important
institution in need of modernisation.
Birt correctly anticipated that the government, any government, would be
interested in greater BBC efficiency. But is he winning the internal
argument for producer choice, the main mechanism that is supposed to deliver
it? Under the concept of producer choice, producers will be able to buy
services from outside the corporation, a change Birt believes is the most
fundamental the BBC has faced.
'In the last couple of months opinion is starting to turn,' he said. First,
the resource departments providing film crews or editing facilities are
finding out how enjoyable it is to control their areas. Programme
departments, initially resistant, have been discovering how much things
cost.
'They are very surprised at it,' Birt said. Programme budgets must now
include everything from the cost of accommodation to the cost of
secretaries.
The BBC is aiming to be distinctive as well as efficient. But isn't there a
danger in too much distinctiveness and the move away from programmes that
are derivative, formulaic or imported cheaply? Don't licence fee-payers
watch such programmes in their millions, and appear to like them, at least
sometimes? 'We're not talking about phasing things out,' Birt said. 'We're
talking about steering a new direction and steering it over 10 years.
'We are not going to take away things that are manifestly loved and enjoyed
by the audience. We are looking to the endgame.' That means making sure at
the end of the decade that people are not paying a licence fee for
programmes that can be found elsewhere.
The director-general-in-waiting said yesterday he 'guaranteed' that the BBC
would remain a pioneer in entertainment, producing hits out of unexpected
material, such as Antiques Roadshow or Dad's Army, as it had in the past.
As a result, the BBC would retain its large audiences despite its viewers
declining to a third of the total audience by the end of the decade.
Does the refocusing imply managerial change when Birt takes over? 'I'am
absolutely not going to be drawn on that today,' he replied.
However, now that he has started talking again, he has no intention of
stopping. He said he accepted the challenge that, as director-general, he
would have to carry the arguments for the new BBC strategies of efficiency,
responsive and distinctiveness throughout the organisation - strategies that
entail swingeing job cuts - and systematically to the country as a whole.
What would he like the shape of the BBC to be in 1997, the first year of the
new charter?
'I would aspire within Britain to be seen as the best-managed institution in
the public sector,' he said. Then it was time for some more talking, this
time to a team from Panorama which is taking a searching look at . . . the
future of the BBC, a programme Birt said he had encouraged.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Tourism argument contains flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS ROWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nicholas Lander's argument about tourism ('British tourism and the
faulty towers of policy, November 24) was both useful and yet at the same
time deeply flawed. It was beneficial in that it did highlight an important
sector of the economy. Yet, it was also misleading:
It argued that job creation in manufacturing '. . .depends on winning back
export markets'. This is only partially true - a big problem for many
manufacturers is to keep or win back home markets, a springboard for then
building up exports in many cases.
It implies that the UK could survive as a nation as a huge theme park or
industrial museum. But he says nothing about the type of jobs in tourism.
This has several dimensions: they may be seasonal, part time and skewed in
geographical, age and gender terms. Many workers losing their jobs may not
possess the requisite skills, location or inclination for employment in
tourism.
An interesting piece was spoiled as Lander reciprocates the faults he points
out in others.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Health and safety regulations go no further than
sensible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir JOHN CULLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bryan Cassidy (Letters, November 24) asserts that recent health and
safety regulations have gone beyond EC directives. On November 25 you
reported the GMB general union as taking HSE to task ('Safety body
'undermined' EC health directive') for watering down the requirements of the
same directives. Neither has got it right.
The Health and Safety Commission's strategy includes proposing to ministers
UK regulations to meet directives, but not to go beyond them without good
cause. It is that approach already on the public record, and the internal
discussions leading to it, which now stand 'revealed' by the GMB.
The facts are important, because ministers have signed recently no fewer
than six EC-inspired sets of regulations which will certainly, in the
interests of safety and health, need to be implemented by employers who have
many other worries at present. The European Framework Directive, which
underlies all these new regulations was negotiated in a hurry and parts,
frankly, were poorly drafted and needed interpretation.
Contrary to what Mr Cassidy says, the directive specifically requires that
employers be 'in possession of' a risk assessment. That requirement has been
restricted in the regulations to a record of the significant risks, to be
made by employers of more than five employees (all must assess the risks).
The commonsense aim is to ensure that employers focus on the essentials. All
employers of course are still subject to the existing UK laws about
maintaining a safe workplace.
Mr Cassidy is, however, right in saying that the UK regulations go beyond
the directive in protecting the self-employed. They obviously must, because
UK law under the Health and Safety at Work Act has always covered this
category, which accounts for half more of those at work in some of the more
dangerous industries; and self-employed contractors can pose risks not only
to themselves but to other workers. Nor would it have made sense in terms of
the Framework Directive itself to have omitted them, since the directive
requires co-operation between all employers sharing a workplace.
Our legal advice is that the UK regulations implement the directives. They
go no further than is sensible and necessary, and will represent a real and
important addition to safety and health provision.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Nothing to celebrate on ozone layer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CORIN MILLAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial,'Saving the ozone layer' (November 25), casts undue
optimism on the outcome of the Montreal Protocol. It is progress that CFCs
are now to be phased out in 1996 rather than 2000. However, the failure of
the meeting to introduce real controls on both HCFCs and methyl bromide
throw away much of this progress. Governments have put back original UNEP
proposals for HCFCs ban by 25 years, and back-tracked on any reductions at
all on methyl bromide. The lack of action has stemmed from industrial
interest of the French in particular, coupled with the absence of European
Community leadership by the British government.
The director of UNEP stated that the outcome was 'not enough' and fears for
the future. You are correct to state that ozone depletion cannot be
predicted; the only judge is that scientists have consistently
underestimated the scale of the damage. The agreement is a green light for a
further assault on the ozone layer, and the next two decades will see untold
damage.
With all the serious consequences this brings, there is hardly a cause for
celebration.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Pension fund trustees have no business changing
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T S SHUCKSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Pritchard (Letters, November 26) is to be congratulated for his
appreciation that it is a duty of pension scheme trustees 'to ensure that
the fund can meet its liabilities in the long term and on an unexpected
near-term winding-up.' This important duty to ensure proper funding of
defined benefits seems to have evaded both the Occupational Pensions Board
in its booklet 'Pension Trust Principles' and the Goode Committee in its
consultative document.
However, it is no business of pension scheme trustees 'to elect to move away
from defined benefit schemes and to adopt defined contribution plans'. The
trustees may have a duty to wind up a final salary scheme if they consider
the employer is not able or willing to fund it to the standard the trustees
consider necessary, but it is not their job to change the benefits. They are
trustees of the trust deed, not arbiters of any aspect of the
employer/employee relationship. If the trustees consider they must wind up a
scheme, it is for the employer to decide what to put in its place.
It would be sensible to find an intermediate solution between fully defined
final salary schemes and defined contribution money purchase schemes. This
would spread the uncertainties and associated risks more realistically and
fairly between employers and employees.
The government should facilitate such a development, whereas present
policies will polarise schemes.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Living with a legacy: Minorities in Germany face renewed
hostility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ignatz Bubis, chief spokesman of the small Jewish community in Germany,
does not believe that he needs any special security measures at his home or
office in Frankfurt.
Yet he has closed-circuit television screens in his offices, and a heavy
metal barrier guarding his front door. 'I don't think it is necessary, but
the police insist that I take precautions,' he says.
Over the years, he has received a steady flow of anti-Semitic letters, being
a prominent member of the community, of a political party (the liberal Free
Democrats) and a prosperous businessman, but recently they have changed.
'They always used to be anonymous,' he says. 'Now they often enclose their
names and addresses.' The suggestion is clearly that the racists have lost
their fear.
In recent weeks Mr Bubis, 65, who was elected chairman of the Central
Council of Jews in Germany in September, has been thrust into the limelight
as a leading critic of government inaction over the wave of violent attacks
on foreigners in the country. In the past week, since the murders of a
Turkish woman and two girls in an arson attack in the northern town of
Molln, he has seldom been off the television screen.
At the same time, his has been a voice of calm and moderation, refusing to
see the incidents as a portent of a return to Nazi rule.
The Jewish community in Germany numbers between 35,000 and 40,000 today, a
tiny residue of the 600,000 who lived there before the Holocaust. It retains
an importance far beyond its numbers, not merely as a reminder of the past,
but also as a symbol of hope for Germany's ability to cope with any new
manifestations of xenophobia.
The views of Mr Bubis and his fellow Jews, therefore, are critical in the
exploding debate over immigration fears, the wave of asylum seekers from
eastern Europe, violence against foreigners, and the whole question of
German nationality and identity.
He is in no doubt that something has changed since unification. He is also
adamant that it should not be exaggerated. 'I stayed in Germany after the
war (he was the only member of his immediate family to survive the
concentration camps) because I had confidence in Germany,' he says. 'I still
have confidence in Germany.
'I do not believe there is a big new threat to Jews here. What there is, is
a new nationalism in Germany. And this nationalism goes together with a
certain anti-Semitism, and hostility to foreigners.'
Most people are not hostile to foreigners, he maintains, but a significant
number does think of 'Germany for the Germans. They say: 'We have been
occupied for 50 years, divided for 50 years, and that is enough. Now we have
our sovereignty back. We are a political power again, as well as an economic
power.' The point is, it is socially acceptable to talk like that today.'
Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit occupies the opposite end of the political spectrum to
Mr Bubis. The former student leader from the Paris uprising of May 1968, he
is today a member of the Greens, and special counsellor to the mayor of
Frankfurt on race relations. Frankfurt has by far the largest immigrant
population in Germany - at some 26 per cent. The proportion of immigrant
children in its primary schools is 40 per cent, rising to 60 or 70 per cent
in some areas.
Mr Cohn-Bendit sees the racial problem far more as a social problem than a
nationalist one. 'German society is not nationalistic. There is a certain
national pride. I don't think anti-Semitism is any stronger in Germany than
it is in France or Britain - or Italy.
'This problem (of racial violence) is a result of the rump of society
responding to a certain situation.'
He sees it as simultaneously a problem of youth in revolt, and a problem of
social deprivation in an ever more affluent society. It was already
happening before unification.
'You cannot keep a society going on the basis of a bad conscience,' he says.
'This is the third generation since the war, and they won't understand. But
Germany has a real problem. How can you make young people here understand
their history, without giving them a bad conscience?
'There is a proportion of young people who are being deliberately
provocative. And the greatest provocation of all is to say: 'I am a Nazi.''
At the same time, he sees in the attacks against foreigners as a revolt of
the least privileged levels of German society. 'There is a German
sub-proletariat competing directly with the immigrants,' he says. 'They see
themselves doubly discriminated against: they are already the poorest, and
then their schools have the highest numbers of immigrants.'
He blames the politicians for their failure to face up to the problem of
immigration and to find programmes to relieve the resulting social tension.
The dilemma at the heart of Germany's current race problem is that there is
no official immigration policy, but there is a liberal asylum law which is
freely used by all would-be immigrants to enter the country. He believes
that Frankfurt has had far fewer bad racial incidents precisely because it
has an integration policy.
Mr Bubis blames the politicians too, for their failure to see the racial
violence as a threat to civil society as a whole. 'Perhaps most important is
that they failed to see the problem as an attack on democracy,' he says.
This week's murders in Molln have finally forced the authorities - in the
shape of Mr Alexander von Stahl, the chief federal prosecutor - to recognise
that such a presumed neo-Nazi attack was indeed a threat to national
security.
Mr Bubis also accuses the judiciary of failing to impose harsher sentences.
Until now, most skinheads have been accused of little more than trespass,
instead of attempted murder and arson. The sentences have been token.
'They have sought to minimise the problem. They have been too liberal. They
did not want to dramatise it. But I believe it must be dramatised.'
Bubis and Cohn-Bendit identify the problem differently, and would have
different priorities in their solutions. Yet neither blames the easterners,
as many west Germans do; and both agree the problem can be solved.
Mr Bubis says that firm action by both government and judiciary would bring
the violence under control rapidly. 'If they act now, I think it will be
over quickly,' he says.
Mr Cohn-Bendit believes that the murders in Molln could mark 'the end of the
rise of the extreme right'. But it does require a big rethink of policy
towards foreigners.
'We will normalise immigration. We will have quotas. We will regulate it. We
will regulate asylum without dramatising it, and without denouncing the
asylum seekers.
'We have to de-dramatise the situation, without seeking to minimise it.
Chancellor Kohl must say: 'We have made a mistake. We have failed to
integrate these people into our civic society.' Then he must summon all the
specialists dealing with foreigners, and draw up a policy to do just that.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The stresses on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR BILL Clinton, president-elect of the US, is the only leader
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or soon-to-be leader - of a major industrial country who can look upon last
week's economic news with pleasure. He may have the good fortune to inherit
exactly the recovery Mr George Bush had claimed. By contrast with the better
news from the US, the monetary data emerging from Japan are deeply
disturbing. Japan's plight is greatly exacerbated by its political disarray.
But if the Japanese political class is at sixes and sevens, what of
Europe's? A feedback from political failure to economic disappointment and
back again is becoming too firmly established.
When the original estimate of 2.7 per cent for the rate of US economic
growth in the third quarter was announced before the presidential election,
it was widely regarded as unrepresentative. Now the figure has been revised
upwards to 3.9 per cent. This then was the strongest quarter of Mr Bush's
presidency, but it came too late to save him. Will Mr Clinton avoid the
temptation to over-egg the recovery pudding and concentrate instead on the
medium to long-term problems of the US economy, on lines recommended by this
week's OECD report?
Other economies look much more fragile. It seems strange to write of a Japan
that is in serious difficulty. But it is. Japan is now in its first
home-grown postwar recession.
This recession is driven by the asset price deflation that followed the
inflation of the late 1980s. It reflects, in particular, the damage done to
its banking system. Bad loans at the top 21 banks alone could total
Y55,000bn (Pounds 293bn) over the next five years, equivalent to 12 per cent
of gross domestic product. Not surprisingly, the broad money supply
contracted by 0.6 per cent in October. Such a decline suggests the
possibility, however remote, of a depression. But the OECD report on Japan,
like the Japanese authorities, seems unwilling even to contemplate this
threat.
Political infighting
Japan is inhibited by political infighting from addressing its problems
effectively. The same is true of the European Community. The rot is
affecting virtually every aspect of EC affairs: completion of the single
market; resolution of the conflict over the EC budget; ratification of the
Maastricht treaty; completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations; and, not least, the ERM.
In the aftermath of the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese
escudo last weekend, the Irish punt has remained close to its floor, while
the Danish krone and the French franc have languished in the bottom half of
their bands. The Irish and Danish currencies have been weak despite
overnight interest rate differentials this week vis-a-vis the D-Mark of as
much as 31 and 21 per cent respectively, and still higher this weekend. Such
rates are not a long-term solution, for the simple reason that they cannot
be sustained for very long.
With such pressure on the outer fringes of the remaining inner core, the
parity of the French franc has come once more into question. Economic logic
suggests that the D-Mark should no longer be the pivotal currency in the
ERM. But the determination of the Bundesbank to sustain its historic primacy
ensures that it is.
Biggest nut
Those, like France, still in the ERM at their old parities are being
penalised, first, for the markets' conviction that the D-Mark will remain
the strongest currency; second, for the Bundesbank's determination to ensure
that that remains the case; third, for the inability of the German
leadership to finance German unification without huge levels of borrowing;
and, finally, for the willingness of member countries such as Italy, the UK
or Spain to devalue.
The French franc is the biggest nut in the ERM nutcracker. This week's
German figures and pronouncements underline the Bundesbank's determination
to go on squeezing. German M3 (broad money) grew at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 10.2 per cent in October, higher than the figures for
September and August and hugely above the upper target of 5.5 per cent for
the year. Underlying German inflation seems to be running at some 4 per
cent. To make matters gloomier, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, widely expected to be the
next Bundesbank president, argued that inflation could remain a serious
threat to Germany for the rest of the decade.
What happens now depends almost as much on European politics as economics.
Will Germany finally take the fiscal action that is required, not at the
behest of Mr Norman Lamont but in response to the urgent needs of the
French? Mr Kohl's pronouncements suggest not. But is there any other way out
for the ERM and, if not, what does his commitment to Franco-German
co-operation amount to?
The EC badly needs a success of some kind. But it depends on the battered
British government, in the last leg of its dismal presidency, to deliver
one. Can Mr Major show the vision and achieve the compromises needed at the
Edinburgh summit? Hope is possible; confidence is another matter.

FT  28 NOV 92 / It hasn't been a piece of cake: Two years on, John Major has
survived several storms but still lacks a cohesive programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not an anniversary he can relish. As Mr John Major this weekend
contemplates two years in Downing Street the unspoken question among his
colleagues is whether he can be confident of a third and fourth.
The answer is almost certainly yes. For all the errors, the self-inflicted
wounds and the sheer bad luck of recent months, there has been no challenge
to his leadership.
But the simple fact that the question must be asked - and the response must
be qualified - underlines the failure of his government to deliver on its
promises.
When he first crossed the threshold of Number 10 on November 28 1990, Mr
Major promised to replace the final, frenzied, spasms of Thatcherism with
policies to create a nation at ease with itself. Instead, two years of
unremitting economic gloom have left the country depressed and demoralised.
Caring Conservatism has a distinctly hollow ring.
There is time for the prime minister to make amends and for the government
to demonstrate the competence and authority which have deserted it since
September 16 when sterling's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism tore the heart from its economic strategy.
If the Tory party and its leader keep their nerve, they have more than four
years to fashion new policies from the wreckage and to erase the bad
memories from the minds of the electorate. More than one minister has
recalled in recent weeks that Harold Wilson survived the humiliating
devaluation of 1967.
And, for the moment, the Palace of Westminster has been enveloped by an
eerie calm. Save for this week's revelations about the less-than-healthy
state of the chancellor's personal finances, the government has been spared
embarrassing headlines for nearly two weeks.
The bunker mentality in Downing Street has lifted. Mr Major has appeared
relaxed, if still fatigued, as he has returned to the ordinary business of
government.
He played a pivotal role in securing last week's farm trade agreement
between Brussels and Washington. He is now making a start on the intricate
negotiations which will precede the Edinburgh EC summit in 10 days. He has
performed well in the House of Commons in the past few weeks, comfortably
outscoring Mr John Smith in his question-time duels with the Labour leader.
The government's supporters at Westminster - exhausted by the rows over
Europe, the coal industry and the economy - have paused to lick their
wounds. The economic recovery package which accompanied the Autumn Statement
was well received. Tory MPs have turned their energies from faction-fighting
on the backbenches to delivering the government's legislative programme.
A senior minister says the same calm has returned to the cabinet table. A
colleague offers an engagingly frank assessment: 'We are still in an
enormous hole but we seem to have stopped digging.'
Mr Major has made some bad mistakes; over the coal closures, in his handling
of the arms to Iraq controversy as well as the ERM debacle. They may well
deprive permanently his premiership of the youthful magic that came with
victory against the odds in the April general election. He shares the
weakness of many in the still relatively inexperienced team he has assembled
in Downing Street: an unwillingness to admit those mistakes. It makes him
appear brittle and defensive.
But he is a more resilient politician than his critics sometimes imagine. He
is clear-thinking and patient. He is determined to survive. The odds are
that he will.
The real question now perhaps is whether he can do more than that. Holding
on to office is not the same as governing the country. The sticking
plasters, U-turns and tactical swerves which have characterised policy since
Black Wednesday are no substitute for a coherent strategy. Mr Major's
government has to rediscover its energy and sense of purpose.
The pessimists at Westminster - and there are plenty within the Tory party
after the misfortunes of the past two months - see little immediate hope.
The recession continues to drain the government's authority. The Treasury's
forecasts point to no early respite. The consequences threaten to deprive
the Conservatives of their most powerful political weapon: the scope for
cuts in income tax.
So it is not hard to sketch the gloomy scenario in which Mr Major remains a
helpless prisoner of events as his government stumbles from one crisis to
another.
Output continues to fall, unemployment to rise. The government is forced to
confront again the issue of closures in the coal industry. Public borrowing
surges ever higher. The Treasury demands Budget tax increases just as the
bills for the council tax land on the nation's doormats. The nurses mobilise
opinion against public sector pay restaint. Euro-sceptics in the
Conservative party call an end to the truce in their civil war over
Maastricht.
Perhaps, but the prime minister's friends argue with some justice that the
pessimists ignore the undoubted successes of Mr Major's leadership - and his
capacity to adjust.
The critics also may be making the mistake of projecting the present into an
indefinite future. If there is a single lesson to be drawn from events of
the past six months it is the speed with which the political mood can
change.
Mr Major's defenders have a point. After his victory on April 9, there were
few who suggested anything but that the prime minister was secure in office
for at least five years and, quite possibly, for a decade.
The dark prism of recent months obscures the undoubted triumphs of his
premiership. The conventional wisdom now is that Labour could never have won
the election. It did not seem like that at the time. If Mr Major's soap-box
oratory was derided by the chattering classes, the electorate decided
otherwise.
He has restored cabinet government, decision-making by consensus rather than
by diktat. Those who delighted in Mrs Thatcher's authoritarianism see it as
sign of weakness. But amid the disasters of the past few months the
restoration of collective responsibility has proved a useful shield.
The anxiety now about the introduction next April of the council tax has
tended to obscure Mr Major's success in ridding the country of its
destructive predecessor. The poll tax has slipped from the news only because
he abolished it.
He knows, too, where he is going on Europe. His handling of the Maastricht
treaty in the wake of the Danish referendum has been less than confident. At
times he has appeared to pander to the irreconcilable Euro-sceptics on the
Tory backbenches. Then he has veered into confrontations.
But the policy which underlines his commitment to the treaty - swapping the
angry Atlanticism of his predecessor for a policy aimed at keeping Britain
at the centre of the European debate - is judged by most at Westminster to
be compellingly right.
His first foreign policy decision two years ago - to rebuild the bridges
with Mr Helmut Kohl which had been burnt by Mrs Thatcher - has paid handsome
dividends. It was Mr Kohl who gave Mr Major the support he needed to strike
a deal at Maastricht. There are signs that the German leader may do the same
again when the British presidency struggles to put the community back on
course at next month's Edinburgh summit.
The prime minister has also begun to take a grip on the government's
economic strategy. He cannot escape the blow to his political and personal
authority delivered by the ERM debacle. Nor with the economy in its present
state can he argue with much conviction that the permanent defeat of
inflation - once the centrepiece of his manifesto - is anything more than a
pipedream.
But after the initial shock of Black Wednesday the prime minister was the
driving force behind the conversion to economic pragmatism reflected in the
measures which accompanied the Autumn Statement. The abolition of
restrictions on private financing of public sector projects, the investment
incentives for industry and the tax concessions for motor manufacturers were
pushed hard by Number 10 against a reluctant Treasury establishment.
The government's policy now is to contain rather than eradicate inflation;
and to deliver economic growth. It is one which recognises the importance of
manufacturing industy and exports. His aides insist that the concept of a
partnership with industry, which the prime minister floated in his speech to
the Lord Mayor's banquet earlier this month, will be a recurring theme.
A cabinet colleague admits happily that such policies mark another U-turn
for a Conservative party which, in the 1980s, seemed to believe that
manufacturing did not really matter: 'But if it works who cares?'
The recent calm has allowed the government to focus again on other strands
in its manifesto. The Citizen's Charter remains a target of derision but the
critics may be underestimating its impact in transforming the public sector
from a provider to a purchaser of services. The education bill marks another
step along the road to individual choice which Mr Major argues is at the
heart of his approach. The employment bill, currently before parliament,
will mark the final nail in the coffin of trade union hegemony.
After the upheavals since Black Wednesday this is not enough. Without a
distinctive centre-piece for his economic strategy, Mr Major must give
greater coherence to his government's programme. He has not yet found the
rhetoric to translate a series of piecemeal measures into a cohesive
philosophy. His premiership still lacks definition.
In part it is a question of personal authority. Mr Major has been hardened
by the ordeals of the past two months. But his enemies are not alone in
complaining that Number 10 is neither decisive enough in its leadership nor
robust enough in confronting critics.
One test of his leadership over the next few weeks will be whether Mr Major
is ready to reshuffle his cabinet. The growing consensus among his ministers
is that the new economic policy demands a new face at the Treasury. Moving
Mr Norman Lamont would require a toughness that the prime minister has yet
to demonstrate.
But more than anything else Mr Major needs economic recovery to restore his
government's balance. The animosities and resentments in his party and the
discontent and anxiety in the country at large will only be eased by a
return to prosperity. Until then the best he can say is that he is bloodied,
bowed but still standing.
