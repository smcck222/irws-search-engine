FT  28 NOV 92 / Woman in the News: Exception to the rule - The Queen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monarchy becomes Elizabeth Windsor. She does the job well. She has outgrown
the natural disadvantages of one who never went to school, never learned to
mix as an equal with others of her own age, and, initially at least, had
little more than formal contact with persons outside the narrow penumbra
that surrounds the royal family.
Five years into her reign, when she was still an apprentice, her speeches
were described by the erstwhile Lord Altrincham (now John Grigg) as prim
little sermons; her style of speaking, he wrote in 1957, was a 'pain in the
neck'. The words that were being put into her mouth were appropriate to 'a
priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team, a prefect, and a recent
candidate for confirmation.'
Mr Grigg's comments caused a furore at the time. An elderly crank hit him.
An Italian monarchist challenged him to a duel. Today that long-forgotten
text should serve the Queen well. The contrast between then and now is to
her advantage. She was a nervous young woman. Her voice and manner were
stilted. Her public demeanour was heavy with responsibility. But 35 years
later she is a mature sovereign, a mother who has suffered as would any
other from the sight of the marital difficulties afflicting her children, a
matron with a long memory and a definite sense of humour.
Her 40 years' experience of public life prepared her for the moment when she
was obliged to come clean, which she did in her celebrated 'annus
horribilis' speech on Tuesday. Yes, she intimated, she did hate it when her
family was pilloried by the media. True, she hinted, it was indeed
unpleasant to be attacked for not paying taxes, or for being so wealthy that
she should have contributed to the cost of rebuilding the burned-out segment
of Windsor Castle.
She was appealing for sympathy but her heartfelt remarks, delivered in the
husky tones brought on by a cold, did not reduce the tabloids to quivering
respect. Those years are gone. Do not blame the messengers: they largely
reflect the sentiments of their readers. In 1952 the young Elizabeth
inherited not only the throne but also the affection in which the nation had
held her father. During the war, class distinctions were forgotten. By his
sharing of their experiences King George VI had won the undiluted allegiance
of the British people. Unexpectedly, he died aged 56. The then Princess
Elizabeth was 26. Not yet ready for coronation, she became Queen-Empress;
her reach stretched around the globe.
Today the Commonwealth means more to its titular head than it does to most
of her subjects. In Britain the monarchy is fondly regarded as a mildly
decaying domestic institution. As such, it is the subject of cartoons, TV
lampoons, commonplace jesting, and, on occasion, the nastier manifestations
of envy. How it is viewed by people in the former colonies, some of which
have discarded it, is a matter of little concern back home. Among the
generality of the Queen's British subjects deference is an outdated notion,
although there is still a tendency to fawn when politicians, or
business-folk, or other distinguished persons are invited to the palace.
Those who seek honour, or recognition, are positively enthralled by contact
with any royal.
The Queen is accustomed to obsequiousness. It is, to her, a natural part of
her life. Yet she shows every sign of enjoying her job, which she takes
seriously. She is proud of remembering many of the names, and recognising
many of the faces, of those of her guests she greets personally. She likes
being flattered, and bowed and curtsied to, and treated as the pivot of the
constitution by a succession of prime ministers, some of whom have sought to
out-Disraeli Disraeli, the Victorian prime minister who wooed his Queen. She
has a strong sense of royal vocation. When there is a matter of state the TV
cameras confirm that her dignity and composure are exemplary.
Her highest duty, as she sees it, is to preserve the monarchy. She had
previously taken advice on how to maintain the affection of the people; this
led to two intimate TV portraits of her family of which the later, a
close-up of the Queen herself, was surely the more appealing. She came
across as a race-horse owner, a countrywoman, a professional monarch with a
twinkle in her eye. But in mid-slump, and with tabloid scandals appearing
every day, that was not good enough. There is no widespread demand for a
republic, but the feeling that people want a less extravagant, less
patronising, less privileged monarchy is palpable. The almost universal
reaction to the Windsor Castle fire last weekend convinced both the
government and the palace that slowly-gestating plans for the Queen to
subject herself to taxation had to be brought forward immediately. She was
ready to be so persuaded by Mr John Major.
The torrent of criticism should now abate, at least for a while. The history
of the monarchy is one of survival by adapting to the pressures of the time.
The events of this week - the Royal cry for help and the Royal decision on
taxation - are fully consonant with that history. Yet the adaptations the
Queen has been obliged to make since 1952 have all served to diminish the
importance, if not the stature, of the institution she personifies. As the
significance of the Commonwealth has shrunk, so has that of the Crown. As
Britain has moved to middle-ranking status, so has its head of state. As the
costs of maintaining a rumbustious extended family have risen, so the esteem
in which the enterprise has been held has dwindled.
During the fifth decade of her reign there may be further changes. The
European Community accommodates monarchies, but the complexities of
membership put into question Britain's highly centralised, unwritten
constitution. Celtic demands for self government may again become vocal. The
Conservatives seem set to hold office indefinitely; single-party government,
exercised in the name of the Crown, cannot be good for democracy. While
Queen Elizabeth is on her throne she will continue to be the British
constitution made flesh. Her successor may be a mere boy on a bicycle.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Income tax returns will fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCOME TAX receipts will fall by 4 per cent this year, Inland Revenue
statistics indicated yesterday.
The figures project total revenues from income tax at Pounds 60.6bn for
1992-93, down from a total of Pounds 63.1bn for 1991-92.
The top 5 per cent of tax-payers will pay a larger proportion of income tax
for the current year than for the previous 12 months - up from 31 per cent
to 32 per cent.
The estimates suggest that the top 1 per cent of taxpayers will pay 15 per
cent of income tax during the current year, the same proportion as last
year, while the bottom 50 per cent of taxpayers will pay 14 per cent, down 1
per cent.
The statistics show that there are 24.8m income tax payers this year
including 2.2m in the lowest range with gross income between Pounds 3,445
and Pounds 5,000 and 700,000 earning more than Pounds 40,000.
Total income before tax is Pounds 367.4bn and total income after tax is
Pounds 306.8bn, giving an average income tax charge for taxpayers of 17 per
cent.
Estimated personal wealth in 1990 is Pounds 1,235bn. The top 1 per cent of
the adult population held 14 per cent of wealth.
In 1989-90, the latest year for which accurate data are available,
employment income accounted for 71 per cent of total income of Pounds 333bn.
Profits and professional earnings were 11 per cent, investment income 11 per
cent, occupational pensions 4 per cent and national insurance pensions 3 per
cent.
Total income for that year was largest in Greater London at Pounds 47.8bn,
followed by Strathclyde at Pounds 12.2bn and Essex at Pounds 10.1bn.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Why independents are being deleted: Michael Skapinker on an
industry in which 'they say there's no such thing as a joint venture or
merger'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN FACTORY Communications, the Manchester-based music company, went into
receivership this week it was honest enough not to heap all the blame on the
recession.
The company said that the 'factory tried to do too many things, from
adventurous buildings to ambitious recording projects, at a time when some
foresight of the negative economic climate to come might have suggested
restraint'.
The collapse of Factory, which was founded by Mr Anthony Wilson and closely
associated with Manchester's 1980s youth culture boom, casts further doubt
on the viability of independent music companies. Many of those that have
survived have done so only by selling out to large publicly quoted music
conglomerates.
Last March, Mr Richard Branson sold his Virgin Music group to Thorn EMI.
PolyGram, the London-based music group owned by Philips of the Netherlands,
bought Island Records in 1989 and A&amp;M Records in 1990. Geffen, an
independent US label, was acquired by MCA in 1990. In the same year, MCA was
itself taken over by Matsushita, the Japanese electronics conglomerate. In
deciding it needed a music business, Matsushita was following Sony, which in
1988 bought CBS, the US record company.
One of Virgin's founders, Mr Steve Lewis, says: 'As soon as a small,
under-funded independent has a success, it finds it doesn't have the money
to keep the artist.' Mr Lewis left Virgin after it was acquired by Thorn EMI
and is about to set up a music company for the UK-based Chrysalis group.
Mr Daniel Miller, chairman of Mute, one of the surviving independents, says:
'It's much more difficult now for an independent than it was 10 years ago.'
Sales of singles are much smaller; companies have to produce albums. 'Now
you have to do a lot of re-mixes, you have to make a video, and you have to
spend so much more on marketing.'
While the costs of marketing and international distribution encourage the
trend towards music industry consolidation, many artists and managers prefer
the intimacy of a smaller company. Singer George Michael has complained of
being treated as a commodity by Sony. Some executives who have sold part or
all of their company to large music groups have not enjoyed the experience.
Mr Chris Wright, Chrysalis chairman, sold 50 per cent of his group's
recorded music company to Thorn EMI in 1989 and the remainder last year. He
felt that his company was no match for its larger partner. 'They say there's
no such thing as a joint venture and there's no such thing as a merger. You
have to experience that to know that it's true,' he says.
Undaunted, he is starting again. Chrysalis' new label hopes to stand midway
between the larger companies and the smaller independents.
Mr Lewis says that the company intends to grow while keeping costs down by,
for example, using freelance press and promotions staff. He believes he can
avoid the big company trappings he encountered during his brief period at
Thorn EMI.
Mr Lewis, whose last position at Virgin was managing director of music
publishing, says: 'When EMI bought Virgin, my financial controller was given
a book the size of an encyclopaedia on how to do the accounts.'
He adds: 'I've observed during my time in the industry that it has become
more controlled by the legal and financial professionals. They seem to have
the attitude that they want consistency of product. That's why George
Michael feels he's treated as a piece of software. Artists' careers don't
necessarily develop consistently. Artists take diversions. If you've got
artists in their twenties, you have to let them grow and find their feet.'
Some executives at large groups say they recognise these problems and
believe smaller companies play a crucial role.
Mr Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, says: 'The independents are an
important source of new product. New artists feel more comfortable in the
environment of an independent - certainly for the first record.'
Several of the large groups have taken partial stakes in smaller labels,
promising them continued creative independence.
Last August, Sony formed a joint venture with the UK independent Creation.
PolyGram has had a joint venture with Go] Discs since 1987. Go] Discs, whose
artists include Billy Bragg, was founded in 1983 on a start-up budget of
Pounds 750.
Mr Levy says he tries to give PolyGram's labels, which include Polydor,
Decca and Deutsche Gramophon, as much managerial independence as possible.
'Once a year they are given budgets and profit targets, but within those
overall controls we let the labels operate on a quasi-autonomous basis. If
you create a huge bureaucracy, new artists won't come to you. The person the
artist speaks to must be able to make a decision, or the person above them
must be able to. If it goes higher than that, it's a problem,' he says.
Mr Wright of Chrysalis will not be the last independent company manager who
finds that this relationship does not work well. A link with a large company
does, however, give small labels access to an international marketing and
distribution network and provides them with an infusion of new capital.
Mr Lewis points out that while marketing and distribution costs have soared,
the advance of digital technology means it has never been easier to record
music. 'A kid can go into a shop and buy the necessary equipment and put it
on the back seat of a car,' he says.
Although growth is difficult, entry costs are low and working in the music
business is the ambition of many. Whatever the perils, there will be others
to take Factory's place.

FT  28 NOV 92 / De-listing penalty urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUOTED COMPANIES should be required from next summer to state whether they
comply with the Cadbury code of corporate governance on pain of de-listing
by the Stock Exchange, the Cadbury committee has decided.
The recommendation will come in the final version of the Cadbury report due
out on Tuesday, and represents determination by the committee to stand fast
against opposition to the penalty by the exchange.
Companies failing to provide a statement in their annual accounts saying
they comply with the code - or giving reasons why not - are likely to be
forced by the Stock Exchange to issue a statement.
Any which did not comply could ultimately be de-listed, although the Stock
Exchange is keen to play down this measure.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of
the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, called the
disclosure 'an essential piece of the machinery' for effective corporate
governance.
He said the main parts of the report would resemble the original issued last
May, with greater clarification of the recommendation that non-executive
directors remain an integral part of a unitary board of a company with the
same obligations as executive directors.
This follows criticism from bodies including the Confederation of British
Industry that the report called for non-executive directors to take on a
separate, supervisory role, creating a two-tier board structure.
The report will continue to request a statement of compliance, but will rely
on the Auditing Practices Board to develop detailed guidelines on which
aspects of the code auditors will comment.
Sir Adrian said the new version of the report would be written more clearly
in an effort to make it a more usable long-term guide for boards.
It will also acknowledge that there are some concerns over the Caparo
judgment in the House of Lords, which severely limits the legal
responsibilities of auditors.
Sir Adrian criticism that the recommendations would not prevent another
failure of corporate governance such as the activities conducted by the late
Robert Maxwell.
He argued that it would influence the greater majority of companies.
Some 210 organisations and individuals have responded to the code.
Sir Adrian said the report would be followed by a series of other studies
outside the present remit of the Cadbury committee including the role of
shareholders playing a larger role in corporate governance, covering such
issues as putting up resolutions to a meeting; greater disclosure of
executive pay; and the long-term role and structure of boards.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Accounts changes 'need clearance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE to be urged to request clearance for any innovative accounting
treatments before using them in their annual accounts.
The Financial Reporting Council, the co-ordinating body for Britain's new
accounting standards regime, is to ask companies and their auditors to
discuss innovative accounting approaches with the Urgent Issues Task Force.
The move will bring the work of the task force more in line with its
equivalent in the US, where companies regularly ask for expert opinion in a
similar way.
The British task force tends to be merely reactive, moving to stamp out
perceived accounting abuses after they appear in a company's published
accounts.
The call for pre-approval will come in the council's annual report, which is
due in mid-December. It follows discussion of the issue at the board meeting
earlier this week.
While the Accounting Standards Board has embarked on a lengthy and ambitious
programme to overhaul UK financial reporting standards, the task force has
acted more quickly on points of dispute. It has issued several controversial
guidelines in the past few months, including one on the treatment of the
goodwill element of acquisitions when sold and one on transfers between
fixed and current assets.
The latter ruling was widely seen as a response to the treatment of
Trafalgar House's 1991 accounts, which led to the company being forced by
the Financial Reporting Review Panel to reduce its pre-tax profits by Pounds
83m.
The Accounting Standards Board also told the council board meeting this week
that it only expected to issue two new financial reporting standards next
year: on off-balance sheet financing and on capital instruments.
It said this reflected the intention to consult widely on the issues and to
give preparers of accounts and the accountancy profession time to change.
The ASB has already issued three standards since it was created just over
two years ago, including one in late October on the struc-ture of the
profit-and-loss account.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Ruling over BCCI deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT ruled yesterday that companies and directors were entitled to
set off deposits they held at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International against company overdrafts.
The decision is expected to have widespread implications for attempts by the
liquidators to recover other bank debts with UK companies.
The ruling was made in three cases involving seven companies and their
directors. The High Court declared that their debts with BCCI could be
reduced by the amounts held by directors on deposit with the bank.
If the decision had gone against the companies they would have had to pay
the full amounts of their overdrafts. A further setback would have been that
the amount their directors received back from their deposits would have been
subject to the payouts secured under the negotiated settlement between the
liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders.
Mr Chris Henson, of Lovell White Durrant, solicitors acting for the BCCI
liquidators, said they would be considering an appeal. He said the ruling
would affect a large number of BCCI clients: 'A very high proportion of the
loans made by BCCI has some sort of deposit associated. This will make a
substantial difference to the amount they will be able to claim.'
Mr Mohammad Sarwar, a director of two of the companies involved in
yesterday's rulings, said the companies would have folded if the judgments
had gone against them.
He is a director of MS Fashions, a Leeds clothing retailer, and of MS
Fashions (Wholesale) which together employ 50 people.
Each company had given a debenture to BCCI and had cross-guaranteed each
other's debt. Directors' deposits of Pounds 300,000 were being used to
secure a combined Pounds 600,000 overdraft from BCCI. Touche Ross, the
liquidator, had demanded the repayment of the whole overdraft.
The companies argued that the directors' deposits should be set off against
the overdraft. Receivers were appointed to the two companies in May by the
liquidators but were discharged in July after Mr Sarwar repaid the Pounds
300,000 balance of the debt.
The two other cases covered by the ruling were: High Street Services,
Portmaid Fashions and Cira which together owed more than Pounds 1m against a
deposit of Pounds 426,000 by Mr Raees Ahmed, a director; Impexbond and Tucan
Investments, which owed BCCI Pounds 3.3m as against Pounds 4.5m held on
deposit by Mr Nasir Amir, a director.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Mark Thatcher accused on arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARK THATCHER, son of the former prime minister, was alleged in the
Commons yesterday by Mr Tom Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, to have been
'up to the neck' in selling arms-making equipment to the Iraqis.
Mr Dalyell also accused Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister whose
evidence led to the acquittal of the defendants in the Matrix Churchill
trial, of not telling the truth to the Commons trade and industry committee.
Mr Dalyell, speaking with the protection of parliamentary privilege, said
statements made about Mr Thatcher in the Channel 4 programme Dispatches
raised questions going to the heart of government and had to be cleared up.
He insisted he was not getting at the former prime minister, but suggested
Iraq might be forgiven for being surprised by the reaction of the west to
its attack on Kuwait.
He said the Iraqis knew that Mr Thatcher was 'up to the neck' in selling
them arms making equipment.
There was a good deal of circumstantial evidence that they had jumped to the
conclusion that 'if Mark Thatcher was involved the general policy had the
imprimatur of prime ministerial approval'.
In the course of posing a series of 'very serious and careful questions,' Mr
Dalyell asked whether the government could confirm or deny allegations about
a deal made in September 1985 for British arms to be supplied to Saudi
Arabia.
Had Mr Thatcher been paid Pounds 10m in commission, with a promise of a
further Pounds 10m, after the signing of a memorandum of understanding?
Mr Dalyell called for a strengthening of the powers of Commons committees
after alleging that Mr Clark had played 'ducks and drakes' with the trade
and industry committee.
Mr Dalyell said 'A lot of his evidence was frankly just not true and not
what he must have known to have been the truth'.
Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, who stressed that
reassesment of relationships with the Arab world was the primary purpose of
the debate, ignored the questions about Mr Thatcher.

LOCAL authorities and the National Health Service are still having

according to a survey by pay analysts Incomes Data Services.
This is even though the recession has generally eased recruitment and

In the NHS the biggest shortages are reported for occupational therapists,

FT  28 NOV 92 / Making Lloyd's more 'user friendly': David Rowland tells
Richard Lapper about the discipline he hopes to bring to the insurance
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Rowland is almost certain to be elected chairman of Lloyd's of
London next week in succession to Mr David Coleridge. He said he aimed to
make the insurance market more 'user friendly'.
'I have always worked with an open door,' said the urbane Mr Rowland, 59.
'Too often in the past things seem to have been done to separate us off from
the outside world. People come to a dinner and go away wondering what
Lloyd's is all about.'
Mr Rowland said he would like to get closer to the market's traders than
some of his predecessors. Ideally he would relocate his offices closer to
the three lower floors on which the market's more than 200 syndicates
conduct their business.
'I want to get as close to the market as possible - both the knowledge and
the atmosphere,' he said. 'We want to persuade our visitors that the place
is really humming.'
Mr Rowland will work with Mr Peter Middleton, the tough-talking
north-easterner recruited to Lloyd's from Thomas Cook, the travel concern,
to be chief executive - and with Mr Brian Garraway, the former BAT
Industries deputy chairman who will be in charge of regulation. They are
offering more than changes in style.
They are promising a radical reform programme to improve the market's
efficiency; to make it more competitive in the international market for
specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance; and above all to make it
more profitable.
That seems like a tall order. Lloyd's is still grappling with some of the
worst trading conditions it has ever experienced. Mr Rowland will have to
report losses of more than Pounds 1bn to Names, the individuals whose
capital supports the market, when figures for the 1990 year become
available. Lloyd's could still be in the red in the 1991 underwriting year.
Thousands of loss-making Names are in dispute with their agents, and
potential liabilities from North American pollution and asbestosis claims
could easily offset the impact of the recent increase in rates.
Mr Rowland has had a big hand in designing the reform programme. Last year
he presided over a task force of 14 Lloyd's underwriters, brokers and
outside experts, whose report - Lloyd's: A Route Forward - laid down 65
specific reforms and outlined a blueprint for far-reaching change.
Lloyd's has implemented many of the measures recommended by the report,
including modifying the market's traditional principle of unlimited
liability, giving Names new powers and rights and moving to attract
corporate capital to the market.
The new team also plans to re-examine the market's approach to a number of
problems considered to be almost intractable by the task force report.
Mr Rowland says he is anxious to do more for the problems of Names who have
been forced to leave the market because of past losses, sometimes suffering
financial ruin.
The main aim of the reform programme was to enable Lloyd's to compete more
effectively in international markets.
Mr Rowland is chairman of Sedgwick group, a broker which does well over half
its business outside the UK, and he is more keenly aware of these realities
than any of his predecessors at Lloyd's.
He was a member of the Lloyd's council - the market's governing body -
between 1986 and 1990 and said the council failed to 'appreciate the
reality' of the way in which companies from Europe and North America were
eating away at its business.
He said: 'I've been very exercised by the way in which Lloyd's thought of
itself. I once threatened to hold up at each meeting a placard with the
annual premium income of Allianz (the German company which is the biggest
insurer in the world) just to encourage Lloyd's not to look inwards.'
He said he was frustrated on the council by the cumbersome way Lloyd's ran
its affairs and was particularly concerned about the way the demands of
self-regulation inhibited the council's ability to provide effective
strategic leadership to the hundreds of separate syndicates, agencies and
brokers which do business in the market.
Mr Rowland confessed 'absolute fascination' with the problem of persuading a
'fiercely entrepreneurial market' to continue competing while observing
enough 'central disciplines' to control the market.
Mr Rowland said: 'On bad days you think it is impossible to reconcile these
two things.'
He takes heart from the fact that in the last few years many big
corporations have sought to promote entrepreneurship within their
organisations.
The issue was studied in detail by the task force which recommended that the
Lloyd's corporation should separate its responsibilities for regulation and
for providing business services to the market's syndicates and agencies.
Lloyd's agreed in the summer to do this, after much prevarication, creating
a market board to spearhead business development. It was an important factor
in persuading Mr Rowland to accept the chairman's job.
The decision to make the chairman's post a salaried one for the first time -
it will pay at least Pounds 400,000 a year - cleared a remaining obstacle
for Mr Rowland, who said he needs a regular income.
Mr Rowland's interest in management might mark him off from many of the
insurance market's old guard, but he is still in some senses a Lloyd's
traditionalist at heart.
He has worked in or near the market all his working life and believes
strongly in the market's historic strengths.
He said: 'Until the early 1980s Lloyd's demonstrated itself as being the
most efficient way of doing business.'
Until the scandals of the 1970s and early 1980s 'the whole quality of the
place was that business was done because of a reputation of trust for the
individuals within it'.
Mr Rowland said that despite all his misgivings it was ultimately a belief
in these values that persuaded him to accept the job.
He described his worst fear as being seen by two other players on the 18th
hole of his favourite golf course missing a putt. 'One man turns to the
other and says: 'Isn't he the guy who they wanted to be chairman of
Lloyd's?' And the other one turns and says: 'He can't putt either'.'

A STUDY of small businesses' relationships with banks by the Mintel research
group indicated yesterday that most do not think bank charges unreasonable,
but that arrangement fees and fees for minor administrative services caused
much irritation.
It said some businesses felt the small-business centres established by
several banks to handle loans had meant a downgrading of their relationship
with the bank.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Bankers seek Lamont meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Bankers' Association yesterday asked for a meeting with Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, about recent criticism of banks' lending
policies, John Gapper writes. Sir Nicholas Goodison, association president,
said an inquiry into lending policies by the Bank of England last year had
shown criticisms to be 'largely unjustified'.
The association said it was waiting for bank chairmen to be contacted by Mr
Lamont after he had indicated to the Commons trade and industry committee 10
days ago that he wanted to discuss lending policies with them.
The association's letter marks an attempt by the banks to defend themselves
energetically against charges of making excessive profits from small
businesses.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Pay and performance 'unrelated': Directors' salaries
examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGEST study of the link between top directors' pay awards and company
performance has found there to be no such connection since the economic
downturn began in 1989.
The study of 288 of Britain's top 500 quoted companies will add weight to
the call by Mr John Major for tighter control of pay in the boardroom in the
light of the public-sector pay squeeze.
The researchers, from the London Business School and the Centre for Economic
Performance at the London School of Economics, looked at the
salary-plus-bonus level of the highest paid director - which has to be
disclosed under the Companies Act - and companies' share price and dividend
returns between 1983 and 1991.
They found that during this period the rate of growth of directors'
remuneration averaged about 20 per cent per year and was 'very weakly'
linked to performance.
They said, however, that any such link broke down after 1988 'when the very
high pay awards received by top directors in the recessionary period up to
1991 appear to be unrelated to the performance of their companies, whether
corporate performance is measured using stock market data or using
accounting data on earnings per share'.
Corporate growth was the most important determinant of pay. That fact called
into question the effectiveness of current systems of pay determination for
top directors. The link between increase in sales and increase in pay was
very strong.
They concluded that high pay awards for directors irrespective of the
company performance should be a cause for concern for anyone who owns
shares, directly or indirectly, since the failure to set incentives in ways
that align the interests of directors with those of shareholders was likely
to reduce shareholders' returns.
'Also, if remuneration is driven more by size than performance, then
directors have a clear incentive to pursue merger and acquisition activity
regardless of any benefit to shareholders, workers, or the economy as a
whole.'
Another recent analysis by Incomes Data Services, the pay research group, in
a sample of 69 of Britain's top 100 companies, similarly found 'no
discernible relationship' between performance and pay.
Of the 26 companies where profits and/or earnings per share fell
substantially, 23 of the most highly paid directors received pay increases.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Politicians play the local numbers game: Alison Smith
reports on warnings from both sides over the council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Howard, the environment secretary, and Mr Jack Straw, his Labour
shadow, have two things in common. Both are barristers, and both have warned
extensively against trusting forecasts of council tax levels.
Mr Straw's warnings derive from suspicion that the government is in the
business of producing misleading figures. Mr Howard insists that council tax
levels will be set by local authorities, and so he will not authorise any
forecasts.
Mr Howard's approach contrasts with the government's readiness in past years
to produce reams of poll tax numbers at a time when there was greater
freedom for councils to run their own budgets.
Nonetheless, he has not been able to avoid being drawn into the numbers
game. In admitting the basis on which the department had been doing its
grant calculations, he has made a significant contribution to the first set
of forecasts which have already appeared.
The departmental figures cannot reflect personal circumstances.
Single-person households will get a 25 per cent discount, 3m people in
England on low incomes will pay nothing and a further 2m will pay a reduced
charge. Moreover, the figures cannot reflect whether an individual's bill
will be reduced through the Pounds 340m transitional relief scheme.
In broad terms, however, the department's figures give a reasonable guide to
the likely levels of bills, provided that some caveats are taken into
account.
The calculations assume, for example, that councils spend at the level of
government assumptions, rather than take advantage of the slight scope for
spending above that level that exists even in the increasingly rigorous
'capping' regime which gives ministers extensive control over council
budgets.
Other factors likely to increase the size of the bills include the allowance
that councils will have to make for the potential shrinkage of the tax base,
perhaps because there are more single-person households or because people
successfully appeal against the banding of their homes.
And the ghost of the poll tax still hovers over local government finance,
with poll tax arrears outside the capping system and - in a few areas -
capable of adding substantially to council tax bills.
In a year when the settlement has been so tight, it may seem implausible
(except in the London Borough of Wandsworth) that some bills could be lower
than the department envisaged. Yet this may be true in some areas, because
of the politics of local government.
The tax comes at a time when shire districts and counties are acutely
conscious of the local government organisation review. Sir John Banham, who
leads the review in England, is drawing up the first of his reports on how
local government should be slimmed.
Ministerial preferences for unitary authorities have pitted councils against
each other, while government emphasis on opinion-polling as a factor in
whether a council should survive gives an incentive beyond the county
council elections in May to seek local popularity.
Council tax bills will show separately the costs imposed by a county and by
a district: those councils which still have balances may well be tempted to
use them to keep bills down as part of the campaign for continued existence,
or in a final spending of their resources if they know they are doomed.
So far as national politics are concerned, decisions on local spending
appear based on a cool judgment by ministers that it is more important to
keep bills as low as possible than to worry about the squeeze on services.
Seeing ministers stumbling from political disaster to PR calamity has become
so familiar that it comes as almost a shock to realise that that judgment
looks right in the immediate terms of Westminster.
The clampdown on spending, means that the transitional relief scheme,
although modest in cash terms, should be enough to see off the worst
concerns in London and the south-east among Tory voters.
A shrewd assessment of the position came from one Whitehall official who
said: 'The problem is likely to be with the (spending) settlement, not the
tax.'
Although cries of anguish from local authorities are routine in response to
every recent local government finance statement, there is little doubt that
this year budgets are under severe strain. The increasing noise from Tory
councils in this chorus is an ominous sign that the spending settlement may
lead to local revolt.
The opposition will need to work hard if it is not to be only local. The
Commons is used to hearing reports of fewer home helps, fewer library
opening hours, worse conditions in schools. It is harder for the opposition
to embarrass the government with these examples than with the case of a
pensioner couple in receipt of a squillion-pound poll tax bill, but it still
looks the most likely ground for the battle.
Mr Straw has made a start, but there is a long way to go. For Labour, the
task is to make the council tax about jobs and services.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Straw attacks government pledges over council jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 45,000 local authority employees lost their jobs last year, Labour
said yesterday. The party rejected repeated government denials that any
redundancies have arisen from the council funding squeeze.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said the figures proved
government pledges that the council tax would not affect employment were not
to be trusted.
Mr John Major said this week that past Labour warnings of job losses 'have
never yet become fact' while Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary,
said there was 'no need' for the new tax to provoke job losses.
Statistics compiled by Local Authority Joint Staffing Watch and examined by
independent Commons' researchers show that about 34,000 full-time and 11,000
part-time jobs were lost in England in the year to June. Of those, 6,700
were full-time teachers and 7,500 part-time teaching staff.
Mr Straw said a Labour survey of town halls had revealed that not a single
council leader contacted would rule job cuts and losses of services as a
direct result of the introduction of the new tax. And the 'conditional'
language of Mr Howard in his statement on local government spending had
tacitly indicated there might be redundancies.
Releasing an action plan for Labour councillors, he stressed that
authorities must make clear to electors that cuts are a direct result of
central government parsimony. A careful look at the plan shows Labour has
been put on the defensive. It is aware many voters will blame the cuts in
jobs and services on local politicians.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Lamont card leak investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER specialists yesterday ruled out opportunism over the leaking of Mr
Norman Lamont's credit-card transactions. They said that the security
surrounding bank card processing systems almost certainly ruled out chance.
One said: 'Somebody wanted that information and somebody, not necessarily
the same person, knew how to get it'.
National Westminster Bank, whose Access subsidiary is the subject of an
internal investigation and an inquiry by the data protection registrar,
yesterday refused to give details of its system security.
Mr Gary Tobin, a senior vice-president of First Data Corporation, denied his
company could be responsible for the leak, which claimed Mr Lamont had
overspent on his Pounds 2,000 Access card limit. The US computer company's
UK subsidiary, First Data Resources, processes Access credit card data under
contracts from National Westminster, Midland, and Lloyds Bank, as well as
the Royal Bank of Scotland.
'Some of the information published is not held on our system, which makes it
unlikely we could be the source of the leak,' he said.
It is not yet known whether details of Mr Lamont's account were obtained
from a computer or paper records.
Card processors are conscious of their obligations under the Data Protection
Act and financial data is typically processed in conditions of high
security. Passwords and security badges are necessary to enter computer
centres and codes are used to gain entrance to computer rooms.
Several levels of password will be necessary to gain access to the computer
system.
These systems, and printers used to produce warning letters, will be held in
extra secure areas. Investigators will have access to an audit trail which
will show which terminal was used for every transaction, at what time, and
which password was used.
It is unlikely, nevertheless, that each screen is held in a separate room.
However, an organisation such as Access could have more than 100 junior
staff working on screens - allowing the possibility of electronic
eavesdropping.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Spens is acquitted and savages SFO: 'There have been
burglaries, phone taps, harassment and overt threats to me and my
colleagues'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SPENS, the former managing director of corporate finance at the Henry
Ansbacher merchant bank, yesterday finally won his High Court battle to be
acquitted of fraud charges brought against him following his involvement in
the Guinness affair.
His name cleared, Lord Spens left court to launch a vitriolic attack on the
Serious Fraud Office and other government departments, accusing them of
acting with 'staggering malevolence' against him and other defendants in the
Guinness trials.
He is also considering suing Henry Ansbacher and the Bank of England for
damages over his dismissal from the bank after details of the Guinness
affair first became public.
Lord Spens was acquitted of charges of fraud and false accounting which had
been left on the file following the collapse of the second Guinness trial
last year.
The fraud charge related to alleged dishonest concealment of material
factors relating to the Guinness takeover of Distillers in 1986.
The role of Henry Ansbacher centred on the disputed ownership of 2m Guinness
shares worth Pounds 7.6m held by the bank during the takeover battle with
Argyll.
The trial was abandoned after 73 days when Lord Spens' co-defendant, Mr
Roger Seelig, the former Morgan Grenfell corporate financier, suffered a
nervous breakdown while defending himself in court.
The trial judge, Mr Justice Henry, refused to acquit Lord Spens and ordered
the 'stay', saying he had brought the prosecution on himself.
Two High Court judges yesterday ruled that Mr Justice Henry had been wrong
to reach this decision since he did not have the power to order the stay.
However, they rejected Lord Spens' application for his legal costs,
totalling about Pounds 365,000, to be paid from public funds.
Lawyers for Lord Spens are considering whether this ruling can be challenged
in the House of Lords.
Afterwards, Lord Spens launched a salvo of bitter criticism against the SFO,
the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Bank of England
and the security services for 'leaving no stone unturned' in trying to
convict the Guinness defendants.
He said: 'There have been burglaries, phone taps, harassment and overt
threats to me and my colleagues; interference with witnesses' evidence,
public interest immunity certificates and failure to disclose important
documents.
'Roger Seelig's health has been destroyed and, but for a fine heart surgeon,
I would have been killed off too.
'I intend to take my seat in the House of Lords where I will work, amongst
other things, for the radical reform of the Serious Fraud Office, which I
consider to be nothing more than a cowboy outfit with a gunslinger
mentality.'
Lord Spens said the prosecution had a 'disastrous' effect on his personal
financial situation, having cost him a total of about Pounds 750,000.
He intends to return to work, but conceded this would probably be only on
the 'periphery' of the City.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Tube faces new strike threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground's plans for radical changes in staffing hit a new
stumbling block yesterday after the white-collar union TSSA voted narrowly
in favour of strike action, Lisa Wood writes.
The vote - 373 in favour and 343 against - was in protest at a Tube
reorganisation plan which will alter terms and conditions for its staff with
a reduction in salaries for about 30 per cent of employees. Unions also
claim the plan could result in 5,000 lost jobs among the 21,000 employees.
Although belonging to a small union, TSSA members control signal
installations and a strike could disrupt services.
Four days ago the RMT, the largest rail union, pulled back from a Tube
strike after being promised renewed talks and no compulsory redundancies.
TSSA's executive will now meet next week to decide what to do next. The
union said the vote had cleared the way for strike action.
London Underground said only about half the TSSA members had voted and the
result seemed to indicate a reluctance to strike.
It added: 'We hope we can provide additional clarification of our plans as
we did with the RMT and which avoided strike action on that occasion.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Venezuela defeats second coup attempt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan government said yesterday it had defeated the second military
coup attempt in a year against President Carlos Andres Perez. Up to 50
people died in the fighting, with hundreds wounded and the presidential
palace bombed.
The rebels, apparently supported by civilian insurgents, captured two
important air force bases before dawn on Friday. They also took control of
the government-owned television channel and broadcasting towers on the
mountains overlooking Caracas.
But by late afternoon the government claimed to have the rebellion under
control. Interior Minister Luis Pinerua Ordaz announced that the leaders of
the insurgency had surrendered to forces loyal to the government.
After recapturing Francisco de Miranda air force base in eastern Caracas,
loyal forces used tanks to take the last rebel stronghold, the Libertador
air base in Maracay, west of the capital.
Venezuelans learned of the rebellion before dawn yesterday when Lt Col Hugo
Chavez Frias, the army officer who led the putsch last February, appeared on
a videotape broadcast on government TV channel. According to opinion polls,
Col Chavez, who apparently heads a group of disaffected lower-ranking
officers, is one of Venezuela's most popular public figures.
The rebel officers, who may now be linked with left-wing civilian groups,
are at odds with the military high command, who for the most part appear to
support the established order. They have denounced Venezuela's political
elite as corrupt.
Col Chavez, who was jailed after the February putsch, attempted in the
broadcast to encourage civilians to take to the streets in support of the
coup.
However, it appeared that most Venezuelans stayed indoors.
After the February coup, the government jailed the ringleaders, split up
disaffected groups in the army and improved military intelligence.
As in many Latin American countries, the army has lost its sense of purpose
in the last decade or so, following the end of left-wing guerrilla violence
and the rapprochement more recently with Colombia, with which Venezuela has
had a long-standing border dispute.
Similarly, the prestige of the armed forces has declined with the
government's reduced ability - because of falling oil revenues which account
for four-fifths of government income - to provide military hardware and pay
reasonable salaries.
The coup attempt comes against a background of rapid economic growth - one
of the fastest in the world. From the depressed levels of 1989, it has grown
by more than a quarter. Growth this year will probably exceed 8 per cent
after surpassing 10 per cent last year.
According to government figures, backed independently by businessmen, food
consumption has grown by a fifth over the last year, a sign that the growth
has not only benefited the rich. Employment is rising rapidly - a quarter of
a million jobs have been created in the last year - on the back of an
expanding private sector.
The government says this growth has been created by its reform programme
which deregulated much of the economy.
Yet, according to opinion polls, the government and, in particular, the
president - who faces elections at the end of next year - are hugely
unpopular. This is partly because his administration has failed to improve
on the poor standard of public services.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Opec agrees to trim oil output
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A DEAL between Iran and Saudi Arabia broke the deadlock at talks between
ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec),
allowing them to agree a cut in oil output yesterday.
Ministers are hoping the market will draw some comfort from their announced
cutbacks and that prices will rise. North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery
in January moved 10 cents higher to Dollars 18.90 a barrel on news of
yesterday's agreement.
Opec agreed to restrict its oil production to 24.58m barrels a day (b/d)
after both Saudi Arabia and Iran said they would trim their output.
Although Kuwait had insisted on a quota of 1.75m b/d, the emirate agreed to
produce 1.5m b/d and to boost its output when market conditions and prices
allowed.
The new production ceiling will be in place for the first quarter of next
year when the organisation expects demand for its oil to be around 25m b/d.
But member nations have said they will try to implement cuts in December in
order to give additional support to prices.
As part of the agreement, Iran will cut its output to 3.49m b/d from 3.8m
b/d which Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, claimed it was
producing in October. At the same time Saudi Arabia will shave its output
slightly to 8.39m b/d from 8.4m b/d. Ministers from both countries had
earlier refused to cut output.
A compromise was reached after all-night talks on Thursday with Mr Alirio
Parra, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines and Opec president.
The agreement does little more than reinforce the status quo since
production by Opec countries is currently at 25m b/d. Without Ecuador, which
officially left the organisation at this meeting, production is 24.7m b/d,
implying a cut of little over 100,000 b/d.
But oil traders say the fact that countries will try to implement cuts
straight away gives a signal to the market that production discipline will
be reintroduced. In addition, this agreement marks the first time for over a
year that Iran or Saudi Arabia has not expressed grave reservations about
the outcome.
'I think the agreement will get an improvement in price of one to two
dollars a barrel, maybe by the end of the year,' said Mr Hacene Mefti,
Algeria's energy minister.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Hong Kong to start airport work

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S legislators yesterday narrowly supported the government's
proposals to go ahead with the site preparations for the controversial Chek
Lap Kok airport.
The vote by the Legislative Council's finance committee comes despite
continued opposition from China. Beijing has yet to approve the financing
package for the HKDollars 167bn (Pounds 14.3bn) airport.
The vote raises concern over the level of support Governor Chris Patten can
expect for his proposals on political development, which have met fierce
opposition from China.
The Hong Kong govern-ment was forced to make concessions to push the
financing package through, cutting funding proposals by HKDollars 1.9bn to
only HKDollars 6.7bn. This enabled it to win the support of the United
Democratic Party, which holds 13 seats in the 60-seat council.
The more conservative political group, the Co-operative Resources Centre
(CRC), voted against the motion, saying it was concerned with the divisive
nature of the project. The proposals were passed by 27 votes to 25.
China said in July it would approve the site formation contract. But the
Hong Kong government turned this down claiming it would be wrong to take a
piecemeal approach towards financing the project.
The approval of the financing package comes just three days before the
contract to the Nishimatsu consortium was due to expire. Failure to agree
would have resulted in escalating costs as a new tender would have to be
launched.
The colony's stock market continued to shrug off political concerns
yesterday, but the business community was bracing itself for an aggressive
response from China over the inevitable implication that Hong Kong was
pushing ahead with the airport on its own.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDAL has taken a heavy toll on Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party
with public support for the government falling sharply in recent months to
20 per cent.
An opinion poll showed that the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, was now as fragile as that of Mr Noboru Takeshita in April 1989,
when he had to resign over the Recruit scandal.
The sharp rise in disapproval of the government and the party is likely to
intensify the instability at the top of the LDP as it prepares for a highly
sensitive cabinet reshuffle.
The party's leadership has already been destabilised by a power struggle
provoked by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. A split in the LDP's largest
faction could follow.
The public outcry over the long running scandal is likely to intensify next
week with mounting pressure on Mr Takeshita.
He will be asked to clarify how much he knew about the role of organised
crime in 1987 in halting a right-wing campaign against his bid to become
prime minister.
The opposition parties have called on Mr Takeshita to testify to the
parliament's upper house after giving evidence to the lower house on
Thursday. That testimony drew a critical public response yesterday.
The opposition parties are considering putting a motion calling on Mr
Takeshita to resign from parliament.
Japan's industrial production in October was 2.6 per cent down on September
and 6 per cent down on October last year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
said.
Inventories of unsold stock, expected to drop as production falls back, rose
by 1.4 per cent for the same month, however.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Dam experts race to save Danube from toxic waste deluge
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST stage of emergency repairs to a crumbling dam in Montenegro, a
republic in the rump federation of Yugolavia, was nearly complete yesterday
evening. But United Nations officials warned there was still a high risk the
dam could collapse, sending tonnes of toxic waste towards the Danube.
Mr Sergio Piazzi, relief co-ordinator with the UN disaster relief
organisation in Geneva, said the efforts of the past two days 'have given
the first injection - now we have to keep the dam standing'.
International response has come six weeks after the floods and nearly a
month after international bodies were alerted to the problem's seriousness.
Mr Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for the Geneva conference on the former
Yugoslavia, said Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, who visited Montenegro on
October 30 as part of peace efforts, had urgently requested money and
materials from the European Commission and the UN sanctions committee. The
first EC experts examined the dam on November 10, and UN experts on November
15.
A quarter of the length of the 600m dam, high in a region of rocky gorges,
was damaged by two flash floods on October 17 and 18 which tore away
supporting concrete panels from the base.
The 12-metre-high dam, made of compacted-earth, holds back 7m tonnes of
mining sludge from the river Tara, which eventually drains into the Danube.
The sludge, the consistency of wet sand, contains lead and zinc, which can
kill fish and poison drinking water. Mr Hans Zimmerman, a senior UN
official, said there also appeared to be traces of lindane, a highly toxic
pesticide.
On Thursday and yesterday materials were hastily collected from all over
Europe - reinforced plastic sheeting from the Netherlands to prevent the dam
absorbing water, and steel cages from Italy to support its foot - and rushed
to Montenegro in a Belgian Hercules aircraft.
Next week Mr Zimmerman will begin a report on the total cost of repairs and
medical supplies for people made homeless by the floods.
The first phase has received Ecu110,000 (Pounds 88,800) from the EC and
Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,570) from UN emergency funds. EC experts estimate
the cost of emergency work at Ecu500,000.
Mr Zimmerman said that even though the floods had subsided, the dam was
still threatened because the Tara had broken its banks and was swirling
against its foot.
Phase two, lasting until Christmas, will be the construction of a new
supporting dam next to the river.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian parliament yesterday passed a motion demanding that the
government rework its economic programme and that President Boris Yeltsin
present to the Congress of People's Deputies his choice of candidate for the
post of prime minister .
The motion threw down the challenge to Mr Yeltsin to nominate Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the acting prime minister, as premier for another term.
The motion came as intense political struggles continued behind the scenes
over the shape of the reform programme and of the next Russian government.
Mr Gaidar, in a uncompromising speech to parliament on Thursday, ruled out
any weakening of the main principles underlying economic reform. The effect
of his speech has been to challenge Civic Union, the centrist group which is
pressing the government to revise its programme, and to force the powerful
grouping to either accept the government's stand or break off negotiations
aimed at co-operation.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister, repeated yesterday that
'there will be no fundamental change in the course of the reform.' He said
that the government was prepared to take from the programme of the Civic
Union only these factors elements which seemed sensible and which aided
reform - such as selective support to industry.
Interfax agency yesterday reported that leaders of Civic Union and of the
nationalist Russian Unity faction in parliament had agreed on the need for
more cabinet resignations. These include Mr Valery Makharadaze, a deputy
prime minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister and of Mr Gaidar
himself from the post of prime minister.
Civic Union has long wanted such dismissals - but was said to have dropped
the idea in the past two weeks following agreement with government experts
on an economic programme. However, Mr Arkady Volsky, the group's leader, has
charged the government with breaking the agreement.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Brussels lets BA buy TAT stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has approved British Airways' plan to buy nearly 50
per cent of the French regional airline Transport Aerien Trans-regional,
after the British carrier offered to open certain UK-France routes to
greater competition.
The decision is likely to incense Air France, the French state-owned
carrier, which had already protested to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition
commissioner, about alleged double standards in judging deals involving BA.
BA, TAT and Dan Air, the UK carrier which BA is also taking over, will have
98.6 per cent of all flights between Paris and Gatwick, and a monopoly on
flights between Gatwick and Lyons. But the Commission decided to assess the
merger on the basis of flights between all four London airports and the
French cities. 'There's a strong competitive relationship between those
airports,' claimed Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday.
The deciding factor, however, was that BA promised to give up slots on both
routes if rivals want to start or step up their service from Gatwick to
France.
That is unlikely to be enough to satisfy Mr Bernard Attali, president of Air
France, who threatened legal action against the Commission two weeks ago. He
believes that Sir Leon adopted the wrong approach last month in deciding the
takeover of Dan Air did not fall under Brussels' jurisdiction, and that he
should have prevented the purchase of TAT going ahead during the four-week
investigation of the case.
The British company said it was pleased with the favourable decision and
added that it only required formal clearance from the French authorities for
the takeover to go ahead. BA is hoping for the go-ahead around the beginning
of next year.
Taking into account all London airports, BA will increase its share of the
London-Paris market from 49 to 52 per cent, and from 45 to 58 per cent on
the London-Lyons routes. Air France is the second airline in both markets,
with 33 per cent and 41.5 per cent respectively.
The European Commission confirmed yesterday that it was conducting a
preliminary study of EC airlines' 'frequent flier' customer loyalty
programmes, but a spokesman said it had not launched a formal investigation
under competition rules.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL INCOME in the US rose by one per cent in October over the previous
month, the largest monthly gain since last December and further evidence of
an economy that seems to be finally gathering steam.
Special factors, including subsidy payments to farmers and other public and
private sector bonuses, accounted for more than half the monthly advance.
But wages and salaries in October also went up a healthy 0.6 per cent, after
falling 0.1 per cent in September, as did disposable income.
Personal consumption spending in the month went up by an adjusted 0.7 per
cent, nearly as good as the upwardly revised 0.9 per cent advance of
September.
The new surge in consumer confidence, also reflected earlier this week by
the revised 3.9 per cent annual growth in the third quarter gross national
product, also suggests much improved Christmas sales, for which the big
retailing push began yesterday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday.
Assorted surveys project sales 4-9 per cent higher than last year and even
some warnings of a shortage of very popular goods just before Christmas
itself.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Germany sets hurdles for power transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN political parties in Germany agreed yesterday that all future moves
to transfer national sovereignty to the European Community must be approved
by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament.
It means that any future moves towards European union, in addition to the
present Maastricht treaty, will be confirmed in Germany only if there is
broad cross-party support.
Such measures - for example, to agree a European defence union - must also
comply with Germany's definition of adequate democratic control, which will
now be written into the German constitution.
The agreement, opposed by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and his
Free Democratic Party (FDP) as excessively restrictive on future progress
towards European integration, was part of a compromise reached in order to
press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the Bundestag next
week.
It was settled between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the special parliamentary
committee set up to ratify the treaty.
The SPD had argued in favour of a strict two-thirds majority being applied
to all final parliamentary approvals. In exchange, the opposition agreed
that the package of constitutional amendments tailored to ratification of
Maastricht will come into effect, even if the Maastricht treaty is not
ratified by all 12 EC member states.
That means that whether Maastricht is approved by Denmark and Britain or
not, the 16 German federal Lander represented in the Bundesrat, the upper
house, will have much greater powers of involvement and oversight of
proposed EC legislation. It will also establish a more powerful European
oversight committee in the Bundestag, the lower house, which will have to be
consulted by the government in advance of all EC negotiations.
All the moves, which now seem certain to be approved by the full Bundestag
on Tuesday, in spite of FDP opposition, have the effect of increasing German
parliamentary control over decisions in Brussels, comparable to that in
Britain and Denmark.
Supporters of European integration fear that it will simply make all
Brussels negotiations far more complex.
There remains one potential stumbling block to ratification in Bonn.
The Bundesrat is unhappy with the clause proposed for resolving conflicts on
EC legislation between the two houses of parliament.
Mr Florian Gerster, the European affairs minister of the
Rhineland-Palatinate, said it was uncertain if the Bundestag would be able
to approve ratification as planned on December 18.
A conciliation committee might have to be summoned to resolve the conflict
on conflict resolution.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Irish PM's future in balance after poll losses: Reynolds'
Fianna Fail loses Dail seats in surge to Labour Party Abortion referendum
proposal defeated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE political future of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's Taioseach (prime
minister), hangs in the balance following his Fianna Fail party's disastrous
general election result this week and the equally humiliating defeat of a
controversial abortion referendum. Speaking on Irish TV, however, he said:
'I am not throwing in the towel.'
As the final results trickled in yesterday evening, it appears that the
make-up of the next dail (parliament) will be Fianna Fail 68-69 seats, Fine
Gael 45 seats, Labour 33-34 seats, Progressive Democrats 10 seats, others 10
seats.
A total of 83 seats are required to form a majority government.
When the election was called last month, following the break-up of the
Fianna Fail-PD coalition, Mr Reynolds said his target was to win an absolute
majority. Instead his party's share of the vote, 39 per cent, has slumped to
its lowest level since the 1920s, while Labour has surged forward, doubling
its vote and its number of seats.
It therefore looks likely that the price Fianna Fail will have to pay to
stay in power will be the ditching of Mr Reynolds. He has been leader only
since last February, when he led a backbench rebellion against his
predecessor Mr Charles Haughey.
All the other party leaders have serious reservations about Mr Reynolds. He
has made public his distaste of coalition governments, but even more
important, the continuing judicial inquiry into the beef industry places a
question mark over his credibility.
The coalition collapsed last month in an acrimonious war of words between
the two party leaders over who was telling the truth to the inquiry.
It was sustained parliamentary questioning by the Labour leader, Mr Dick
Spring, that led to the establishment of the inquiry last year. Mr Spring is
due to be called to the witness stand next week to substantiate allegations
of fraud and political favouritism he made in the dail, and Mr Reynolds will
probably continue to be cast as the accused.
The alternative coalition of Fine Gael-Labour-PD faces ideological obstacles
as well as Mr Spring's insistence that he be given the prime minister's
post, instead of Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader.
Mr Michael McDowell, the chairman of the PD party said yesterday: 'I would
be very conscious of ideological incompatibility.'
Mr Spring is likely to insist on the leadership as his price for supporting
such a coalition, however. His fallback option, preferred by many of his
party strategists, is to continue building the party in opposition with a
view to making it the second force in Irish politics and forcing the
right-of-centre parties into coalition.
Labour party activists believe it may take until the new year before a new
government can be formed, although the new dail reconvenes on December 14.
Until then, Mr Reynolds must struggle on with his discredited, minority
government, which will make even more difficult the task of defending the
Irish currency on the financial markets.
In the abortion referendum, with a third of the votes counted, the right of
women to travel abroad for an abortion and to receive information on how to
go about it has been overwhelmingly supported.
However, a government proposal put forward by Mr Reynolds, which would allow
abortion when the life of the mother is threatened, has been overwhelmingly
defeated.

SOUTH Africa's tortuous negotiating process received a big boost yesterday
when it was announced that the South African government and the African
National Congress (ANC) would meet next week for talks on a new
constitution.
It will be the first time the two sides have met for formal constitutional
negotiations since multi-party talks broke down last May at the Convention
for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa).
Since then, the gap between the two sides on the crucial issue of
power-sharing has narrowed, with the ANC proposing this week that South
Africa be ruled by coalition even if one party wins a majority of votes in
the first elections under a permanent constitution.
ANC officials tried to force the pace of next week's meeting, which will be
held over three days at a secret location, by rejecting as too slow the
timetable announced on Thursday by President F W de Klerk, who forecast
elections for an interim government by April 1994.
Amnesty International human rights group has released a report documenting
physical abuse of prisoners in ANC camps outside South Africa. The victims
were often labelled as South African government spies, but most appeared to
have been genuine ANC members, imprisoned because they raised grievances or
policy differences, it said.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Serbs' human wall keeps UN aid from Moslems: Laura Silber

HOPE of emergency aid reaching Srebrenica, a besieged Moslem town in eastern
Bosnia, receded yesterday after Bosnian Serb commanders sent a UN convoy on
a wild goose chase.
The UN, blocked for three days, suffered another setback in its third
attempt to reach Srebrenica. Once again, this time in Bajina Basta, local
Serbs formed a human wall on a bridge over the River Drina, linking Bosnia
with Serbia, in order to block food from reaching tens of thousands of
Moslems.
The 20-lorry convoy was instead forced to take a new route down a winding
road in the Drina river valley, 30 miles south of the previous, more direct
route to the besieged Moslem stronghold.
In every town where the convoy was blocked, similar events took place.
Villagers screamed and jeered. Old women brandished sticks. One even waved
an axe at journalists. Volleys of gunfire boomed in the surrounding hills as
locals accused the Moslems of roasting their Serb victims on a spit. They
said the convoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was
smuggling weapons in the food packages.
In other villages, weeping Serb women said the fresh graves were the reason
why they would never let the convoy reach one of the last pockets of Moslem
resistance. 'While we are alive, this convoy will never pass,' said
Andriana, 17, a student. 'Most of my friends are buried in the cemetery.
They were just a year older than me.'
Officials of the UNHCR patiently reiterated that aid must be given out to
all sides in the Bosnian war. But shabbily-clad Serb villagers defiantly
insisted: 'We don't need your help.'
The UNHCR since July has delivered 85 tonnes of aid to the town of 3,000
people. Last week, the UN severed aid to Serb-held territory in eastern
Bosnia until access is given to Moslem towns.
Bosnian Serb commanders told UN officials that the new route to Srebrenica
in any case was an unusable dirt track. A UN reconnaissance team later
confirmed that armoured personnel carriers and 10-tonne aid lorries would
get stuck.
Agreement for the convoy to take this new route was won after Serb
commanders appeared to climb down in their war of nerves with the UN. But as
the convoy commanders yesterday waited for the go-ahead, it appeared the
Serbs had won again.
An angry Bosnian Serb soldier asked why the world tells lies about Serbs. He
gestured at the crowd of 200 people, saying 'everyone has lost a son or a
husband'. The crowd waved placards in English saying: 'Don't feed our enemy'
referring to the Moslems of Srebrenica, five miles away over the hillside.
Across the river in Serbia, UN peacekeepers escorting the convoy set up camp
in a cattle market as they awaited orders to head for Srebrenica, the only
Bosnian town to have received no aid since the war erupted in April.
British, Danish and Belgium peacekeepers sat eating French army rations and
sipping French wine while UN officials and commanders in Sarajevo tried to
pressure Serb commanders into letting the convoy through.
While weeping Serb villagers seemed genuinely distressed, a UN soldier said
the blockade of the convoy belonged to a military strategy. 'The Serb
military obviously intends to starve the Moslems and then take the town.'
Bosnian Serbs and leaders of Croatia's regular forces have agreed a
ceasefire from midnight tomorrow, according to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, agencies report from Sarajevo.
He denied this amounted to a Serb-Croat 'carve-up' of Bosnia at the expense
of Moslems.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Rise in house sales forecast as prices continue to drift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLUME of UK house sales is expected to recover by as much as 15 per
cent next year but prices are likely to go on falling, according to industry
and independent forecasts.
Forecasters believe buyers will be tempted back into the market by low
interest rates and cheap house prices, prompting the first annual increase
in house sales in four years.
Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, said
yesterday the number of UK house sales could rise by 13 per cent next year
from 1.06m to 1.2m. This compares with a peak of 1.98m sales in 1988 at the
height of the property boom.
The bank warned that prices would continue to drift down even when sales
started to rise, because of the large backlog of unsold properties. Buyers
concerned about rising unemployment and the state of the UK economy would
not countenance higher prices.
Mr James Morrell, who prepared the forecasts for Charterhouse, predicted
that prices would fall next year by a further 1 per cent after a 6 per cent
decline this year.
The bank forecasts 6 per cent price rises in both 1994 and 1995. Mr Morrell
said house prices had fallen to their lowest level in relation to average
earnings since the 1970s and this would attract buyers back into the market.
A survey of more than 300 housebuilders by the House Builders Federation
found that 43 per cent of companies expected sales to rise next year.
Another 27 per cent expected sales to stay static, while the remaining 30
per cent forecast further falls.
House prices in the south-east have fallen on average by about 30 per cent
since the 1988 peak.
Mr Morrell said: 'People who bought in 1988 would have to wait until the
turn of the century to recover their money, assuming that prices continue to
rise at about 6 per cent a year from 1994 onwards.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / SIB attacks sales methods of life insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SELLING practices of the life insurance industry were sharply criticised
yesterday by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board, the UK's main financial regulator.
Mr Large referred to what he described as 'mis-selling' of life products in
his speech to the annual conference of the Society of Financial Advisers in
York. He said that 'human nature has been found wanting in too many cases
and this has shown up as bad practices and disadvantaged clients'. As a
result, he said, there was widespread public unease about the industry.
The vast majority of salesmen working in the industry earn commission for
each policy they sell, with the heaviest income accruing in the early years
of the product.
This practice of 'front-end loading' has encouraged, critics say,
high-pressure selling. Customers who surrender their policies early find
costs have taken a large chunk of their investment. It can take about 11
years for the surrender value of a 25-year endowment policy to equal the
value of premiums paid.
The life assurance regulator, Lautro, has disciplined a number of companies
for the inappropriate selling of policies in recent months. The previous
chairman of SIB, Sir David Walker, criticised front-end loading, but the
authority has done little to reform the commission system.
The industry has responded sharply to past criticism. When Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director general of fair trading, criticised selling practices in
September, the Association of British Insurers said his comments 'betrayed a
lack of understanding about how the insurance industry operates'.
Yesterday, Mr Large said that 'the selling of life products does pose
particular regulatory challenges. The combination of commission-driven
selling and lack of transparency in the products themselves places an
enormous weight on the conduct, the training and the professional competence
of advisers, be they tied or independent'.
Mr Large said regulators had been criticised for interfering too much in a
business which was already suffering from the recession.
'My view is that if we could all be satisfied that high and continually
updated standards of competence were universal through the industry, then it
might be possible to contemplate a less prescriptive approach to regulating
the client-adviser relationship. But to be frank, we do not now have that
confidence.'
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers Association, said:
'It is a shame that after five years of the Financial Services Act, it is
only now that the chief regulatory body has said this. Mr Large is right to
pick out remuneration as well as lack of competence as a key factor.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / UK wins backing for EC budget proposal: Rich and poor
countries divided over finance plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK won majority support among EC partners yesterday for its compromise
on future Community financing, but its tough approach drew a storm of
protest from the poorer countries, led by Spain.
Britain's refusal to give up its annual rebate of about Pounds 2bn also
faced fierce criticism.
The UK's compromise package was condemned by Mr Jacques Delors, EC
Commission president, as 'a serious political mistake'. He continued to
press for his proposal, known as Delors II, to boost the EC budget.
Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland joined Mr Delors in opposing the British
plan.
But there was strong support from Germany and the Netherlands. France,
Belgium and Italy, which has it own severe budgetary problems, also appeared
to be leaning in Britain's direction, according to EC and German officials.
British ministers had been bracing themselves for a furious reaction from EC
partners over its plan to limit Community spending. In the event, UK
ministers were pleasantly surprised.
Britain's compromise envisages holding down the increase in Community
spending to 3 per cent a year in real terms for seven years. This would
allow for a budget of Ecu79.3bn (Pounds 61bn) by 1999, from Ecu61.1bn this
year. Mr Delors wants to boost the EC budget to Ecu82.3bn over the same
period, a figure he insists to be in line with the goals of the Maastricht
treaty.
The split between Europe's prosperous northern tier, led by Germany, and the
poorer Mediterranean countries and Ireland emerged during a 'conclave' of
foreign and finance ministers in Brussels.
Unless Mr John Major can bridge the north-south divide, he risks a
destructive budget wrangle overshadowing a crowded agenda during next
month's EC summit at Edinburgh.
The prime minister is touring European capitals in an effort to narrow
differences on enlargement of the Community as well as a resolution of
Danish demands for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty.
A resolution of the budget impasse is being seen among diplomats in Brussels
as the test of Britain's much-criticised presidency.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, described the budget talks
in Brussels as serious and calm. 'There is no guarantee of progress at
Edinburgh,' he said 'but we have identified the obstacles and are
well-placed for a compromise.'
However, he acknowledged, that the UK's refusal to yield to pressure to give
up its rebate had been fiercely criticised. The UK remained open to
suggestions of reworking how to pay the the money back, but the amount of
the rebate remains non-negotiable, he said.
The core of the British proposals seeks to raise the maximum size of the EC
budget - the so-called own resources ceiling - to 1.25 per cent of EC gross
national product by the end of 1999 from 1.2 per cent at present.
Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary for finance, said a majority of
countries accepted the UK's approach as 'serious' and said it ought to be
possible to reach a deal at Edinburgh.
Much hard bargaining lies ahead if differences are to be bridged over how to
divide the EC pie. Most controversial are the 'cohesion' funds for poorer
countries to bring them closer to their prosperous EC partners in the drive
to economic and monetary union. The UK's proposal doubles the cohesion and
structural funds for the four poorest countries to Ecu12.25bn compared with
Ecu15bn under the Delors II package.
Peter Norman, Economics Editor, writes: Mr Lamont and other EC finance
ministers will take part in the Edinburgh summit, reflecting the growing
importance of economic issues in the remaining weeks of the UK presidency.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Jobless executives run aid mission to Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYED executive Mr Andrew Stephenson is on a mission to Croatia to help
Bosnian refugees - and himself.
Six months ago Mr Stephenson, 37, was a Pounds 30,000-a-year security
company executive. In 10 days, with the blessing of his unemployment
benefits office, he will deliver blankets and food to Bosnians.
The mission has been organised by Reaction, a self-help organisation for
unemployed executives and managers.
Established earlier this year by a jobless personnel director, Reaction aims
to involve unemployed executives in voluntary projects where they can
re-create the atmosphere of the world of work.
Mr Stephenson believes the convoy, whose navigators will all be unemployed
executives and managers, will be the largest one leaving the UK with aid for
Bosnian refugees in Croatia.
Mr Stephenson said: 'The aim of the organisation is to banish the void of
redundancy and improve job prospects through positive action.'
Social security, he said, had given Reaction permission for individuals to
take unpaid work provided executives guaranteed they would take paid jobs,
if these were appropriate.
Based in Leeds, Reaction has received inquiries from more than 5,000
unemployed men and women. There are moves to set up offices in other towns.
Government-run executive job clubs and job review workshops served a
valuable purpose, Mr Stephenson said. 'They are an important resource where
you can scan the vacancy columns in the newspapers every morning and beef up
your curriculum vitae.'
The projects Reaction would normally undertake related more strictly to
business activities and the needs of executives, he said.
'However, the needs of the executives for contact with others and to feel
useful makes the organisation the ideal vehicle to organise this relief
effort.'

FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance ministers to attend EC summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, and other European Community finance
ministers will take part in the EC summit in Edinburgh in two weeks,
reflecting the growing importance of economic issues in the remaining weeks
of the UK presidency, Peter Norman, Economics Editor, writes.
The finance ministers' presence will be a break with EC tradition. But the
UK's proposals for financing the EC budget over the next seven years and the
search for an economic growth policy for Europe have persuaded Britain to
invite finance ministers.
Recent upheavals in the European exchange rate mechanism and the future of
the community's plan for economic and monetary union are likely to be
discussed at the summit. The heads of government and foreign ministers would
be able to draw on the expertise of finance ministers.
UK Treasury officials confirmed that Mr Lamont would be in Edinburgh. Most
other EC finance ministers are expected to attend.

in an apparent neo-Nazi arson attack.
The order to close the 130-member Nationalist Front, based in Detmold in
North Rhine-Westphalia, was served by police in mid-afternoon.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, said it was an 'unmistakable
warning signal against extreme right-wing agitation and violence'.
At the same time, orders were issued to arrest eight further members of a
separate extreme right-wing group in the northern town of Gudow, near Molln,
where the Turkish victims died in a fire on Monday.
The leader of this group, Michael Peters, is already in detention, accused
of forming a right-wing terrorist group, and taking part in at least two
arson attacks on foreign asylum-seekers' hostels.
However, Mr Alexander von Stahl, the chief federal prosecutor, who has taken
over the case on the grounds of a threat to national security, said there
was still no evidence to link the group to the Molln attack.
Two houses occupied by Turkish families were set on fire, and an anonymous
caller tipped off the police with the words: 'Heil Hitler]'
In spite of that suggestion of neo-Nazi involvement, German television has
reported 'strong suspicion' in the police department that rivalry between
Turkish gangs may have been behind the attack.
The theory has been denied in the Turkish community.
More than 10,000 mourners turned out in Hamburg at the funeral for the
51-year-old grandmother, her 10-year-old granddaughter and 14-year-old niece
who died in the blaze.
The funeral was attended by Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, and Mr
Norbert Blum, labour minister, on behalf of the German government.
Mourners at the funeral, held at the Al-Aksa mosque, held Turkish flags and
waved banners saying: 'Stop Racism'.
There were spontaneous demonstrations against racism across the country.
Some 200,000 members of the IG Metall engineering union in northern Germany
stopped work for one minute in sympathy. In Dortmund, 10,000 schoolchildren
marched in solidarity.
The Nationalist Front was founded in 1985 and, the Interior Ministry says,
was 'an active fighting organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the
democratic order'.
Its programme included policies similar to those of Adolf Hitler's Nazi
party, and its immediate aim was the expulsion of foreigners from Germany.
It presented candidates at state elections in Bremen last year, and won just
0.03 per cent of the vote.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Banks deny witholding cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS responded yesterday to criticism that they have not passed on all base
rate cuts to small businesses, and asked for a meeting with Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor.
The move came as a study of small businesses' relationship with banks found
most did not think bank charges were unreasonable, but arrangement fees and
fees for minor administrative services caused considerable irritation.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, wrote
to Mr Lamont requesting a meeting. The association said it waited 10 days
for bank chairmen to be contacted by Mr Lamont after he said he wanted a
meeting.
The association's letter marks an attempt by banks to defend themselves
against charges of making excessive profits from small businesses. Mr Lamont
asked the Bank of England to extend an earlier inquiry into bank lending.
Sir Nicholas said in his letter that the Bank's inquiry last year into
lending policies had shown that criticisms were 'largely unjustified'. He
said he wanted to discuss recent criticisms in that context.
Sir Nicholas said he and senior bank executives wanted to talk about 'the
effects of the economic background of the last few years on the banks, and
the need for a strong banking industry based on sound capital and fair
competition'.
Mr Lamont told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee 10 days ago
that he would ask the chairmen of the clearing banks about lending policies.
The association said none of its members had been contacted.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Chief chosen by 3i lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in which 3i, the venture capital group, has an investment
yesterday established an organisation, which has not yet been given a name,
to represent their collective interests.
Representatives from about 88 companies gathered at a private meeting in
Birmingham and decided unanimously to found the organisation. A further 120
companies have made commitments to join.
Mr Barry Baldwin, managing director of AE Poeton, metal finishers, will be
the first chairman.
The decision to found an organisation was prompted by concern over the
future of individual companies once 3i is floated on the stock exchange.
There have been fears that, to maintain dividend payments to its new
shareholders, 3i might take a short-term view of its risk capital
investments.
The biggest venture capital group in the UK, 3i has investments in over
4,000 UK companies.
It is owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks, with Barclays and
National Westminster as its biggest shareholders.
A Stock Exchange flotation, which would have valued 3i at more than Pounds
1bn, was planned for this year but has been delayed.
Before the Birmingham meeting, there were complaints from some of 3i's
client companies about a lack of communication and a lack of interest from
3i. There were proposals that client companies should have representation on
the 3i board and have preferential treatment in any 3i share issue.
But after the meeting, members of the seven-strong committee set up to run
the new organisation were anxious to distance themselves from both such
proposals and any criticism of 3i. They stressed the need for communication
with 3i.
'As far as I am concerned, we are starting with a clean page. We just want
to talk,' said Mr Baldwin.
Mr Alan Wheatley, chairman of 3i, told colleagues he would be glad to meet
Mr Baldwin to discuss new ideas.
The new organisation is the brainchild of Mr John Garrod, chairman of
Rite-Vent, a Tyne and Wear engineering company, which sponsored yesterday's
meeting.
Rite-Vent has issued a writ against 3i, alleging negligence. To avoid a
conflict of interest, Mr Garrod declined to stand for election to the new
organisation's committee.

FT  27 NOV 92 / HSBC makes further provision for Concord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland
Bank, has taken a further provision of Dollars 61.4m (Pounds 40.6m) against
Concord Leasing, its troubled US equipment leasing business.
This comes just two months after it announced the resignation of Concord's
senior management, together with a Dollars 100m cash injection and Dollars
75m provision.
The latest write-down followed a review of Concord's entire asset portfolio.
HSBC said it had established general provisions sufficient to support
Concord's continuing business activities, in addition to taking 'specific
provisions for all identified weaknesses in Concord's asset portfolio.'
The initial Dollars 75m write-down taken in September was against Concord's
ageing shipping portfolio, and raised concerns over insufficient management
control from the parent company.
Concord had assets of Dollars 2.17bn in December 1991, and analysts had
considered further provisions to be inevitable. The latest charge was taken
in the quarter ended September 1992.
HSBC has appointed Mr Matthew Colasanti as president and chief executive for
Concord. However, Mr David Budd, a senior HSBC executive from Hong Kong, has
been appointed chief operating officer. HSBC said that Concord planned to
remain active in the leasing business, despite the impact of the US
recession.
Since HSBC's successful takeover of Midland in June it has also taken a
Dollars 187.5m provision against its exposure to Olympia &amp; York. The banking
group made total provisions of HKDollars 4.48bn (Pounds 381m) against bad
and doubtful debts at the interim stage.

FT  27 NOV 92 / AAH hits Pounds 18m on back of buoyant healthcare market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUOYANT healthcare market and the withdrawal of a competitor helped
pre-tax profits of AAH Holdings, the diversified distribution company,
advance 11 per cent to Pounds 17.5m in the half year ended September 30.
The result was struck on turnover 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 679.7m.
Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said the results reflected 'solid progress' in
healthcare, with a substantial advance in the group's pharmaceuticals
distribution business. Healthcare profits rose by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds
13.9m on sales 11 per cent up at Pounds 564.2m.
About half of that division's increase was due to the acquisition of
turnover from the withdrawal of rival Medicopharma last November. The other
half was due to an underlying growth in the sector.
Mr Bill Revell, managing director, said the UK pharmaceuticals market had
benefited from the combination of an ageing population and more expensive
drugs.
In the early part of the summer - known as hay fever season - the overall
market had been growing at about 12 per cent. However, when the wet weather
hit Britain in July and August underlying growth fell back to about six per
cent.
The environmental division - rubbish collectors and road cleaners -
benefited from a small acquisition and increasing contracts from local
authorities. Profits advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 3m.
The difficult economy was blamed for the Pounds 200,000 decline to Pounds
1.5m in building supplies and the Pounds 100,000 loss (Pounds 500,000
profit) in consumer products. Mr Pybus said the consumer division was
expected to incur a similar loss in the second half. Distribution increased
from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 1.4m due to the acquisition of ECE in April.
The purchase had refocused AAH on to higher margin and more reliable
contract distribution services, particularly for the food sector.
During the half year, AAH spent Pounds 28.2m in cash and shares on
acquisitions. The company currently has 182 retail pharmacies.
The interim dividend was raised 7 per cent to 5.8p.
COMMENT
A stock with defensive as well as cyclical qualities might not offer the
spectacular returns some would hope for. However, to enhance the defensive
position by holding a leading role in the growing pharmaceuticals market
certainly adds a bit of spice. AAH Holdings yesterday showed that it had not
skimped on spice with results showing that growth in healthcare had
outstripped that of the sector. Rationalisation of Medicopharma business -
initially delayed by a Monopolies and Mergers inquiry - and the acquisition
of Ireland's Cahill May Roberts group promise even greater growth in the
future. On the cyclical side, those betting on economic recovery should
eventually see a good upturn in the building and consumer divisions.
Forecasts are for about Pounds 37.5m in the current year, leaving the shares
on a prospective p/e of about 16 times. While the medium-term prospects look
tantalising, the market appears to have factored in the good news for the
moment.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Lords protect employees' perks: Inland Revenue loses case
centred on reduced school fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS OF THOUSANDS of employees have been saved from losing their perks at
work by a landmark ruling against the Inland Revenue from the House of Lords
yesterday.
The decision will allow many companies to structure their benefits without
fear of incurring additional costs. Many have delayed tax planning while
awaiting the judgment.
The case, Pepper v Hart, concerned the reduced school fees paid in 1983 for
their own children by 10 teachers at Malvern School, including Mr John Hart,
a senior master.
But, it had enormous implications for many employers offering benefits to
their staff. Those affected would have included those with subsidised
canteens, sports facilities or travel, and those able to buy goods at a
discount.
British Airways confirmed last night that it was one of several companies
and professional firms which contributed to a Pounds 100,000 'fighting fund'
to help in the appeal. If the case had been lost, its employees might no
longer have been able to buy airline tickets at 10 per cent of the retail
price.
The teachers at Malvern argued they should only be taxed on any difference
between the reduced fees they paid for their own children and the marginal
cost of providing this education - such as meals, laundry and books. The
Inland Revenue claimed that the teachers should be assessed for tax on any
difference existing between the fees they paid and the average cost of the
fees.
The Revenue said yesterday that it would be issuing a statement shortly on
the implications of the judgment. 'We are analysing the fine print,' it
said. 'This is a very important case. We felt we would win.'
It still has the option of seeking new legislation which could push for
average cost on employee benefits to apply in the future.
Mr Hart said: 'It's an absolute rout. There was tremendous interest from the
boys, wishing us good luck. I was bullish at every point. I'm going to buy a
new car next week.'
The 35-page statement by seven law lords was described last night as a
landmark decision by Ms Leslie Ferrar, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick,
because it said ministers' speeches in parliament can be taken into account
when interpreting the law.
The ruling means that lawyers and judges may now have to consult Hansard to
understand ministers' intentions when they were originally debating
legislation, even though their ideas may not have been reflected clearly in
the letter of the law.

In the run-up to the summit on December 11 the SNP will be urging voters to

There will be an independence rally in Edinburgh on December 4 and a
torchlight demonstration in the city the following day.
Another mass demonstration is being planned for Edinburgh on December 12.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lordships resist breath of fresh
heirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Lords last night struck a blow for tradition and against equal
opportunities by rejecting a proposal which would have given hereditary
peers the choice of passing titles to their daughters instead of their sons.
On a day when apparently immutable parts of the UK's constitution were in
flux, peers decided by 60 votes to 33 to block a backbench bill that would
have given an hereditary peer the option of nominating his eldest daughter,
rather than his eldest son, as heir. The bill was proposed by Lord Diamond,
who said the present 'discriminatory practice' should not continue.
Opposition to the bill was led by Lord Denham, a former government chief
whip and himself an hereditary peer. He argued that it would be unfair to
eldest sons who already had the expectation of succeeding to a peerage.
The Duke of Norfolk said that the bill would mean 'interfering with
history', while Lord Mowbray and Stourton, whose peerage was created in
1283, said that most people thought of a family line as the male line. 'The
male line of inheritance ought not to be disregarded.'
A number of those against the bill said they were not anti-feminist, but
were opposing it because they feared it would divide families.

High-level officials from the two sides, meeting for the first time since

Queen Victoria volunteered to pay income tax when it was introduced in 1842,
prompted by her prime minister, Sir Robert Peel.
Her successor, Edward VII, tried to avoid income tax in 1901, but was
advised by Lord Salisbury's Conservative government to pay up. It was his
son, George V, who managed to get income tax removed from the civil list in
1910.
The Treasury was persuaded in 1932 to lift tax on income from Duchy of
Lancaster rents, but the monarch continued to pay tax on private investments
until 1937, during the reign of George VI, the Queen's father.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (24): Key facts for visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY:
The French franc is still pegged to the Deutsche Mark, but has floated
against most of the other European Community currencies, notably the pound
and the lire, since the autumn currency crisis.
Almost all large Paris banks, such as Credit Lyonnais or Credit Agricole,
have bureaux de change although you should shop around for the most
competitive rates. The small bureau de change on rue Saint-Honore at the
back of Le Louvre des Antiquaires (by Palais-Royal metro station) usually
offers good rates. Leading credit cards - American Express, Visa and
Access/Mastercard - are accepted by most hotels, shops and restaurants.
Telephones:
The international dialling code for Paris itself is 331. Dial 19 followed by
the country code and number to make an international call from Paris. To
make a call from Paris to anywhere else in France dial 16 plus the number.
Some payphones are still coin-operated but most only accept telecartes,
phone cards, which are worth up to 18 minutes of telephone time and can be
bought from any cafe-tabac.
Minitel:
Although Minitel is probably best known, inside and outside France, for its
Rose sexlines, it is actually one of the world's most advanced interactive
information networks. You can change your flight reservation, book an opera
ticket, check a phone number or read the International Herald Tribune on
Minitel. Most hotels are equipped with them at reception. There are also
coin-operated Minitels available to the public at the Bibliotheque Public
Information at Centre Georges Pompidou.
Time:
French time is one hour ahead of Britain (Greenwich Mean Time) and six hours
ahead of New York. The only exception is in the four weeks in early autumn
from late September, when the French clocks go back an hour at the end of
summertime to the same time as Britain (and only five hours ahead of New
York) until the British and American clocks go back in late October.
Hotels:
Paris is fairly busy throughout the year, but the hotels are filled to the
brim in May, June, September and October when the city is crammed with
tourists. March is busy too because of the pret-a-porter fashion shows as is
June during the biennial Air Show. Book early for these periods. Details of
the main Parisian hotels are available in the hotels section of this guide,
or in standard tourist guides such as the Michelin.
Restaurants:
The grand Parisian restaurants, those with two or three stars or a really
stunning location like the Jules Verne on the Eiffel Tower, are almost
always booked up four to six weeks in advance, particularly for dinner. You
should also book a few days to a week in advance for anywhere else which is
particularly attractive, or fashionable.
Addresses and telephone numbers for restaurants are published in the
Michelin and Gault Millau guides.
Clubs:
Business life in Paris is notoriously nepotistic and the city has a
labyrinthine network of private clubs and dining circles. The plush private
clubs, such as the Club des Inter-Allies on rue Faubourg Saint-Honore or the
Saint-Cloud country club, are ideal for discreet business entertaining.
These clubs are ferme to the public, or members only, although they do have
reciprocity arrangements with private clubs in other cities such as London
and New York. The Inter-Allies has the added attraction of pretty gardens
and a large 1970s James Bond-style swimming pool.
Tipping:
A service charge of 15 per cent is automatically added to all restaurant
bills, or cafe bills if you sit down to eat. The bill usually indicates this
with service compris, service included. But you should always leave a tip if
you stand at the bar.
Strictly speaking you need not tip taxi-drivers. Most people do, however,
unless the journey was particularly dreadful. The same principle applies to
hotels. The staff at the very swanky Plaza-Athenee are told to stand at the
room doors for 30 seconds, no more, in case the guest decides to give them a
tip.
Airports:
Paris has two main airports. Charles de Gaulle, 23km north-east of the
centre, for international flights (tel:4862 2280 for flight information) and
Orly, 12km to the south (tel: 4975 1515) for domestic routes.
Almost all the major - and minor - international airlines fly to and from
Charles de Gaulle. Air France, the French international carrier, also has an
extensive international network of routes. Air France passengers should go
to Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle and passengers with most other carriers
to Terminal 1. Air Inter is the main domestic airline operating from Orly.
Getting to and from the airports: It takes anything from 40 to 90 minutes -
costing FFr150 to FFr250 - to get from central Paris to Charles de Gaulle
depending on the traffic. Try to avoid travelling there by taxi during rush
hours particularly on Friday evenings when people are leaving Paris for
their weekends in the country.
The easiest alternative is the RER train service from Chatelet, which costs
around FFr30 and takes about 30 minutes. The RER stops at Roissy station
where a courtesy bus ferries passengers to the airport terminals. But the
RER network is not safe at night, particularly for women travelling alone.
Alternatively Air France buses leave for Charles de Gaulle from L'Etoile and
Porte Maillot every 20 minutes. Allow at least an hour for the journey,
which costs roughly FFr40.
The taxi journey to central Paris from Orly is cheaper and quicker, at
FFr120 to FFr150 lasting about 40 minutes, depending on the traffic. Buses
leave for Orly from Les Invalides and Montparnasse every 15 minutes with
tickets costing about FFr35.
Public Transport:
The famous Parisian Metro underground railway network is not only cheap, but
efficient. Maps are available from every station and are included in all
tourist guides. You identify which line you want from the direction, the end
station on the route. The metro operates on one ticket per journey, however
long. One ticket costs FFr6, or you can buy a carnet of 10 tickets for
FFr36.50. A weekly pass costs FFr57 and a monthly pass FFr201.
The only hitch is crime. Pickpocketing is commonplace, so keep a tight grip
on your bags. You can use your metro tickets on the Parisian bus network,
although this tends to be a less efficient way of travelling around the city
because of traffic jams. Paris is also the hub of an international rail
network, thanks to France's futuristic - and very comfortable - Trains a
Grande Vitesse (TGVs), which often make it easier to travel to cities such
as Brussels by rail rather than air. Call 4565 6060 for train information
and 4582 5050 for reservations.
Taxis:
One of the indirect effects of the efficient metro network is that taxis
tend to be comparatively cheap in Paris. There are taxi ranks in most parts
of the city centre. You can also hail cabs on the street whenever their roof
lights are on. Most restaurants will call for them for you at the end of the
evening.
There are also a number of reliable telephone taxi services so you can order
your own cab from Taxi Bleu, Tel: 4936 1010, or Taxi Etoile, Tel: 4270 4141.
The Aerotaxi service, Tel: 4731 3030, specialises in airport journeys, which
is useful during peak periods when the peripherique and motorways may be
congested.
Boats:
Travelling by boat is one of the loveliest ways of seeing the city. The
bateaux mouches look - and are - terribly touristy, with their incandescent
lights and booming loudspeakers. But they do provide one of the most
efficient, and picturesque, routes through the city. A bateau mouche journey
at night is quite captivating because of the effect of the lights on the
stonework of the riverside buildings and the Seine bridges.
Vedettes de Pont Neuf, Tel: 4633 9838, leave from the Pont Neuf itself.
Bateaux Mouches, Tel: 4225 9610, from Pont de l'Alma and the Bateaux
Parisiens, Tel: 4705 5000, set sail from nearby Pont d'Iena.

Sports facilities: Paris is a high density city. Most of the tennis courts,
golf courses and larger swimming pools are found on the outskirts of the
city, by the Portes, as are the only real open spaces, the Bois de Boulogne
and Bois de Vincennes. The inner city parks, the Jardin des Plantes and
Jardin du Luxembourg, were designed to be ambled, rather than run, around.
Parisian joggers tend to settle for running on the roads or around the
islands - Ile de la Cite and Ile Saint-Louis - as a compromise.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (25): At least the Lucky
Nugget Saloon won a star - EuroDisneyland, located east of Paris, is one of
those places that people either love - or loathe
</HEADLINE>

THERE is a possibly apocryphal story that a man arrived at Euro-Disneyland
carrying a large bag in which he had hidden a Smurf costume, like those worn
at a rival French theme park. Once inside he changed into his costume and
chatted to visiting children until the Euro Disney security guards hustled
him away.
An interloping Smurf is probably the least of Euro Disney's problems. In its
short life, EuroDisneyland has been assailed by a barrage of obstacles
ranging from a stream of abuse from France's intelligentsia (one of whom
called it a 'cultural Chernobyl'), to a traffic-stopping Operation Escargot
blockade by militant French farmers and a tumbling share price amid
speculation about serious financial difficulties.
EuroDisneyland is one of those places that people either love - or loathe.
Some visitors return with tales of smiling children and carrier bags stuffed
with souvenirs. Others rattle off complaints about high ticket prices,
lengthy queues and commercial, as well as cultural, imperialism. If you want
to see for yourself, the best way to visit EuroDisneyland is to go
off-season, preferably when it is not too cold, or too wet. Euro Disney did,
after all, decide to build Europe's most expensive leisure complex on one of
the boggiest bits of northern France.
Should you go during the peak summer season, when the weather is likely to
be better, it is probably best to stay overnight. You would then arrive in
the early evening in plenty of time to see the stunning firework display and
could enjoy the park in the morning, before the afternoon crowds descend.
It is also sensible to buy the Michelin guide to EuroDisneyland, which ranks
all the attractions according to its usual star system. That way you can
make sure that you spend your time on the three star rides - the sci-fi Star
Tours attraction, Phantom Manor haunted house and runaway minetrain - and
skip the dross.
Epicureans beware. Michelin could find little good to say about
EuroDisneyland's catering arrangements. Only one of the park's restaurants,
the Lucky Nugget Saloon, was given a star - and that was for decor, not
food.
EuroDisneyland, Tel:4941 4910 for information and reservations, is
accessible by road 32km east of Paris at Marne-la-Vallee on the A4 motorway,
by the RER rail network from central Paris or by shuttle from Charles de
Gaulle and Orly airports.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (22): Dream city for film
buffs - Paris, with 450 cinemas, offers the world's widest choice of films
old and new
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
IF you tell a Parisian that you have been to see a film, their first
question will almost certainly be what did you think of it and their second:
'Quel ecran?' - 'Which screen?'
Paris is a dream city for any film buff. There is probably a wider choice of
movies on show at any time in the French capital's 450 cinemas than anywhere
else in the world.
The Hollywood blockbusters usually arrive in Paris long before London and
lovingly restored prints of even the most obscure art films play to packed
houses at the Latin Quarter independents.
There are also always a dozen or so retrospectives of famous directors to
choose from at the art houses or the legendary Cinematheque.
The first step for any film fiend visiting Paris is to buy a copy of one of
the listings magazines - Pariscope, L'Officiel des Spectacles or 7 a Paris -
to see which films are on, where and when.
The information given in these magazines is so basic that they are easily
understandable even if you do not speak French.
The second step is to check which language the film is being shown in. The
initials 'VO,' version originale, mean the movie is in its original
language, probably with French sub-titles if it is a foreign film. 'VF,'
version francaise, denotes a film in French, so foreign films will have been
dubbed, and 'VA,' version anglaise, the English language version of a French
film.
The next step is to choose which cinema to go to. If you want to see a
mainstream movie then any of the commercial cinemas, the Gaumonts or UGCs,
along the Champs Elysees ought to offer the basic ingredients of big screens
and air-conditioning. But there are so many really spectacular cinemas in
Paris that it seems silly not to choose something special.
Perhaps the prettiest picture palace of all is La Pagode, the sole surviving
cinema in the snooty seventh arrondissement, a Japanese pagoda brought to
Paris from Japan in the late 1890s by a director of the Bon Marche
department store, originally as his private ballroom.
La Pagode was converted into a cinema in 1931 and declared an historical
monument by Jack Lang, the French arts minister and an avid cineaste, in
1982. There are now two screens and a small salon du the, which is perfect
for tea in the ornamental Japanese garden on summer afternoons. But make
sure you go to the main salle, as it has both the bigger screen and the
original oriental decor. The smaller salle has a postage stamp screen and an
undistinguished interior.
Attractive though La Pagode may be, purist Paris film fiends tend to stick
to the independent cinemas in the Latin Quarter. Paris is one of the few
cities with its own arts house chain, Action, which has nine screens all on
the Left Bank.
Anyone with an eye for cinema history should appreciate the Studio des
Ursulines, the city's oldest arts house dating back to 1926 near the
Luxembourg gardens, or Le Champo, one of the rue des Ecoles independents
dedicated to Jacques Tati, the cult 1950s comedian. There is also the
chi-chi Escurial Panorama on boulevard du Port-Royal, a starlet's paradise
with red velveteen seats in the salle and Vaseline-softened star portraits
adorning the walls.
Paris also offers the very latest in movie modernism. There is La Geode, the
Thunderbirds fantasy at Parc de la Villette, a silver dome of a cinema where
the seats tilt back so that you can see the film projected onto the dome's
ceiling. There is also the shiny new Gaumont Grand Ecran on place d'Italie,
the state-of-the-art Gaumont complex which boasts the biggest single screen
in the city.
But the best modern cinema of all is still the independent Max Linder
Panorama on boulevard Poissoniere, an exercise in design excellence, with
spacious seats, stunning sound, excellent expresso for before or after the
show, and an enormous screen which every self-respecting French film
director chooses for their premieres.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (23): Treasures on display -
Apart from the famous Louvre, Paris is also the home of a series of smaller,
but no less appealing museums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE had an eye for art, particularly for art owned by other
people, so much so that whenever his armies stormed a city or won a battle,
his soldiers were under orders to ransack the buildings, to prise paintings
off walls and sculptures off plinths, and to send them back to Paris.
This artistic swag was put on show in the Louvre, the old royal palace that
Napoleon commandeered as his own home. The citizens of Paris trooped
patriotically through the galleries peering at the Titians, Leonardos and
Greek busts, the spoils of their emperor's military triumphs. Napoleon's
booty is still on display in the Louvre, dotted around its miles of
galleries. And the Louvre is still the museum in Paris. The latest addition
to the Louvre complex is IM Pei's notorious glass pyramid (see the main
front cover photograph). Whatever one thinks of it aesthetically, the
pyramid is now established as a Paris landmark, and has also made it much,
much easier to navigate around the museum.
Impressive though the Louvre's permanent collections may be, its temporary
exhibitions have been rather lack-lustre in recent years. The Grand Palais,
built for the 1900 Exhibition on the leafiest stretch of the Champs-Elysees,
is now the forum for the big Parisian art shows.
Across the Seine, the Musee d'Orsay is still run along more traditional
lines. The d'Orsay, a 19th century railway station which was immaculately,
if a little antiseptically renovated in the early 1980s under the aegis of
the Italian architect, Gae Aulenti, has now established itself as one of
Paris' most popular museums.
It houses a wonderful collection of works, mainly from the end of the
Workers' Revolution in 1848 to the beginning of the First World War in 1914.
It is best known for its Impressionist paintings, which were moved here from
the old Jeu de Paume. But it also has some stunning Gaugins, Van Goghs,
Cezannes and Seurats as well as one of the world's best collections of Art
Nouveau furniture and a replica of Charles Garnier's Opera.
The chief complaint about the d'Orsay is that the labyrinthine lay-out makes
it virtually impossible to find your way around. But the collection is of
the finest quality and offers an unrivalled 'snapshot' of the watershed in
19th century art, with the shift from the neo-classical formalism of
Delacroix, to the musey Impressionists, and later of the sea-change towards
the early abstraction of Cezanne. The best time to visit is on Thursday
evening, when the galleries are open until 9.45pm.
Beaubourg, or the Pompidou Centre as it is officially called, follows on
from where the Musee d'Orsay stops as the national museum of 20th century
art. The fourth floor is the home of the permanent collection with wonderful
works by Matisse, Picasso, Cezannes.
AMONG the smaller, but no less appealing museums, the Musee d'Art Moderne de
la Ville de Paris has emerged as Beaubourg's chief competitor on the modern
art scene by carving a niche as a centre for younger contemporary artists
and for conceptual art.
The Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie, is a great place to take children,
who can run around the sculpture park, or gawp at the futuristic silver dome
of the Geode cinema, as well as getting a taste for inter-galactic life from
the rockets and satellites displayed in the Explore exhibition hall.
Meanwhile anyone interested in 20th century art should see the fruits of the
French government's tax deal with the Picasso family. Musee Picasso is an
immaculately restored Marais mansion, which combines some of the very best
examples of Pablo Picasso's own work with his personal art collection of
Braques, Cezannes and Matisses, which merits a gallery of its own.
Paris also has its musees sentimentaux, based in the places where artists or
writers lived and worked - there are a dozen or so dotted around the city.
The most opulent is the Musee Rodin, set in Auguste Rodin's stunning 18th
century hotel.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (22): Culture on a grand scale
 -The arts scene / Paris has long been a lively centre for the world's
academics, artists, writers, architects, musicians and film makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
IT was back in the year 1102 that Paris first won its laurels as the
cultural capital of Europe thanks to Abelard, the learned logician, who left
the stuffy old cathedral school of Notre Dame to set up his own school on
the Montaigne Sainte-Genevieve.
Other freethinkers followed Abelard's lead. Medieval Paris became the 'New
Athens,' a hubbub of learning, with scholars and teachers flocking to the
city first from France, and then from all over Europe. Paris has been a
centre for the world's academics, artists, writers, architects, musicians
and film makers ever since.
From time to time other cities have tried to usurp its position. New York
ousted it in the 1940s as the centre of the modern art movement, just as
Milan did in the 1970s for architecture. But the sheer scale and range of
Paris' artistic activities means that it has always played a special role in
the cultural sphere.
In recent years the Paris arts scene has experienced an extraordinary burst
of energy, fuelled by the support of the socialist government which, under
Jack Lang, its long-serving arts minister and a close associate of President
Mitterrand, has invested heavily in the arts.
Jack Lang sees the investment in the arts not only as a lynchpin of the
government's attempts to safeguard France's cultural heritage, but also as
an economic catalyst, to boost tourism and create jobs within the arts
industry. Critically he has persuaded the president, and rest of the French
government, to agree.
During Jack Lang's nine years at the arts ministry, 'l'epoque Lang,' as
Liberation calls it, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the
arts has more than doubled to just under 1 per cent, or FFr13bn. A large
chunk of this money has been lavished on Paris. At a time when many of
London's main monuments are shrouded by protective plastic and the British
government dithers over whether or not it can afford to restore them, the
French capital has been engaged in an unprecedentedly ambitious programme of
architectural construction and renovation.
The Grands Projets, which President Mitterrand has presented as a testimony
to the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution - but his critics see as
megalomaniacal monuments to himself - have left Paris with a new opera house
at Bastille, a science museum at La Villette, an Arabic cultural centre
beside the Seine, a triumphal arch at La Defense and a glacial pyramid in
the middle of the Louvre museum.
Add to this the opening of the Musee D'Orsay, the Louvre restoration scheme,
the Jeu de Paume's metamorphosis into a contemporary arts museum, the
renovation of the Tuileries and Palais Royal gardens, the regilding of all
the prominent statues in the city and you get some idea of the scale of Jack
Lang's legacy to the French capital.
These programmes have been accompanied by a lower profile, but no less
influential, policy of arts subsidy. The French government's film funding
strategy has turned Paris into the centre of European cinema. A number of
large French companies, the Canal Plus television group and the Bouygues
construction empire, have set up film production subsidiaries. This has
created a sprawling satellite sector of film lawyers, set designers,
distributors, make-up artists and agents, all based in Paris, to service the
cinema industry.
Sometimes it seems as though nothing escapes the eagle-eyed arts minister.
One group of self-avowedly avant garde artists, who were working from the
derelict L'Hopital Ephemere in the groovy Pigalle district were startled to
see their alternative credentials shattered when they became the recipients
of an unsolicited subsidy from Mr Lang.
L'Epoque Lang has not been universally successful. The opera is a constant
bone of contention. The opulent old Paris Opera house had lost its stature
in the musical world long before President Mitterrand and his energetic arts
minister arrived on the scene. The FFr700m new Opera de Bastille was their
solution. It was to be a 'people's opera' with a state-of-the-art
auditorium, cheap seats and wonderful music. Instead, the Opera de Bastille
has been plagued by the same union problems - and the same customer
complaints about high prices and intermittent strikes - as the old opera
house. It has also been clouded by controversy over the firing four years
ago of Daniel Barenboim, its first artistic director, and more recently the
resignation of Philippe Belaval as director general following a tragic
accident in Seville when a set collapsed killing one member of the chorus
and injuring 30 others. Meanwhile the old opera house has been reduced to
staging ballet and occasional showings of vintage Hollywood musicals.
Jack Lang's critics have revelled in the melodramas of the opera world. They
see the flamboyant arts minister, with his penchant for graffiti art and
Thierry Mugler suits, as the epitome of the sybaritic socialists, la gauche
caviare, who have swept to power in the Mitterrand era. They also see him as
a presidential poodle and a fritterer of public funds.
Chief among the critics is Jacques Chirac, one-time prime minister, would-be
president and now mayor of Paris. The battles between the arts minister, in
his meticulously restored offices in the heart of the lovely Palais Royal,
and the mayor of Paris, in his Disneyesque headquarters at Hotel de Ville,
have added a definite frisson to the Paris arts scene of the 1980s and early
1990s.
The latest row is over the new Bibliotheque de France, the national library
otherwise known as the Tres Grande Bibliotheque, now being built with
government money on a patch of land owned by the Continued on next page
Lively arts scene Continued from previous page
city council near Gare d'Austerlitz. Jacques Chirac has done everything he
can to stop the project. He has criticised the design, a series of glazed
glass towers conceived by the 39-year-old architect, Dominique Perrault. He
has even threatened to take back the land.
The Tres Grande Bibliotheque is going ahead, albeit with a modified design,
thanks to the constant complaints of the Paris mayor and the 200 academics
who petitioned President Mitterrand claiming that the original building
would have toasted France's academic treasures.
The battles between the mayor and the arts minister almost always make
entertaining spectator sport. They also work to the art lover's advantage in
that one of Jacques Chirac's main tactics - vocal though he has been in
attacking Jack Lang's alleged extravagance - is to invest in the city of
Paris' own ambitious arts schemes.
One of the best examples is in modern art, where the city council has spent
heavily to turn its Art Deco edifice, the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de
Paris (MAM), at Iena, into a serious competitor to the government-funded
Centre Georges Pompidou.
Four years ago MAM appointed a new director, Suzanne Page, who has turned
the museum into one of Europe's liveliest contemporary art centres by
concentrating on the recent work, notably conceptual art, that the more
conventional Pompidou curators ignored.
MAM has since become an unquestionable success with Jacques Chirac and the
city council basking in its reflected glory. Meanwhile Jack Lang, always
anxious to preserve his reputation as France's grooviest politician, has
decided that Paris did not have enough space for contemporary art. He has
turned the Jeu de Paume - originally the royal tennis court in the Tuileries
Gardens and later the shabby, but evocative Impressionist museum - into a
new contemporary art gallery.
The Jeu de Paume has since shown a series of sensational exhibitions. The
MAM programme is as innovative as ever and the Pompidou Centre has drafted
in a new director, Dominique Bozo, with a brief to liven it up. There is
more modern art to see, and more galleries to visit, in Paris than ever
before. Long may hostilities go on.

WHEN the shiny new Opera Bastille flung open its doors on the Place de la
Bastille in 1990, it was supposed to herald a new era for the Paris music
scene by offering opera for the people, with cheap seats, state-of-the-art
accoustics and marvellous music.
Unfortunately for the city's opera lovers, the Opera Bastille has not turned
out quite as the French government expected. The government may have lashed
out on a swanky new opera house, with all the requisite technology, but it
made the fatal mistake of transferring the old union agreements that had
wrecked the old Opera, now limited to ballet, to the new one.
The new Opera Bastille has never been far from controversy. There was the
row four years ago when Daniel Barenboim, the temperamental conductor, was
fired as artistic director and the recent rumpus over the Philippe Belaval's
fiery resignation as director general.
But the accoustics are great and the programme devised by Myung Whun Chung,
the new artistic director, is now, or so Parisian opera buffs boast, among
the best in Europe. The only hitch for the visitor is buying a ticket. Most
of the Opera Bastille seats are snapped up in advance. Your best bet is to
try to get tickets through the hotel, or to see if they can recommend a
nearby booking agency.
If the opera is sold out, there are always dozens of classical concerts to
choose from. The most picturesque venues are the big churches. The eglise de
la Madeleine near the old Opera is a stunning church with wonderful sound,
as is eglise Saint-Eustache at the back of the Les Halles complex.
If you want to go for a walk after the concert, the Eglise Saint Germain des
Pres in the heart of the Left Bank, or Eglise Saint-Louis-en-l'Ile on the
lovely Ile Saint-Louis, should appeal as should the little Sainte-Chapelle
on the Ile de la Cite.
Paris is paradise for any jazz fan. Modern jazz has been a pivotal part of
the city's cultural agenda since the 1950s when the French existentialists
recognised the importance of musicians like Charlie Parker and Miles Davis,
long before their counterparts in the US.
Details of the week's jazz sessions, like classical concerts, are all
published in the listings magazines, Pariscope and L'Officiel des
Spectacles. Although the established clubs, such as New Morning on the rue
des Petites-Ecuries or Cafe de la Plage on rue de Charonne, can usually be
relied on to have good line-ups.
As for rock, this is one area where the French, for all their success in
other arts spheres, have never really cut it. France is, after all, the land
of anodyne Europop. Rarely a week goes by without Paris-Match magazine
regaling its readers with the latest adventure, or misadventure of the
ageing 1950s vedette, Johnny Hallyday.
All the big American and European rock acts come to Paris generally to play
at the amorphous - and expensive - Omnisport Bercy stadium, or, if you're
lucky, La Cigale, a wonderful old vaudeville house. If you want to see the
stars off stage you should pop along to Les Bains, the night club, where
they almost always turn up - complete with their troops of black
leather-clad bodyguards - after the show.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (18): A haven for gourmets -
Food and wine shopping / cheese, fish, bread, meat, wine, chocolate, coffee,
tea - you name it - there are specialist shops for almost everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FOOD is one of those things that the French take seriously
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
very, very seriously indeed. Parisian street markets are crammed with
customers peering judiciously to make sure that the peaches, or parsnips,
they have chosen are of the very best quality. Every Parisian has a
favourite fromager, cheese specialist, or poissonnier, fishmonger. The
snooty Gault Millau guide to the creme de la creme of Paris devotes as many
pages to food shops, as to clothes or hotels.
So, if you are prepared to plough through the traffic to farflung 20th
arrondissement to pick up your raisan bread fresh from the oven at Bernard
Ganachaud and then trek back to Creplet-Brussol on the place de la Madeleine
to buy the very best butter to smear on it, Paris is the place for you.
There are, of course, easier ways to shop for food in Paris. The easiest of
all is to find an epicerie fine with a wide range of goods. Fauchon has been
selling gourmet groceries on place de la Madeleine for over a century. The
store, which not only sprawls across several floors, but also different
buildings, is so packed with Japanese tourists that it sometimes seems more
like a tourist attraction than a shop.
But the quality and quantity of Fauchon's stock, with its range of 4,500
spices and penchant for very rare delicacies, is as high as ever, making it
well worth trekking around and teetering out ladened with its brown and
white carrier bags. It also has the inestimable advantage of a private
parking service which is a godsend, as anyone who has ever tried - and tired
 -to find a parking space in central Paris will attest.
Alternatively, you could pop into one of the Fouquet shops, on rue Lafitte
or rue Francois-Ier, which also sell a wide range of food but are
particularly tempting for their chocolates, or into the quaint, old Faguais
on rue La Tremoille, famous for its jams, honeys and freshly roasted coffee.
As for food specialists, Paris is packed with them. Gault Millau has a
lengthy lists of shops specialising in everything from tea to truffles.
The bustling Marks and Spencer store on boulevard Haussmann even merits a
mention in its 'Ethnic' section scoring high marks for its 'meaty, smokey'
bacon with 'no nasty bits of bone' and for providing 'ample evidence that
British gastronomy is not, as Parisians tend to think, a joke.'
Tasty though M and S's bacon may be, the ingredients of a British breakfast
tend not to be high on any foodie's Parisian shopping list. Wine, however,
comes close to the top and the present plight of the French wine industry
means that there are lots of bargains to be found.
The best sources of really good wines at low prices are the French
hypermarkets, Carrefour and Auchan, both of which have branches on the
outskirts of Paris.
Until recently, French wine distributors, the negociants, were too snooty to
sell to hypermarkets, but the recent fall in prices and the decline in their
export markets, means they no longer have a choice.
Some negociants sell directly to hypermarkets. Others have dumped
consignments of wine sent back from depressed export markets such as the US.
Stories of people picking up 1988 or 1989 Grands Crus Classes - sometimes
still bearing their US Customs labels - for a song are standard fodder at
Paris dinner parties.
If bargain hunting at the hypermarkets does not appeal, there are lots of
excellent wine shops in the city. Legrand Filles et Fils in Galerie Vivienne
by the Banque de France is a lovely, old-fashioned shop full of interesting
French country wines and the very best Bordeaux and Burgundies. There is
also a tiny epicerie fine with a good selection of coffee and chocolates at
the back.
Caves de la Madeleine on rue Royale also offers a wide selection of French
wines. Unusually for a Paris wine shops, it is run by a Briton, Steven
Spurrier, who still scrutinises every wine himself.
Au Verger de la Madeleine on the nearby boulevard Malesherbes is renowned
for its very rare, very expensive cognacs and for first growth Bordeaux.
Vins Rares et de Collection-Thustrup further out of the centre on rue
Laugier in the 17th arrondissement is famous for antique Yquem, Petrus and
Mouton-Rothschild.
Cheese is another staple souvenir. Most quartiers have their own fromagers,
many of them excellent. But there is also an elite band of really good
cheese shops to which fromage fiends flock from all over the city.
Alain Dubois on rue de Toqueville in the 17th is renowned for his Gruyere
and also has the kudos of supplying many of the smartest Paris restaurants,
including Lucas-Carton and Guy Savoy. Lecomte on the Ile Saint-Louis has a
huge selection of cream and goats cheese.
Specialites Fromageres on rue de Grenelle selects cheeses from farms all
over France. While Creplet-Brussol on place de la Madeleine is the place to
go for Camembert and Brillat-Savarin, as well as for butter and cream.
Chocaholics should head for the aptly-named La Maison du Chocolat on rue
Francois-Ier for its classic chocs with buttercream fillings or to Peltier
on rue de Sevres for palets d'or, dark chocolates with buttercream centres
garnished with gold leaf. Christian Constant on rue du Bac is on the cutting
edge of Parisian chocolate-making with funky shapes and innovations such as
his 80 per cent cocoa bar. But traditionalists will probably prefer the old
fashioned grandeur of Debauve et Gallais on rue des Saints-Peres where the
chocolates taste as good as the 19th century shop (now a Beaux Arts
landmark) looks.
CAFFEINE addicts can choose from the world's best coffee beans at Verlet on
rue Saint-Honore, where you can taste the house blends and exotic imported
beans before you buy. Brulerie des Ternes on rue Poncelet is also noted for
its blends and records the details of each customer's choice on a computer.
L'Espace Cafe on boulevard de Charonne is even more futuristic. Its computer
produces a 'sensorial analysis' of each customer to identify the blend that
bests suits their personality.
Paris also has a coterie of tea specialists, despite the dreadful French
habit of making tea by dangling tea bags into cups of hot, or tepid, water.
Perhaps the prettiest tea shop is Mariage Freres on rue du Bourg-Thibourg in
the Marais, which boasts 350 different teas from 30 countries, every tea pot
you can imagine, a tea room, where you can sample its wares, and even a tiny
tea museum.
Finally, if you fancy some really smart pots and pans to go with your newly
purchased ingredients, you should browse around the specialist catering
equipment suppliers at the back of Les Halles. Mora on rue Montmartre prides
itself on selling even the most esoteric kitchen utensils. But the most
famous of all is Dehillerin on nearby rue Coquilliere, which has been a
treasure trove of copper pots and kitchen knives since 1820.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (19): Saying it with flowers -
The smart flower shops of Paris are surprisingly inexpensive, at least
compared with the markets and street stalls which often charge high prices
for indifferent blooms
</HEADLINE>

ON almost every day of his adult life Marcel Proust called in at Lachaume,
the flower shop on rue Royale, to pick out a fresh orchid for his
buttonhole.
Lachaume has been selling flowers since the 1840s and is still one of Paris'
most famous florists today. Flower lovers with less traditional taste may
prefer to call in at Christian Tortu on rue Saint-Florentin and the
carrefour de l'Odeon, where he sculpts flowers, mosses and foliage into
bizarre, abstract shapes. Jean Vassal on rue du Bac is somewhere between the
two styles, with carefully structured concoctions of traditional blooms.
My favourite florist is Moulie-Savart on place du Palais Bourbon, a lovely
old-fashioned flower shop with big bunches of rustic blooms and glossy,
green leaves. Christian Lacroix, the fashion designer, buys his flowers here
 -in the same colours as his collections - as does Paris Vogue, which has
offices a few doors along on place du Palais-Bourbon.
Even the smallest Parisian florists wrap flowers beautifully in swathes of
cellophane tied with ribbon. The smart shops are surprisingly inexpensive,
at least compared to the markets and street stalls which often charge hefty
prices. The Marche aux Fleurs on the Ile de la Cite is lauded in the tourist
guides, but is actually rather dull with very high prices.
The smaller flower markets at place de la Madeleine and place des Ternes are
usually more appealing with a more imaginative selection and reasonable
prices. The Marche aux Ternes is open until quite late in the evening so, if
you need to pick up a posy or bouquet on your way to dinner, it is usually
worth considering a detour.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (16): Delight for shopaholics
 -Paris shops are best known for the sort of self-indulgent items sold at
Chanel. But one of the most appealing aspects of the city is the variety of
small shops in almost every area
</HEADLINE>

THERE was a time in the mid-1980s when so many Japanese tourists flocked
into the Chanel shop on rue Cambon to buy classic quilted leather bags that
Chanel was forced to ration them to no more than three per person. Unabashed
the Japanese lurked outside and bribed passing Parisians to go in and buy
more bags for them.
Those days are over. The Japanese economy is no longer strong enough to
allow its foreign travellers to indulge in conspicuous consumption on quite
so grand a scale and the franc is now so high against other currencies that
even the most ardent shopaholics are a little more abstemious during their
trips to Paris. But shopping is still part and parcel of any visit to the
city as you can tell from the bundles of shiny carrier bags at the Charles
de Gaulle check-in desks.
Paris shops are, of course, best known for the sort of self-indulgent items
sold at Chanel. But one of the most appealing aspects of the city is the
variety of small shops in almost every area. You can find fishmongers,
florists, greengrocers and, of course, patisseries in even the most
expensive quartiers, along the winding streets of the Ile Saint-Louis, or
off the glossy avenue Montaigne.
This is because French property regulations were devised specifically to
ensure that independent shops can stay in business and that every area has a
mix of both residential and commercial property, with enough small
businesses to service the local community.
That said, different quartiers have developed their own specialities over
the years. The tiny rue Pont Louis-Philippe running from the Marais down to
the river is packed with tiny papeteries, selling everything from hand made
pencils, to rough hewn Japanese paper. Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau at the back
of Les Halles is crammed with specialist foie gras sellers. Place Vendome is
the historic home of France's fine jewellers with Mauboussin, Cartier,
Boucheron, Mellerio dits Meller and Van Cleef et Arpels all a stone's throw
away from the Ritz.
Any fashion fiend visiting Paris should head straight for avenue Montaigne
or rue Faubourg Saint-Honore where most of the main designers have their
flagship stores, often beneath the haute couture salons where their very
wealthy clients go for their fittings.
Avenue Montaigne is one of the world's most elegant shopping streets, with
its wide tree-lined pavements and its opulent stores selling the classic
clothes beloved of hauts bourgeois Parisians.
The main Christian Dior store is here - with everything from furs, to
signature tea-towels - as are Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent (just around
the corner on Avenue Marceau, and the Paris branch of Harry Winston, the
American jeweller where Elizabeth Taylor likes to buy her glitzy
nuckledusters.
Chanel and Christian Lacroix both have 'satellite' shops on avenue
Montaigne, but their flagship stores, and couture salons, are in the
Saint-Honore area. Lacroix, who five years ago set up the first new Paris
couture house for over a decade, drafted in Garouste and Bonetti, two of the
funkiest French interior designers, to deck out his store in vivid pinks and
oranges.
Chanel on rue Cambon favours the more subdued style of its classic black and
white, with a brace of uniformed guards to open and close the doors for you
as you stagger out with your booty. Karl Lagerfeld, the German designer
behind Chanel, has his own shop a little further along rue Saint-Honore with
Chloe, another of his labels, just across the street.
GUCCI, under Dawn Mello its new design director, sells its contemporary
classic fashion and leather on rue Saint-Honore. But, if you are in the mood
for the more opulent side of Italian style, go to gawp at the Disneyesque
baroque that Gianni Versace has brought all the way from Milan to Paris.
The best area for men's fashion is around place des Victoires, where Yohji
Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Claude Montana, Marithe et
Francois Girbaud, Kenzo and Agnes B. all have shops for both sexes. Remember
to look in at A Priori The, a pretty tea room with delicious tartes and
cakes under the glazed roof of the 19th century Galerie Vivienne, just
around the corner from Montana and Gaultier.
It is also worth checking out the shops in the Marais district. Romeo Gigli,
the Italian designer, has a breathtakingly beautiful store in a converted
printshop on rue de Sevigne. The courtyard is lit by scented candles in
terracotta tubs on dark winter afternoons.
Miller et Bertaux sell their own functional clothes, as well as an
idiosyncratic assortment of ethnic and artisanal objects, from their shop on
rue Ferdinand Duval. Meanwhile Azzedine Alaia serves his super-model
clientele from his new store and studio on rue de Moussy.
Anyone interested in seeing the latest looks from the funky, young European
designers should go to L'Eclaireur on rue de Rosiers where Martin Margiela,
Ann Demeulemeester, Vivienne Westwood and Dolce e Gabanna are all on sale.
Then you can sink into one of the shabby chic armchairs, while tucking into
a delicious slab of cake, at Le Loit dans La Theiere, the nearby salon du
the.
Shoe buffs should cross the river to Saint-Germain to scour the streets
around the carrefour de la Croix Rouge. Stephane Kelian sells its
contemporary classic French footwear from rue de Grenelle, as does Michel
Perry with his wittily pretty mules and platforms, a little further along
the street.
Robert Clergerie, another contemporary classic French shoe designer, is on
rue du Cherche Midi, together with Fausto Santini, which is full of funky
urban Italian styles.
But the creme de la creme of French leather goods lies back across the river
on rue Faubourg Saint-Honore. Hermes is the place to buy leather and silk in
Paris.
The Hermes store may be packed with Japanese tourists, but nothing could be
more Parisienne than splashing out on a classic Hermes Kelly bag, which
costs as much as a Chanel suit, takes 20 hours - and a lot of skill - to
make by hand and will last a lifetime.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (17): Happy hunting grounds -
Antiques / Apart from specialist dealers, the flea markets sell authentic,
and lots of not-so-authentic, antiques every weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
WHENEVER the home of a prominent Parisian artist, or architect, is featured
in a glossy interior design magazine, it is almost always crammed with the
very chic antiques that the owner claims to have picked up for a pittance at
the Marches aux Puces.
The Puces are the flea markets that sell authentic, and not so authentic
antiques every weekend on the fringes of central Paris. Like flea markets
everywhere else they vary enormously in the quality - and price - of their
wares. But the Puces are a Parisian institution. Anyone even remotely
interested in antiques, and even serious collectors, scours them from time
to time.
The biggest and best known of the Puces is the flea market at Saint-Ouen, by
Porte de Clignancourt, every Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Saint-Ouen,
actually a combination of five different markets, is vast with different
areas devoted to antique clothes, African art and furniture as well as a
'modern' section selling everything from t-shirts to mobile telephones.
There is lots of junk on sale but it is worth seeking out the really good
stalls, many of them owned by dealers with shops elsewhere in the city.
Marche de Vanves, to the south of the centre, is smaller and quieter than
Saint-Ouen. Its stalls, mainly selling small pieces of furniture and
bric-a-brac, spill out on to the streets on Saturday and Sunday. There is
also a section where artists sell their paintings, sculpture and jewellery.
Vanves is just as crowded as Saint-Ouen and if you want to find a real
bargain at either market you have to go early in the morning. And whenever
you turn up you must be willing to haggle.
Anyone who prefers to go antique searching in more serene surroundings
should head for one of the Paris antiques centres. The best of all is
undoubtedly Le Louvre des Antiquaires, a treasure trove for any antiques
buff with 250 dealers filling three floors of the old Magasins du Louvre
department store opposite the Louvre itself.
Village Saint-Paul is a smaller, less grand antiques centre in the area
between rue Saint-Paul and rue Charlemagne, just south of the Marais. If you
want to browse, head also for Saint-Germain des Pres, where the tiny streets
running down to the river between rue de Seine and rue du Bac are crammed
with antique shops.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (14): Try the new wines -
Competition among the wine bars has hotted up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH will probably never forgive them for the congenital misfortune of
being British, but even the snooty Gault Millau guide has been forced to
admit, albeit very grudgingly, that Mark Williamson and Tim Johnstone run
one of the very best wine bars in Paris.
Willi's, their wine bar, on rue des Petits-Champs between the Bibliotheque
Nationale and the Palais Royal is now a firm fixture on the Parisian wine
scene.
Williamson and Johnstone, both of whom worked in the English wine trade
before setting up Willi's in 1980, scour the Rhone valley, Bourdeaux and
vineyards in further flung places, California, Australia and even Italy, for
new wines.
At first glance it looks as though they must have been crazy - to think that
the French would buy wine, and even food, from two Brits. But Tim Johnstone
says that when they hatched their original plan to open Willi's in the late
1970s, they were convinced there was a gap in the market - 'at the time
there just weren't any really good wine bars around,' he says.
Times have changed and competition has hotted up. Nicolas, the chain of wine
shops, has opened a string of L'Ecluse wine bars all over the city. L'Ecluse
specialises in Bourdeaux wines, selling everything up to Grands Crus, and
serves perfectly palatable salads, fish dishes, foie gras and San Daniele.
L'Ecluse is a chain, but its choice of prettily renovated bistros, means
that it avoids the antiseptic feel of most of the 'corporate' cafes in
Paris. Its wine bars are also among the few places where it is really nice
to eat in the very touristy areas, such as the one on quai des
Grands-Augustins along the Left Bank by place Saint-Michel.
Anyone with more traditional taste should head for Le Rallye on rue Daguerre
in the 14th arrondissement, which has been in the hands of the Peret family
for three generations, and does, or so they say, sell the best Beaujolais in
Paris with a choice of 200 bottles.
Devotees of Loire wines may prefer La Cafe de la Nouvelle Marie on rue des
Fosses-Saint-Jacques by the Sorbonne, where you can sit out in the leafy
square on sunny days. La Sancerre on avenue Rapp by the Eiffel Tower
specialises, as its name suggests, in Sancerre wines.
La Cloche des Halles on rue Coquilliere by the Les Halles shopping centre is
a classic bustling bistro, packed with chattering Parisians which serves
hearty food and good wines, bottled on the premises. Meanwhile Le Forum on
boulevard Malesherbes by the Madeleine is the classic Parisian bar with its
Art Deco decor, little plates of olives and nuts, a choice of 150 (killer)
cocktails and its very enigmatic clientele.
La Cloche and Le Forum are favourite haunts of the Willi's team, Mark
Williamson and Tim Johnstone, when they are checking out the competition.
Johnstone also recommends Ange Vin on rue Richard Lenoir in the Bastille
district for 'really good, very cheap wines' and 'a cheerful atmosphere', or
Le Moulin a Vin on rue Burq, north of the Pigalle sex district, which he
describes as 'a funky place with down-to-earth food and a good choice of
wine.'

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (15): Where to dance the night
away - Parisian nightclubs slide in and out of fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the early hours of every morning a gaggle of people gathers on rue du
Bourg-l'Abbe, a narrow street among the fashion showrooms and sweat shops of
Sentier, the rag trade area of central Paris.
They queue there morning after morning, whatever the weather, to try to get
into Les Bains, the night club that has for years dominated the Parisian
night scene. Any truly fashionable Parisian will roll their eyes at the
mention of Les Bains, mutter something about it being passe and advise you
to go to one of the mercurial one-nighters that are held in different venues
all over the city.
Passe or not, other clubs open and close in Paris, but Les Bains goes on. It
is still the place that Chanel chooses for its fashion parties, where the
fashion industry holds the Venus awards (the fashion designers' own prizes
for each season's collections) and where Roman Polanski, and almost every
other fashionable film director, hold their post-premiere parties.
No-one with any sense would go to Les Bains to dance. The dancefloor is tiny
with a distractingly low ceiling and Parisians, who tend to be as aggressive
about staking their claim on the dance floor as about poaching parking
spaces, have very sharp elbows. The music at Les Bains is satisfactory, but
not sensational. The Folies Pigalle, the hastily converted music hall on
place Pigalle, has a bigger and better dance floor as does la Locomotive,
the triple-storey club on boulevard de Clichy, which also has far funkier
music.
Nor would anyone choose Les Bains for its food, its drink (both predictably
over-priced) or even its decor, which, with its video monitors and shabby
chic seats looks like any one of half a dozen Manhattan night clubs.
Although Les Bains does score high aesthetic points for the ceiling of its
(unisex) toilets upstairs, a sea of pink plastic roses, tres Jeff Koons.
But Les Bains, like all really long-lasting night clubs, comes top of the
class for voyeurism. It is probably still the only place in Paris where you
are virtually guaranteed to see a sprinkling of super-models, fashion
designers, film directors and visiting American movie stars (Sylvester
Stallone turned up with a posse of black leather-clad body guards) on any
one night among the army of suburbanites on the dancefloor.
OTHER clubs flicker in and out of fashion. Niel's, which opened last autumn
on avenue des Ternes, is popular with the film crowd, as is Le Comptoir on
rue Vauvilliers beside Les Halles centre with the fashion scene.
But people still queue on rue Bourg-l'Abee. The only hitch is getting in.
One of the ruses with which Les Bains, like all really longlasting night
clubs, has protected its reputation is by operating a supremely snobby door
policy. Night after night, or, more accurately morning after morning, there
are humiliating scenes as people plead with Marilyn, the formidable door
person, to be allowed in.
There is a simple solution. If your idea of a fun night out in Paris does
not include shivering on the pavement outside a night club that you may or
may not eventually be allowed to go in to, then telephone Les Bains on 4887
0180, and book a table at the restaurant. You can then sail past Marilyn and
eat your meal before fighting for a few spare square inches on the Les Bains
dance floor.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (13): Golden rules - Business
etiquette, introductory lunches play a pivotal part in forging corporate
liaisons and doing deals. But the social side of business still has a
special salience.
</HEADLINE>

WHEN Bernard Arnault, one of France's most ambitious businessman, arrived at
Christian Dior, the fashion house he bought in the mid-1980s, he was asked
out to lunch by one of his new colleagues.
'Why?' replied Mr Arnault. 'What would we have to talk about?'
The story may be apocryphal - most stories about Mr Arnault are - but the
incredulity with which it is still repeated in Paris business circles serves
to highlight the importance of that most sacrosanct of France's corporate
rituals, le dejeuner, otherwise known as lunch.
In a city where whom you know or, more specifically, who graduated with you
from your Haute Ecole, is just as important as what you know, the social
side of business still has a special salience. Lunches play a pivotal part
in forging corporate liaisons and doing deals.
But unfortunately for the foreign visitor to Paris, the written and
unwritten rules on what you should and should not say over the lunchtable
are not only very strict, but incredibly complicated.
The golden rule to remember is that no-one ever, ever actually dirties their
hands by doing business during lunch. Broadly speaking there are three types
of business lunches.
The first, which appears wantonly time-wasting to Anglo-Saxon eyes, is the
'introductory' meal at which you make contact with someone with whom you
might want to do business in the future, but at which you would not dream of
discussing anything concrete.
The second lunch is more constructive. This is the type of meal at which a
new venture may be discussed although, yet again, no-one in Paris would ever
expect to actually clinch a deal over the lunchtable. If the time has come
to sign on the dotted line, you will have to wait until you go back to the
office after the meal. You can then move on to the third and final form of
dejeuner, celebrating a deal that has already been done.
The only time you are expected to talk about business is during dessert. In
the meantime you are allowed to discourse on everything from world affairs,
to the state of the European economy and the latest amours of the Monegasque
royal family (whom the French generally find more interesting than the
British equivalent) - anything in fact but the reason for the lunch.
Finally, you have to brace yourself for a lengthy lunch in Paris - two hours
is the absolute minimum, three is generally seen as more polite - and also
for an assault on the arteries.
Four courses - hors d'oeuvre, plat du jour, cheese and dessert with coffee -
are the norm, although it is just permissible to skip the cheese and get
straight down to business.
As for the delicate question of language. The French business elite is in a
cosmopolitan mode at the moment. Most senior executives speak at least one
other language, usually English, reasonably fluently, and possibly two or
three others. However ropey your French it is always considered courteous to
at least try to speak it to your new contacts, even if you do breathe a deep
sigh of relief when they break into your own tongue.
The English are at a distinct advantage in that the French language
apparently sounds particularly charming when spoken with an English accent,
just as English does when spoken by the French. The poor Spaniards lose out,
as French is said to sound particularly harsh when spoken with Spanish
tones.
But wherever you come from, you must never forget that it is very rude to
call your new French contact tu, unless they invite you to do so first.
In the meantime, you should always use the formal vous.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (11): An endangered species -
Traditional cafes / These familiar French institutions are closing at the
rate of 5,000 a year and the more famous survivors have become objects of
nostalgic fascination for tourists

WHENEVER the French newspapers, or television news crews, are short of a
story they rush off to one of the tiny tabac bars, the cafes au coin along
the Parisian back streets, dust down a few Robert Doisneau photographs, and
publish yet another obituary of the cafe.
The French cafe, with its prim patronne and zinc comptoir, is an endangered
species. There are now only 70,000 cafes in France, compared with 510,000 in
their early 1900s heyday. The decline continues with at least 5,000 more
cafes closing each year.
The cafe au coin is a victim of modernity. Almost every innovation in the
20th century has hit it in one way or another. The decline of heavy industry
has taken a toll on its blue collar clientele. The spread of takeaway sushi
bars means that fewer Parisians pop out for snacks at their local cafes.
Rising living standards have made cafe staff far stroppier about working
long hours for low pay.
Anyone who cherishes the idea of reliving one of Doisneau's 1950s cafe
scenes on their next visit to Paris is probably doomed to disappointment.
The grand cafes, Aux Deux Magots on boulevard Saint-Germain and the Cafe de
la Paix on boulevard Haussmann by the Opera, are now teeming with tourists
and most of the cafes aux coins, once Art Nouveau idylls, are smoke-filled
monuments to 1960s retail redesign with vinegary vins and formica-like food.
There are still a few really pretty cafes with authentic interiors dotted
around the city, although they have probably survived by accident rather
than design. Le Cochon a l'Oreille on rue Montmartre has weathered the
disappearance of its original customers, the workers from the nearby Les
Halles fruit and vegetable market. It now serves basic, but tasty bistro
fare from its sumptuous ceramic-lined interior to the new community of
office workers, and journalists who have converged on Les Halles.
The tiny cafe-tabac a few streets away on the corner of place des
Petits-Peres at the back of place des Victoires, serves even simpler fare.
But it does sell reasonable wines and excellent espresso from an unspoilt
Art Nouveau interior. There is also a sprinkling of pleasant cafes and bars
along rue Vieille du Temple in the Marais and on the side streets straddling
rue de l'Universite in Saint-Germain.
If you still long to while away an hour over a cafe-creme at a grand
Parisian cafe, the best choice is Cafe de Flore on boulevard Saint-Germain.
Cafe de Flore's coffee and carpaccio are delicious, and there are not quite
so many tourists as at Aux Deux Magots a few doors away.
Alternatively you could plump for one of dozens of salons du the that have
popped up across Paris in recent years. The rise of the salons du the is one
of the main reasons for the demise of the Parisian cafe, as they tend to
offer fresher food - generally salads, tartes and cakes - in prettier
surroundings than the traditional cafes au coin.
A Priori The in the lovely old Galerie Vivienne by place des Victoires is an
excellent example, with delicious salads and tartes, served on simple wooden
tables with pretty wicker chairs. The best tables are outside on the mosaic
floor of the galerie, where you can watch the sunlight shafting through the
glazed roof in the summer, or, if you are very lucky, snowflakes settling on
snowy winter days. The only hitch is that A Priori The is packed every
lunchtime - so arrive early.
Tea Follies on place Gustave-Toudouze just below Pigalle is another classic
Parisian tea room serving traditional teas with scones, laced with local
delicacies such as its delicious savoury tarts and chicken pies. Le Loir
dans la Theiere is another old-fashioned tea room on rue des Rosiers in the
heart of the Marais, where you can sink down into the battered armchairs to
choose from a delicious selection of cakes, salads and tartes (the
pascualina spinach tarte is the house speciality) among its Alice in
Wonderland wall murals.
If you are in too much of a hurry to contemplate languishing at a cafe, the
best places in Paris for really speedy snacks are the branches of Lina's,
the chain of deluxe sandwich bars, on rue Etienne Marcel along from Place
des Victoires, on rue Marboeuf off the avenue Champs-Elysees and on the
third floor of the Galeries Lafayette department store.
The system of service at Lina's can seem a little bizarre to the
uninitiated. You queue at the counter to give your order to one of the
sandwich makers (most of whom seem to have been selected for their looks
rather than their skill at spreading moutarde on your jambon only to then
queue again to pay at the cashdesk. You then return to your original queue -
hopefully elbowing your way through to the front - to collect up your order
from the sandwich-maker.
It is all worthwhile. Lina's does make the very best sandwiches in Paris.
Its chunky pain pave is particularly tasty, especially when rounded off by
the house speciality, a Lina's chocolate brownie.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (12): From noodles to rice
dishes - Ethnic eating / The adventurous gourmet can find a bewildering
variety of national cuisines - from the numerous Japanese sushi bars to Thai
and Chinese establishments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF you wander along rue Sainte-Anne at the back of the Bibliotheque National
in the heart of Paris you could be forgiven for thinking that you were in
downtown Tokyo. Rue Sainte-Anne is the centre of the Japanese community in
Paris. The traditional bistros and tabac-bars which once filled the street,
and the tiny side streets around it, have been chased away by noodle and
sushi bars with brightly coloured neon signs glowing above their doors.
There are so many Japanese eateries to choose from on rue Sainte-Anne that
the sheer variety is bewildering. Most places are not really suitable for
formal business lunches or dinners, but they do make a cheap and tasty
alternative to the rich foie gras and compotier de boeuf of the classic
Parisian restaurants. Higuma, on rue Sainte-Anne itself, is one of the
liveliest and least expensive noodle bars. Matsuri Sushi on nearby rue
Richelieu dishes up traditional noodles from a rotating counter.
If you do like Japanese food, but would prefer to eat somewhere smarter,
Kinugawa, a few blocks away on rue Mont Thabor, is ideal. Kinugawa, which
sports one Michelin star, is one of the best, if not the best, Japanese
restaurants in Europe and is kitted out exactly like chic modern restaurants
in Tokyo or Osaka, with its electronic doors and pale wooden interior.
The real Kinugawa devotees, such as Kenzo, the Japanese fashion designer who
lives in Paris and owns Isse, the rue Sainte-Anne sushi house, eat at the
kitchen bar. But as well as the usual tables, Kinuagawa also has small rooms
set aside from the main restaurant upstairs for larger, and more discreet,
rendezvous. Kinugawa is, predictably, much more expensive than the cheerful
bars along rue Sainte-Anne. Whereas it is hard to spend more than FFr200 for
a meal for two at the Higuma noodle bar, dinner for two at Kinugawa will
cost around FFr900, with beer or sake.
Japanese food is not the only ethnic cuisine in Paris. The city is famous
for its North African restaurants, particularly its cous-cous houses. There
are cous-cous houses, of wildly varying quality, in most parts of Paris,
although the Belleville area is a good source of cheap Arabic food with some
well-established places, such as Mansouria on rue Faidherbe, which
specialises in Moroccan cuisine.
Timgad, one rue Brunel in the 17th arrondissement is one of the very few
North African restaurants to have been graced with a Michelin star. The
restaurant on the top floor of the Institut du Monde Arabe is also worth a
visit for its mix of Moroccan and European food and the wonderful view
across the Seine on to the right bank.
Belleville is also packed with Chinese restaurants, often huge dim sum
canteens, as well as places specialising in Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.
There is another sprinkling of cheap Chinese and Asian restaurants in the
13th arrondissement south of Austerlitz railway station.
The hitch is that neither Belleville, nor the 13th, are particularly
salubrious areas and are certainly not safe at night if you are alone. If
you are keen to try Asian cuisine while in Paris, but want to go somewhere
smarter, and safer, it is probably best to stick to the places in the centre
such as Tong Yen on rue Jean Mermoz off the Champs-Elysees where you can
choose from Chinese, Thai or Vietnamese dishes.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (8): Oozing opulence - The
Hotel de Crillon offers comfort, elegance and classical French style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE view across Place de la Concorde from the Hotel de Crillon is, or so
said Victor Hugo, the 19th century French writer, the most beautiful view in
the world.
Hugo, of course, saw the Place de la Concorde without all the cars and
coaches that honk their horns and belch out fumes around the obelisk today.
But the view from the suites along the Crillon's facade is still stunning
particularly at night when the 19th century lamps are lit and you can look
out over the trees of the Tuileries gardens to the giant clocks of Musee
d'Orsay on the other side of the Seine.
Even if you plump for a more modest room along the side of the hotel, the
Crillon positively oozes opulence. The whole hotel has been restored over
the past few years, from the sumptuous marble lobby with its forests of
flowers festooned on Louis XVI tables, to Jacques-Ange Gabriel's 18th
century facade.
The Crillon is still a very French establishment. Even the royal suites
along Place de la Concorde are small, certainly by American standards, and
there are none of the amenities, the multi-gyms or swimming pools, that a
Montana millionaire might expect from one of the very grandest European
hotels.
But the Crillon more than compensates with its glossy blend of icy elegance
and comfort, classical French style at its best. The rooms are decked out in
powder blue and white, with glacial glass chandeliers and gold leaf inlaid
in the woodwork. All the hardware that all too often messes up the
aesthetics of modern hotel rooms, including the mini bar, is discreetly
hidden away, although even the Crillon has yet to find a way of hiding the
black-clad bodyguards that hang out around the rooms of its
security-sensitive guests.
Best of all, the marble bathrooms are arranged in suites of tiny rooms, so
that the bath, bidet, shower and make-up area, are completely separate from
the bedrooms themselves. There are also walk-in wardrobes, with plenty of
drawers and hanging space, so that even the smallest rooms need never be
cluttered up by baggage, however long your stay. The staff even leave a
little weather guide by your bed each night with a forecast for the coming
day.
Foodies need not stir from the hotel. Les Ambassadeurs ranks as one of
Paris' finest restaurants thanks to Christian Constant's classic French
cuisine. It also has one of the most stunning settings, with its glowing
marble walls and the afternoon sun streaming in from Place de la Concorde.
L'Obelisque offers less formal fare from Andre Signoret's kitchens at the
Grand Vefour on Palais Royal, in its art nouveau-style restaurant, prettily
decorated in red velvet banquettes.
Hotel de Crillon, 10 Place de la
Concorde, 75008; tel: 4265 2424.
Rooms: FFr2,300 to FFr3,300.
Suites: FFr4,600 to FFr24,000.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (9): Book early for the very
best - Eating out / A really good restaurant is one of the treats of a visit
to Paris - but it can also be something of a trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH are appallingly snooty about everything to do with eating, from
the choice of restaurant, to the meal itself. Any three-star restaurant
worth its Michelin rosettes - such as Robuchon on rue de Longchamp, where
the chef, Joel Robuchon is famous for his experimentation, or the more
traditional Taillevent on rue Lamennais - is certain to be booked up for at
least a month in advance, particularly for dinner. So you must plan ahead
and make your reservation early.
Some of the sniffier Parisian eateries, such as Brasserie Lipp on boulevard
Saint-Germain, are so chauvinistic that they are wary of taking too may
bookings from foreigners. When you finally arrive at the restaurant of your
choice it is sure to be full of Parisians reminiscing about how the
(apparently faultless) food is not quite so good as it used to be.
There are, of course, lots of sources of advice as to where you might like
to eat in Paris. As any London restaurateur will tell you, the Michelin
tasters are rather more liberal about sprinkling their stars around France
than Britain. But the Michelin is still a reasonably good guide to the Paris
food scene. Gault Millau, the bible of the haut bourgeois and now available
in an English version, offers a much more acerbic - and entertaining -
analysis of where you should, or should not go, complete with marks out of
20 for each establishment.
In any case it would silly to miss out on the opportunity to eat really well
when in Paris. The food at the three-star restaurants is generally
sensational and the locations - L'Ambroisie hidden among its 17th century
arches in the heart of Le Marais, or Lucas-Carton with its Belle Epoque
interior - are often equally impressive.
There are also some jewels among the two-star places fighting for promotion.
Le Grand Vefour in Palais Royal has been a restaurant since the 18th century
 -Napoleon is said to have dined there with Josephine  - and has kept its
exquisite interior intact. Le Grand Vefour already has two stars and is
bidding for a third as is Guy Savoy on rue Troyon, which is run by one of
the most innovative of the younger Parisian chefs.
Any restaurant with two or three Michelin stars is sure to be suitable for
even the most formal business lunch. But the atmosphere at the very grand
Parisian restaurants often errs towards the staid, or stuffy. They do tend
to be treated as epicurean temples where poe-faced Parisians can entertain
their Japanese joint venture partners. They are also extremely expensive.
The bill for dinner for two at any restaurant with two or three stars can be
anything between FFr1,500 to FFr2,500 without wine.
If you prefer a less formal atmosphere, and are less inclined to torture
your bank balance, it is probably better to plump for a smaller, livelier
Parisian restaurant. L'Ami Louis on the winding rue Vertbois is one of the
oldest bistros in Paris with a delightful mottled mirrors and battered old
wooden furniture. The menu is classic French and rarely stints on the
cholesterol. The portions are huge, but generally delicious. The only hitch
is the winelist - exasperatingly long and very expensive.
Le Voltaire, on quai Voltaire in the heart of the Left Bank, is another must
for the traditionalists, particularly for any literature-buff as it is set,
as the name suggests, in the house where Voltaire lived and died. Chez
Pauline, on rue Villedo at the back of Palais Royal, is a pretty bistro -
always filled with flowers - where the chef produces contemporary versions
of traditional Lyonnaise dishes.
Benoit, a fin de siecle coaching inn at the Hotel de Ville end of rue Saint
Martin, serves up traditional bistro fare. Chez Georges on rue du Mail by
place des Victoires is another classic bistro, with hearty Lyonnaise fare.
It is best for lunch, when the tables are packed with chattering Parisians.
The atmosphere seems more antiseptic at dinner.
L'Ami Louis, Le Voltaire, Chez Pauline, Benoit and Chez Georges are all far
cheaper than their two and three-starred counterparts, but still cost
between FFr300 and FFr500 per person just for food. If you want to taste
classic Parisian cuisine, but are on a more limited budget, there are dozens
of good, cheap brasseries and bistros to choose from although the atmosphere
in these places is far less formal and they are not really appropriate for
business eating.
Aux Charpentiers on rue Mabillon is a good traditional bistro in
Saint-Germain and is always bustling with customers. Polidor on rue Monsieur
le Prince near Odeon serves tasty, traditional fare at student prices as
does Chez Paul on the corner of rue de Lappe and rue de la Charonne in the
Bastille district.
The old-fashioned station restaurants - the newly renovated Le Train Bleu
above Gare de Lyon and Terminus Nord at Gare du Nord - are still popular -
although the memory of their fin de siecle interiors fades fast,
particularly at night, when you walk out into the dirty, and potentially
dangerous, railway stations.
Paris is also full of restaurants with a more modern approach to cooking.
The craze for nouvelle cuisine that swept through the city in the early
1980s, has faded. However there are still some survivors such as La Maison
Blanche which offers a panoramic rooftop view through the huge windows of
its perch at the top of the Theatre des Champs Elysees at the bottom of
avenue Montaigne.
Finally, if you feel you fancy something simpler you could try Guen Mai on
rue de l'Abbaye by place Saint-Germain, one of the new wave of fashionable
macro-biotic restaurants now opening in Paris, which is easier on the
stomach - and the arteries.
Addresses and telephone numbers for all these restaurants are available from
the Paris telephone directory, Minitel, or the Michelin and Gault Millau
guides.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (7): Hotels to suit every
taste - Where to stay, whether your tastes are lavish or your budget is
strictly limited, the 1,400 hotels of Paris offer a wide choice
</HEADLINE>

ERNEST HEMINGWAY once said that he hoped heaven would be 'as good as the
Ritz.' He should have known. The all-American author headed straight for the
Hotel de Ritz on Place Vendome whenever he was in Paris, staying in one of
its swankiest suites and holding court night after night in the bar.
The Ritz returned the compliment by christening one of its bars, the
Hemingway, in deference to its loyal customer. The Hemingway Bar is still
there but the Ritz of today is very different from the hotel that played
host to Ernest Hemingway, with its bullet-proof windows overlooking the
Place Vendome, a baby jacuzzi in every room and a heliport on the roof.
All the really grand Paris hotels have stories to tell. It is impossible to
go into the Ritz without thinking of Hemingway reeling out of the bar, or of
Coco Chanel sneaking in with her Nazi lover during the war. The
Plaza-Athenee conjures images of Marlene Dietrich downing killer cocktails
at the gallery tables and the Grand Hotel of the Empress Eugenie sweeping in
for the gala opening with Pereire, the wily financier, by her side.
Each hotel has a different personality. The Plaza-Athenee is the prettiest,
and most intimate, the place where movie stars who really want to be alone
stay when they are in town. The Raphael, colonised by the arts crowd, is the
most decadent with a Turner in the lobby and opulent Oriental carpets
disappearing along dark, deep corridors.
Madonna, Michael Jackson and a caravanserai of Arab sheiks opt for the
classic French grandeur of the Crillon. The super-models seem to prefer
dodging the paparazzi from behind the bullet proof windows of the Ritz. The
Grand Hotel, now restored to its original Garnier grandeur, is for the
business community as are the Bristol and George V, which also sport troupes
of Japanese tourists munching lettuce leaves for breakfast in their opulent
restaurants.
The bill for any grand Parisian hotel tends to be pretty steep. The Bristol,
one of the most expensive of all, charges FFr5,900 to FFr10,900 a night for
suites and FFr2,300 to FFr3,900 for rooms (Tel. 4266 9145). Even the
Raphael, almost a snip compared to others in the luxury bracket, offers
suites from FFr2,700 to FFr6,400 and rooms from FFr1,600 to FFr2,200 (Tel.
4502 1600).
If your tastes are less lavish, or your budget does not quite stretch that
far, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the city, 1,400 to
be precise.
The Montalembert, just off rue du Bac in Saint Germain, is the most
successful of the recent breed of Paris 'designer' hotels. Christian
Liaigre, the architect, has spruced up the sandstone of the original
exterior and added brisk blue canopies. The interior has the same mix of the
classic and the contemporary with modernist furniture against sandstone
walls.
The rooms are compact, but comfortable and Liaigre has succeeded in escaping
the flakey feel of so many other 'designer' buildings flung up in the late
1980s by choosing natural woods and stones for his restrained designs. The
Montalembert is now a popular haunt for the fashion pack who can stroll over
the Seine for the pret a porter collections at the Louvre. (Hotel
Montalembert, tel. 4548 6811. Rooms from FFr1,450.)
L'Hotel on rue des Beaux Arts has eschewed any attempt at renovation and
thrives on the shabby chic charm of its original Directoire-style decor. It
has even kept the Art Deco furniture installed by Mistinguett, one of its
most famous clients and one of Paris' most infamous striptease artistes,
including her mirrored bedroom which decks out the honeymoon suite.
For all the charm of Mistingeutt's memory L'Hotel is best known as the place
where Oscar Wilde lived until his death. The Irish arterati still flock
there to pay their respects, including U2, the Dublin rock super-group, who
installed themselves in L'Hotel for the Paris leg of the Zoo TV tour.
(L'Hotel, tel. 4325 2722. Rooms from FFr900.)
Over in the Marais, the Pavillon de la Reine is based in the stunning 17th
century setting of the Place des Vosges. The building is a lovely hotel
particulier, with a pretty flower-filled garden, although the interior
design does verge on Disneyesque gothic, with mock-Medieval bedsteads and
chunks of tree trunks for key-rings. But this is still the only hotel in
Paris where you can munch your morning croissants among the arches of Place
des Vosges. (Pavillon de la Reine, tel. 4277 9640. Rooms from FFr1,250). If
you want something cheaper, but charming, you could choose one of the tiny
hotels on the islands or the back streets of Saint Germain.
Hotel des Deux Iles is set in a pretty 17th century building on the Ile
Saint-Louis, a short walk away from the Seine. The nearby Jeu de Paume also
offers small, simple rooms at similar prices. (Hotel des Deux Iles, tel.
4326 1335. Rooms from FFr650. Jeu de Paume, tel. 4326 1418. Rooms from
FFr730.)
Saint Germain is another good source of picturesque hotels particularly on
the streets along the Seine, Rue Jacob and Rue de l'Universite. The Lenox on
Rue de l'Universite is one of the most popular with basic rooms, but a
stunning Art Deco bar tucked away on the ground floor which is a favourite
haunt of the Paris publishing crowd as well as the hotel guests. (Hotel
Lenox, tel. 4296 1095. Rooms from FFr550.)
Wherever you decide to stay make sure you book early. Paris is usually
packed with business travellers and tourists throughout the year. Sometimes
the city is so busy that it is almost impossible to find a room anywhere.
The worst times of all are late March and mid-October when the fashion crowd
takes over for the pret a porter collections and mid-June, when the
aerospace industry arrives for the Paris Air Show.
May, June, September and October are the busiest times for the tourist
trade. During these months the Parisian hotels are packed to capacity and
the sightseeing centres around Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower, often seem
more like downtown Detroit or Tokyo than part of France's capital city.
Virtually the only time of year when you are almost sure to get a room
anywhere you want at reasonably short notice is August, when business life
grinds to a halt, Parisians flee to the coast or country for their vacances
leaving the city's shops and restaurants to drag down their shutters for la
fermeture annuelle. But no-one with any sense chooses to come to Paris in
August anyway.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (5): Epitome of la gauche
caviare - Jack Lang is a powerful politician who towers over the Paris arts
world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MAN has dominated the artistic life of Paris for the past decade and his
name is Jack Lang. Liberation, the arterati's favourite daily paper, has
even dubbed the 1980s 'l'epoque Lang.'
Jack Lang not only towers over the Paris arts world, he is also one of
France's most powerful politicians. He is the longest serving member in the
Mitterrand cabinet having held his post as arts minister for the nine years
the socialists have been in power. He has also built on that base, by adding
first media, then education to his portfolio, to become the second most
important member of the cabinet after Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister.
His record is all the more impressive because he appears to have achieved
all this without compromising his own political or personal style.
Jack Lang, with his taste for Thierry Mugler suits, his groovy Place des
Vosges apartment and his love of the avant garde, is the epitome of la
gauche caviare, the sybaritic strain of socialism that has flourished in
Mitterrand's France.
Night after night he and his entourage sweep into receptions at the city's
museums and art galleries. His own receptions in the sumptuous salons of his
ministry in the Palais Royal are legendary for their opulence.
The apparently endless stream of literary revivals, architectural
restoration schemes, new museums and musical fetes are greeted with glee by
the fashionable left, and fury from the conservative right.
Mr Lang is such a shameless self-publicist that when an international poll
cited him as the second most famous French politician, his own publicity
team circulated copies to the press. It does not seem to have done him much
harm. Whenever the French public is polled on France's most popular
politicians, Jack Lang almost always near the top.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (6): City restored to its old
glory - A guide to the diverse districts of Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE city of Paris is in the shape of a circle, bordered by the ancient
portes, the old city gates, and the modern mayhem of the peripherique
ringroad. The centre (see map overleaf) is divided into 20 arrondissements
spiralling clockwise from the Ile de la Cite, the historic heart of Paris.
Paris has been restored to its old glory in the Mitterrand era. The statues
were regilded for the bi-centennial celebrations in 1989 and the old
sandstone buildings renovated in the late 1980s property boom. In the
meantime two brand new business districts have been built - the tall towers
of La Defense to the west and the brutal blocks of Bercy to the east.
1. OPERA. Garnier's grandiose Opera is at the heart of the old banking
district. The big French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de
Paris, still tower over the financial sector from their opulent buildings on
boulevard des Italiens. But some of the smaller banks and insurers have been
chased away by high rents and cramped conditions to find more modern
accommodation in other parts of Paris.
Societe Generale is now following suit by trading in its historic
headquarters for a brand new tower block at La Defense.
2. PALAIS-ROYAL. This was built by the wily Cardinal Richelieu in the 17th
century but made its name as the centre of the Paris red light district in
the 18th and 19th centuries when its picturesque arcades were filled with
gambling dens and whore houses.
Palais-Royal today, with the Louvre museum on one side and the Banque de
France and Bibliotheque Nationale on the other, is the home of Jack Lang's
arts ministry, its beautifully restored gardens (courtesy of the LVMH luxury
goods group) and Daniel Buren's controversial sculpture, built on the
ministry's old parking lot.
3. THE MARAIS. This is one of the few parts of Paris to have emerged
unscathed from Baron Haussmann's 19th century reconstruction schemes. The
old 17th century hotels, once the homes of the aristocracy and their
concubines, survived to be renovated by young professional Parisians in the
1980s.
Although the Marais, with its narrow alleys and the arcaded place des
Vosges, is still a lovely area to stroll around. It is also the home of
Musee Picasso, the fruit of the Picasso family's tax deal with the French
government, and some of the city's best contemporary art galleries.
4. SAINT-GERMAIN. This area today does not evoke quite the same esprit as
that of Balzac's novels, but its 18th century town houses are still among
the loveliest in Paris. Saint-Germain is squeezed between the snobby
septieme, the seventh arrondissement, where many of the government
ministries are based, and the studenty sixth. It houses a number of Paris'
most fashionable shopping areas, art galleries and antique dealers, as well
as the tiny Musee Delacroix and Eglise Saint-Germain, famous for its choral
concerts.
5. CHAMPS-ELYSEES. This is the Parisian answer to London's Oxford Street and
New York's Fifth Avenue, with its parade of shops and cinemas. Jacques
Chirac, the city's mayor, is doing his best to spruce it up by imposing
strict rules and regulations over what the tenants can and can not do with
their premises.
Meanwhile the new generation of Champs-Elysees tenants, led by the space-age
Virgin Megastore, is revitalising the area. The chic shopping streets
running off it, notably Avenue Montaigne, have also been revitalised thanks
to the opening of new shops and restaurants.
6. LA DEFENSE is the joint initiative between the French government and the
Ile de France region to alleviate the pressure on central Paris by shipping
out some of its biggest industrial tenants to the west. Esso, Elf-Aquitaine,
Total, IBM and Saint-Gobain are already there.
The tall towers of La Defense now loom over the city and Jean Nouvel, the
futuristic architect, has been commissioned to build another, even bigger
Tour Sans Fins.
7. BERCY, or so the French government hopes, will eventually become the
financial district of eastern Paris.
President Mitterrand gave the development a kick-start by exiling the
finance ministry there. Mr Michel Sapin, the present incumbent, now speeds
along the Seine to and from the National Assembly in his gunmetal grey
powerboat.
Bercy also boasts the Omnisport stadium and, what is expected to be, one of
the world's main wine markets. But its progress has been hindered by the
fact that large tracts of Bercy office space have come on to the market in
the depths of the property slump.

Francois Mitterrand has made a personal imprint on the city's appearance

NIGHT and day a small troop of armed guards are stationed beside the
barricades at either end of the rue de Bievre running down to the river from
the boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris fifth arrondissement.
The guards are there because rue de Bievre is the private address of
President Francois Mitterrand. He is rarely there. For the 11 years of his
presidency he has spent most of his time at the Elysee Palace, but he is
still fond of reminiscing about his time back at rue de Bievre when he would
pop along the street to the local bistrot.
Francois Mitterrand was born at Jarnac in Charente but has spent most of his
adult life in Paris, first as a journalist, then a lawyer and finally a
politician. From the moment he became president he made it absolutely clear
that he planned to make his mark on the city - and to make it last.
The Paris of 1981, when the socialists swept on to the streets to celebrate
the election of the first socialist president of the Fifth Republic, was a
very different city from the Paris of today.
The most visible legacies of the Mitterrand era are the glossy Grands
Projets - the luminous Louvre Pyramid, the giant Arc de la Defense and the
glittering Bastille opera house - that are now part and parcel of the
cityscape.
The culture of Paris has changed too. The old-fashioned ouvrier socialism of
the early Mitterrand era was quickly supplanted by the groovy gauche caviar
ethos of the rest of his regime.
Le gauche caviare is out of tune with the more ascetic mood of the early
1990s as the opinion polls attest. Francois Mitterrand now faces the
challenge of redefining socialism for the 1990s if he is to avoid an
enforced return to his old home on rue de Bievre after the next presidential
elections.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (4): Relentless self-publicist
 -Jacques Chirac has ruled the French capital since he became mayor in 1977
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE chain-smoking mayor, with his perpetual smile and his pinstripe suits,
is part and parcel of the city's politics. Yet Jacques Chirac, now nearing
60, has made no secret of the fact that he sees Paris as little more than a
platform to the serious business of national power.
Chirac began his career as a civil servant, working his way through the
ministerial ranks until 1974 when he became prime minister under President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Two years later he resigned to nurture his own
national powerbase as head of the neo-Gaullist RPR.
He and his old presidential mentor have since fought over, and disastrously
divided, the conservative right, as illustrated by the damaging split over
this autumn's Maastricht referendum. So far they have proved spectacularly
successful at squashing their younger would-be successors although, as their
critics suspect, they may be damaging their own parties' electoral prospects
in the process.
Jacques Chirac is still best known outside France for his second stint as
prime minister during the cohabitation era from 1986 to 1988. Cohabitation
came to an abrupt end in 1988 when the RPR suffered its worst electoral
defeat in the 30 year history of the Fifth Republic courtesy of Jean-Marie
Le Pen's extreme right wing Front Nationale, whose racist policies split the
party and stole its votes.
The head of the RPR, a relentless self-publicist who conducted his last
presidential campaign from a travelling circus tent, has been left to bide
his time back at the opulent Hotel de Ville, firing off the odd offensive at
President Mitterrand, until the next elections come along.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (2): Bordering on the
burlesque - Political battles / Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, has been
waging war against France's head of state ever since Francois Mitterrand
trounced him in the 1981 presidential elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Hotel de Ville with its Disneyesque towers, turrets and tricolors on the
right bank of the Seine has for a very long time played a pivotal part in
the politics of Paris.
Danton, Robespierre and Marat, the lynchpins of the French Revolution,
decamped there in 1792 to turn it into their seat of government. But in 1871
the Hotel de Ville was ransacked by the angry mobs that swept through the
city in the early days of the Paris Commune.
The Hotel de Ville, sparkling in neo-Renaissance splendour with its
illuminated fountains and shimmering chandeliers, is now the scene of
another political struggle in its current role as the campaign headquarters
of Jacques Chirac, the neo-gaullist who has been mayor of Paris since 1977,
in his bitter battle against Francois Mitterrand, France's socialist
president.
Mr Chirac has been waging war against France's head of state ever since
Francois Mitterrand trounced him in the 1981 presidential elections. The
battle between them has become all the fiercer since the uncomfortable era
of cohabitation between 1986 and 1988 when they wrestled for power on the
national stage, while Jacques Chirac played prime minister to Francois
Mitterrand's president.
The two men have clashed over everything from the rights and wrongs of
military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina, to whether the French state
should have chopped down the trees on Quai Branly, to who was to stand
closest to the Queen of England at the photocalls for her official visit to
Paris.
All too often the battles have bordered on the burlesque. The mayor's
assaults on the Grands Projets, the ambitious architectural programme
initiated by the president and Jack Lang, his faithful arts minister and
another Chirac bete noir, are a fine example.
Almost every new architectural scheme, from IM Pei's Louvre Pyramide, to
Dominique Perrault's Tres Grande Bibliotheque, has been treated to an attack
 -on aesthetic, social or financial grounds, often on all three - from the
Hotel de Ville only to be defended with a carefully cultivated air of
insouciance from the president.
At first glance, President Mitterrand appears to hold the winning hand if
only because central government still controls many aspects of the
management of Paris, including public transport. Mr Chirac has been left to
drum up as much publicity as he can for the few areas left under his aegis -
ranging from the enormous electronic information boards he has plastered all
over the city (relaying details of the time, traffic jams and the weather)
to his 'poop-scooping' campaign against dog dirt.
The Hotel de Ville's power has also been eroded by the socialists'
decentralisation programme which has been implemented throughout France but
could scarcely have been better designed to curb Jacques Chirac's authority.
These reforms started six years ago with the creation of the Ile de France
region, an elected body that now adminstrates the area in and around Paris
in tandem with the council. They continued in 1990 with the appointment of a
state-selected prefet to represent the government in the region.
But the wily mayor has battled back. The Ile de France region is in the
sympathetic hands of a Chirac loyalist. Equally important, the city
council's budget at FFr18.7bn for 1992 is still twice as big as that of the
region. The prefet, Christian Sautter, is a Mitterrand man and was once
senior adviser to the president. But he has forged a sound relationship with
the Ile de France loyalist and, in practice, there are relatively few
serious differences of opinion on strategic issues between the various
governing bodies.
CONTEMPORARY Paris is a prosperous place. New buildings have been flung up,
old buildings lovingly restored and the city's statues glisten after their
recent regilding. In the early hours of the morning the streets are crammed
with the apple green vans of the city council, scooping up litter, hosing
down pavements, sweeping the roads and even polishing the street signs.
During the Mitterrand era Paris has gained 137km of new railway track, four
times more than London, and 500km of motorway to London's 250km. A fourth
express rail route is now under construction and a fifth is in the pipeline.
There are also plans for a fourth ring road and for five subterranean
motorways.
This investment seems to have done little to tackle the city's appalling
traffic problems. Parking is still a nightmare. It is almost impossible to
find a legal parking space in central Paris at night. The pavements of the
grands boulevards are littered with abandoned cars. The huge subterranean
car parks built by the city council in the late 1980s have had little
impact. The only consolation is that things would almost certainly be even
worse without them.
Yet, almost all the comparative studies between contemporary Paris and
London come out in the French capital's favour. Paris wins higher marks for
transport and planning in a recent British government report, while London
scores on culture and greenery. When it comes to public service
infrastructure, Paris has a clear advantage. The London Underground,
according to the report, is slower, dirtier, less efficient and more
dangerous than the Paris Metro.
The chief criticism levelled at Jacques Chirac is that, like Mayor Ed Koch
in New York, he has gentrified his city to such a degree that the centre is
now an enclave for the affluent, with the disadvantaged shipped out to the
potentially explosive poverty belt of the suburbs.
But it is the government, not the city council, that usually gets the blame
whenever the suburbs erupt in sporadic bursts of urban unrest. And Jacques
Chirac has yet to lose an election. He, and his loyalists, have been
returned to power by poll after poll. Mr Chirac is only likely to leave the
Hotel de Ville on his own terms. In other words he will only do so if he
finally triumphs in a presidential election so that he can swap the towers
and turrets of the Hotel de Ville for the 18th century grandeur of the
Elysee Palace.

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOST of the world's great cities are either modern
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New York and Tokyo - or monumental, like Rome and Prague. Paris is almost
alone in being both. It is a picture postcard of a city - breathtakingly
beautiful and steeped in history, but with all the techno-toys of a modern
metropolis.
The Mitterrand era is now nearing its end. But Francois Mitterrand and his
glittering Grands Projets will leave as strong a stamp on the fabric of
Paris as Henry IV's 16th century construction schemes and Baron Haussmann's
19th century urbanisation drives.
The Grands Projets are President Mitterrand's monuments to modernism, but he
has also breathed new life into the city's past. In the Mitterrand years,
ancient buildings have been renovated, the statues of the city regilded and
the grime washed away from the sandstone bridges along the Seine. The result
is a compelling combination of the old and the new.
The real appeal of the Grands Projets is their rapport with the ancient
aspects of Paris. The giant glass pyramid in the Louvre is all the more
beguiling because of the contrast between its glacial modernity and the
grandeur of the old courtyards. The brutal new Grande Arche at La Defense
looks at its best when framed by the 19th century splendour of the original
Arc de Triomphe.
Then there is Palais-Royal, the arched arcades built by Cardinal Richelieu
as an aristocratic enclave in the 17th century that degenerated into dens of
debauchery under Philippe d'Orelans in the next century. The Grand Vefour,
the restaurant where Napoleon dined with Josephine, is still there today as
is the tiny cobbler tucked away on rue de Beaujolais, a beneficiary of
Paris' paternalistic property law. But Palais-Royal is also the home of Jack
Lang's arts ministry. The ministry itself has been meticulously restored,
but a futuristic wall of video screens shimmers through the windows and
Daniel Buren's monochrome sculptures glower in the courtyard.
Paris does share the shortcomings of most metropolises. The streets are
choked with traffic. The pavements are littered with the homeless, the
jobless, the penniless and the new efflux of emigres from eastern Europe.
The city centre may be plush and prosperous but its suburbs are
socially-explosive powderkegs of poverty and violence. This is a side of
Paris that the traveller can choose not to see. The French excel at le luxe
and Paris can pamper its visitors like no other city. A grand hotel like the
Crillon, or the great restaurants, Taillevent and Lucas-Carton, offer
classic French style at its very best. This is the peculiarly Parisian
product of finesse and instinct, beautiful, but restrained without the
slightest hint of vulgarity.
But the paupers' Paris has its pleasures too. It costs next to nothing to
travel from one end of the city to another on the fast and efficient Metro
system, or to sip a steaming cafe-creme at the counter of an Art Nouveau
cafe-tabac.
As for staring at the silhouette of the Seine islands while crossing the
Pont des Arts, or catching the magical moment when the lights of Place de la
Concorde come on all at the same time, that costs nothing at all.

FT  27 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: New closing peak for Footsie Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market celebrated the closure of Wall Street for
Thanksgiving Day by gaining more than 32 points yesterday to reach a new
closing peak of 2,741.8, less than three points under the trading peak also
established in the middle of May this year.
The advance reflected the better news on the US economy reported this week
as well as hopes that a settlement of the GATT dispute will be confirmed in
spite of bitter resistance by French farmers. The absence of New York
trading was also reflected in foreign exchange markets, although the
impending hike in Irish interest rates to 100 per cent indicated the
continuing uncertainties in this area.
The FT-SE Index opened nervously but was soon encouraged by firmness in
stock index futures, where the absence of a recent US seller proved enough
to push the December contract ahead. From mid-morning, the market moved
forward steadily and the final reading on the FT-SE Index showed a net gain
of 32.2 on the day. On May 11, the Footsie touched 2,744.5 before closing at
2,737.8.
Trading volume increased to 598. m shares yesterday, boosted by renewed
buying of equities ahead of the closure today of the two-week trading
account. The account has brought significant profits in share prices but
traders noted that there was little inclination to take profits yesterday.
On Wednesday, Seaq turnover of 522.1m shares was worth Pounds 1.13bn in
terms of customer business.
Dealers suggested that yesterday's upswing in London was helped by the
absence of Wall Street but also assumed that the New York market, which had
gained 17.56 Dow points overnight, will return strongly from its one-day
holiday closure.
The international blue chips moved up sharply, benefiting both from the
absence of any US selling and also from hopes of transatlantic support when
Wall Street gets back to work. The weak spot was ICI, still restrained by
the bearish views on the prospective demerger plans which have been
expressed by London brokerage houses over the past week. However, gains in
oil shares on hints of progress at the Opec talks were not taken too
seriously in the stock market against the backcloth of oil price
uncertainty.
Leading store and retail sectors advanced in spite of doubts cast over hopes
for further cuts in UK base rates by the rise in German money supply
disclosed this week. The absence of any move in policy at yesterday's
Bundesbank meeting was no surprise.
Traders sounded pleased with yesterday's advance in UK equities, the first
genuine upturn of the week, but admitted that much will depend on whether
the New York market opens higher today. On the domestic front, evidence of
the economic recession is only too clear on every side.
One strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities
house, pinpointed the UK unemployment levels as the the key factor for any
recovery in the domestic economy.
Higher employment would help boost consumer confidence and also act as a
favourable indicator for the industrial and commercial property sector,
which is still weighed down by the overhang of office properties in London
and other business centres.

FT  27 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG mid-morning buy order from a leading house sent Footsie futures
sharply forward to trade at the higher levels, although turnover remained
dull, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the December contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,728, some
4 points above Wednesday's close and moved to trade in a range of 2,730 and
2,740 for the first part of the trading session.
It was however the large buy order from a leading house which sent December
powering ahead, moving from 2,731 to 2,755 within a short period. But for an
occasional flurry which saw the contract touch the day's high of 2,762
twice, December traded in a tight range of 2,750 to 2,758 for the rest of
the day.
A noteable feature was the absence of some US houses in the market due to
Thanksgiving Day in the US.
December closed at 2,763, up 39 points on the previous close and around 17
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 9. Turnover
was however once again low reaching only 5,672 contracts.
Traded options were dull with volume falling to 25,536 contracts. The FT-SE
100 option was more active than in the last two sessions and saw its
turnover reach 7,284 lots. Asda was the most actively dealt stock option. It
traded 4,643 contracts, with the January 30 calls attracting nearly half of
that total.

FT  27 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: C &amp; W in renewed demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RANGE of positive stories helped drive shares in Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W),
the telecoms group, to a 10-year high of 678p. They closed a fraction off
the top, settling 19 firmer at 675p.
Among many stories in the market was a suggestion that Cazenove, the
company's broker, had adopted a much more positive stance on the stock. C &amp;
W is currently making presentations to Scottish institutions and is also due
to embark on a trip to the US next week to address US investment
institutions. But suggestions that the group might be about to make a
secondary issue of ADR's were treated with scepticism by telecoms
specialists.
There were also rumours that Cable may be considering the sale of another
substantial block of shares in HK Telecom in which it retains a near 60 per
cent stake.
Other dealers said the shares had absorbed some sizeable selling pressure
triggered by the recent strains between the Chinese and the UK Government
over the handover of power.
Forte focus
Acquisition talk once again focused around Forte as the trade press
suggested that the hotel group was considering bidding for the Sheraton
international chain. However, the rumour was dismissed by industry observers
as highly speculative, given Forte's debt position and its current attempts
to sell the Gardner Merchant catering subsidiary.
There were also suggestions that the death of Sir Hugh Wontner, a main
shareholder and president of the Savoy group, might revive Forte's bid to
control the luxury hotel chain. Sir Hugh was the principal protagonist
against the bitterly contested bid for the Savoy group by Forte which ended
in 1989 with Forte controlling 42 per cent of Savoy and having boardroom
representation. Significantly Forte agreed not to buy any more Savoy shares
until 1994. Savoy shares jumped 40 to 485p yesterday while Forte was a penny
firmer at 173p.
GKN under pressure
Shares in GKN came under pressure after several brokers downgraded profit
expectations following cautious remarks from the company chairman regarding
the near term trading outlook. His remarks came at a dinner for analysts in
France on Wednesday evening.
The early damage appeared to have been wrought by Hoare Govett, now said to
be predicting current year profits of Pounds 140m, and by Kleinwort Benson
which reiterated its negative stance on the stock. At worst, the shares were
down 9 at 390p but later recovered to end 6 1/2 p lighter at 392 1/2 p.
However, Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney favoured the stock.
ICI shares were weak on reaction to a stock overhang and a sell
recommendation from Baring Securities.
Baring argues that after the company's planned split the new chemicals and
pharmaceuticals groups will each pay only 20p in dividend, reflecting a 27
per cent dividend cut and that shares in the two groups will have a combined
value of 1025p. That is 75p higher than the figure suggested by recent Smith
New Court analysis but Baring says the stock is vulnerable ahead of results
in February and the shares should be sold down to 900p. ICI fell 13 to 981p.
Wellcome was weak in early trading falling to 1012p at one stage on
profit-taking following strong rises over the past week. However, the shares
recovered as the selling died and closed 4 better at 1032p.
Seton Healthcare dropped 11 to 281p after announcing a one-for-four rights
issue at 240p a share to raise Pounds 13.1m. The company will use part of
the cash to buy pharmaceutical group Cupal for Pounds 8.2m.
Both classes of BT shares, the fully-paid and partly-paid, staged a
determined advance with some dealers taking the view that the shares will
soon launch an attack on the all-time high of 421 1/2 p, reached last
October.
Specialists said the market was reflected perceptions that the proposed sale
next year of some or all of the Government's remaining 21.9 per cent stake
in the group, some 1.35bn shares, could be preceded by a build up of
institutional demand for the stock. 'There is the possibility that
institutions may have their allocations of BT III shares linked to their
existing holdings,' said one analyst.
BT fully-paid closed 7 1/2 higher at 406 1/2 p on turnover of 2.1m while the
partly-paid ended 6 higher at 301p on 9.4m traded.
Critchley, the manufacturer of electrical cable accessories, made a
successful market debut, climbing to 240p and closing at 237p, compared with
the placing price of 220p.
Plasterboard manufacturer BPB shocked the market by chopping the interim
dividend by a third. 'All the the market bulls of the shares and most of the
bears had been confidently expecting the company to hold the payment,' said
one dealer. The reduction in the payment was made all the worse by the
company announcing interim profits up 14.5 per cent at Pounds 27.5m - at the
very top of the range.
There was little respite for the shares despite a reasonably polished
post-results meeting between the company and building analysts. Full-year
profits estimates were being reigned in to the low to mid-Pounds 50m's with
a consensus figure for next year of around Pounds 80m. The dividend total
for this year is generally expected to be 7.5p. BPB closed 18 down at 172p.
Turnover in Cannon Street Investments leapt to 7.1m shares and the share
price jumped by more than 40 per cent as selling pressure on the
mini-conglomerate was taken up. The stock rose 2 to 6 3/4 p but still a long
way below its 80p level a year ago.
Results in line with expectations initially lifted shares in Northern Foods,
although they later faded following the post-results meeting. Marking the
shares a 'dull hold', Mr Carl Short at Nomura said that worries had emerged
over the stock's premium rating but sub-market earnings per share growth.
The stock retreated 8 to 279p.
However, remarks by Northern's chairman over food price inflation were
interpreted as good for food retailers. Argyll rose 10 to 373p, Sainsbury 11
to 509p and Tesco 9 1/2 to 248p. Bumper turnover of 25m in Asda saw the
shares edge 2 3/4 on optimism that the group may be admitted to the FT-SE
100 in the near future.
International drinks group Allied Lyons was hit by speculation that its
broker Cazenove had unofficially downgraded the stock, although official
confirmation was said to be held back until after the Allied's results next
week. Cazenove refused to comment on the rumour. The shares tumbled 15 to
643p. Whisky distiller Macdonald Martin slid 70 to 400p after revealing a
profits slump.
Big turnover and continued takeover speculation helped Queens Moat Houses
climb 3 to 46p with 12m shares traded. The market remains convinced that the
hotel group will announce a tie-up with the Bass's Holiday Inn operations.
Fresh buy notes on Thorn EMI from Hoare Govett and County NatWest helped the
leisure conglomerate continue its post-results surge and gain 12 to 816p.
Rank Organisation bounced back from recent weakness adding 19 at 625p.
Tentative optimism over US recovery helped stocks with North American
exposure. Among them, Reuters Holdings lifted 13 to 1294p as it rebounded
after weakness prompted by a convertible bond redemption announcement on
Wednesday.
Among engineers, APV were in favour and the shares added 3 to 104p. Broker
Albert E Sharp which was reported to have visited the company earlier this
week is said to favour the stock. Talk that the company would soon make
disposals also benefited the shares. Also in demand was British Steel in
which some 9m shares were dealt. The shares firmed 4 to 53 1/2 p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Series of sad stories from Japanese OTC
 -A depressing two-year trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High risk, high return has been the sales pitch for the Japanese
over-the-counter market (OTC), but investors have seen more risk than return
recently with the OTC index 72.5 per cent off its peak in 1990.
Most companies listed on the OTC market have fallen victim to the downturn
in the economy, the two-year slide in the stock market and the bursting of
the real estate bubble of the late 1980s. This, compounded with inadequate
disclosure at many OTC companies, has driven investors away.
A downward revision of forecasts by leading OTC companies such as THK, the
ball bearings maker, and Jafco, the venture capital company, seem to sum up
the woes of smaller companies. THK, which originally forecast a 36 per cent
rise in annual pre-tax profits, now expects earnings to plunge by 89 per
cent. Jafco also initially saw a profit increase, but has revised
projections to a fall of one-fifth at pre-tax level.
Smaller companies, which rely on a 'niche' market, lack the breadth of
business and are more vulnerable to an economic downturn. Last year's
failure of Maruko, an Osaka-based condominium developer specialising in
one-room apartments, symbolised the troubles at OTC companies.
Maruko, the first company listed on the OTC to become bankrupt, expanded
aggressively in the late 1980s. However, when interest rates started to rise
and demand for its one-room condominiums fell, the consequent liquidity
crunch forced the company to file for court protection with liabilities of
Y285.8bn (Dollars 2.3bn).
Royal Construction, a contractor of golf resorts and condominiums, followed
Maruko. The company filed for court protection last July with outstanding
debts of Y19bn.
Disclosure problems of companies have also heightened the risks of investing
on the OTC market. The Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) recently
admitted that it needed tighter disclosure rules, following criticism over
the bankruptcy of Ipec, an operator of educational institutes and supplier
of educational material, and a false data claim attributed to TSD, a
computer software company.
In October, the failure of Ipec highlighted slack disclosure measures at
smaller companies. According to the company lawyer, liabilities at Ipec
totalled Y18.6bn, with some Y8.7bn in off-balance sheet borrowings. While
Ipec may be an isolated case, allegations that the company did not make
itsoff-balance sheet liabilities clear at the time of listing discouraged
OTC investors.
Investors were also shocked by an announcement by TSD, earlier this month,
that it had presented investors with false information concerning clinical
tests of its HIV vaccine. The JSDA announced last week that it would produce
a guideline for information disclosure by the end of the year.
Mr Yoshiro Nao, senior managing director of Ichiyoshi Securities, a broker
specialising in OTC companies, points out that small companies often lack
the auditing systems within the organisation to check irregular practices.
OTC companies do not feel the pressure to disclose more information and
rarely face scrutiny from the media, or from analysts. The press club at the
Tokyo Stock Exchange once rejected the Japan Securities Dealers
Association's request for a forum for the OTC companies to announce their
results.
The surprises have not all been unpleasant. Mr Kenzo Tsujimoto, president of
Capcom, a video game equipment and software maker, apologised to investors
after revising up the company's profit forecast for the second time since
the beginning of the fiscal year in April. The company said that it had not
foreseen the surge in demand for its new video game software, and now
projects annual sales to March to rise 72 per cent, and pre-tax profits to
double.
Seikagaku, a pharmaceutical company specialising in geriatric drugs, was
another of the few companies which saw a steady rise in interim profits. The
company is expected to post double digit increases in both profit and sales
thanks to 'Alz', an arthritis cure.
But with the OTC index failing to respond to the recent rise of the Nikkei
average, the few positive earnings forecasts have been ignored. Traders
admit that the OTC market will remain a risky and speculative market for
some time to come.
The JSDA requires retail investors to sign an agreement acknowledging the
risks before placing orders on the OTC market. And Nomura Securities, the
industry leader, says its that sales staff are guided not to allow
inexperienced individual investors to participate in OTC trading.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate hopes stay alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE lack of movement from the German Bundesbank on key interest rates
yesterday prompted some analysts and strategists to look for a cut at the
next council meeting on December 10, the last one this year, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS ended higher on hopes of an early round of interest rate cuts led by
the Bundesbank, in spite of its decision to do nothing yesterday. Dealers
said that the market also believed if the Bundesbank failed to cut rates,
the resulting pressure on the franc would lead to a devaluation and
consequently lower domestic rates.
The CAC-40 index ended 18.71 higher at 1,739.68, its third successive rise,
but turnover was thin at FFr1.74bn.
Pleasing third-quarter US growth figures, which raised hopes of a speedier
recovery in the US economy, lifted stocks with transatlantic exposure.
Pechiney CIs put on FFr12 or 4.8 per cent to FFr260 and Lafarge added
FFr6.50 FFr305.80.
Hopes that Opec would agree to keep oil output at less than 25m barrels per
day lifted oil stocks, as Elf added FFr9.10 to FFr330.90 and Total put on
FFr2.50 to FFr234.50.
MADRID registered a sizeable rise for the first time in a week, the general
index closing 2.83 higher at 214.77. In a firm banking sector Banesto,
relatively weak recently, rose Pta115 or 5.8 per cent to Pta2,090 on
takeover rumours.
Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Europe said that the latest macro-economic
figures from Spain have been better than expected, indicating a light at the
end of the tunnel and tempting foreign investors to return to the market.
Furthermore, the peseta was holding fairly firm after the weekend
devaluation.
FRANKFURT mounted a minor technical recovery and responded to some
better-than-expected company news. The DAX index closed 5.46 higher at
1,523.18 as turnover rose from DM4.5bn to DM6.1bn.
Some demand came from futures trading, where the December DAX contract
touched a high of 1,543 before dropping back to trade at 1,535 in the early
afternoon. Company news came most noticeably from Thyssen, BHF Bank and
Asko.
Thyssen net profits fell to DM350m and the dividend from DM10 to DM6, but
this was generally better than analysts had feared. Mr Michael Geiger at
County NatWest said that he had been looking for DM220m and DM5 respectively
as the shares rose DM3.10 to DM158.
BHF Bank outperformed the banking sector, putting on DM4 to DM408 after it
reported a 20.5 per cent increase in group partial operating profits for the
first ten months of 1992.
In retailing, Asko rose DM33 to DM533 after the German cartel office
approved a planned merger of the company with the Metro retail group,
provided that the two divested themselves of some stores. This reversed an
earlier decision blocking the merger.
STOCKHOLM paused again, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 3.5 lower at
862.5 after a 2.9 per cent gain on Wednesday. The decline was led by the
blue chips which spearheaded the recent rally, and turnover stayed heavy
although it fell from SKr1.37bn to SKr1.12bn.
Banks continued to outperform as the sector index put on 12.9 per cent.
Handelsbanken B rose SKr4.5 to SKr34.5 and S-E-Banken by SKr2 to SKr17. The
krona devaluation is expected to lead to lower loan losses and an upswing in
real estate values.
OSLO extended its upswing on speculation that Norway may be forced to
devalue, but this time the all-share index ended only 2.63 higher at 357.35
in active turnover of NKr342m. Industrial shares, which would benefit from
devaluation, were in the forefront again with Norsk Hydro NKr3 higher at
NKr142.5.
MILAN ended lower in slow trading and the Comit index fell 4.17 to 442.63 in
turnover estimated at slightly more than Wednesday's relatively low L181bn.
Shares in the Ferruzzi group were in the limelight following newspaper
reports of management reshuffles and asset disposals. Montedison was fixed
L5 lower at L1,151, but then surged to L1,200 later on.
Fondiaria, the insurer in which Ferruzzi has an interest, rose L750 or 2.8
per cent to L27,900. Ferruzzi Finanziaria added L71 to L1,253 in volume of
3.79m shares, the third most heavily dealt screen stock.
The state-controlled food group SME rose another L87 to L5,620.
AMSTERDAM saw Nedlloyd lose Fl 1.50 to Fl 29.60 as the company warned that
it would once again announce a net loss at the end of the year but that it
would not be as severe as last year's.
The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 103.2 in thin trading.
ISTANBUL jumped by 2.7 per cent on active buying, triggered by renewed hopes
that a long-awaited tax decree designed to encourage institutional
investment in equities would be agreed. The 75-share index closed 97.91
higher at 3,749.76.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drives on as
Australia rests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING by public funds and dealers on the first day of trading for December
settlement bolstered activity, and the Nikkei average rose for the sixth
consecutive day, its longest winning streak since February last year, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei advanced 177.03 to 17,479.04. It fell to the day's low of
17,226.98 in the morning on uncertainty over the parliamentary testimony by
Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister. However, active buying by
public funds in the afternoon prompted trading by dealers and arbitrageurs,
and the index rose to the day's high of 17,601.91.
Volume rose to 310m shares from 213m. Advances outnumbered declines by 736
to 261, with 146 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 8.92 to 1,303.06 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
fell 3.42 to 1,049.80.
In spite of active trading by domestic investors, traders said foreigners
were absent. 'Foreign investors don't know what to do since they think the
market's too expensive, but they realise that the officials want to push
prices up,' said Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel.
Traders were relieved that little fresh news emerged from Mr Takeshita's
sworn testimony before parliament concerning alleged gangster links and
involvement with the Sagawa Kyubin bribery scandal. But caution prevailed
due to an announcement by Nomura Securities that it would repay holders of
its asset-backed bonds because it had not explained the full risks of the
product.
Brokerage issues remained weak. But selling was limited since Nomura said it
would not alter its earnings estimates as a result of the sale of assets to
offset the Y23bn repayment losses. Nomura fell Y20 to Y1,400 while Yamaichi
Securities lost Y5 to Y545.
High-technology issues rose on purchases by public funds. Hitachi advanced
Y23 to Y726 and NEC gained Y33 to Y683.
Shipbuilders were steady, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advancing Y1 to
Y535 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y2 to Y376.
Banks were mixed as dealers adjusted their positions ahead of earnings
announcements due after the market's close. Industrial Bank of Japan fell
Y20 to Y2,400 but Sumitomo Bank gained Y20 to Y1,770.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 251.93 to 18,733.39 in of 27.8m shares.
Pharmaceuticals and electronics rose on short-term buying by dealers.
Roundup
AUSTRALIA took a breather after its recent rally, and there were more rises
than falls elsewhere in the region.
NEW ZEALAND carried on where Australia left off. The NZSE-40 index ended
25.57 or 1.7 per cent higher at 1,525.21 for a cumulative gain of 5.4 per
cent over the last four days.
All of the rise in the index was achieved in the first 15 minutes of
trading. Turnover fell from NZDollars 55.7m to NZDollars 41.6m, but
Wednesday's total had been boosted by some big block sales.
The forestry and resources conglomerate, Fletcher Challenge, rose 11 cents
to NZDollars 1.99 for a 25 cent gain over the last four days. Improving
sentiment for FLC was based partly on a better long-term outlook for its key
exports.
Air New Zealand closed down 6 cents at NZDollars 2.42 on rumours of changes
to the board of directors.
SINGAPORE was encouraged by the 3.9 per cent growth in US GDP and
institutional funds began buying more aggressively.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed 17.20 or 1.2 per cent higher at
1,436.99, while volume moved up from 129m to 177m shares. Brokers said there
was still retail speculation in Malaysian OTC stocks, and this was helping
the volume figure to move up.
BANGKOK and SEOUL both staged technical rebounds. The SET index of Thai
stocks climbed 10.91 to 858.24 as turnover remained thin at Bt3.7bn,
compared with Bt3.4bn on Wednesday. The Korea composite index rose 8.47 to
660.94 in volume up from 34.4m shares to 44.3m.
The recovery in Bangkok was led by small- and medium-sized banks, Siam City
Bank leading the most active stocks as it rose Bt1 to Bt15.
Seoul brokers detected an effort by institutional investors to pull up the
market. But securities houses and large manufacturing shares, which have a
decisive impact on the index due to their heavy weighting, fell victim to
selling late in the session.
AUSTRALIA closed weaker for the first time in eight trading days. The
All-Ordinaries index closed 8.3 lower at 1,450.9 after a rally which has
taken the index up by 6.8 per cent since November 16.
Volume was inflated by Westpac to 121.4m shares worth ADollars 256.2m. After
the close the media magnate Mr Kerry Packer said he had an 8.27 per cent
stake in the bank.
MANILA extended its setback to a ninth consecutive trading day with the
composite index down 17.49 or 1.4 per cent to 1263.69, down 6.2 per cent
since November 13.
HONG KONG eased slightly in thin trading, as modest early gains were erased
by an afternoon bout of profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 5.36 lower
at 5,913.18 following a 54-point loss on Wednesday. Turnover shrank to
HKDollars 1.81bn from HKDollars 2.46bn.
HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, led the way down with
a fall of 50 cents to HKDollars 59. The bank is continuing to suffer from
comments by its chairman, Mr William Purves, who said in an interview
earlier this week that analysts might have overestimated the group's 1992
earnings.
BOMBAY's BSE index dropped 69.45 to 2,487.11 on widespread liquidation on
the last day of the account.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentina tipped to top 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA offers the best return in dollar terms to equity investors in
Latin America next year, while Brazil and Peru are the wild cards in the
pack, according to Mr Audley Twiston Davies, managing director of Latin
American Securities.
He told a group of investors yesterday that Argentine equities are now
looking oversold, after a volatile year in which they rose by 45 per cent
before falling back to show a loss of 38 per cent by mid-November. Assigning
Argentina an asset allocation of 20 per cent, the second-largest after
Mexico with 35 per cent, he forecast that its stock market would rise by 60
per cent in 1993.
Describing Mexico as the core holding in any Latin American portfolio, he
expected that market to rise by 40 per cent next year.
Brazil and Peru were more difficult to predict following the political
upheavals this year, he said, and their gains could be anywhere between zero
to 100 per cent.
Venezuela was given the smallest asset allocation, of just 2 per cent, due
to uncertainty ahead of the country's elections. Mr Twiston Davies noted
that other countries in the region were mid-term in their political cycle
and that by the end of next year, forthcoming elections would have an
increasing influence on their stock markets.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: No move from the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK reversed a rise in the dollar in European trading yesterday after
the Bundesbank did not change its officially posted interest rates at the
fortnightly council meeting, writes James Blitz.
Trading was thin yesterday because of the absence of US markets on the
annual Thanksgiving Day holiday. However, there were residual signs of
tension inside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The Irish authorities signalled that the punt's overnight rate will be
pushed up to 100 per cent on Monday to try and stave off a devaluation. This
did nothing to help the currency, which remained at the bottom of its band
against the Belgian franc, one of the strongest currencies in the system.
Dealers in Lisbon said the Bank of Portugal was buying escudos at Es89.85 to
the D-Mark. However, the French franc gained support after the country's
finance minister stated that he would maintain the current value of its
currency within the ERM. The franc closed virtually unchanged, at FFr3.387
to the D-Mark.
The dollar rose to a high of DM1.5985 against the D-Mark in what dealers saw
as a delayed reaction to Wednesday's quarterly gross domestic product
figures in the US. This showed a rise of 3.9 per cent against previous
estimates of 2.7 per cent. The dollar later closed nearly half a pfennig
higher at DM1.5970.
Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International in London says the ERM still needs a
more credible realignment. 'We are in for further instability and the softer
currencies are vulnerable,' he says. The punt remains a strong candidate for
devaluation despite the Irish authorities' latest moves. Other analysts say
that new disagreements on the Gatt negotiations or the EC budget would
undermine the entente between Germany and France, sparking new currency
tensions.
However, dealers think that the recent pressure on the French franc is
unlikely to resurface before the New Year. This is partly because traders
are reluctant to keep open positions in the run-up to the year- end.
Interest rate markets are already assuming no easing in German policy at the
next council meeting on December 10.
Another factor easing tensions is the potential dollar upside that could
follow the imminent announcement of the economics posts in the new US
administration.
Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Greenwell Montagu in London, believes
that the Bundesbank will only ease policy on December 10 if there is strong
ERM pressure to do so.
She believes the only other motive for the German central bank to cut rates
would be concerted progress by the government in striking a solidarity pact
with the opposition parties and unions. This would have to be matched by
clear success in restraining the current wage round in Germany.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED Euromark futures lost several basis points yesterday after the
Bundesbank failed to change officially posted rates at its fortnightly
council meeting, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision not to ease policy was widely expected in both
foreign exchange and interest rate markets. But several dealers said
yesterday that there will be more intense speculation about a cut in German
interest rates in the run-up to the next meeting in a fortnight's time.
At the moment, the market is assuming that there will be a cut in German
rates, but that it will come in the New Year.
The December Euromark contract fell back 12 basis points from its opening
level, to a close of 91.22 yesterday. At this level, the contract assumes
that 3-month money will be only 9 basis points lower by the middle of next
month, effectively ruling out a change in German rates in 1992.
That view was compounded yesterday by a poor inflation figure in the German
state of Bavaria, showing the at the cost of living had risen by 0.6 per
cent in the month to mid-November for a year-on-year rise of 4.0 per cent.
The Bundesbank has made it clear that domestic inflationary pressures are
still of great concern and yesterday's figure will add to pressures not to
ease policy.
Futures dealers continue to assume that there will be a significant cut at
the start of 1993 although prospects for this have dampened a little too.
The March Euromark contract fell 19 basis points from its opening level
yesterday to a close of 92.24. At this level, it still assumes that there
will be more than 100 basis points off 3-month money by the spring.
In the rest of Europe, markets were very quiet in the wake of the turbulence
of Monday and Tuesday. the exception was Ireland, where the central bank
said that the overnight rate will be hiked to 100 per cent on Monday to ward
off speculation against the Irish punt.
By contrast, the December French franc futures were virtually unchanged at
89.99, pricing in no change in 3-month money before the end of the year. The
franc was mostly stable on the foreign exchanges, and the Bank of France
drained a net FFr7.9bn of funds, leaving its intervention rate at 9.10 per
cent.
There was little change in sterling cash rates, with 3-month money closing
at around 7 1/4 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds
1.55bn, most of which was removed in the afternoon.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers struggle to find
output compromise
</HEADLINE>

MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were
striving late yesterday to patch together a compromise of their widely
disparate views on a production ceiling for the first quarter of next year.
Talks were continuing in the evening but positions were hardening as several
key players demurred over cutting their levels of oil output.
The organisation is aware of the need to give a clear signal to the oil
market that it can reintroduce production discipline.
Any agreement that falls short of sharing out specific production
allocations among individual members is likely to disappoint the market and
could further depress prices.
The price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery slipped a further 35
cents yesterday to Dollars 18.77 1/2 a barrel.
Opec ministers are having problems getting their sums to add up when the
largest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not prepared to trim their own
output from current levels. Iran insists on retaining 3.8m b/d as its
production level although many delegates believe its output has been closer
to 3.6m b/d. A Gulf official said Iran was 'confused' about what it wanted
from the meeting. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is unwilling to produce
less than 8.4m b/d.
Overall production ceilings still under discussion range from 24.5m to 25m
barrels a day, with a consensus building around 24.8m b/d. Output in October
was estimated by Opec economists to have been 25.04m b/d in spite of
agreement on a much lower ceiling in September.
While Saudi Arabia and Iran are finding it hard to agree on a compromise,
smaller producers have also approached the meeting in a spirit of defiance.
'Poorer countries are questioning why they should make sacrifices for the
benefit of the rich ones,' one delegate said. For this reason, Nigeria and
Gabon are pushing for higher output allocations.
Mr Ali Ahmad al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, also said the emirate wanted
a production level of 1.75m b/d for the first quarter, on which it is not
prepared to compromise. This is in line with the emirate's goal of reaching
1.5m b/d by the end of this year as it rebuilds production after the Gulf
War.
Smaller producers are also carping about the level of fees they pay to the
organisation, which are the same as those paid by the larger, richer
countries. The debate over membership dues has been brought to a head by
Ecuador's request to leave the producers' club. However, ministers have also
signalled that they are discussing approaches made by Russia and Kazakhstan
to join the organisation.
The disaffection felt within the group is likely to prevent a unanimous
outcome with the sort of deal that could push up prices. Far more likely is
a vague compromise that could hold off a price fall until next year, when
ministers hope that an increase in demand because of colder weather could
save them from any hard decisions.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Developers resist PNG plan to
boost gold mine stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN and Canadian joint venture partners in the Porgera gold mine
in Papua New Guinea yesterday said they would resist government plans to
acquire an extra 20 per cent of the project.
The government owns 10 per cent of Porgera under a 1979 agreement with
Renison Goldfields, Highlands Gold, a PNG-registered subsidiary of MIM
Holdings, and Placer Pacific, a 76 per cent subsidiary of Placer Dome of
Canada.
Mr Paias Wingti, the prime minister, said he expected an amicable settlement
with the Porgera partners. 'PNG has always been a reasonable negotiator and
partner in all its resource projects, and will continue to (be) so,' he
said.
However, the proposal follows government claims that PNG officials have been
misled by the joint venture partners about the profitability of the project,
which is one of the world's largest gold mines.
Mr Masket Iangalio, the mining minister, has said that PNG restricted its
holding to 10 per cent because the joint venture partners convinced the then
government that the mine would be a marginal project.
Porgera began production in September 1990. It is expected to produce about
900,000 ounces of gold a year until 1996, but is likely to produce 1.4m
ounces in the current year.
Mr Lawrie Reinertson, managing director of Placer Pacific, said the joint
venture partners viewed the government's proposal with 'considerable
concern'. He said it was 'clearly contrary' to the 1979 agreement, which put
a 10 per cent ceiling on the government stake. Mr Reinertson said the
partners rejected suggestions that they had misled the government on the
size of reserves and potential production when the Porgera agreement was
negotiated.
'This is simply not true. As the project moved ahead, a number of factors
combined to contribute to Porgera's better-than-projected performance. The
PNG government was kept closely informed at every step along the way of the
progress being made,' he said.
The joint venture partners say that 60 per cent of profits from Porgera are
distributed in PNG through the government's equity interest, taxes and
royalties.
Mr Campbell Anderson, Renison Goldfields chief executive, said he was
'disappointed' by the government's plans. 'We will meet with the government
of PNG to put our response and why we don't think any change in the equity
is appropriate,' he said.
The Porgera dispute reflects the increasingly tough approach being taken by
the government in its dealings with overseas mining companies, some of which
say privately that they are deeply concerned by events in PNG.
Mr Iangalio yesterday delivered a scathing attack in parliament on CRA, the
Australian mining group, over its involvement in a dispute at Mount Kare,
not far from Porgera.
Mr Iangalio said he had been advised that CRA's conduct of the dispute might
be in breach of the Australian Trade Practices Act, which regulates
competition. He said he would ask the corporate authorities in Australia to
investigate. Mr Iangalio also praised the Perth-based mining companies
Ramsgate Resources and Menzies Gold, which have angered CRA by funding legal
action against the group by a faction of Mount Kare landowners.
CRA has offered to hand over its 51 per cent of the Mt Kare alluvial mine to
the landowners, but wants to retain the rights to explore for hard-rock gold
deposits in the area.
Mr Iangalio claimed CRA had distributed false statements by landowners,
which included forged signatures. 'There is strong evidence that CRA has
been engaging in deceptive and misleading conduct,' he told parliament.
CRA denied any involvement in the allegedly forged statements, and dismissed
Mr Iangalio's claims as 'without foundation'.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barbadian collapse deepens
shadow over Caribbean sugar - The region, faced with high costs and low
productivity, relies on guaranteed market access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Barbados' sugar industry late last month is the latest
indication of the sometimes terminal difficulties which beset Caribbean
producers. The region is faced with high production costs and often low
productivity, and is unable to survive without guaranteed access to markets
such as the European Community and the US, and which pay higher than
prevailing world market prices.
The problems caused by inefficiency and indebtedness are exacerbated by what
many producers see as a threat to current preferential market arrangements.
Many are worried by the recent reduction in US import quotas, and are
uncertain how they will fare if the North American Free Trade Agreement is
implemented and Mexican production becomes a market factor.
In the case of Barbados, the island has been unable to produce enough even
to meet its quota obligations to these guaranteed markets. Efforts are under
way to jump-start the industry after the state-owned Barbados National Bank,
exercising tighter credit control as part of a government austerity
programme, and which is owed Dollars 50m by the industry, suspended all
further loans.
This followed production of 55,000 tonnes from the 1992 harvest, the lowest
in 60 years, according to official figures. In order to make use of its
opportunities on the EC and US markets the island has had to import sugar to
meet domestic demand. Ironically, the collapse of the industry came after
indications that it was being put under new management by Booker Tate, a
subsidiary of Booker, the UK food and farming group.
The company has become an important factor in the region's troubled sugar
industry, and has been called in to help the industries in Guyana, Belize
and St Kitts-Nevis, and to run two of Jamaica's nine mills. Trinidad and
Tobago is the only producer in the Commonwealth Caribbean in which Booker
Tate is not involved. In all cases the company contracted to give corporate
management and technical services to sugar industries in the five countries.
It provides engineers, technologists, agriculturalists, economists,
marketing specialists and support staff.
The industries in both Guyana and Jamaica have attracted financial
assistance from multilateral institutions as a result of the management
contracts given to Booker Tate, But assessments to the company's
effectiveness differ in the two countries. Jamaican officials say the
performance of the two mills managed by the company since 1985 has been
'disappointing'.
Yet the case of Guyana shows that the regional sugar industry is not beyond
redemption. From output of 330,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s, Guyana's
production, plagued by labour unrest and poor weather, slumped to 135,000
tonnes in 1990. The industry declared shortfalls on its European Community
quota for three years, and shipped none of its quota to the US. Booker
Tate's takeover of the management of the industry has been followed,
however, by a decisive turnaround. Production is up this year and export
quotas have been met.
In the Dominican Republic, the region's second largest producer after Cuba,
the problems of financial viability have been compounded by a shortage of
labour. Foreign criticism of the treatment of workers from neighbouring
Haiti, and the subsequent expulsion of thousands of Haitian workers, has
resulted in the state-owned producer suffering a painful drop in output.
Production this year is 8 per cent less than the 326,000 tonnes of last year
and sugar has had to be imported to meet domestic demand.
The outlook for the industry, like that of others in the region, has been
depressed by the recent reduction in global imports by the US. The
Caribbean's cumulative quota has been reduced by 11 per cent to 276,341
tonnes, causing an estimated Dollars 15m reduction in earnings. It is the
second consecutive cut for the Caribbean holders of US quotas, which were
allowed to supply 471,710 tonnes in 1991.
Sugar industry officials in the region say one area of uncertainty is
Mexico's future access to the US market under the Nafta. They say Mexico's
current and modest US quota of 7,500 tonnes a year can be increased 20-fold
in seven years, at the expense of existing suppliers.
Cuba's troubled industry has received a fillip with a new trade agreement
between the island and the Russian republic. Cuba will receive 23m barrels
of Russian oil a year for 2m tonnes of sugar - significantly less than the
country had sold in past years to the former Soviet Union. But the island's
economic problems have depressed output this year to just over 6.9m tonnes.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee delegates show little
urgency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON a new international coffee pact have got off to a slow start this
week, revealing that there is little urgency to meet the deadline of the end
of this year for agreement.
Yesterday delegates to the International Coffee Organisation in London were
discussing for the first time the issue of selectivity - basically, allowing
consumers to choose what sort of coffee should be allowed on to the market.
In the past, rigid export quotas were set for robusta and arabica coffees,
leading to imbalances between supply and demand.
Although the talks are not due to end until next Wednesday, delegates
already appear resigned to extending the December 31 deadline.
Mr Myles Frechette, delegate for the US, the biggest consumer, has insisted
that his country's negotiating position has not changed following the
election of the new president. The coffee agreement would be way down the
list of priorities for the new Clinton administration, he said. Mr Frechette
also believes the US will remain committed to getting a coffee agreement - a
key element in the war against Colombian drug barons.
Producers appear to have heeded a call earlier this month from Mr Alexandre
Beltrao, chief executive of the ICO, for greater co-operation among
exporting countries in order to make any future pact successful. African
exporters agreed at a meeting of their own last week to recommend that
producers should take the major responsibility for stopping illegal exports.
They had previously argued that consumers should bear an equal
responsibility.
The exporting countries are certainly anxious not to rock the boat during
these talks even if agreement is delayed. Coffee prices have recently
touched nine-month highs, but the markets are likely to retreat again on any
signs of disagreement at the ICO.

price rally

LONDON TEA prices have hit the highest levels for nearly three years on a
combination of increased demand from the former Soviet Union and falling
world production because of droughts in India, Africa and Sri Lanka. The
devaluation of sterling in September has added to the recent rise.
Brokers are 'cautiously optimistic' that the recovery will not collapse as
it did in May. 'London prices are very rewarding for producers at the
moment,' said one broker this week. The all-tea average this week reached
138.66p a kilogram.
The former Soviet Union's imports of tea hit an estimated record 231,000 kg
in 1990, according to the International Tea Committee, before falling back
to 161,000 kg last year.
But the break-up of the Soviet Union last year resulted in an almost
complete retreat from the world tea market. Now that there is no longer any
significant centralised trade, it is difficult to estimate how much tea is
being bought by the independent republics but there is no doubt that, since
September, interest from the former Soviet republics has re-emerged world
wide.
Their interest is very much at the low quality end of the market. 'They used
to buy a lot of top quality tea,' said one dealer. 'But now they want value
for money.'
The renewed offtake comes as the world crop is suffering its worst ever
production shortfall - estimated at about 110m kg at the end of September.
Poor growing conditions in Sri Lanka and southern India alone are estimated
to account for almost 80m kg of the shortfall. Production in the major
exporting countries last year totalled about 1.4bn kg.
The fall is reflected in the volumes sold at the London tea auction, which
so far this year have reached only 506,439 packages (53.5 kg each), compared
with 618,634 packages at the same stage of 1991.
At the same time consumer stocks are thought to be very low in the UK,
partly as a consequence of high interest rates over the past year. According
to one broker, stocks in the UK - which is likely this year to regain from
the former Soviet Union its position as the world's biggest consumer at
about 150m kg - are 15 per cent down from 1991 at 30.7m kg.
India's Tea exporters have been urged to seek new markets, rather than place
too much reliance on rebuilding sales to the former Soviet Union, writes
Kunal Bose in Calcutta.
The Indian Tea Association believes it could maintain its shipments to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, provided there was sufficient government
support. But the finance ministry does not agree.
The Soviet Union used to import about 230m kg of tea a year, of which India
had a share of more than 100m kg, about half its total exports. But both
figures fell sharply last year.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has warned the association that it
will be a long time before the former Soviet economies recover and that tea
exporters should look for alternative markets.
But Mr HP Barooah, chairman of the ITA, fears that if India does not stick
it out in the Commonwealth of Independent States other exporting countries
will capture the market.
According to Mr Singh, a domestic market of more than 500m kg a year should
have given the Indian industry confidence to explore the more competitive
markets, like Europe, the US, west Asia and north Africa. 'Instead, the
industry chose the easy path of exporting a disproportionate amount to the
former Soviet Union,' he said. Last year, India could export only 22.6m kg
of tea to the UK and 2.6m kg to the US.
The minister regrets that while world trade in tea has increased to 1,100m
kg from 400m kg in the 1950s, India's share has fallen to 20 per cent from
44 per cent, with exports stagnating at about 200m kg.

ALL JUTE producing countries except for China will be harvesting smaller
crops in the current season.
In India, the biggest producer, production is forecast to decline to 1.17m
tonnes from 1.62m tonnes in 1991-92, according to Mr RN De, the country's
jute commissioner. Bangladesh, which falls within the same climatic zone as
eastern India, is expected to have a crop of 828,000 tonnes, down from
949,000 tonnes last season. The Thai and Nepalese crops of kenaf (a
jute-like hard fibre) are expected to be marginally lower at 161,000 tonnes
and 11,000 tonnes respectively. But Chinese production of raw jute is
forecast to rise 7,000 tonnes to 520,000 tonnes.
The Dhaka-based International Jute Organisation, which has made these
production estimates, thinks falling prices of raw jute are primarily
responsible for the setback in output. Jute farmers outside China have
reduced the land under jute this season: in India from 2.55m to 2m acres
(800,000 hectares); in Bangladesh from 1.45m to 1.24m acres. Thailand's
kenaf area has declined to 303,000 acres from 345,000, while Nepal's has
fallen from 38,300 acres to 23,500. China's jute area has remained at
741,000 acres.
According to Mr De, the shrinking world trade in raw jute has hit the jute
economy badly. World trade in the fibre declined from 459,700 tonnes in
1989-90 to 350,500 tonnes in 1990-91 and 327,600 tonnes in 1991-92.

A CHANGE of sentiment brought a general rise in base metals prices on the
London Metal Exchange yesterday. ALUMINIUM moved back to the highs, reacting
to confirmation, after early doubts, that the giant Tajikistan aluminium
smelter was all but closed. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,199 as tonne,
up Dollars 17.50 on the day. ZINC lost some of its early gains after
Germany's Metallgesellschaft denied it had production problems, but cash
metal closed Dollars 9 higher at Dollars 1,082 a tonne.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Declining milk production lifts
powder and cheese prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DECLINING WORLD milk production has pushed up prices of milk powder and
cheese over the past two years, but butter prices remain depressed by
falling consumption and the high level of stocks, according to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In its annual report on world dairy markets, published today, Gatt says
world milk production fell 2.1 per cent in 1991 and is expected to fall
another 1-2 per cent in 1992. This reflects efforts by the European
Community and other western European countries to contain milk deliveries
and the 'virtual collapse' of the commercial market in Russia and eastern
and central Europe.
The result has been a firming of milk powder prices from mid-1991 and a
rapid reduction in stocks of skimmed milk powder this year.
World cheese trade remains buoyant, fuelled by a steady increase in demand.
World market prices rose by an annual 13-16 per cent in 1991 and 1992, Gatt
estimates.
However, world butter production shrank by 4.2 per cent in 1991 and is
expected to drop by a further 2.5 per cent in 1992. Despite this, prices
remain depressed at, or only slightly above, agreed minimum prices in 1991
and 1992. Consumption continues to slow, partly because of the trend to
lower-fat diets in the West, and stocks remain relatively high.
Gatt points out that commercial sales of butter in international markets
have been very limited in the past couple of years, mainly because the
former Soviet Union, the world's biggest butter importer, can no longer
afford to buy at market prices.
Russia also took less than 60 per cent of authorised sales of cheap butter
in 1991 and in 1992 bought only a small quantity of butter, almost all of it
under a US credit guarantee programme.
Commenting on dairy policies, Gatt says there is now 'an almost universal
trend towards increased liberalisation and less governmental interference',
which has seen a reduction of subsidies and price supports to curb costly
surpluses.
In many industrialised countries the numbers of dairy farms and cows are
declining, though this is being partially offset by rising production in the
third world.
India is now the third largest producer, after the EC and the US, and China
could well become the world's second largest developing country producer by
the beginning of the next century.

FT  27 NOV 92 / The Property Market: Rooms to let - Vanessa Houlder examines
the increasingly bleak outlook for Europe's battered markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property recession in Europe is gathering pace. The malaise that has
swept through its overheated markets over the past three years has now
gripped Germany, until recently one of the last bastions of stability.
Across Europe, prime offices fell in value by 5.2 per cent in the third
quarter this year, bringing the decline over the past year to 18.7 per cent,
according to UK-based property consultants Richard Ellis.
Estimates vary, but office values have fallen from their peak by between 5
per cent and 10 per cent in Germany, 25 per cent in Paris, 20 per cent-plus
in Madrid, 10 per cent-20 per cent in Milan and by 50 per cent in the UK.
The downturn is scarcely surprising. At a time of high real interest rates
across Europe and increasing concern about recession, it would be remarkable
if property markets were not feeling the pressure. The nature of the market,
notably its long planning and building periods, forces the sector to endure
deeper troughs than other industries.
But the problems go deeper than the recession. Continental European markets
have more in common with the volatile US and British markets than is often
assumed. The problems created by inflated prices and a surge in credit and
construction activity in recent years have proved more damaging than
expected at the time.
In any event, although vacancy rates in continental markets have risen
sharply recently, they are unlikely to even remotely match the record levels
in the US and Britain.
In Paris, 2.5m square metres - some 6 per cent - of the total stock is
vacant. This figure could rise to 10 per cent, says Jones Lang Wootton,
chartered surveyors.
In Madrid, vacant space has increased to 412,000 sq m (7 per cent of the
total stock), with a further 277,000 sq m under construction, according to
Richard Ellis. Some 400,000 sq m are due to come on stream during 1992-93,
half of which is on the outskirts of Madrid in developments such as Campo de
las Naciones or La Moraleja and Las Rozas Business Parks.
In Germany, the diverse nature of the property market, which is spread
between five cities, strict controls on bank lending on property and a
generally restrictive planning structure, have kept supply low by European
standards. Nonetheless there is concern about developments on the outskirts
of Munich, while in Frankfurt the current vacancy level - 3 per cent - could
rise to 5 per cent by the end of next year. The speculative frenzy that was
unleashed after German unification in October 1990 has raised serious doubts
among property agents about the possibility of future oversupply in Berlin.
Now that most west European markets have slowed down, there is much
uncertainty about prospects for recovery. Doubts persist over crucial
elements of the international economy, such as the European exchange rate
mechanism, the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on closer European
union, and the stalled international trade liberalisation talks.
In spite of this economic gloom, Germany is likely to remain the most
resilient of Europe's large property markets, while the UK will remain
Europe's worst hit - even though sterling's exit from the exchange rate
mechanism in September has allowed the British government to lower interest
rates by three percentage points, accelerating hopes that the property
downturn may soon be bottoming out.
In Spain, one source of comfort is the relatively low level of borrowing of
the leading investors and developers. One notable exception is Prima
Inmobilaria, the Spanish property group which over-extended itself by buying
property during the heady days.
Of the continental markets, Paris probably gives the greatest cause for
concern. Its problems dates back to the late 1980s when - as in London  -
banks, rather than investors, dominated the market. Banks lent
enthusiastically to property because the sector appeared to offer profitable
returns at a time of intense competition. Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, estimates that average margins on French property loans were 3 per
cent compared with average margins of 0.1 per cent on corporate lending in
1989.
French property loans have risen to FFr215bn in 1992, up from FFr63bn in
1988, says Goldman Sachs. Provisions for bad property loans could rise to 5
per cent of the total loan book, it adds.
Attention in France is particularly focused on the FFr75bn lent to
highly-geared small and medium-sized brokers which entered the market as
small-scale developers in the late 1980s. These developers have been badly
hit because they are under-capitalised and do not have large rental income
or parent companies to cushion them during the downturn.
Although most continental markets vary in terms of lease agreements, the
structure of the investment market and banking practices, many of the
property trends have a common origin: namely the increasingly international
outlook of banks, investors and tenants at the end of the 1980s.
At the same time, one of the factors influencing the rise in rents in most
European capitals was the rapid expansion of corporate activity ahead of the
creation of a barrier-free European market in 1993. High rents in Europe
were underlined by a recent survey which found that 12 of the 17 most
expensive office locations in the world were in Europe.
Another influence forcing values up was a surge in cross-border investment
activity, itself the result of a relation in investment controls in Europe.
As well as pan-European investment, funds flowing into the European
Community, particularly from Japan, rose from Pounds 820m in 1985 to Pounds
4bn in 1989, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
In France, for example, foreign inward investment doubled between 1989 and
1990, with the Japanese among the more prominent investors. In the UK, 30
per cent of all institutional property was owned by non-British groups by
the end of the 1980s. And in Spain, a surge in economic growth, the
country's admission to the EC in 1986 and the lifting of restrictive rent
laws in 1985, attracted inward foreign investment.
The pricking of the bubble throughout Europe was prompted in part by the
retreat of international investors, many of which were increasingly burdened
with problems in their home markets.
Yet as so often, the German experience has bucked the trend. In recent
months there has been a flurry of investment by German buyers in the London
office market. This is seen by many analysts as a tentative sign that the UK
 -the hardest hit market in Europe - may have seen the worst.

FT  27 NOV 92 / The Property Market: Rental values slip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of the decline in the property market slackened in October,
according to the Investment Property Databank's monthly index of 1,418
properties with a total value of Pounds 2.5bn.
Total returns climbed back to zero for October, up by more than half a point
from last month. There was little movement in yields, but rental values
dropped by 1.2 percentage points over the month, the single largest fall
this year.
For the year to October, rental values fell by 8.6 per cent. London and the
south-east were the hardest hit regions with rental falls of 18.7 per cent
and 9.6 per cent respectively, while for the rest of the UK the fall was
contained to 1.9 per cent. In central London, 85 per cent of all office
properties were over-rented.
Offices are still the worst performing sector. London offices had a
year-on-year total return of -11.7 per cent, compared with -5.2 per cent for
the south-east and 1.5 per cent for the rest of the country.
The retail sector made a slight recovery in October, with an unchanged yield
of 9.0 per cent and total returns back into positive figures at 0.4 per
cent.
The industrial sector posted a total return of zero, with an unchanged yield
of 11.3 per cent. Rental values and capital values fell 1.3 per cent and 0.8
per cent respectively.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Sharp rise in short-term interest rates
weakens Irish gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES in the Irish gilts market slipped yesterday due to a sharp rise in
short-term interest rates and uncertainty over the formation of the next
government following Wednesday's election.
Following the suspension of its key interest rate, the short-term facility,
earlier this week, the central bank yesterday announced its short-term
borrowings would rise to 30 per cent today and to 100 per cent on Monday in
a move designed to curb speculation over a devaluation of the currency.
Meanwhile, the market could be further affected if wranglings over the
formation of the next government, following this week's election, prove
protracted. Whatever the outcome, there is expected to be little effect on
supply in the gilts market, since all parties are committed to staying
within Maastricht guidelines on policy.
There was speculation yesterday that if, as seems likely, the Labour party
helps form a new coalition government, the chances of a speedy devaluation
could be increased. In any case, many analysts believe that the current
situation is becoming untenable.
THE German bond market lost early gains on news of another bad regional
consumer price index figure. The CPI in Bavaria showed at 0.6 per cent rise
for November. Analysts said that meant that German inflation was likely to
remain at 3.7 per cent at the end of this year, but was bound to rise above
4 per cent, when value-added tax increases started to come through.
The Bundesbank's failure to lower rates yesterday held no surprises. 'The
only thing that could make the Bundesbank move now is a desire to save the
exchange-rate mechanism,' said one analyst.
The bund future ended unchanged, but the Euro-D-Mark contract fell 10 ticks
as any hopes of a rate cut fell further.
IN London, the gilts market ended slightly lower ahead of next week's Pounds
2.5bn auction of new 10-year 8 per cent stock. The new stock is free of tax
for residents abroad. Although the market has cheapened ahead of the
auction, it is 'fairly well underpinned,' according to Mr Phillip Tyson,
bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'Investors are reluctant to reduce
exposure while prospects for short term rates remain good.'
FRENCH bonds ended unchanged, after a dull day's trading. The pressure on
the currency appears to have faded, and the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the
US further reduced activity in the French and other markets.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest to open capital
markets side in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank, the UK clearer, plans to open a capital markets
operation in Frankfurt in the first half of next year in the latest move to
expand away from its sterling-dominated base.
For NatWest, the move represents a renewed attempt to build a broad-based
business in the debt markets, after a decision only three years ago to focus
almost exclusively on sterling.
'In the long term, we would have to aim at being an issuing house in
D-Marks,' said Mr Gary Southern, head of capital markets.
'But we would want to avoid the standard mistake of rushing in when everyone
else is rushing in as well.'
The weakness of UK banks in the D-Mark was emphasised last month when the UK
government chose Deutsche Bank to lead a DM5bn Eurobond issue.
British banks similarly played only a minor role when the UK raised Ecus in
1990.
The initial purpose of the German operation will be to strengthen contacts
with German customers and find ways to arbitrage between the domestic German
and international markets, said Mr Southern. The bank is currently seeking
approval from the German authorities for its plans.
The derailing of the Ecu bond market in recent weeks has forced many banks
to review their strategies in the European capital markets, forcing them to
put more resources into their coverage of domestic markets, Mr Southern
said.
'We've upgraded our thinking on markets in Europe,' he said. 'My sense is
that a number of houses feel they have to commit more to domestic markets.'
NatWest plans to limit its investment in overseas domestic markets, though,
in an attempt to avoid the mistake of overexpansion it and other banks made
in the 1980s.
The bank recently announced the acquisition of the Milan branch of
Continental Bank, bringing it a capital markets presence in Italy, but has
no plans to expand into France.
'The French banks do a remarkably good job as trading houses in their own
centre. They don't leave a lot of room for foreign banks coming in,' said Mr
Southern.

<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Securities Japan, Tokyo arm of the US securities house, has
realigned its Japanese equity operations as a result of the Tokyo stock
market's weakness.
Japanese equities will no longer be a strategic core of operations,
Prudential said. It has reduced the number of staff by 40 to 100.
Mr James Walsh, regional director of the Asia Pacific region, said the
weakness of the Tokyo stock market represented a fundamental change of
investment flows in Japan, and the financial services industry needed to
undergo a long-term change.
Trading volumes remained low and commissions at Japanese and foreign brokers
alike had fallen steeply. Foreign houses were finding it increasingly
difficult to justify the high costs of Tokyo operations, Prudential said.
Prudential said it would continue to provide institutional clients with a
Japanese equity service, while focusing on US equities and international
bonds sales. It will retain its membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as
the only non-Japanese member of the exchange's board.

Westpac Banking

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATED Press Holdings (ConsPress), Mr Kerry Packer's privately-owned
publishing group, yesterday emerged as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake
in Westpac Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank.
The shareholding, worth ADollars 434m (USDollars 299.3m) at last night's
closing price of ADollars 2.99, is close to the 10 per cent ceiling placed
on individual shareholdings by Westpac's deed of settlement and federal
banking law. ConsPress could move to 15 per cent ownership of Westpac, but
only with the approval of both the board and Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer
(finance minister).
Mr Packer, who is travelling abroad, was not available for comment. Mr Al
Dunlap, managing director of ConsPress, said Westpac was 'a very good
company, with great potential'. Mr John Uhrig, Westpac chairman, said the
bank was very pleased to have Mr Packer as a shareholder. He said the
ConsPress holding would add stability to the share register.
Mr Packer was also welcomed by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest
financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of Westpac. Mr Ian Salmon,
managing director, said Westpac was 'a strong company with an excellent
future, and it is pleasing that Mr Packer shares that view'.
ConsPress said it had acquired the rights to 145.16m Westpac shares since it
began buying in mid-October. The stake comprises 4.61 per cent of Westpac's
ordinary shares and 3.66 per cent in the form of options.
Buying by ConsPress pushed Westpac shares briefly above ADollars 3
yesterday, for the first time in two months. The shares fell back in later
trading to close 1 cent higher on the day.
ConsPress has been rumoured to be acquiring Westpac shares since the failure
in October of the bank's ADollars 1.72bn rights issue. The issue closed 72
per cent undersubscribed, leaving many sub-underwriters holding unwanted
shares.
Analysts said Mr Packer's investment was likely to provide a significant
lift for the shares, which fell to a low of about ADollars 2.65 last week
after the group announced a record net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year
to September. The shares were trading at about ADollars 4.50 at the start of
the year.
ConsPress gave no indication of its motives in buying Westpac shares.
Analysts said Mr Packer would probably seek a seat on the board, but would
be prevented from seeking control by the law and the bank's deed of
settlement.
Mr Packer may be counting on a takeover bid for Westpac by one of the other
three Australian banks, National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New
Zealand banking Group (ANZ) and Commonwealth Bank.
The banks are excluded from the legal restriction on bank shareholdings, but
are prevented from bidding for each other by a separate government policy
which bans mergers between the six largest financial institutions.

<TEXT>
MR BRUCE Hancox, a principal architect of the coup two years ago that ousted
Sir Ron Brierley as chairman of New Zealand's biggest investment company,
Brierley Investment (BIL), was him-self replaced yesterday.
The new chairman is Mr Bob Matthew, another Brierley director and chairman
of Air New Zealand, who is to relinquish executive tasks within the BIL
group.
The changeover, announced at the group's annual meeting yesterday, sparked
speculation that Mr Hancox was replaced because of market perceptions that
he was too outspoken on political and other issues and was spending too much
time on his private business - a charge he denied.
Mr Hancox also said there had been 'no coup' against him because he had
never wanted to be chair-man.
Mr Matthew is a prominent and highly successful businessman. At Air New
Zealand, he oversaw the restructuring of the airline, now one of the world's
most profitable companies in its sector.
He said yesterday he intended to take an equally active role as chairman of
BIL.
Other changes in the board included the appointment of Mr Robert Peel, chief
executive of Mount Charlotte, BIL's biggest investment.
Mr Andrew Meehan has also been appointed an executive director. He is one of
the country's best known bankers and was previously chief executive of
Southpac, the New Zealand merchant bank subsidiary of Lloyds Bank of the UK.

<TEXT>
MATRA, the French telecommunications-to-transport group, yesterday agreed to
exchange assets with the French subsidiary of Fiat, the Italian carmaker, as
part of a strategy of focusing on its mainstream businesses.
Matra is to hand to Fiat France its 35 per cent stake in Ufima, a maker of
automotive components which is already 65 per cent owned by Magnetti
Marelli, Fiat's components offshoot.
Magnetti Marelli has nine plants in France employing 5,000 people,
generating FFr3.5bn sales (Dollars 640m), equivalent to 22 per cent of its
total turnover.
In exchange, Fiat France is to hand to Matra its 13.72 per cent stake in
Labinal, a French producer of gas turbines, aerospace components and
electrical connectors. On top of this, Fiat France is to pay Matra FFr40m,
to make up for the difference in value between the two share stakes.
Matra has been reorganising its business portfolio recently, with the sale
of a large minority stake in its telecommunications business last July to
Northern Telecom of Canada.
Matra said yesterday that the disposal of its Ufima stake was in line with
its decision to get out of automotive electronics, no longer seen as of
strategic interest to the group.
Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM), the French state-owned freight transport
group, said its holding company, CGMF, would sell the 65.25 per cent stake
it has in Financiere de l'Atlantique to Compagnie d'Investissements et de
Participations (CIP), a holding company, Reuter reports from Paris.

NATIONAL Mutual, the Australian insurance and investment group, is to
receive HKDollars 765m (USDollars 98.6m) in direct proceeds from the
flotation of its Hong Kong subsidiary.
The HKDollars 1.08bn flotation of National Mutual Asia (NMA) will be the
largest new issue in Hong Kong since Mr Rupert Murdoch raised HKDollars
2.26bn from the public offer and placement of 49 per cent of News
Corporation's South China Morning Post newspaper group in June 1990.
NMA has placed out existing shares representing 10.4 per cent of the company
to institutional investors. A further 15.6 per cent of the enlarged company
is being offered to the public, the majority in old shares. National Mutual
will retain 74 per cent control.
NMA was set up in Hong Kong in 1986 and has grown to be one of the two
leading life assurance companies in the colony, along with American
International Assurance. It has a 35 per cent market share.
The company will receive HKDollars 297m from the share issue, to enable it
to expand its business both in Hong Kong and the south-east Asian region.
However, the flotation has been more beneficial to its parent. NMA paid out
its first dividend, of HKDollars 154.4m, for the year to September 1992.
This was in addition to the substantial proceeds from the sale of its
existing shares.
The pre-placement of NMA shares was well received by international
institutions, and analysts expect the flotation to be fully subscribed.
NMA recorded 169 per cent profits growth in the year to September 1991 and a
further 27 per cent increase to HKDollars 355.6m in 1992. The prospectus
forecast is for HKDollars 410m profit in 1993, putting the share offer on a
prospective price-earnings ratio of 9.95.

ANGLO American, South Africa's largest company, is maintaining its interim
dividend at 90 cents per share despite an 11 per cent fall in attributable
profits to R581m (Dollars 193m) for the six months to the end of September.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, predicted earnings would fall more in
the second half owing to a 'downturn in world economies together with
unsettled local political and economic conditions'.
Anglo's investment earnings rose marginally to R641m from R630m, due mainly
to higher dividend income from gold mining interests, which contributed 27
per cent of investment income. The higher dividends reflected increased gold
production and well-contained costs. Anglo is the world's largest gold
producer.
Dividends from platinum interests - in Rustenburg Platinum, the world's
largest producer - fell on the weaker rhodium price.
Trading profits fell by 8 per cent to R229m, due mainly to a decline at
Anglo American Coal.
Earnings per share fell to 251 cents from 282 cents.
With the retained earnings of associated companies falling to R523m from
R611m - reflecting recessionary conditions in the diamond, platinum,
industrial and base metal industries - the group's equity-accounted earnings
fell by 13 per cent to R1.1bn.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson noted that, over the reporting period, Anglo's
associate, De Beers, had opened the R1.1bn Venetia diamond mine;
shaft-sinking had started at the R1.7bn Moab gold mining project; the R1bn
Namakwa Sands heavy minerals project got the go-ahead; and the Anglo group
announced plans to participate in the Collahuasi copper venture in Chile.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has identified its next generation of top
executives with the election of five new senior vice-presidents, from among
whose ranks the successor to Mr John Akers, chairman and chief executive, is
expected to be chosen.
Mr Akers will reach 60, the traditional retirement age for IBM executives,
in December 1994.
Speculation about his successor has been rife for the past year, but the new
appointments appear to narrow the field to a handful of the company's top
managers, all of whom are in their late 40s.
The five are: Ms Ellen Hancock, 49, general manager of the networking
systems division, and the first woman to be elevated to the level of senior
vice-president at IBM; Mr James Cannavino, 48, general manager of the
personal systems division, which includes personal computers and
workstations; Mr Robert LaBant, 47, general manager of US operations; Mr Ned
Lautenbach, 48, president of IBM Asia Pacific; and Mr Bernard Puckett, 48,
general manager of the applications solutions division.
Notably absent from the line-up is Mr Nick Donofrio, general manager of the
enterprise systems division, which develops and manufactures mainframe
computers, IBM's traditional flagship products.
Within IBM, the bets are on Mr Robert LaBant, who was assistant to Mr Akers
from 1983 to 1987. In 1990, he became general manager of application
business systems, overseeing one of IBM's most successful lines, the AS/400
mid-range computer products.
Also named by insiders as a likely successor to Mr Akers is Mr Bernard
Puckett, a former head of IBM's corporate strategy and planning, who took up
his current position last year. Mr Puckett is said to be playing a key role
in IBM's efforts to establish closer links with its customers.

CREDITORS of Central Capital, once a fast-growing financial services group
with assets of CDollars 17bn (USDollars 13.2bn), have approved a final
restructuring plan to avoid bankruptcy. Most company operations have been
taken over by the secured creditors, led by the Royal Bank of Canada, to
satisfy CDollars 1.1bn in borrowings.
In effect, the founders and controlling shareholders, Mr Reuben Cohen and Mr
Leonard Ellen, are left with 10 per cent of the company. Unsecured creditors
get 90 per cent of the equity, plus CDollars 21m in new debt securities.
Court approval is being sought next month.

write-downs

<TEXT>
THE recession and a heavy write-down of loans to the Olympia &amp; York group
reduced final-quarter profits at National Bank of Canada.
Net income in the quarter was CDollars 39m (USDollars 30.4m), or 23 cents a
share, against CDollars 41m, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on
equity was 9 per cent, against 9.4 per cent, and return on average assets
0.38 per cent against 0.45 per cent.
For the year ended October 1992, net income was CDollars 1m, equal to a loss
of 29 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends. This compares with
net income of CDollars 186m, or CDollars 1.20 a share, in 1990-91. The drop
was due to Dollars 570m in loan losses, including a CDollars 350m write-down
in loans to O&amp;Y taken in the third quarter.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Overcapacity is catalyst behind
PVC merger - Hoechst's and Wacker-Chemie's venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and CHRISTOPHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's announcement by Hoechst, the German chemicals giant, that it was
to merge its PVC business with Wacker-Chemie is likely to be the first in a
series of rationalisations within this troubled DM6bn (Dollars 3.7bn)
industry.
The outlook for European PVC producers is bleak. None is making money due to
massive overcapacity.
Last year, European demand for PVC, a plastic widely used in the
construction industry and in packaging, fell about 4 per cent to 5.3m
tonnes, according to Mr Erich Schnitzler, executive vice-president of PVC at
Hoechst.
But that result was achieved when French and German markets were still
buoyant. German demand had been rising fast at about 5 per cent, while in
France and Italy it had been about 4 per cent. The German economy, Europe's
largest, is now slowing, as demonstrated by the poor third-quarter results
posted by the German chemicals groups.
Hoechst said there had been no sign of improvement in the market in the
short or medium terms. 'This makes it necessary to use all possibilities for
reducing costs, especially through rationalisation,' the company added.
The collapse in PVC demand has been aggravated by rising levels of imports
which, according to chemical industry consultants Tecnon, used to represent
4 per cent of the west European market but have now reached about 12 per
cent. Imports were about 515,000 tonnes in 1990 and could be as high as
700,000 tonnes this year. Nearly half of PVC imports are from eastern
European suppliers. Western European exports are also falling.
Not surprisingly, prices have been under pressure. In Germany, Europe's
largest market, the price of pipe-grade PVC slumped last year from about
DM1.75 a kilogramme to DM1.
Attempts to increase prices by about 30 per cent this year not only failed
but led to a cartel investigation by the European Commission.
Even that increase, if successful, would not have led to profitability for
most manufacturers. The industry reckons it needs prices of about DM1.45 to
break even.
Mr Mike Stanley at Tecnon estimates prices have now fallen to between DM1.03
and DM1.07, from an average of DM1.17 during the second quarter. Some
suppliers are selling below DM1. The position of German producers has been
aggravated by the recent appreciation of the D-Mark.
In this context, rationalisation and plant closures have become imperative.
Hoechst has made the first move. A candidate for disposal is Imperial
Chemical Industries' 50 per cent stake in EVC, its PVC joint venture with
Enichem of Italy, which is Europe's largest manufacturer. Those clearly
committed to the sector include Solvay of Belgium and Atochem of France.
Hoechst says the merger of the PVC business with that of Wacker-Chemie will
allow it to gain critical mass and save costs. The new 50-50 joint venture
company will take over all the PVC activities of both groups, excluding only
Hoechst's PVC film business.
Wacker-Chemie has annual PVC capacity of 365,000 tonnes a year, compared
with Hoechst's 250,000 tonnes. The groups have four PVC plants between them,
which in 1991 turned over DM880m and employ 1,400 people. Hoechst, which
plans 'three-figure' job cuts next year, gave no indications of how many
might go as a result of the merger.
According to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, Hoechst chairman, the new company would
have a 10 per cent share of west European output and could generate
synergistic savings of DM50m a year.
Such savings look to be increasingly necessary. Hoechst estimates European
demand will grow at only 0.5 per cent a year over the next five years.
Clearly, price rises and further rationalisation will be necessary if the
market is to move back into the black.

solve problems

<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the struggling Brazilian airline VASP, privatised in 1990, has
agreed to step down if he is unable to resolve the company's severe
financial problems within 90 days.
Mr Wagner Canhedo, majority shareholder and president of VASP, agreed to the
move at a meeting with federal and state officials, stockholder
representatives and union leaders.
Mr Canhedo bought 60 per cent of the airline from Sao Paulo state in the
privatisation. The state remains the largest minority shareholder, followed
by an employee fund. State and federal officials are opposed to public
intervention to rescue the airline, Brazil's second-largest carrier.
VASP's most important suppliers of leased aircraft have repossessed their
airliners. Negotiations continue over 13 grounded aircraft owned by Guiness
Peat Aviation (GPA) of Ireland - itself facing a debt rescheduling - and
nine owned by Ansett Worldwide Leasing, a US-based subsidiary of the
Australian company.
The accord with Mr Canhedo must be agreed by Mr Luis Antonio Fleury,
governor of Sao Paulo state. Mr Fleury, who is on a visit to Europe, told
the FT in London yesterday that he would not accept the proposal before
hearing the results of an auditor's report into the airline's finances. He
insisted that VASP would not be returned to state ownership.
VASP has maintained international flights but has been forced to juggle
domestic schedules. The airline's total debt is about Dollars 800m, up from
Dollars 700m when Mr Canhedo took over. Last year it lost Dollars 214m.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ferfin chief goes in Ferruzzi
management shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ferruzzi family yesterday announced a management shake-up giving it full
operational control of its agro-industrial, chemicals and energy group,
Italy's second-largest private empire.
The central element in the change is the departure of Mr Giuseppe Garofano
as chief executive officer of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the family's
controlling company, and president of Montedison, the main subsidiary.
Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, already head of Ferfin, will become chairman of
Montedison, and Mr Carlo Sama, his brother-in-law and vice-chairman of
Ferfin, will become chief executive officer of Montedison.
The two companies will thus have the same senior management structure and
personnel with effect from January 1993, headed by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi and
run by Mr Sama.
The change has been agreed amicably with Mr Garofano, who was promoted from
the management of Montedison in November 1990 to steer the family group
after the acrimonious departure of Mr Raul Gardini, who had married one of
Arturo Ferruzzi's three sisters.
'This step has been agreed with the shareholders for some time,' Mr Garofano
said yesterday.
He underlined it was an opportune moment to step aside following the group's
outline agreement on a major plastics joint venture with Shell in September.
Mr Garofano has had the difficult task of rationalising the aggressive
expansion of Ferruzzi-Montedison under Mr Gardini's leadership. This year's
first-half results for Montedison saw the group move into a loss of L188bn
(Dollars 136m) against net profits of L108bn in the same period in 1991.
Mr Garofano will be retained in a consultant's role with Ferruzzi and will
remain on the Montedison board and as vice-president of Ferfin. Aged 49, Mr
Garofano is now likely to be free to play a major role in the Italian
government's forthcoming programme of privatisation.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Metro gets go-ahead for Asko
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S federal competition authorities yesterday reversed their decision
to stop Metro, the privately-owned Swiss retail giant, from buying a
majority stake in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, a large German retailer.
The reversal, coming just over two weeks after the Bundeskartellamt ruled
that the merger would have been uncompetitive, paves the way for the
creation of one of the world's largest retail groups with combined sales of
more than DM70bn (Dollars 44bn).
The Berlin-based competition authorities have given their go-ahead to the
transaction because the two companies have given binding undertakings to
sell off businesses with turnover of DM1.3bn, a relatively small share of
the two companies' total sales in Germany which exceed DM50bn.
The authorities originally said that the transaction would have given the
new grouping anti-competitive market dominance in certain parts of Germany
in a number of different retail sectors. However, the proposed sales of
businesses in food, furniture and DIY sectors are enough to remove the
original worries, the cartel office has decided.
A statement from Mr Erwin Conradi, Metro's chief executive, said that the
forced sales would be painful and lead to a serious weakening of its market
position in a number of sectors. He said, however, that the fusion would
lead to meaningful synergies between the two groups.
The stock market welcomed the new yesterday, and Asko's shares rose from
DM500 to DM533 on the assumption that the companies would benefit from the
tie-up. Asko lost DM269m last year on sales of nearly DM20bn, reflecting
write-offs on acquisitions and share stakes. Sales had risen 64 per cent
from 1991, reflecting the acquisition of the Co-op retail group.
Metro, which reported turnover of DM46bn last year, was founded by Mr Otto
Beisheim, who copied the 'cash and carry' concept from the US and opened his
first store in Germany in 1964. Although the company subsequently moved its
headquarters to Switzerland, it expanded rapidly and aggressively in Germany
and it owns majority stakes in a number of German retailers, including the
quoted Kaufhof and Kaufhalle.
Metro announced it wanted to acquire a majority in Asko in July. The move
has the support of Asko's management and although Metro's direct stake in
Asko is only 11 per cent, it is thought to have accumulated more than 50 per
cent via indirect holdings.

<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, expects to post a loss for the year,
reversing forecasts of a 'modest' profit.
The company gave no figures but said the full-year net result would be
considerably better than the Fl 117m (Dollars 65m) net loss posted in 1991
before the inclusion of book profits on divestments.
Overall, Nedlloyd posted a net profit of Fl 145m in 1991, thanks to
extensive book profits of Fl 263m. The company has already said that
proceeds from divestments would be limited this year.
After barely breaking even in the 1992 first half with a net profit of Fl
1m, Nedlloyd said its unpublished third-quarter results had been
'disappointing but positive'.
Nedlloyd blamed the downturn on a further weakening of economic conditions
in key markets since it issued its previous profit prediction in mid-August.
The company forecast that its ocean-shipping sector, which recorded an
operating profit of Fl 44m in 1991, would post a small operating loss for
1992. This was due to lower freight rates in its container logistics
business.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, is to join forces with the French
companies Thomson and Sagem in an attempt to break Japanese dominance of the
world market for advanced liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), widely used in
small portable televisions and lap-top computers.
The three European companies said yesterday that they will pool their
efforts in active matrix LCDs - which make possible the use of colour moving
pictures, unlike passive LCDs which are common in digital watches and hi-fi
equipment.
Philips is to own 80 per cent of the joint venture, with 10 per cent each to
be held by Thomson and Sagem.
The Dutch company, which already has a pilot LCD plant in its home town of
Eindhoven and which is currently building a factory nearby for commercial
production, also said it plans to acquire a 10 per cent stake in Sagem, but
it gave no financial details.
The world's commercial production of active matrix LCDs is the preserve of
Japanese companies, particularly Sharp, Toshiba and Hitachi.
European producers of consumer electronics such as Thomson and Philips
currently have to turn to Japanese suppliers for commercial quantities of
LCDs.
The new joint venture, which will start operations in January, aims to
manufacture active matrix LCDs for its three parent companies as well as for
third parties.
'Turnover is expected to reach the level of some hundreds of millions of
guilders in the coming years,' Philips said.
At first, the venture's production process is to be based on Philips
technology but eventually it will switch to technology co-developed by
Sagem.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Grupo Torras defaults on Dollars
400m loans
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER BRUCE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office
(KIO), has defaulted this week on a Dollars 200m loan from Credit Suisse and
another Dollars 200m credit from Bank of America. The KIO is obliged to
repay the debt, further deepening the crisis surrounding its Spanish empire.
The defaults come as the Torras board, chaired by Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader,
president of the KIO, met in London yesterday to consider placing the Torras
group in receivership. Torras, which owns controlling stakes in some of
Spain's biggest manufacturing companies, has debts of more than Dollars 3bn,
its management says.
It is understood that the KIO auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, and its lawyers,
Stephenson Harwood, have told the KIO that placing Torras under judicial
management would be a viable way of extracting the Kuwaitis from Spanish
commitments entered into by the KIO's former management and its Spanish
partners.
The problem with receivership is that it might reflect badly on the books of
the KIO, which has loans outstanding to Torras. Also it is not certain that
these loans would be given preferential treatment by the receivers as they
could be regarded as equity. Some analysts believe talk of a possible
receivership might be designed to frighten bank creditors into renegotiating
loans through the entire Torras group.
A senior adviser to the KIO in London denied reports that a firm decision
had been made to begin legal action against Mr Javier de la Rosa, the KIO's
former business partner in Spain, and the two former KIO leaders who
directed the Spanish investments - Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO former general
manager, and Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, who retired as KIO chairman last
February.
Stephenson Harwood and Peat Marwick have completed a preliminary
investigation into allegations by the new KIO management that the Dollars
3.4bn invested in Spain between 1986 and last May was misappropriated.
The KIO says it has seen no return on those investments. A Spanish lawyer
has been hired to study the report and to decide whether legal action is
viable. KIO sources said this could take up to two months.
Although the default notices this week from Credit Suisse and Bank of
America on the Torras loans automatically trigger guarantees by the KIO,
they also reflect the deepening concern in international banking circles
about how the new KIO and Torras management is dealing with the crisis.
Credit Suisse on Tuesday cited Torras' decision a month ago not to approve
its 1991 accounts as a reason for calling in its loan, plus more than
Dollars 2m in interest.

<TEXT>
CASTINGS, the West Midlands-based iron castings producer, announced a fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.59m in the six months to
September 30, as the depth of the recession dented its long record of solid
profits growth.
Turnover fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 16.9m), and tightening margins reduced
operating profit to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.45m).
Mr Brian Cooke, chairman, said 'good cash management' led to an increase in
other income to Pounds 282,704 (Pounds 246,137), which would have been
higher if not for lower interest rates.
Castings' foundries were operating at an average of 70 to 75 per cent of
full capacity. The group shed about 10 per cent of its 1,000-strong
workforce in the half-year as costs were cut.
The interim dividend is held at 1.3p, against a drop in earnings per share
from 5.5p to 5.05p.

In North America profitability had been improved substantially.
Earnings per share rose to 1.84p (1.01p). The interim dividend is again

Tomkinsons, the yarn and carpet group, blamed the 'continuing low level of
consumer confidence and spending' for an 18 per cent decline in annual
profits.
On turnover down to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 21.3m), the pre-tax line for the 12

However, Mr Lowry Maclean, chairman, described the performance as

Although overseas markets remained difficult, exports increased by 13.5 per

A proposed final dividend of 8p maintains the total at 11.5p, uncovered by

ensure our competitiveness, but our already tight ship has meant relatively
few redundancies.'
There had been a review of marketing and associated strategyat Benair and
Channel Express in the distribution division, which had reinforced the
strategy for growth.
Channel Express Air Services, which operates freighter aircraft on UK and
European contracts, had to make savings to maintain competitiveness.
Earnings per share came to 4.4p (5.9p) and the interim dividend is held at
1.3p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Southnews improves 32% to Pounds 651,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Southnews, the USM-quoted London regional newspaper
publisher, increased by 32 per cent, from Pounds 494,000 to Pounds 651,000,
in the six months to September 28.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up by just Pounds 41,000 to Pounds
7.19m and was boosted by a reduction in the interest charge from Pounds
157,000 to Pounds 20,000.
The directors said that in September the bank balance became positive for
the first time since 1988, and would remain so for the foreseeable future.
The company also announced the sale of its publishing interests in Worthing,
West Sussex, and this marked the completion of the programme of disposals of
titles in peripheral geographical areas.
The proceeds of the sale would added to existing cash reserves, the
directors said, to help fund future expansion.
Earnings came out at 2.84p (2.13p) and the interim dividend is increased to
0.7p (0.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Stoddard Sekers, the carpet and furnishings manufacturer, fell
from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 432,000 in the half year ended September 30,
reflecting continued deterioration in consumer durable products.
With the purchase of BMK sales rose to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 22.2m). But
those from the original group showed a fall because of a drop in volume and
the effect of pricing pressures and a weaker mix of sales.
The losses at BMK have been stemmed and the drop in pre-tax profit was
attributable to other companies. Finance charges rose to Pounds 458,000
(Pounds 189,000).
Earnings per share were 0.3p (1.2p) and the interim dividend is held at
0.75p.
Gearing rose to 43 per cent with the purchase of BMK and assimilation of its
debt.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its packaging machinery side helped GEI
International, the Bedfordshire-based engineer, to double profits in the six
months to September 30, writes Graham Deller.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 38.2m (Pounds 35.7m), pre-tax profits advanced
to Pounds 1.03m against Pounds 511,000.
Mr Michael Blackburn, chairman, said packaging machinery followed an
'outstanding' 1991 with a similar performance in the half, while processing
machinery lifted profits substantially and losses in the special steels
division were reduced.
He warned, however, that although most of the group's operating companies
performed 'relatively well' in an uncertain economic climate, trading
conditions remained difficult.
Earnings per share improved from 0.65p to 1.31p; the interim dividend is
held at 2.47p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Morland matches defence estimates with
Pounds 7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND, the Thames Valley-based brewer which beat off a hostile takeover
bid by Greene King earlier this year, yesterday reported a 28.5 per cent
increase in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.93m to Pounds 7.62m.
The result was in line with forecasts made during Morland's successful
defence of its independence which cost Pounds 1.75m, included in
extraordinary charges of Pounds 2.03m in the figures for the year to
September 30.
Earnings per share improved 15 per cent to 26.1p (22.7p); a proposed final
dividend of 5.98p lifts the total to 8.4p, an increase of 18.3 per cent.
Operating profit rose 41 per cent to Pounds 8.52m (Pounds 6.04m) on turnover
ahead 21 per cent ahead at Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 33.7m) in spite of 'very
poor trading conditions' in the final quarter.
Volume sales of Old Speckled Hen ale doubled as a result of the acquisition
of 101 pubs from Courage and trading agreements with Boddington, Everards
and, more recently, Adnams.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chief executive, said further benefits would come
this year from 72 pubs bought from Inntrepreneur Estates and a trading
agreement with Courage.
Free trade volumes improved 16.4 per cent and now accounted for 27 per cent
of sales.
Bad debt provisions had been reduced from Pounds 278,000 in the first half
to Pounds 41,000 in the second six months.
Turnover and profits of the 65 managed houses increased by 18 per cent. Food
sales improved 42 per cent and now accounted for 24 per cent of income.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 897,000 as a result of
the expansion of the pub estate. But, with gearing at 25 per cent, Mr
Clutterbuck said: 'We shall continue to develop the business both
organically and by acquisition.'

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: AAH hits Pounds 18m on back of buoyant
healthcare market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUOYANT healthcare market and the withdrawal of a competitor helped
pre-tax profits of AAH Holdings, the diversified distribution company,
advance 11 per cent to Pounds 17.5m in the half year ended September 30.
The result was struck on turnover 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 679.7m.
Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said the results reflected 'solid progress' in
healthcare, with a substantial advance in the group's pharmaceuticals
distribution business. Healthcare profits rose by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds
13.9m on sales 11 per cent up at Pounds 564.2m.
About half of that division's increase was due to the acquisition of
turnover from the withdrawal of rival Medicopharma last November. The other
half was due to an underlying growth in the sector.
Mr Bill Revell, managing director, said the UK pharmaceuticals market had
benefited from the combination of an ageing population and more expensive
drugs.
In the early part of the summer - known as hay fever season - the overall
market had been growing at about 12 per cent. However, when the wet weather
hit Britain in July and August underlying growth fell back to about six per
cent.
The environmental division - rubbish collectors and road cleaners -
benefited from a small acquisition and increasing contracts from local
authorities. Profits advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 3m.
The difficult economy was blamed for the Pounds 200,000 decline to Pounds
1.5m in building supplies and the Pounds 100,000 loss (Pounds 500,000
profit) in consumer products. Mr Pybus said the consumer division was
expected to incur a similar loss in the second half. Distribution increased
from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 1.4m due to the acquisition of ECE in April.
The interim dividend was raised 7 per cent to 5.8p.
COMMENT
A stock with defensive as well as cyclical qualities might not offer the
spectacular returns some would hope for. However, to enhance the defensive
position by holding a leading role in the growing pharmaceuticals market
certainly adds a bit of spice. AAH Holdings yesterday showed that it had not
skimped on spice with results showing that growth in healthcare had
outstripped that of the sector. Rationalisation of Medicopharma business -
initially delayed by a Monopolies and Mergers inquiry - and the acquisition
of Ireland's Cahill May Roberts group promise even greater growth in the
future. On the cyclical side, those betting on economic recovery should
eventually see a good upturn in the building and consumer divisions.
Forecasts are for about Pounds 37.5m in the current year, leaving the shares
on a prospective p/e of about 16 times. While the medium-term prospects look
tantalising, the market appears to have factored in the good news for the
moment.

FT  27 NOV 92 / 38% rise to Pounds 1.55m for Scantronic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Further progress within all its principal markets enabled Scantronic
Holdings to lift pre-tax profit 38 per cent, from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds
1.55m, in the six months ended September 30 1992.
The result was achieved on sales 10 per cent better at Pounds 18.5m (Pounds
16.8m). They were split as to Pounds 14.5m in Europe and nearly Pounds 4m in
North America, while the operating contributions were profit Pounds 1.73m
and loss Pounds 15,000 respectively.
Mr Chris Brookes, chairman, said in Europe the group continued to be a
leading supplier of security products, assisted by the new Arrowhead sensor
division which was making inroads into the detector product market.
In North America profitability had been improved substantially. Bank and
inter-group debt was cut by Dollars 1.3m primarily from reduced raw material
and finished goods stocks.
Earnings per share rose to 1.84p (1.01p). The interim dividend is again
0.79p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin tumbles 42% on downturn in
bulk shipments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACDONALD Martin Distilleries, which produces Glenmorangie and Glen Moray
malt whiskies, suffered a sharp setback at the interim stage as bulk
shipments to its international markets were reduced.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 2.69m,
a 42 per cent contraction on the comparable Pounds 4.67m. Turnover declined
23 per cent to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 15.2m).
The shares fell 70p to 400p.
Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said discounting by competitors and depressed
trading, particularly in Australia, New Zealand and the US, had affected
both volumes and margins and the group had been compelled to reduce prices.
The position was partially ameliorated by another good performance in Japan
where sales were ahead despite a seasonal decline in shipments.
Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director, said total shipments of Glenmorangie
were in line with last year following increased worldwide marketing
expenditure in the brand.
The distillery was currently operating at about two-thirds of capacity and
was likely to remain that way.
Nevertheless, the brand had outperformed the market with sales up 2 per cent
against an industry downturn of about 4 per cent.
The smaller Glen Moray distillery was working at full capacity, he said. The
brand had been repackaged and repositioned in the market place.
Profit margins in cased blend whisky were cut to protect existing markets.
Overall margins fell from 31 per cent to 28.5 per cent, with the decline
totally attributable to blended whisky, Mr McKerrow said. Malt whisky
margins had been maintained, he added.
Industry price discounting and an uncertain Christmas season made prospects
for the second half difficult to forecast.
Earnings per A share dropped to 13.08p (22.74p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.2p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Looking for some light in the tunnel - The
controversy surrounding Amstrad's Pounds 113m buy-back proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD's 31,000 shareholders are still largely in the dark about the
financial prospects for their company.
That is in spite of last Tuesday's marathon four-hour annual meeting which
mainly focused on Mr Alan Sugar's controversial Pounds 113m plan to buy-back
the shares he does not already own.
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman, founder and 36 per cent shareholder, said he
hoped the consumer electronics group which he built into a Pounds 625m
international business in the late 1980s, would not make another loss this
year, but must undergo further surgery if it was to prosper in the 1990s.
Whether or not his 30p-a-share buy-back plan is approved in two weeks time,
he has told shareholders that the Amstrad business, and overheads in
particular, must be cut.
For shareholders, the group's future prospects are a crucial factor in their
decision to accept, or reject, Mr Sugar's offer. Individual and
institutional investors have complained about the lack of financial
forecasts in Mr Sugar's offer documents and feel there is nothing except Mr
Sugar's own word to go on.
'We're being taken out at the bottom of the cycle and I just don't know what
the value is,' one institutional investor complained.
The Amstrad board, and Kleinwort Benson, its financial advisers, said in the
offer documents that they were 'unable to present a meaningful forecast of
profit or loss' because of 'the uncertainty inherent in the projections and
the level of contingencies which would have to be included.'
Since then the board has added that 'it is not material and would be
commercially damaging to the business to disclose publicly how much
shrinkage (in Amstrad) might be achieved.' But on the basis of Mr Sugar's
answers to critical shareholders' questions, it is clear that his vision of
Amstrad's future is very different from its past.
In the 1980s Mr Sugar and Amstrad successfully identified and exploited the
mass consumer market for low cost electronic systems like audio equipment,
personal computers and then satellite dishes and receivers. But Mr Sugar
says 'those days have gone forever,' and warns shareholders who think
otherwise that they are 'dreaming.'
The recession and fierce price competition has eroded margins on consumer
electronics products while fashion and the fast pace of technological change
means that the 'shelf-life' of a new PC, for example, has fallen from 18
months to just six months.
Most crucially, Mr Sugar says he has run out of 'blockbuster' product ideas.
He admits he is tired of 'fire-fighting' and does not feel comfortable
running a large international group. He says now that he wants to return to
what he does best - hands-on management of a fast-paced small consumer
electronics trading company. Amstrad's business has already been scaled down
dramatically.
Turnover in the year to June 30 was Pounds 356.6m - 43 per cent below the
peak 1989 level. Over the same period the number of employees has fallen
from 1,647 to 743. In the meantime, Amstrad has 'cleaned out the cupboard,'
writing down stocks by an average of 18 per cent and taking a Pounds 32m
provision last year, split evenly between restructuring costs and inventory
write-downs.
Although Mr Sugar has not detailed where Amstrad will retrench, and the
board has said that 'no detailed plans exist,' the only currently profitable
business is satellite receivers and dishes, and Amstrad faces pressure from
new entrants even in this maturing market.
Amstrad's professional computer business, which represented about 40 per
cent of turnover last year, is a big loss-maker because of ferocious price
cutting. Some analysts reckon the PC business posted a pre-interest loss of
Pounds 25m last year, and speculate that Amstrad will soon quit the business
having already exited from the home computer market.
Amstrad has been expanding its video equipment business and has about a 10
per cent UK market share and, more recently, its audio products segment
which is, coincidently, the market Amstrad first targeted. What therefore
might emerge is a domestically refocused Amstrad, still in the consumer
electronics business, but with annual sales of perhaps between Pounds 120m
and Pounds 150m.
Although Mr Sugar has been careful not to issue any forecasts, he did sketch
out a scenario at the annual meeting in which a slimmed down Amstrad
produced profits of around Pounds 8m a year. Based on that scenario he
predicted Amstrad would have a market capitalisation of around Pounds 65m
and a share price of about 10p.
He has also warned that there is little prospect of Amstrad's share price
rising significantly, or the dividend increasing substantially in the near
future.
However, many individual shareholders still believe that his 30p-a-share
offer is inadequate, especially when stacked up against the company's net
asset value of 46.3p per share.
The Amstrad chairman counters that the group's share price was hovering
around 22p before he first mooted his offer, and no alternative bid has
emerged. If his bid was matched, and offered to all shareholders, he says he
would sell.
The Pounds 122.2m, or 21.6p per share, of cash Amstrad had at the end of
June has drawn particular interest. Even allowing for bank loans of Pounds
8.5m and finance leases of Pounds 5.7m, net cash was Pounds 108m or 19.1p
per share. In addition, cash reserves should be boosted by Pounds 21m, or 4p
per share, in UK corporation tax refunds which will help offset any further
rationalisation costs and the Pounds 8m spent on increasing Amstrad's stake
in Betacom.
However, Mr Sugar argues that the group's 'core' cash, excluding seasonal
fluctuations, is much lower at about Pounds 60m - equivalent to about 7p a
share. And he says the 15p difference between this and the base 22p market
price reflects the City's real valuation of the ongoing business and its
non-cash assets.
Touche Ross, Amstrad's accountants, advised Kleinwort Benson that a
voluntary liquidation would be unlikely to generate proceeds 'materially in
excess of 30p per share' and would probably result in shareholders receiving
less than 30p.
Nevertheless, there are those who agree with the dissident shareholders that
Mr Sugar is trying to buy Amstrad stock 'on the cheap.' In particular,
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, in its latest report on Amstrad, said the company
was 'significantly undervalued at 30p' and agreed that an offer closer to
net asset value 'would represent a fairer outcome.'
There are other uncertainties which could also influence Amstrad's value -
including the eventual outcome of legal action seeking substantial damages
from two US electronics groups.
Predictably, Mr Sugar is dismissive of these issues, and forcefully tells
shareholders that his 30p-a-share is the most he can afford, and the most
they are likely to get.
The battle lines for the extraordinary meeting on December 10 have been
drawn.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Directors respond to 'inaccurate and
misleading' criticism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad's directors sent a letter to shareholders yesterday responding to
some of the criticism of Mr Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-back bid for the shares
he does not already own.
The board, which does not include any non-executive directors, described
some of the comment on Mr Sugar's offer as 'inaccurate and misleading.'
In particular the directors emphasised that Kleinwort Benson, 'is not
providing, and never has provided, advice to Amshold or Mr Sugar' in
connection with his bid.
'Kleinwort Benson was appointed by Amstrad's board to provide independent
financial advice for shareholders on the proposal.'
The letter also defended the proposed Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) loan from
Amstrad to Amshold, Mr Sugar's private takeover vehicle.
In connection with Mr Sugar's offer price, directors warn shareholders 'that
a company's audited net asset value does not represent its likely realisable
value on liquidation nor necessarily its value on sale'.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Recession puts dent in growth at Castings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASTINGS, the West Midlands-based iron castings producer, announced a fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.59m in the six months to
September 30, as the depth of the recession dented its long record of solid
profits growth.
Turnover fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 16.9m), and tightening margins reduced
operating profit to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.45m).
Mr Brian Cooke, chairman, said 'good cash management' led to an increase in
other income to Pounds 282,704 (Pounds 246,137), which would have been
higher if not for lower interest rates.
The depressed building and construction sectors had hit Castings' business
badly, and there was no sign of an upturn. Orders had picked up in April,
but had then fallen sharply, particularly since August.
Mr Cooke said any recovery in demand for the group's products - a range of
graphite iron castings sold to manufacturing industry from its foundries in
Walsall, Rotherham and Sheffield - was most likely to come from the car and
commercial vehicle markets.
Castings' foundries were operating at an average of 70 to 75 per cent of
full capacity. The group shed about 10 per cent of its 1,000-strong
workforce in the half-year as costs were cut.
The interim dividend is held at 1.3p, against a drop in earnings per share
from 5.5p to 5.05p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore spending Pounds 13m to buy in
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROGMORE ESTATES, a property investment company, yesterday announced plans
to spend Pounds 13.1m in buying in its own shares for cancellation.
It has asked its shareholders permission to buy 5.2m shares or 13.1 per cent
of its share capital from Markheath, another property company.
The Markheath stake was the rump of a 27.2 per cent interest - totalling
10.9m shares - in Frogmore it accumulated between June 1988 and April 1990.
In April 1991, it sold 4m shares to Southend Properties, which launched an
unsuccessful Pounds 139m bid for Frogmore.
Southend later sold its stake in Frogmore to Regalian Properties in October
1991. Regalian sold the stake in June this year.
The proposed price is 250p a share. This compared to its share price of
279p, after a rise of 9p yesterday, and a reported net asset value per share
of 411p at June 30.
Frogmore said the deal would increase its net assets per share from 411p to
435p. Its gearing would increase to around 40 per cent.
It is seeking approval from its investors because it does not have the
existing authority to buy its own shares and because it is buying from a
substantial shareholder.
Markheath's shares were unchanged yesterday at 6 1/2 p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Provisions behind fall at Gibbs Mew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXABLE profits at Gibbs Mew, the 59 per cent family-owned brewer and
commercial property company, fell 25 per cent from Pounds 503,000 to Pounds
377,000 even though trading profits edged ahead by Pounds 22,000 to Pounds
1.52.
Behind the pre-tax decline was an exceptional charge of Pounds 262,000 which
related to 'provisions against sums due from customers for loan and trading
debts and guarantees arising under the customer support loan scheme secured
by property and other assets'.
Group sales advanced to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 9.75m). The rise in free trade
volumes helped trading profits of the brewery division grow to Pounds 1.19m
(Pounds 1.03m) on sales of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 8.58m).
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 129,000 relating to Gibbs' bid
defence. Earnings contracted to 5.79p (7.03p) per share and the interim
dividend is maintained at 3p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Dollars 47.4m at GWR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES virtually doubled at Great Western Resources, the USM-quoted oil, gas
and coal company which almost collapsed earlier this year following
litigation with its largest customer.
The group, which is based in the US, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of
Dollars 47.4m (Pounds 31.1m), against Dollars 24m last time. Sales were 44
per cent lower at Dollars 74.9m for the year to September 30. Losses per
share deepened from 26 cents to 52 cents. There was no dividend.
Mr William Phillips, finance director, said the increased losses reflected
the impact of litigation and a Dollars 10.7m writedown on oil and gas
assets.
Mr Phillips said the litigation had depressed coal profits by about Dollars
15m. In the year just ended, the company had incurred about Dollars 1.4m in
costs associated with the litigation.
GWR planned a Dollars 34m capital expenditure programme in the current year,
to be funded by revenues and existing cash balances. The group also planned
to develop its main oil and gas asset, he said.
The group was not expected to return to profit in the current year, Mr
Phillips said. 'This is not just an overnight scenario,' he said. 'It will
take a little time to rebuild.'
GWR is still in dispute with its former chairman, Mr Dan Pena. The
flamboyant businessman who founded GWR is suing the company over his
dismissal in April.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Seton rises 43% to Pounds 2.13m and makes
Pounds 13m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SETON HEALTHCARE Group, the rapidly expanding medical products and sports
equipment company, yesterday announced a Pounds 13.1m rights issue to fund
further growth.
The 1-for-4 issue was priced at 240p. Seton's shares closed 11p lower at
281p.
Seton also reported a 43 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds
2.13m for the six months to August 31. After adjusting for disposals in the
US and the discontinuance of French business, turnover of the continuing
businesses rose by 35 per cent Pounds 17.8m.
The proceeds from the rights issue will be partly used to buy Cupal, a
Blackburn-based company which makes and distributes Meltus cough medicine;
Cupanol, a children's liquid painkiller; and Cuprofen painkiling tablets.
Seton has also agreed to buy the UK and Eire manufacturing and distribution
rights for the Betadine range of antiseptic products from Ladenburg, a Dutch
pharmaceuticals company, for an initial payment of Pounds 2m, plus
royalties.
Seton is paying Pounds 6.8m in cash for Cupal and issuing 500,000 of its
shares to the vendors of the private company, which employs 150 people. Last
year Cupal made trading profits of Pounds 581,000 on sales of Pounds 5.7m.
Seton said the acquisition was in line with its strategy of building a
branded healthcare portfolio and would add several over-the-counter products
to its range. It believed that although Cupal's main brands were well
established, their sales could be substantially increased by marketing them
alongside existing Seton brands with the benefit of integration with Seton's
wider community, wholesale and retail selling network.
The remaining proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce Seton's
borrowings to about Pounds 2.5m, giving gearing of 15 per cent.
The cash call was underwritten by Robert Fleming and joint brokers to the
issue were Beeson Gregory and de Zoete &amp; Bevan.
Earnings per share were 6.1p (4.7p). The interim dividend was raised to 1.7p
(1.5p).
COMMENT
This rights issue and related deals fit in snugly with the strategy which
Seton has been pursuing with such vigour since it came to the market at 130p
a share in the summer of 1990. The group is paying a high multiple for
Cupal, but such calculations are often of limited application to small
private companies. Seton is confident that the deal will enhance earnings
next year and the management has an impressive track record. Forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m put the shares on a prospective multiple of
just over 17. That rating looks justified, but a constraint on further
advances is the thought that this will not be the last cash call to
shareholders.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: South West edges up 4% - Profits growth
restricted at two water companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WEST Water saw its first half pre-tax profits rise restricted to 4 per
cent by the costs of cleaning up beaches from Lyme Regis to Penzance.
Profit came to Pounds 48.9m in the six months ended September 30 1992,
against Pounds 47.1m, and was generated from turnover ahead 15 per cent to
Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 84.1m).
Earnings per share were 37.1p (36.1p) and the interim dividend is 7.8p
(7.1p).
Over 93 per cent of turnover comes from the core regulated water and
sewerage businesses.
The increase was mainly the result of price rises of 16 per cent in the core
businesses, even though the impact of recession on commercial water
customers cut 1 per cent off core turnover.
Alone among the 10 public water and sewerage companies, South West has
secured an increase in its price formula from Ofwat, the industry regulator,
since privatisation in 1989.
Its original limit of annual rises of 6.5 per cent above the rate of
inflation was lifted to 11.5 per cent to cover the rising costs of its water
treatment programme.
South West has a particularly high number of beaches whose quality is
regulated by EC directives, and it expects that its capital investment
programme will eventually cost it some Pounds 2.2bn between privatisation
and the end of the decade.
Within total turnover, revenues from the non-regulated water services,
instrumentation and pipeline businesses rose to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 11.1m),
partly because of work on South West's own water treatment schemes.
Mr Keith Court, chairman, attributed part of the 25 per cent advance in
operating profits from Pounds 33.3m to Pounds 41.6m to cost control, and
added that it compensated for the fall in interest receivable to Pounds 7.6m
(Pounds 13.9m).
The investment programme cut net cash to just Pounds 90m at the end of
September from Pounds 212m in March 1992 and Pounds 180m in September 1991.
The increase in tax to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.9m) was ACT paid on dividends -
like much of the water industry, the group's capital allowances shield it
from mainstream corporation tax.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said: 'We're feeling pretty robust, and there
are signs that the recession may have peaked in the south west although we
are not complacent'.
COMMENT
Results from South West Water were at the top end of analysts' expectations
although the shares failed to respond. But the capital spending programme
will probably drain the last of the cash by next March giving a net interest
charge for the first time since flotation, while depreciation charges will
continue to rise. In the past few weeks the group has agreed with Ofwat that
annual price rises for the next two years will be 11 per cent on top of
inflation. While the deal gives welcome stability up to Ofwat's 1994
periodic review of the industry's pricing structure, Ofwat's thinking on
price increases in the second half of the decade is only beginning to emerge
and long-term returns remain hard to estimate. With those concerns, and the
dividend for the second half likely to rise by less than that of the first,
the shares may lack reasons to perform.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring behind Powell Duffryn surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Powell Duffryn rose sharply after the distribution, storage and
engineering company reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, in
spite of seeing no improvement in its principal markets, the UK transport
and energy sectors.
Proceeds from restructuring the group helped cut interest costs from Pounds
4.9m to Pounds 2.6m, which was the main factor behind the rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 6.89m to Pounds 9.33m in the six months to September 30.
Turnover was down 7 per cent to Pounds 330.8m (Pounds 355.4m).
Powell Duffryn Standard, which builds rail freight wagons and bogies, and
Metalair, which makes bulk powder tankers, both continued to suffer from a
dearth of orders and made a combined trading loss of Pounds 2.5m.
The group is closing its railway manufacturing plant at Heywood in
Lancashire, with the loss of 56 jobs, and said its railway plant in Cardiff,
which employs 130 people, would also be run down unless firm orders
materialised. Several European companies are discussing manufacturing the
bogies - perhaps under licence on the Continent.
Powell Duffryn sold its quarry interest for Pounds 30m in September last
year and in April it received Pounds 19m from the sale of its ship-owning
subsidiary, Stephenson Clarke. This inflow helped cut gearing from 38 to 31
per cent.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the profits increase demonstrated the
benefits beginning to emerge from the major structural changes which had
been implemented over the past two years.
Weak summer demand for heating and industrial fuels caused the group's fuel
distribution division to make a loss of Pounds 377,000, compared with a
trading profit of Pounds 905,000 last time.
Despite the losses at Powell Duffryn Standard and Metalair, the group's
engineering division saw trading profits advance by 11 per cent to Pounds
5.5m, mainly due to the steady performance of Hamworthy's marine activities,
and increased contributions from its combustion division.
Shipping and storage increased trading profits from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds
6.9m, boosted by a full contribution from the Tees and Hartlepool ports,
which a consortium led by Powell Duffryn bought in January. The group said
the performance of the ports had exceeded its expectations at the time of
the acquisition.
Earnings per share rose by 36 per cent to 9.1p (6.7p). The interim dividend
was held at 6.6p.
COMMENT
Yesterday's 7 per cent rise in the share price, from 389p to a new four-year
peak of 416p, reflects a surge of enthusiasm for the new-look Powell Duffryn
which has emerged from the recentrestructuring. The City was also cheered by
strong indications that the group will not be slow to increase its final
dividend. Even where problems exists - as they plainly do in the railway
businesses - the management has shown itself willing to staunch the losses.
Although the profits figure is flattered by the drop in interest payments,
the underlying performance is impressive in view of the flat energy and
transport markets. Full-year profits are forecast at about Pounds 30m, which
puts the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.5. The shares have had a
good run recently, but that does not seem too demanding for a high-yield
stock with recovery potential.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Concentric almost doubles to Pounds 8.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCENTRIC, the engineering and components group, almost doubled pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.22m to Pounds 8.25m for the year ending September 30.
The profit rise, on sales of Pounds 113m (Pounds 112.9m), was mainly due to
the turnaround at two of the group's subsidiaries.
New management at Concentric Pumps, which produces parts for diesel engines,
was responsible for producing an operating profit of Pounds 1m. It had
incurred a loss of Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Tony Firth, chairman, said the former management at Concentric Pumps had
been replaced last year because it had lost control of costs.
Capital expenditure, which remained unchanged at Pounds 4.8m, is likely to
be increased as a result of the company's net cash position of Pounds 11m,
due to this year's rights issue.
About Pounds 1m had been earmarked for Concentric Pumps, with further
expansion of its plastic mouldings and automotive businesses.
Mr Firth said
he was encouraged by the 7 per cent rise in overseas sales.
Earnings increased to 23.25p (13.21p). The final dividend is held at 7.63p
for an unchanged total of 11.17p. The group is proposing a 1-for-1 scrip
issue.
COMMENT
Having shot themselves in the foot by losing control of costs at key
businesses the group has aggressively regained control of its subsidiaries.
It is difficult to fault the timing of its rights issue which will allow a
needed increase of capital expenditure. The recent devaluation of sterling
is expected to further underline the growth in overseas sales. Its house
brokers are forecasting pre-tax profits next year of Pounds 10m, giving
earnings per share of 24.3p. This puts the shares - up 7p at 360p - on a
prospective multiple of 14.8, a slight discount to the market. Not a get
rich quick stock but may prove attractive to investors willing to wait a few
years.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs curb Welsh Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING INTEREST costs because of growing capital investment held back profit
growth at Welsh Water, the Powys-based water and sewage company, to 1.5 per
cent in the six months to September 30.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 74.1m to Pounds 75.3m after net
interest earnings fell from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 5.6m.
Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman, said the performance was 'very commendable'.
The recession, which appeared to hit Wales later than England, led to a 4
per cent fall in income from metered consumption, reflecting lower usage by
companies and factories. Mr Graham Hawker, managing director, said the fall
in metered usage seemed to have levelled off.
Turnover increased 8 per cent to Pounds 185.4m (Pounds 171.1m) because of
average price rises of 9.3 per cent.
Operating costs moved up nearly 8 per cent to Pounds 118.4m. Staff numbers
were unchanged and pay rises held at 4.3 per cent.
Cost controls helped lift operating profits 9 per cent to Pounds 67m (Pounds
61.3m).
Capital investment remained on target and is forecast to rise this year to
Pounds 206m (Pounds 189m). Depreciation for the period increased 15 per cent
to Pounds 16.1m while infrastructure renewals rose 6.7 per cent to Pounds
11.1m.
Welsh's net cash holdings fell to Pounds 90m (Pounds 154m) and the company
expects to have small net borrowings by the end of next year as its
investment programme continues.
Non-regulated businesses, which include a pipeline company and a hotel
group, continued to perform poorly and reported operating losses of Pounds
1.4m (Pounds 2.8m) on turnover of Pounds 28.4m. Mr Jones said he hoped
non-regulated businesses would break even in 12 months.
Earnings increased to 49.1p (48.5p) and the interim dividend is raised to
7.8p (7.13p).
The shares added 3p to close at 526p.
COMMENT
After limiting its price increases by 1 per cent in June, Welsh can feel
slightly smug at seeing Ofwat impose similar constraints on the rest of the
sector. That does not detract from those who argued Welsh could most afford
such restraint. Pre-tax profit growth may have been flat, but operating
profits rose strongly and Welsh is in the enviable position of having at
least another year before it goes from net cash to net debt. But the
company's forays into unregulated areas such as hotels continue to
disappoint. The timing of these ventures ahead of recession was unfortunate,
but their lack of success continues to provide somewhat of a drag on the
shares. Perhaps with Mr Jones retiring next year, and management promising
'greater focus' to the non-core side, a more radical review of strategy will
be forthcoming. Full year forecasts of Pounds 143m put the shares on just
under six times, which looks about right relative to the sector.

<TEXT>
THE CONSORTIUM led by Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications yesterday
got the support needed to make the offer for Independent Television News
unconditional.
The consortium, which also includes Central, London Weekend, Reuters,
Granada, Anglia and Scottish, already had the agreement of ITV shareholders
holding 74.7 per cent, just below the 75 per cent needed to change the
articles of association.
Thames Television, the largest shareholder, had already signed the offer.
Yorkshire and Tyne Tees, which together hold 14.4 per cent of ITN, had not
signed before and are still unhappy about part of the news supply agreement
with ITN.
Yorkshire said it believed it had the support of enough ITV companies to
block the deal.
To do that Yorkshire needs the support of HTV, Ulster, Grampian and Border.
Two of the companies are believed to have signed the offer yesterday, taking
acceptances to above 75 per cent.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Chloride Pounds 2.73m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Chloride, the once famous batteries supplier which has been
reduced to a small electronics group, crumbled in the half-year to
September, as the group turned a Pounds 1.02m pre-tax profit into a Pounds
2.73m loss.
Chloride staggered under the weight of restructuring costs and poor demand
for its main products: power electronics, uninterruptible power supplies
(UPS), and emergency lighting systems. The interim dividend is passed, and
retained losses rose to Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 523,000).
Turnover fell 17 per cent to Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 54.7m). The group made an
operating loss after exceptional costs of Pounds 932,000, against a profit
of Pounds 2.05m.
Reorganisation costs this year totalled Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 586,000) and
there was a loss on discontinued operations amounting to Pounds 916,000. The
interim dividend is passed.
Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chairman, said the interim period had been
'interesting', but management was not despondent.
He predicted 'a significant improvement' in results by the year-end.
Exceptional costs would not recur, new products - especially Chloride's
latest UPS - had been well received, but the group would not return to
profit.
Chloride's operating loss of Pounds 556,000 before exceptional costs
included Pounds 876,000 in 'stringent provisions' for bad debts and stock
obsolescence, which reflected encouraging underlying profitability.
Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 8.68m at the end of March to Pounds
3.05m. Losses per share were 1.6p (0.2p).

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: DC Gardner warns of second-half downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DC GARDNER Group, the personnel training company, issued a profits warning
yesterday, replaced its chief executive, Mr Barry Topple, after less than a
year and appointed Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland Bank, as
non-executive chairman.
The group, which has undergone a substantial restructuring in the past 18
months, said the results for the second half of 1992 would be 'less than
current market expectations,' and 'well below' the Pounds 930,000 pre-tax
profit achieved in the six months ending June 30.
'At that stage the revival of business confidence following the General
Election was expected to continue but in the event confidence subsided,'
said a trading statement issued by the board.
As foreshadowed at the time of the interim results, the UK market for the
group's training and publications division has been 'very difficult' in the
second half and the division's results have been adversely affected by the
continuing recession.
However the group's outplacement division continues to perform well and
while profits for the second half will be less than those for the first, the
board expects another record result for the year, helped by overseas
expansion.
The company said the performance of its residential conference centres, 'has
been satisfactory and the division should finish the year strongly with its
best ever quarterly results.'
The latest boardroom changes follow a string of other appointments and
departures culminating in the resignation last month of Lord Walker of
Worcester, the former Welsh Secretary.
Sir Kit succeeds Mr Stephen Johnson, as chairman. Mr Johnson, a former
chairman of Coutts Consultants, the group's outplacement subsidiary, is
taking over as chief executive.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Newspaper Publishing in profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday
has turned a Pounds 10m loss in 1991 into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 28,000
in the year to September.
Sir Ralph Dahrendorf, chairman, said yesterday: 'The bottom line is one of
satisfactory progress both in commercial terms and in reputation.'
The newspaper group's position improved despite the depth of the recession
because of a number of factors.
Revenues increased from Pounds 79m to Pounds 81.8m and there was an
operating profit of Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 6.58m loss). The main factors
here were savings in newsprint costs and lower overheads following the
integration of the the two titles.
Exceptional costs this year were only Pounds 138,000, against Pounds 1.9m
before which was mainly attributable to redundancy costs.
Because of an Pounds 8m refinancing which allowed all bank borrowings to be
paid off, interest charges this year fell to Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 1.88m)
The company now has about Pounds 1m in the bank.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Market signals issue success for Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN Tomkins' nil-paid shares ended sharply up yesterday ahead of the
November 30 deadline for the conglomerate's first call on shareholders under
its Pounds 653m rights issue to fund the recommended bid for Ranks Hovis
McDougall.
The nil paid closed up 8 1/2 p at 20.5p and the underlying shares up 9p at
222p, giving every indication that shareholders will fully subscribe to the
issue barring any unforeseen external disruption in the market as a whole.
Once the rights issue is successfully away, Tomkins' next target is to keep
its share price near the 227p level ahead of the first closing date of the
RHM offer on December 7. At this price Tomkins' offer of 520p and 2.29 new
shares for every four RHM shares is worth more than the 260p cash
alternative, encouraging shareholders to stay with Tomkins rather than take
the cash.
As the share price headed strongly away from the 200p rights issue price,
which it briefly threatened last week, Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive,
was confident Tomkins would end up with a strengthened shareholder register.
Advisers to Tomkins say there has been exceptionally high turnover in the
nil paid shares, suggesting a significant shift in the make-up of the
shareholder base. The fall in Tomkins' share price appears to have allowed
some institutions to join the shareholder register when previously they were
underweight or had thought the shares were too expensive.
As shareholders have examined Tomkins' bid for RHM, much of the initial
hostility and opposition to the Pounds 935m offer appears to have subsided.
'I have not had much hostility from the institutions that I have seen,' he
said. 'What we misunderstood was the size of the rights issue in volatile
markets. A number of shareholders decided to sell enough rights to take up
the shares.'
City observers say this is consistent with the fact that institutions are
not flush with liquidity at the moment.
Some institutions have also said that while Tomkins' shares were not
attractive at the 261p level prevailing before the bid for RHM, they were
attractive again after the 15 per cent fall in the price.
The recent devaluation in sterling would have a beneficial impact on
earnings this year. And recession in the US, where Tomkins has over three
quarters of its business before the RHM deal, would end earlier than in the
UK.
Mr Hutchings said that some people had 'taken their eye off the ball'. 'This
is a company (RHM) making Pounds 92m; the cost of funding a Pounds 935m
acquisition with borrowings is Pounds 65m at 7 per cent so there is plenty
of upside.' He also said he had been encouraged by the 'numerous, numerous'
offers he had received for parts of RHM's bakery, grocery, milling and
baking businesses which reinforced Tomkins' belief in its target's value.
This did not necessarily mean Tomkins would break with its history of
tending to run rather than sell businesses that it buys.
'We are builders of mature businesses in mature markets,' he said.
While institutions appear to have been brought around to supporting the RHM
deal, a number still question whether Tomkins' rating at a premium to the
market will not have been smeared slightly with a food company rating which
could hold back any substantial recovery from the current share price.
Mr Hutchings insists this has never been the case before. 'We have gone into
a lot of unfashionable businesses,' he says. 'We have not been rated for our
industrial fasteners or our handguns or lawnmowers, and look at the likely
progress. The next deal will not be in food, just as it won't be in
lawnmowers as it won't be in handguns.'

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Tawse deeper in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER DECLINING demand in its markets caused Brown &amp; Tawse Group, the steel
and pipes distributor, to fall more sharply into losses in the six months to
September 30. It is passing the interim dividend.
Pre-tax losses grew from Pounds 181,000 to Pounds 2.76m in the period. The
interim dividend last time was 2.85p.
Turnover declined to Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 72.3m). Mr Gil Black, chairman,
said that the shrinking demand first seen in the group's markets in 1989,
continued unabated.
But Mr Phillip Ashforth, finance director, added that 'occasional green
shoots' had been seen at Jay Fasteners and there had been signs the southern
region was bottoming out, though there were no trends for sustained
recovery.
To help cut costs further, Mr Richard Wilson, chief executive since
September 21, has engaged Coopers &amp; Lybrand to undertake a detailed
operational review. Mr Ashforth said it was likely that the mother company,
Brown &amp; Tawse Ltd, would be restructured.
Working capital was under 'continuous scrutiny' and capital expenditure,
down to Pounds 3.4m last year, was a little under Pounds 1.5m in the half.
Net borrowings rose from Pounds 16.1m at the year-end, when gearing was 35
per cent, to just over Pounds 20m at the end of the half, giving gearing of
almost 49 per cent. Losses per share emerged at 8.5p (0.5p).

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Uncertainty behind BPB dividend cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BPB Industries, the UK's largest plasterboard manufacturer, yesterday cut
its interim dividend in spite of declaring that prices were again rising
after a five-year price war.
Mr Alan Turner, chairman, said there was unprecedented uncertainty over the
short-term outlook for business prospects and the company could not continue
to pay an uncovered dividend.
Interim pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds
24m to Pounds 27.5m on sales up 6 per cent at Pounds 544.7m.
Earnings per share fell from 3.9p to 3.7p and the interim dividend is cut
from 4p to 2.7p. BPB's shares fell 18p to 172p.
The reduced dividend would re-base the annual payment at a level from which
a progressive dividend policy could be resumed, Mr Turner said.
Mr John Maxwell, chief executive, said that after five years of falling
plasterboard prices, there was now growing evidence of 'sustained pricing
recovery' and that increases in France, the UK and Germany were sticking.
BPB's operating profit margins have fallen to about half the levels
prevailing before the price war began with Lafarge Coppee of France and
Krauf of Germany five years ago.
BPB had answered certain questions from the Office of Fair Trading after the
Federation of Master Builders complained about the price rises in the
summer. The company was not expecting to hear any more from the OFT.
Gearing in the period rose from 36 per cent to 38 per cent on total
borrowings of Pounds 264m.
The building materials division, which includes plaster board and plaster,
enjoyed a sharp increase in margins with operating profit rising 31 per cent
to Pounds 37m on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 464.9m.
On the paper and packaging side, despite a volume increase, profits were 41
per cent lower at Pounds 6m on sales 4 per cent lower at Pounds 79.8m,
because of price erosion and lower profit margins.
Mr Turner said that plasterboard remained one of the few building materials
for which there was still significant growth potential in Europe and Canada
even without economic recovery.
BPB had only benefited from the French price increase during the first half;
the other price rises would feed through in the current half.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Japanese banks reveal scars from end of financial bubble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S banks yesterday revealed some of the scars suffered in the collapse
of the country's financial bubble, as the 11 leading commercial banks
reported sharply lower first-half profits and a dramatic increase in their
loan loss reserves.
The plunge in pre-tax profits, down by an average 37 per cent, came despite
a general fall in interest rates during the six months to September,
allowing the banks to exploit a favourable rate spread and boost profits on
banking business by an average 47 per cent.
But those increases were wiped out by appraisal losses on securities
holdings, undermined by the Tokyo stock market's continuing weakness.
Appraisal losses for commercial banks, called 'city banks' in Japan, rose
124.7 per cent last time to a combined Y417.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn).
The banks also reported an increase of Y326.8bn to Y1,099.2bn in loan loss
reserves, some used to cover exposure to collapsed property developers,
including the Olympia &amp; York group of Canada as well as smaller Japanese
companies. Tokai Bank set aside half its Y41.1bn loss reserves to cover
Olympia &amp; York Developments debt.
As a result of the losses and provisions, net profits at Fuji Bank plunged
56.1 per cent, Dai- Ichi Kangyo Bank 42.4 per cent, Sakura Bank 40.8 per
cent, Sumitomo Bank 40.7 per cent and Mitsubishi Bank 37.6 per cent.
Traditionally, Sumitomo has been the most profitable Japanese bank, but it
lost that title to Sanwa Bank, which saw a 69.2 per cent increase in
business profit to Y198.6bn and a 34 per cent drop in net profit to Y40.2bn.
Mr Paul Heaton, of Smith New Court Japan, said Japanese banks are likely to
experience falling profits for the next two years.
'Unlike banks in the US, the Japanese banks cannot take their losses in one
big hit and report zero profits. It's not the way in Japan. They will spread
it out, but that also means they will take time to solve their problems,' Mr
Heaton said.
One source of comfort for the leading banks was that all succeeded in
clearing the 8 per cent hurdle for their capital to assets ratio, as defined
by the Bank for International Settlements.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Gerald Ratner plans his comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD Ratner is already planning his comeback and could approach Ratners
Group, the jewellery retailer from which he resigned on Wednesday, to buy
back the Ratners chain, close associates said yesterday.
Mr Ratner himself was not able to comment. The man who was never at a loss
for words has finally been gagged. A confidentiality agreement signed with
his former employers means he cannot speak publicly without risking losing
his Pounds 375,000 pay-off.
His cousin Mr Victor Ratner, who left the group in February, has opened a
store and some think Mr Gerald Ratner could join forces with him. His
agreement with Ratners allows him to open four competing shops over the next
year. Ratners shares briefly rose yesterday but fell back to close down 1p
at 17p.
Mr John Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest WoodMac, said: 'There is
a certain durability to what he did. Retail history will be a lot kinder to
him than the tabloids.' However, Mr Richards felt Ratners would survive
without its one-time chairman and chief executive.
One rival jewellery retailer said he was sorry for Mr Ratner personally but
glad that he had left Ratners. 'Gerald Ratner's going will be a great help
to us,' he said. 'Their Christmas offer has been lacklustre, it just wasn't
Gerald. They should be taking us on out there and they just are not.'
Mr Ratner's friends say he could not agree with the strategy the group's new
board was implementing, which is aimed at improving margins rather than
going for volume with price cuts. 'He is a man of refreshing honesty, and he
could not sit there following a strategy he does not intrinsically believe
in,' one said.
One stockbroker said: 'The strategy is really up to the bankers not the
board. Only profitable companies have the luxury of choosing their own
strategies.'
Forecasts for the group's current year, to end-January, are for a loss of
around Pounds 15m although analysts said the figure depended heavily on
Christmas trading. They said the US business was faring better now and
interest and exchange rates were moving in Ratners' favour. Mr Richards
said, 'a small profit is not impossible'.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Northern Foods ahead 24% midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Foods increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 68.4m in
the six months to September 30, helped by contributions from the Express
Dairy and Eden Vale chilled food operations acquired a year ago.
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman, said the result was achieved in spite of
worse-than-expected trading conditions, which he believed would persist at
least until next spring. He warned that devaluation of the green pound, used
in EC farm trade, combined with inflation, would add between 6 per cent and
8 per cent to food prices next year. But recession would make it hard for
manufacturers to pass on the increase.
Nonetheless, he said Northern Foods' margins would improve next year as it
benefited from rationalisation of its dairy and meat businesses. The company
aimed to cut costs by between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m and shed 3,000 jobs
by June.
The pre-tax result, up from Pounds 55.2m a year ago, was achieved on sales
of Pounds 969.9m (up from Pounds 655.6m). Operating profits were 41 per cent
higher at Pounds 81.2m, but the operating margin slipped to 8.4 per cent
from 8.8 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 3 per cent to 8.92p from 8.66p, reflecting the
Pounds 227m rights issue to fund the Pounds 359m purchase of Express and
Eden Vale. Excluding these and lesser acquisitions, sales rose by 7 per cent
and operating profits by 8 per cent.
Express and Eden Vale were being integrated on schedule. Head offices and
two dairies were being closed, a Pounds 9m bottling plant was being built,
and London milk rounds were being turned into franchises.
Operating profits and sales improved in dairy, convenience foods and
grocery, helped by strong growth in recipe dishes, new grocery products and
higher milk prices. Growth in bread and sandwiches was below expectations.
Operating profit on meat fell 7 per cent and sales stagnated. The division's
plants were being reduced from 11 to five.
Northern Foods made capital investments of Pounds 45m, chiefly in its dairy,
meat and convenience foods businesses.
Acquisitions increased debt to Pounds 255.9m (from Pounds 109.7m) and
finance charges to Pounds 12.8m (from Pounds 2.5m.) The interim dividend
rises 5 per cent to 3.4p.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Shares in Savoy rise on death of president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Hugh Wontner, president of the Savoy hotel group, has died at the age of
84. Sir Hugh had fiercely defended Savoy from hostile takeovers for nearly
40 years and news of his death lifted the group's 'A' shares 40p to close at
485p.
Market attention focused particularly on Forte, which holds 69 per cent of
Savoy's equity and 42.5 per cent of its voting shares. The Forte group has
made no secret of its desire to gain control of its rival, whose hotels
include the Savoy, Claridges and the Connaught.
Both companies said yesterday, however, that they were still bound by a 1989
pact under which Forte agreed not to purchase any more shares until the end
of 1994.
Savoy said that Sir Hugh, who died on Wednesday night after a short illness,
was 'a distinguished man of many talents'. Forte said: 'We have not often
seen eye-to-eye, but we extend our sympathies to his family.'
Sir Hugh, the son of an actor, joined the Savoy in 1938 and became a
director two years later. He was on the board for 48 years, becoming
president in 1990.
Although he was one of the most senior figures in the British hotel
industry, Sir Hugh was often criticised for his failure to make more of the
international prestige of the group.
Takeover attempts in the 1950s by Mr Charles Clore and Mr Harold Samuel led
the Savoy to create two classes of shares: the 'A' shares and the 'B' shares
which carried more votes. The Savoy board retained control over enough of
the 'B' shares to give them more than half the votes.
The dual structure was sufficient to prevent control passing to Forte, whose
then chairman, Lord Forte, conducted a bitter battle against Sir Hugh
throughout much of the 1980s.
Mr Rocco Forte, Lord Forte's son and now chairman of the group, has said he
would like to create a new luxury hotel company in which Forte would have a
majority stake. The company would consist of the Savoy properties and
Forte's luxury hotels.
Although the Savoy's independence is guaranteed for another two years, many
in the industry believe that with Sir Hugh's death much of the hostility to
Forte could disappear.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Accountants get the bird from S&amp;L regulators: Nikki Tait and
Andrew Jack on the Dollars 400m settlement agreed by Ernst &amp; Young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR partners in the leading US accountancy firms have some unpleasant
after-dinner reading to do this week as they digest their Thanksgiving
turkey - a weighty document detailing the Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) legal
settlement just reached by Ernst &amp; Young with the US federal savings and
loan industry regulators.
The settlement is the largest agreed by an accounting firm, and will be
closely scrutinised by its competitors for both the terms and the potential
it brings for negotiations by other auditors to failed S&amp;Ls across the US.
It has been privately welcomed by the regulators, the firms and insurers
alike, although it continues to fuel the arguments of the accountants for
litigation reform to provide protection against the escalating costs of
defending themselves in court.
The professional firms are coming under additional pressures to settle on
S&amp;L audits in the face of punitive regulatory penalties introduced by
Congress in the wake of the collapse of thrifts across the country.
Mr Michael Cook, chairman and chief executive of Deloitte &amp; Touche in the
US, which also faces a number of S&amp;L suits, says: 'This is an unfortunate
example of what people are coerced to do because of the level and risks of
litigation. There is a lot of logic to it. Going to the courts would make
the lawyers very rich and the taxpayers would not end up with the proceeds.'
The Ernst &amp; Young settlement results from a wide variety of charges levelled
against the accounting firm by three federal agencies  - the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Resolution Trust Company and the Office of
Thrift Supervision (OTS). These are the bodies that regulate the savings and
loan industry in the US, and which are still trying to recoup some monies
from the widespread and extremely expensive failure of thrifts during the
1980s.
The allegations related to audit work which Ernst &amp; Young, or Arthur Young,
one of its predecessor firms, had undertaken for failed thrifts. The firm
audited 400 of the 2,500 S&amp;Ls, some of them among the sector's most
notorious casualties - notably Denver-based Silverado, Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan in California and Western Savings and Loan in Phoenix.
The charges ranged from claims that E&amp;Y failed to review adequately property
appraisals or make adequate allowances for loan losses, to assertions that
it did not require necessary disclosure of transactions between the thrift
and 'related parties'.
While E&amp;Y has neither admitted nor denied guilt, the decision to settle
looks thoroughly pragmatic, particularly as the deal appears to have been
shaped to penalise the firm without seriously undermining its viability.
That also seems to offer hope for other smaller firms facing similar legal
action.
For a start, Dollars 300m of the Dollars 400m cash payment is covered by
insurance. While the annual cover provided to the firm is below this level,
it relates to many different claims spread over 10 years and so in no way
threatens to approach the upper limits of professional indemnity.
The remaining Dollars 100m will be delivered over four years - solely by the
US firm - and, according to E&amp;Y, will be funded out of current earnings.
This, in turn, might reduce the firm's future payouts to partners, but for a
business which had US fee income of Dollars 2.2bn last year, a Dollars
25m-a-year penalty looks manageable.
The settlement is also a fraction of the total damage claims, which would
have run to several billions of dollars. Potential litigation costs, had the
charges been contested, could have topped Dollars 100m. For its Dollars
100m, E&amp;Y gets immunity from prosecution for both the specified charges and
from any potential charges.
Meanwhile, the regulatory agencies have scored a well-publicised PR coup.
'This settlement shows that the government is ready, willing and able to
resolve disputes through alternatives to costly litigation,' claimed the
agencies on Monday.
The settlement agrees to some partners being retrained and others banned
from working on insured financial institutions. But E&amp;Y insists that any
lessons to be learnt from the S&amp;L audits have long been taken on board.
With hindsight, the accountancy firms admit they would not have taken on
many of the S&amp;Ls as clients. Partly under pressure from insurers, they
continue to enhance the risk assessments they make of prospective clients
before agreeing to future audits.
It should be noted that accountants are not the only professionals targeted
by the thrift regulators. Earlier this year, the New York law firm of Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler agreed to pay Dollars 41m to settle a
federal lawsuit from the OTS, which charged the lawyers with withholding
information about Lincoln S&amp;L from regulators.
The question now is whether other accountancy firms will fall in line. Ernst
&amp; Young is by no means the only firm targeted by the regulators for its
audit work on failed thrifts, although its suits were among the largest and
were dealt with first. The FDIC, for example, says it has a dozen pending
lawsuits against other accountancy firms (see table), although some relate
to bank organisations rather than thrifts.
Officially, neither the FDIC nor the OTS, which pursues its complaints
against professionals who undertake work for thrifts, will comment on
whether negotiations with other accountancy firms are underway. But both
KPMG and Deloitte &amp; Touche have confirmed that they have held preliminary
discussions. These talks have been temporarily stalled by changes in key
personnel in the regulatory bodies, partly a result of the US presidential
election.
There have already been some, much smaller, settlements between accountants
and the thrift regulators - Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for example, signed a 'cease
and desist' order with the OTS over Silverado in 1990. Earlier this year
Arthur Andersen reached an out-of-court settlement with investors of
American Continental Corp, holding company for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. There
is clearly an expectation that more will follow.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Labour makes big gains in Irish poll
</HEADLINE>

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH Labour party has made sweeping gains in Dublin at the expense of
the two main right-of-centre parties, and picked up seats in rural
constituencies, according to early returns from Wednesday's general
election.
Such victories over Fianna Fail and Fine Gael would establish Labour's
ability to hold the balance of power in a new coalition government.
The returns, calculated before taking into account transfer votes under
Ireland's voting system, show Fianna Fail, Ireland's strongest party since
independence in 1921, suffering its worst setback in 50 years. Its share of
the vote appears to have fallen to just above 40 per cent, which would
secure only 70 of the 166 seats in the Dail (parliament).
Labour appears to have doubled its share of the vote since the 1989 general
elections to more than 20 per cent, giving it the breakthrough it has sought
since its foundation in 1912. Labour candidates have topped the polls in 10
of Dublin's 11 constituencies and, overall, the party is projected to win 30
seats.
Having broken the grip of the two larger parties in the capital and made
significant advances in rural seats, Labour sees itself as just one step
away from displacing Fine Gael as the second force in Irish politics. Mr
Dick Spring, the Labour party leader, said: 'We have laid the foundations
for achieving that in this election . . . and I am confident it is the start
of a new era in Irish politics.'
Labour must now decide how to exploit its strength in negotiating the
formation of a government with either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael.
In an early result from the three referendums on abortion, the right to
travel abroad for an abortion and to receive information on the operation
was overwhelmingly approved, while a proposal to allow abortion when the
mother's life is at risk was rejected.
Ireland's central bank announced that overnight interest rates for new funds
would next Monday increase to 100 per cent from 30 per cent.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Brussels misjudgments have cost millions, watchdog says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is weakly managed, has poor accounting controls, and
its misjudgments have cost European Community taxpayers tens of millions of
pounds, according to a report published by the Court of Auditors yesterday.
The EC financial watchdog's 1,100 page report criticises the Commission for
wasting money in fisheries policy, programmes to widen sexual equality, aid
to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and through extra expenses
for travel-conscious members of the European Parliament.
Its release comes as member states prepare for a showdown today in Brussels
over new British proposals on the EC budget. Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, has already called for the Pounds 47bn annual EC
budget to be raised by just under a third over the next five to seven years.
The UK and Germany, which doubt the need for such a rise, will find plenty
of ammunition in the court's report identifying areas of endemic
mismanagement and fraud:
Subsidies for the olive oil sector have risen almost threefold to Ecu1.774bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) since 1985 - even though there is often no proof that many of
the producers exist.
'The system continues to be unreliable, even though the Commission has
continued to tinker with it for more than 20 years,' the report says.
Special support for beef and veal producers has risen more than sixfold to
Ecu335m since 1987. But there is no common system for checking eligibility,
and the payments encourage production at a time when beef and veal
consumption are falling.
The EC is paying wine growers to improve the quality of vines, while handing
out subsidies to convert wine for industrial use or to destroy surplus
vines.
The court also criticised Operation Phare, an EC aid programme for eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union which now covers 10 countries. It found
that appraisal of projects took between 12 and 18 months, judged its
contribution to the private sector as 'feeble' at the start of 1992, and
considered the programme's extensive use of subcontracting inefficient.
The court also said it saw no economic reason for building a 60-metre wide
highway through thinly populated jungle in the west African state of
Cameroon. And it voiced concern over the 11 per cent increase in travel
expenses for European MPs to Ecu32m to cover the shuttle between their
constituencies and European Parliament locations in Brussels, Luxembourg and
Strasbourg.
The Commission yesterday responded to the criticism by pointing out that
some of the waste was the result of political decisions by member states,
particularly on farm subsidies. Errors and shortcomings were often related
to Community law, while the court had to be careful of making dubious
general-isations and conclusions on the basis of isolated examples.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Britain braced for EC budget row: UK proposes 'restrained
increase' to break spending deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UK braced itself for a furious reaction from its European Community
partners at a meeting of ministers in Brussels today after putting forward
proposals yesterday to break the nine-month deadlock over the future
financing of the EC.
At a 'conclave' of foreign and finance ministers, Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will present
proposals envisaging 'a more restrained increase' in EC spending than a
recent proposal from EC Commission president Mr Jacques Delors.
Britain is also refusing to yield to mainly German pressure to give up its
annual rebate, worth about Pounds 2bn, from its EC contributions. While the
UK will discuss reformulating the way the money is paid back, the scale of
the rebate is not negotiable.
Britain has proposed a seven-year agreement that would freeze the upper
limit of the EC budget at the present 1.2 per cent of Community gross
national product for three years from the start of next year, before raising
it in stages to 1.25 per cent by 1999.
According to UK Treasury figures, the British plan would lift the EC budget
to Pounds 61bn or Ecu 79.3bn at 1992 prices by 1999 from Pounds 47bn this
year against Mr Delors' plan to boost the budget to Pounds 64bn after seven
years.
Britain wants to force other member states - notably Germany - to clarify
their stance on the budget well ahead of the Edinburgh summit in two weeks.
British diplomats are aware that if the presidency cannot advance the debate
on the EC budget, it risks an embarrassing deadlock at the summit after what
many of its partners consider a disastrous EC presidency.
If EC leaders cannot reach a decision on the budget at the summit,
negotiations for the admission of new EC members - one of the British
presidency's central objectives - will also have to be delayed.
Germany and the Netherlands are expected to back the British plans for a
more modest EC budget, but poorer member states will oppose any package that
would leave them worse off than under the Commission's current plans for EC
spending, known as the Delors II package.
The British presidency is prepared to face fierce criticism from Ireland,
Spain, Greece and Portugal, which are seeking funds to encourage economic
convergence with the wealthier EC members. The so-called 'cohesion' funds in
the Delors II proposals have been cut from Ecu15bn to Ecu12.25bn under the
British plans. UK officials stressed yesterday that this would still amount
to a quite substantial increase in funding compared with the 1988-92 budget
period.

Part of the reason for yesterday's FT-SE record close is that the UK market
seems to have been a proxy for Wall Street during the US Thanksgiving
holiday. Admittedly, indications of a stronger US economy are good news for
many large British companies. With prospects for a Gatt agreement
favourable, there may be fewer reasons to sell the market. But London might
prefer to assess the degree of follow-through in New York before setting out
to scale higher peaks - unless investors are prepared to overlook the
continuing impact on UK consumer confidence from rising unemployment and
falling house prices.

FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BPB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The plasterboard war seems to have ground to a standstill, but corporate
battle fatigue may not be enough to raise prices significantly. BPB, Lafarge
Coppee and Knauf might all want higher profits, yet each still has to juggle
price against volume. There is still excess capacity, particularly in the
UK, and the British and French markets continue to weaken while Germany's
decline has yet to come. The omens for sustained price rises are not good.
Indeed, BPB's decision to cut its dividend at the interim stage reinforces
that view, however confident the company tries to sound. To be sure, the
payment was at an unsustainable level and the new chief executive may want
to start with a clean sheet, but trading prospects can hardly be rosy. With
the dividend 'rebased', the market must adjust its valuation of the stock. A
25 per cent yield premium may not be enough, given that even the reduced
payment will be barely covered by earnings this year. And the prospective
earnings multiple of 24 clearly looks far ahead to better times.
Presumably those will one day return, and BPB's strong market position will
eventually earn rewards. But that only highlights the narrowness of BPB's
focus. A little judicious diversification when the company was making Pounds
200m of profits might have prevented it scraping to earn Pounds 50m now.

FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese equity market was well prepared for yesterday's dismal slew of
results from the big banks. Besides, there are a couple of silver linings.
One is that all the large commercial banks are now above minimum
international standards of capital adequacy. By widening their lending
margins as interest rates came down, the banks also generated stronger
operating profits against which to help offset bad debt provisions. Whether
the sector can hold on to its remarkable 25 per cent gain relative to the
market since early April is another matter.
The suspicion remains that banks have only recognised the tip of a bad debt
iceberg. The best of the gains from wider margins have now passed. Interest
rates have fallen by 2.5 percentage points since this time last year. Even
allowing for a possible cut in the discount rate next month, there is surely
little more to come.
Meanwhile the recession appears to have spread from the epicentre of the
Tokyo property market to manufacturing industry, especially small businesses
in the provinces. That points to bad news to come from the regional banks.
Even if yesterday's optimistic economic outlook from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development proves correct, there seems little
chance of the banking sector providing much more of a boost to the Nikkei.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers and food retailers have every reason to play down devaluations in
the green pound. After all, any downward adjustment in the EC's funny money
 -and there was another small one yesterday taking the cumulative total to
12 per cent since September - boosts rural incomes and puts up prices in the
shops. No doubt a Chancellor striving to stay within his new inflation
ceiling will want to keep mum. Northern Foods, in the form of its chairman
Mr Chris Haskins, is effectively crying foul.
Mr Haskins, of course, is playing to the gallery too: in his case the
supermarket customers who he fears will not enable him to pass on the extra
costs. But his assertion that green currency changes may add up to 8 per
cent to some food prices next year is a timely warning of the pressures
which the food industry will be labouring under. With retailer competition
and trading down by consumers intensifying, it is just as well that Northern
is highly geared to lower interest rates and will soon start reaping the
benefits of its massive restructuring.
Solid earnings growth is assured for the next couple of years, but there is
a question mark over where the momentum comes from thereafter. The market,
though, has already taken some of the froth off Northern's rating, with the
shares now 16 per cent below their relative high. The company is probably
better placed than most to stand up to its customers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Warburg's Sir David Scholey has been telling anyone who cares to listen that
he's faintly embarrassed by being the bookmakers' favourite candidate to
become the next Governor of the Bank of England. He really has no ambitions
to fill that post - or so he says.
Few in the City take him seriously. Fellow bankers generally say he is the
best candidate and they do not believe he would turn down the post. Hence
the amusement at the speculation that Lord Weinstock has approached him to
join the GEC board, with a view to Scholey's eventually becoming chairman.
True, he and Lord Weinstock go back a long way. Sir Ronald Grierson, who
retired as a GEC vice-chairman last year, was an old Warburg hand, and
Weinstock's heir, Simon, worked at Warburg for five years. But would Scholey
really want to take on the chairmanship of GEC which is regarded by many as
little more than a high-powered public relations job?
Aside from Lord Nelson, all GEC chairman up to now have been former
politicians, the ambassadorial rather than the entrepreneurial type.
Everyone knows that it's 68-year-old Weinstock who pulls the strings. Who
takes over from him is the real question.
Of course, when Weinstock eventually steps down, GEC may well require a very
different type of chairman. In the meantime, the speculation is probably
either a smokescreen while Scholey waits to find out about the governorship,
or else someone has got his name mixed up with that of Sir Bob Scholey,
British Steel's ex-chairman.
If only he were 10 years younger, he would have made an excellent GEC
chairman. It's hard to believe that GEC needs a banker at the helm.

One has to admire Lord Walker of Worcester's impeccable timing. He parted
company with Jim Slater well before Slater Walker went down, quit the
Conservative government before the rot set in, and has assembled one of the
most impressive string of directorships of any former cabinet minister.
He was chairman-designate of Maxwell Communication but backed out less than
four months before the late tycoon jumped ship. Last month he stepped down
as a non-executive director of troubled training group DC Gardner.
Lo and behold, a few weeks later Gardner's chief executive Barry Topple is
toppled after terrible trading news.
Walker had a good excuse for wanting to reduce his non-executive
directorships now that he has taken on the chairmanship of the Urban
Regeneration Agency. Moreover, Gardner thanked him profusely for 'his hard
work and firm support' over the past couple of years.
Even so, there might be a slight tremble the next time he hands in his
notice.

Questioning those suspected of insider dealing can lead to some striking
explanations for share-buying sprees.
Richard Lines, operations manager of the Stock Exchange surveillance group,
told a London conference on financial crime of one man who said his large
and sudden purchase had been prompted by his noticing that a certain chief
executive had removed the personalised number plates from his Rolls-Royce.
That obviously meant he was getting ready to leave when his company was
taken over.
Another impressive 'excuse' went: 'My wife and I were having a row when she
hit me with one of the company's products. I was so impressed with its
sturdiness that I decided to buy some of the shares.'
However genuine the explanation, Lines said, the experience must have been
bruising. The product in question was a kettle.

Nigel Burgess, drowned yesterday in the Vendee Globe solo round-the-world
race, was a giant in the world of yacht brokerage. Although his private -
and ultimately fatal - passion was racing single-handed sailboats, his
business was the sale and management of vast motor-yachts worth millions.
His company, Nigel Burgess Yachtbrokers, had sold the ship best-known as
Trump Princess twice. The first time was for Adnan Kashoggi. When the Middle
East's most visible Mr Fixit ran short of funds Burgess found a willing
buyer in Donald Trump despite the property tycoon's avowed aversion to the
sea.
When Trump in turn found himself financially foundering, Burgess steered
through a second sale to a Saudi buyer. Even more lucrative than the
commission on the sales was that management of the vessel and its crew of
50-plus was handled by Nigel Burgess Yachtbrokers.
His immense discretion about his business did not stop stories of his
dealings from entertaining the industry.
For instance, at the time Kashoggi's yacht was sold it bore the name of one
of his daughters, Nabila - retention of which, under the Arab code, would
have been an insult once the boat was out of the family. Trump eventually
agreed to change the name to Trump Princess . . .for Dollars 1m off the
Dollars 30m purchase price.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Positive reasons for financial intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A ALLCOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT of November 25 was an object lesson in the power and application
of market-distorting financial intervention, the positive reasons for it and
the continued lack of government commitment to its necessary application to
the UK's manufacturing industry. Your leader concerning the European steel
industry quite rightly says that subsidised inefficient capacity could
destroy lower subsidised efficient capacity. I agree. But this is exactly
what has been allowed to happen at large to the UK's manufacturing industry
over the past 13 years as other competing countries have supported theirs.
On the other hand, immediately adjacent to your leader is an article in
which the government is shown perfectly happy to distort the market for
television programmes by allowing the flat-rate TV licence to continue to
support programmes which the market would not sustain. It is admitting that
a free market would destroy 'good' television. I agree such distortion is
necessary, but why only for the BBC?
Finally, on page 10 you report the Department of Trade and Industry's
'exports strategy'. It is naive to believe that this Pounds 10bn increase
will not itself cause a substantial increase in imports which form a large
part of our exports. As the DTI never tires of telling, the UK already
exports 80 per cent more per head of population than Japan. Quite clearly it
imports a great deal more, too. The real problem is one of import
substitution. There are too few medium-sized manufacturing companies, the
back-bone of manufacturing industry in Germany, Japan and Italy, and,
therefore, too few British designed and manufactured products.
Will the government be able to spot these links, I wonder?

The article stated that 'arguments over the use of the Lyons name delayed

Not so. The delay was caused by the time needed for Clarke Foods to put in

FT  27 NOV 92 / Lonely ride into sunset: Unless John Smith transforms the
UK's Labour party and speeds up its move to the political centre, another
election defeat beckons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a short answer to the question, 'does the British left have
anywhere to go?' It is 'no'. For the Labour party appears to be living in a
fantasy world in which the Conservatives self-destruct, an early general
election follows, and Mr John Smith becomes prime minister.
The dream will not come true. Not that way. Mr Smith may one day move into
Number 10 Downing Street, but first he must totally transform his party. If
it is to win again, Labour must no longer be regarded as a party of the
left. It must be separated from the trade unions. There is time for such a
renewal. No election need be held until 1996 or 1997. By then the
redistribution of constituency boundaries will have created another 10 or 20
seats whose demographic profiles favour the Tories. The recession will
(surely) have come to an end. The party that faced the Conservatives in
mid-slump in April 1992 and lost will, if nothing has changed, lose, lose
and lose again.
Reality could be different. If Labour makes a complete break with its own
history and traditions - in essence, creates a fresh political force - it
may stand a chance. The slimness of that chance may be measured by the
performance of the Democrats in the recent US elections. Governor Bill
Clinton did not campaign as the candidate of the poor, the dispossessed or
the proletariat. He ran on a promise to meet the concerns of the middle
classes. Socialism neither entered his mind nor obscured his vocabulary. He
denied his party's liberal past by stressing the 'new' in 'new Democrats'.
The public feeling was that there was no end to the recession. Mr Clinton
peddled a Keynesian revival, Victorian social values and 'hope'.
In the event he won by a far smaller margin than had been anticipated. Had
it not been for a statistical quirk, much of that advantage could have
melted away. The US Commerce Department's estimate of third-quarter growth,
originally 2.7 per cent, was revised upwards this week to 3.9 per cent.
President George Bush must be wondering what might have happened if that
figure had been available, and believed, during the campaign. As it is, Mr
Clinton may enjoy the advantages of coming to office at the start of a
return to real growth in the US economy.
Mr Smith is not so fortunate. He has become Labour's leader in time to see
prosperity return before he gets to fight a general election.
Truly there is no hope for parties of the left, not in the sense the term
has been used until now. Professor J K Galbraith has an explanation. He
believes that during the last half century the left, particularly in
Britain, has saved capitalism. He said so on Tuesday. In a lecture to the
Institute for Public Policy Research, a think-tank of the left, he listed
old-age insurance, unemployment compensation, medical care, public housing,
improved public services, the ending of the 'once-cruel exploitation of
women and children' and the like as ingredients of a social revolution that
'has taken the cruel edge off capitalism'. In consequence 'our claim is not
to violent change, certainly not to revolution. It is to a socially better
performance by the existing system.' We are now, the professor intimated, in
the age of 'constructive pragmatism'.
That would be all fine and dandy for Labour if the Conservatives represented
something else - destructive ideology, say. They did for a while,
particularly during the years 1987-1990. But just two years ago this weekend
they jettisoned the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher and replaced her with the
supremely pragmatic Mr John Major. He has had a run of bad luck, and at
times has made the worst of his misfortunes, but he has not sought to place
the cruel edge back on to capitalism. Contrary to Labour's eager
expectations, the social security budget has not been cut. Most payouts will
be increased in line with inflation.
This will leave the poorest among us with pretty thin gruel. For the life of
me I cannot imagine what it is like to live on income support or
unemployment benefit of less than Pounds 2,250 a year (basic levels for a
single person). Yet Labour could only find money with which to improve on
these meagre sums by increasing taxation. To propose that is a proven
vote-loser. Mr Clinton advocated tax increases for families with annual
incomes greater than Dollars 200,000. He only just got away with it. The
Clinton programme, which centres around 'workfare', is politically saleable
as a hand-up, not a hand-out. The benefit system that most appeals to
electorates on either side of the Atlantic is the one that delivers comfort
and cash to the middle classes.
Labour is still wrestling with this. The 'Commission for Social Justice'
which Mr Smith espouses has yet to be established. I am told that its
chairman will be known by Christmas. He or she will do well to approach half
the standard of intellectual rigour and thoroughness of the Beveridge
Report, the work of a Liberal, which was first published exactly 50 years
ago. Beveridge advocated workfare, proposing that unemployment benefit
should be 'subject to requirement of attendance at a work or training centre
after a limited period . . .' After that, 'complete idleness even on an
income demoralises'. He did acknowledge the proposal to be impracticable in
periods of high unemployment.
A second Beveridge lesson for Labour is fiscal. The report, printed in 1942,
projects spending on social security for the years 1945, 1955 and 1965. Only
the cost of pensions rises significantly. Unemployment benefit falls
slightly; the health services (which would soon make everyone well) remain
at a flat level of cost. As an exercise in optimistic under-estimation of
future expenditure the Beveridge arithmetic has not to my knowledge ever
been exceeded - not even by the designers of nuclear generating plants.
Labour must find new ways of thinking, and get them straight. One of its
unique selling points should be constitutional reform. Another should be
strong environmental protection, using selective taxation as an instrument.
A carbon tax would be a mixed blessing, but it could serve as a method of
raising revenue that, like VAT, would be politically less painful than
direct imposts on incomes.
The danger is that the Tories are already ahead: they are making
pencilled-in calculations about both a carbon tax and toll booths for roads.
The government is also denying Labour the opportunity of differentiating
itself by promoting the abandonment of strict monetary controls in favour of
Keynesian pump-priming.
Mr Smith, who became leader on July 18, is approaching all of this at a
measured pace, with long interruptions to respond to the dramas on the
Conservative benches. Some of his colleagues believe that he cannot afford
such a luxury. If he is ever to become prime minister, his goal for 1993
should be to create a new party. He would then have about three years - a
desperately short time - in which to convince the voters that Labour really
had changed. It will be amazing if he pulls it off.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Legally possible, if politically unwise, to isolate
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL TRACY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The possibility of France using its 'right of veto' against the US-EC
farm trade deal continues to be evoked.
There is in fact no legal right of veto on matters where the Treaty of Rome
provides for the EC Council of Ministers to decide by qualified majority.
This includes agricultural policy (Article 43) and commercial policy
(Article 114).
The 1966 'Luxembourg compromise' was a political document, not a legal one,
and was in fact an 'agreement to disagree' among the original six Member
States. Its full text (which can be found in the Commission's Ninth General
Report) states:
'I. Where, in the case of decisions which may be taken by majority vote on a
proposal of the Commission, very important interests of one or more partners
are at stake, the members of the Council will endeavour, within a reasonable
time, to reach solutions which can be adopted by all the members of the
Council while respecting their mutual interests and those of the Community.
. . .
II. With regard to the foregoing paragraph, the French delegation considers
that where very important interests are at stake the discussion must be
continued until unanimous agreement is reached.
III. The six delegations note that there is a divergence of views as to what
should be done in the event of failure to reach complete agreement.'
Even assuming that the 'Luxembourg compromise' still has some political
validity, a country which invokes a 'very important interest' can be
overruled, as Peter Walker (then minister of agriculture) found to his cost
in 1982. It depends on the president agreeing not to take a vote, or,
failing that, on a sufficient number of countries abstaining or voting
against to constitute a blocking minority.
It may be politically unwise to isolate a country in this way, but it is
legally possible.

Sir, Ms Arrowsmith (Letters, November 20) may have missed the point of our
article ('Omissions on options', November 18) when she cites the various
institutional shareholder guidelines that cover issues such as equity
dilution, discounting and voluntary lapsing of share options.
She does not dispute that these flaws exist, but states that there are
regulations to prevent misuse. We agree, and applaud the extent to which the
Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of
Pension Funds (NAPF) have created such comprehensive guidelines.
However, the point of our article was to illustrate how little impact these
issues and their regulations have at the individual pension fund manager
level. Certainly, with respect to issues of executive remuneration, the ABI
and the NAPF are anything but 'inattentive', but their thousands of members
often are, as has been admitted. Michael Cranna,

FT  27 NOV 92 / At a loss for a speedy solution: Japan's banking crisis
threatens economic growth at home and abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp falls in pre-tax profits announced yesterday by Japan's large
banks are just the latest sign that the country's banking sector is facing
its worst crisis since the second world war. The collapse of the speculative
bubble of the 1980s has left them burdened with bad debts, a legacy which
has potentially far-reaching consequences for Japan and the international
economy.
At the end of September the top 21 Japanese banks had loans on which no
interest had been paid for more than six months, worth Y12,300bn (Pounds
65bn), or about 3 per cent of their outstanding loans. According to the
Finance Ministry, about Y4,000bn of these loans do not have any collateral.
This amounts to an unrecoverable loss which could soak up about 18 months of
operating profits at the top 21 banks. Their uncommitted loan loss reserves
are worth only Y2,875bn. Covering the loss by digging into their capital
would reduce their equity by about 19 per cent.
The banks and the regulatory authorities are taking a distinctively Japanese
approach to solving this debt crisis. Market forces will play only a limited
role in restoring equilibrium. There is little prospect that weak
institutions will be allowed to go to the wall or be taken over. Instead,
the Japanese are working in the grey zone between the market and state
intervention by adopting a gradualist and collective approach.
At present, the government is offering the banks only limited, covert
support. There are no plans for a bail-out modelled on the US government's
rescue of the savings and loan industry.
Instead, the entire banking system is taking the strain. Weaker banks will
be kept afloat through a web of relations with stronger banks which will
support them with cheap loans. But what are the chances that the Japanese
authorities can prevent a long drawn-out crisis which undermines Japan's
economic performance?
The banks' bad debts are a direct result of the collapse of the property
market after the end of Japan's 'bubble' economy of low interest rates and
financial deregulation, which created a climate for rampant speculation in
the late 1980s.
At its peak rate of growth in late 1987, commercial bank lending to the real
estate sector grew by 32.7 per cent, to Y33,565bn in March 1988. In 1988
land prices in the Tokyo area rose by 57 per cent. By spring 1989 the Bank
of Japan, which had become alarmed by the rise in asset prices, began to
push up the discount rate (which determines short-term interest rates) from
2.75 per cent in April 1989 to 6.25 per cent 15 months later. The
authorities also put a cap on real estate lending.
The property market went into a tail-spin. Prices in some central areas of
Tokyo are 60 per cent off their peak, leaving many borrowers with collateral
worth less than their loans. Residential land prices may still have a long
way to fall; prices dropped about 20 per cent in the main cities in the year
to September. An unprecedented glut of office space will overhang the
commercial market for several years.
This means the banks' final bill will be far larger than the outstanding
unbacked Y4,000bn of bad debts estimated by the Finance Ministry for this
September. Privately, Tokyo bankers acknowledge that bad loans at the 21 top
banks could total Y55,000bn, equivalent to about 12 per cent of gross
domestic product, over the next five years. Even a conservative estimate for
unrecoverable loans of Y10,000bn is about equal to the top 21's forecast
operating profits for the next three years.
This figure almost certainly understates the problem, however. The top 21
banks are the tip of a very large financial pyramid. Beneath them are about
132 large and smaller regional banks, which do not operate nationally, and
455 very small, local shinkin banks. At the base is a dense network of
22,000 non-banking lenders, which do not take in deposits.
According to Mr David Snoddy, banking analyst at Jardine Fleming, the
securities house, the regional banks could face a loss of Y1,600bn or about
21 per cent of their equity. What matters is whether the top 21 banks and
the strongest regional banks will have the resources to deal with their own
problems as well as help their weaker affiliates.
Japanese banks all have large holdings of securities, which they could sell
to raise capital. The plunge in the Tokyo stock market means the value of
the banks' large unrealised gains on securities holdings has fallen from a
peak of Y60,604bn in September 1989 to about Y18,385bn this March. That is
still more than enough to cover their losses, but if they tried to realise
these gains share prices could decline further, thus depleting the banks'
capital. This would increase pressure on the banks to restrict lending by
pushing their capital below the standards set by the Bank of International
Settlements. From next March they are required to hold capital worth 8 per
cent of the value of their risk assets.
Any strategy that the banks might consider to meet their losses faces
constraints. For instance, issuing more shares is not an option while the
Tokyo stock market is in the doldrums. So the banks hope to stretch out
their losses, at least until the late 1990s, paying for them piecemeal each
year, partly from profits, partly from stock reserves and, in time perhaps,
from their shareholders' equity.
Despite the mutual ties between banks, a crisis at a large bank cannot be
ruled out as long as the stock market is depressed and real estate prices
continue to fall. A large bank failure would destabilise the entire system
because it could unravel the patchwork of cross-lending which binds the
banks together.
That threat is taken seriously by the authorities. They are keeping a close
watch on the long-term credit banks set up to lend to industry but which
have become heavily exposed to real estate lending. They are also watching
several trust banks, which operate both banking and trust-fund investment
businesses. Nevertheless bankers are adamant that a failure can be averted.
Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, puts it: 'Our
banks do not go bust.'
Crises at weaker institutions are expected, however. Mr Akira Nambara,
executive director of the Bank of Japan, has predicted mergers and rescues
among smaller institutions. Several weaker regional banks are already
undergoing restructuring.
The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, says it has instructed large banks to take
an interest in the health of their non-banking lending affiliates. Bluntly,
the banks are being told to stop the affiliates going bust. Distress lending
from large banks to non-banking institutions at very low rates of interest
rose by about 194 per cent in the year to August.
Even if a collapse can be averted, a prolonged crisis would have
far-reaching consequences. Small businesses, which account for 56 per cent
of employment, are already complaining of a credit crunch. Large companies
have cash reserves to fall back on, but many are reconsidering ambitious
investment strategies which were based on access to low-cost capital.
As a result, the domestic picture could be grim: the banks' weakness could
stifle growth in the Japanese economy for several years. Extrapolating from
calculations by Mr Yushio Suzuki, the Bank of Japan's former executive
director, the money supply needs to expand by about 6 per cent a year for
gross national product to grow at the government's target of 3.5 per cent a
year. That seems unlikely with bank lending rising by only 0.7 per cent in
the six months to September and with an unprecedented contraction in the
money supply in August and September. Money supply growth remains weak,
despite a series of discount rate cuts since July last year as the Bank of
Japan has tried to stimulate the economy and offer support to the banking
industry. The economy looks set to grow more slowly in the 1990s than at any
time since the 1950s.
The international consequences could also be profound because of the pivotal
role that Japanese banks now play in the world economy. Japanese banks have
already retreated from international lending to reduce their assets and meet
the BIS capital adequacy standards. Companies which found it relatively easy
to borrow from Japanese banks - from US steel mills to Olympia &amp; York, the
developer of the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands - now find it
more difficult to borrow money, a constraint which is likely to remain tight
so long as Japanese banks' domestic difficulties persist. When loans are
made available, they are also likely to be more expensive than in the 1980s.
When Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, came to Tokyo
last month, he delivered a grim warning that asset deflation - which is
undermining the profitability and lending ability of banks in the US, UK,
Australia and Scandinavia as well as Japan - was a malaise which would take
a long time to cure. He also stressed that world economic growth would be
sluggish until the 1980s' debts were paid off.
So unless the Japanese government intervenes, Japan's debt problems are
likely to hinder both the domestic and the world economy for some time. As
yet the government has been unwilling and unable to commit large sums of
money to bail out the banks, and thereby help them into a position to start
lending again when the economy picks up. This is largely because there would
be an outcry from a public which has little sympathy for bank executives who
are widely regarded as overpaid and underworked. All the government has so
far been willing to offer the banks is tax credits to allow the banks to
write off their losses against profits.
The banks have set up an agency to buy the land they used as collateral for
some of their bad loans, thus allowing them to calculate their losses at
realistic land prices. But this agency will be funded by the banks and have
no public money. On the other hand, the government has been willing to use
public funds to buy land to stabilise land prices.
The authorities face a dilemma. An injection of public funds into the banks'
land-buying agency may be essential to speed up the writing off of bad debts
and thus limit the wider economic damage of a protracted crisis. But that
may only be politically possible once there is a sudden bank failure of
large proportions. Unless and until this happens, the banks will have to
fend for themselves.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: France and the Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER WEDNESDAY'S debate in the French national assembly, it is clear that
the French government is set to stage a long and fierce rear-guard action
against the farm trade deal negotiated between the European Community and
the US as a central component of the Uruguay Round. At the end of the day,
however, it seems almost inevitable that France will have to accept the
terms negotiated by the European Commission, because no better terms will be
available.
Yet nobody should underestimate the depth of the real political difficulty
which this issue is causing in France, let alone sneer that this is just a
case of a weak government kow-towing to a combative peasantry. Finding a
solution will certainly need political courage in France, but it will also
require the other member states to recognise that a successful conclusion to
the longest-running trade negotiation the world has ever known may require
finding ways of helping France come to terms with the deal.
The central French complaint is that the Community negotiators went beyond
their brief, and have made concessions to the US which will impose
uncovenanted and unacceptable sacrifices on French agriculture. France has
already agreed to a sacrifice of its agricultural interests, in the reform
of the Community's common agricultural policy (CAP) adopted by the 12 member
states earlier this year. But the French also protest that the Commission
has conceded additional restrictions, and therefore hardships for French
farmers, which were not in its mandate.
The European Commission has declared that the EC-US deal is consistent with
the terms of the CAP reform; but Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime
minister, has announced that he could not accept these assurances, and has
threatened to block the agreement with some sort of national veto.
As a matter of principle, Mr Beregovoy is inevitably right. Without seeing
the fine print, it is almost impossible to make any firm calculation of the
detailed impact of the deal; if French claims are even roughly true, it
seems probable that the agreement will impose stiffer restrictions on
European agriculture. But the main French sacrifice, and it is a very real
one, is the concession of the very principle of a farm agreement.
The reform of the CAP is a far-reaching programme to restrain
overproduction, but it does admit the possibility of Community flexibility
according to circumstances; an agreement under the Uruguay Round will be an
external constraint on the Community's freedom of movement, and it must
therefore be less flexible and more binding.
It may be argued that the French government is in trouble now because it has
played its hand rather clumsily. But the bottom line is that French farmers,
who are a large part of the labour force (over 6 per cent), are already
enduring steady falls in their incomes, and facing a steep decline in their
numbers. The British government recently backed sharply away from a plan to
fire 30,000 coal miners; but French farmers know that their numbers are
likely to drop from a little over 1m to around 600,000 in the next decade.
The CAP reform must accelerate that process, and so will the GATT deal.
In the case of the Uruguay Round, common sense and politics are at variance.
Common sense suggests that the government should have declared that the
EC-US deal is the best available. But if it had done so, it would almost
certainly have been defeated in parliament, and after fresh elections its
conservative successor would inevitably have been even more fiercely opposed
to the Gatt deal. The best hope now is that the government will navigate
under cover of a flag of protest, with a view to avoiding an absolute break
with the Gatt negotiations, so as to accept an overall Uruguay Round package
at a later date.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Queen taxed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH monarchy has been a remarkably successful institution. It has
also been a highly adaptable one. The adaptability of the monarchy largely
explains the success. The Queen's offer to pay taxes on her private income
and, as importantly, trim the civil list represents an excellent example of
the monarchy's flexibility. These changes, sensible in themselves, are also
more likely to strengthen the monarchy than weaken it.
Rationalists dislike monarchies. But constitutional monarchy has proved to
be an obstacle neither to economic progress nor to democratic stability. On
the contrary, their shrunken numbers include many of the world's richest
democracies: in Europe there are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands,
Belgium and more recently Spain; in Asia, there is Japan. In these societies
the monarch's role as a living symbol of the state has proved consistent
with political stability and indeed one of its sources.
These monarchies have all changed markedly over time, as has the British. It
has survived a civil war and the decapitation of Charles I. It has outlived
the acquisition and collapse of the British empire. Above all, it has coped
with the transition from aristocracy to democracy.
Now it has to adapt to an age of populist suspicion and popular curiosity.
It has to tackle two specific problems: the all too visible foibles of minor
members of the royal family and the untaxed wealth of the Queen herself. By
yesterday's announcement the monarchy has done what it can, short of a
credible vow of poverty and personal perfection.
Nothing will stop the popular press from probing the private lives of
members of the royal family. But with the compensation for their public
services being reimbursed from the Queen's privy purse they may be
criticised less easily. Similarly, nothing will stop left-wing politicians
from complaining about the Queen's wealth. But properly taxed it becomes
just another inherited private fortune.
The monarch's role is fundamentally symbolic, but scandal and untaxed wealth
are unsatisfactory symbols. There had to be changes. Whether these go far
enough is another matter. A clearer definition of the monarch's role in the
state may be required, particularly if there are wider constitutional
changes. The future of the monarchy depends partly on the royal family
itself, but still more on the changing temper of the British people.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Personal View: Not such a capital idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN BOND and EVAN DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is customary for business to seek bigger tax allowances from the
chancellor of the exchequer, and no surprise that Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, used his speech
at the recent CBI conference to invite the chancellor to 'think hard' about
capital allowances.
What is more surprising is that this chancellor should respond to these
calls, introducing a temporary increase in allowances in the Autumn
Statement. It was, after all, Mr Norman Lamont who so eloquently rejected
the idea of raising capital allowances in this year's Budget speech, when he
said: 'Good quality private investment will come not from artificial
subsidies or incentives, but in response to consumer demand . . . I have
concluded that, whatever its superficial attractions, an increase in capital
allowances would not be a sensible use of the resources available.'
It is tempting to see the chancellor's policy reversal as a clever way of
boosting demand, or as a means of promoting the interests of industry. But
in fact, while investment in 1993 is increased, this is only at the expense
of investment in 1994 and 1995. His scheme is not about helping the economy
in the long term.
The increase in first-year capital allowances means that companies can claim
a bigger deduction against corporation tax in the year they undertake
investment spending, albeit at the cost of lower tax allowances for
depreciation in subsequent years. It works rather like a loan from the
exchequer to a company. At the current corporation tax rate of 33 per cent a
15 percentage point increase in capital allowances - from 25 to 40 per cent
 -is like the government giving a 5 per cent interest-free loan on every
pound invested.
This will not do much to persuade a cash-starved company to engage in new
spending if markets are depressed. But a lot of investment occurs anyway:
about Pounds 50bn a year by industrial and commercial companies. And while
the tax concession will not be enough to generate new investment, it will
persuade many companies to bring their 1994 investment spending forward into
the year ending October 1993, to enjoy the more advantageous tax rules.
Temporary changes in taxation can have important effects on investment
spending. The phasing out of high first-year capital allowances announced in
the 1984 Budget gave companies a large fiscal incentive to bring investment
spending forward. As the table shows, manufacturing investment rose sharply
in 1984 and 1985, and then fell back in 1986.
The fiscal incentive then was about three times larger than the effect now.
Nevertheless the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that business
investment in the next 12 months could be as much as 6 1/2 per cent higher
than it would otherwise have been as a result of the temporary increase in
capital allowances announced last week.
So what is the downside?
Unfortunately the boost is likely to be short-lived, and investment in 1994
sharply lower than it would otherwise have been. Spending that has been
brought forward into 1993 will not be repeated. This is a short-term fix
which does not promote investment in the longer term.
Where does this leave Mr Lamont if the economy is still in recession next
year? It would be stretching his credibility to repeat the exercise to get
people to bring their 1995 investment into 1994. Only if he were quite
certain that low investment in 1994 would not cause any problems could there
be some merit in the chancellor's policy. Given the limitations of economic
forecasting, we would favour a less cavalier approach.
A further problem with this kind of measure is that it introduces a new
element of unpredictability into the tax system with all the attendant
costs. What we do not want as we enter the next recession is for companies
to delay their investment in the expectation of a special tax concession if
they just wait a few months.
The chancellor began his Autumn Statement by insisting that 'the government
has no intention of engineering a short-lived boom', and proceeded to
introduce a supplementary package of time-limited fiscal measures, the sole
rationale of which is that they can deliver a short-term stimulus. Long-term
business planning is not aided by this interference in the tax system.
Norman Lamont was right to reject this policy in March, and wrong to succumb
to its superficial attractions now. If he wants to promote industrial
investment for the long term, he needs to embrace a more serious
restructuring of the corporate tax system than this.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Local taxation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNUAL ritual of UK local taxation began its course yesterday, with the
government announcing details of its grant to local authorities. The
environment secretary, Mr Michael Howard, said that it allowed for a 3.1 per
cent increase in expenditure. This appears generous given the 1.5 per cent
ceiling on the public-sector pay bill, since 70 per cent of local spending
goes on wages.
The local authorities disagreed. The grant is 3.1 per cent up on what
councils were supposed to spend last year, but only 0.4 per cent more than
they calculate they actually spent. Since the government has tightened the
capping rules to curb high spenders, many councils will be unable to
increase their spending next year even if they wish to. Some - including
Conservative authorities - are threatening cuts in services.
This year, there is an added complication in the replacement of the poll tax
by the council tax. The transitional relief scheme to ease the introduction
of the new tax should ensure that winners outnumber losers, according to
ministers. But many people will find the new tax difficult to understand,
not least its cunning banding system which has provided a steady flow of
misleading press stories about average bills throughout the summer and
autumn. And people living in homes which have fallen in value recently may
feel that a tax based on property values in April 1991 is unfair. As with
any tax change, there will be losers who will be vocal, and winners who are
likely to keep their good fortune to themselves. A tranquil debut for the
new tax is unlikely.
All of this points to another political storm over local taxation in the new
year. There will be pressure for a further switch from local taxation to
central government grants, as in 1991 when VAT was increased to hold down
poll tax bills. This should be resisted. Council tax is already too highly
geared, providing only 15 per cent of local government revenue. Any increase
in gearing would further undermine the tax base of local government and
constrain its ability to provide services in line with local wishes.
The real concern about yesterday's announcement, however, is not in the
figures but in the fact that they so greatly restrict discretion to increase
funding on local services. That makes local government little more than the
local administration of Whitehall's policies and priorities - an outcome
which is most undesirable for British democracy.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: 'Annie' gets it right - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modern musicals have become very sophisticated, so it takes a while to
re-acclimatise to the simpler and more innocent world of Irving Berlin:
perhaps five minutes. Annie Get Your Gun is a masterpiece.
Roger Redfarn's wonderful production takes off with one of the early and
least known songs, 'You Can't Get a Man with a Gun'. The song is both
dramatic and prophetic, for it gives the full stage to Annie, allowing her
to maraud around with a rifle, firing and singing at the same time, and the
words turn out to be true since, as Annie realises at the end, indeed you
can't get a man with a gun. In a shooting competition with a man, nice girls
learn to finish second.
Other songs come flowing back. Who would have thought it was possible to
have 'There's No Business Like Show Business', 'Falling in Love is
Wonderful', 'My Defences are Down', 'I Got the Sun in the Morning', and
'Anything You can Do' all in the same show? Moreover, those are only the
most familiar numbers. Almost as much pleasure is to be had from the change
in style to 'Moonshine Lullaby' and the simplicity of 'An Old Fashioned
Wedding'.
This is not an exercise in nostalgia for the over-40s. Annie is as fresh
today as it can have ever been. It is based on the simplest of plots with a
slight twist: not so much boy meets girl as girl meets boy. Few musicals can
have told the story better. Here is a wild female spirit who decides to tame
herself to get her man.
It is also a story about the sheer joy as well as the grind of show
business: hence the famous song. 'No Business' ought to be the marching song
of the theatrical profession. Berlin had the genius to be sentimental
without being soppy. I wonder if anyone can listen to 'Falling in Love is
Wonderful' without being moved. He could do dramatic switches as well. The
reprise of 'Falling in Love' comes immediately after the hugely raucous 'I
Got the Sun in the Morning'. From the stage being packed with people dancing
and singing in evening dress, we return suddenly to the simplicity of Annie
and the man she loves.
Above all, the piece abounds with self-confidence. The words are as good as
the tunes. The diction is clear, nothing is slurred, and the songs do not
repeat themselves. Some of them go on for verse after verse with new words.
Nothing is overdone. Children on stage do not steal the show, and Chief
Sitting Bull does not force any comments about the treatment of American
Indians. Everyone is in this show together.
If the original self-confidence came from Berlin's book and lyrics,
Redfarn's direction and the choreography by Gillian Gregory pick up where
Berlin left off. Seldom has one seen a production that gets so deliberately
stronger and stronger as it goes on. The party scene in the second act is
big theatre. So is the final shooting scene, but the smaller scenes in act
one are needed in order to make the full impact.
Annie is played by the American Kim Criswell. As the title suggests, it is
the part in the show and she performs immaculately. She would not be able to
do so with such conviction, however, without the total support of the rest
of the cast from John Diedrich (the man she falls for) down to the extras.
Diedrich is an impeccable straight male lead who can sing, shoot and act.
Here is one of the most professional productions on a London stage. It has
arrived in association with the Theatre Royal, Plymouth whose specialisation
in musicals over the last few years is paying off many times over. Buddy,
which also came from Plymouth, is still running in the West End. Barnum
follows next month.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: A New Zealand 'Hamlet' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal New Zealand Ballet is making its British debut this week in
Northampton's lively Derngate Theatre. The company will mark its 40th
anniversary next year; the decades have been marked by hard slogging to
establish the troupe, but the result, as I saw on Wednesday night, is a
group of artists who work very well indeed. Forces are modest: 26 dancers;
two pianos and a small band of instrumentalists; design that offers wit and
ingenuity rather than egregious display. The effect is pleasing at every
moment, and in the case of a two-act Hamlet, much more than that.
The statutory calling card was a Faust Divertissement which uses Gounod's
adorable Walpurgisnacht romp (where the devil does have the best tunes) for
polite classic entries confected by Galina Samsova and Andre Prokovsky.
There are too many orange shifts for the girls, but the dances are pretty
enough, the company's academic style is well-mannered, and in the Chinese
danseur Ou Lou, we see a virtuoso of beautifully secure and even technique.
The point of the evening, though, is the Hamlet which Jonathan Taylor
(remembered as a dancer and choreographer with Ballet Rambert) has made for
the company. It has much to recommend it. Taylor's decision to follow most
of Shakespeare's action can be called into question, since he becomes
somewhat prisoner of his text. The piece is too long, and would benefit by
editing. But Taylor's mime-dance language is fluent, and no less so his
staging. He benefits from excellent design by Allan Lees. Large stone
obelisks are manoeuvrered to indicate locale. An opening at the back of the
walled set allows for additional scenes - Marcellus and Horatio on guard;
Claudius and Gertrude in state. Costume design offers strong shapes, a brave
use of fabric for clearly characterised identities, a vivid sense of
history.
Taylor is eminently successful in evoking a late mediaeval society as
setting for the drama. The play scene has the hurly-burly of a fair; the
darkness and menace of Elsinore itself is always present. Admirably lit, by
Ian Perkins, filled with the vitality of the New Zealanders' performance,
Hamlet also benefits from a brilliantly conceived and executed score.
William Southgate has turned to the music of the renaissance, adapting and
re-scoring melodies for an ensemble of seven musicians - playing a variety
of real and electronic instruments - which gives a secure and highly
atmospheric base for the action. The staging tells everywhere of what can be
achieved by taste and imagination when faced with the needs for economical
touring, rather than the twin demons of inane expenditure or cheapjack
flummery that we can see with other ensembles currently rattling round this
country.
The RNZB dancers play this Hamlet with tremendous will. They look serious,
gifted artists. Characterisations are clear - how good to see Harry
Haythorne again, as a fussy Polonius - and Taylor's sense of theatre suits
them well. Kilian O'Callaghan's Hamlet is a man of action; Kerry-Anne
Gilberd makes a touching Ophelia. The company's achievements - in
performance; in the artistic attitudes implicit in this ballet - deserve
every praise. And so do the seven musicians who accompany, and greatly
enhance, the production.
The Royal New Zealand Ballet: Derngate Theatre, Northampton until November
28.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Before the Wigmore Hall shut up shop for refurbishing, a pair of
French-Canadian artists offered striking rewards in two recitals that
included Beethoven's five sonatas for cello and piano. On Tuesday Sophie
Rolland and Marc-Andre Hamelin resurfaced at St. John's, Smith Square, with
a frankly cello-oriented programme: bright chances for the pianist in their
Grieg and Samuel Barber sonatas, all of which Hamelin seized eagerly, but
basically soloist-and-accompanist stuff.
As a musical partnership, it is virtually seamless. There were keen
interpretative insights in every work. In Martinu's seductive Variations on
a Slovakian Theme, Miss Rolland sported ripely ethnic portamento swoops
whilst Hamelin conjured up cimbalom-sounds; in Grieg's A minor Sonata he
rang all the echoes of the much-loved Concerto in the same key, while the
cellist adapted her portamenti to Victorian salon-style. They found no clear
trajectory through Barber's early Sonata, but they lit up its passing ideas
as vividly as could be.
There was nevertheless a sense of some restraint,of compromise. Hamelin has
been described as a 'super-virtuoso'; more precisely, he is a thoughtful
young musician with an all-encompassing technique - incisive dispatch,
brilliant clarity in quick passages, gorgeously balanced chords.
Contrariwise Miss Rolland's address is soft-grained and discreetly
suggestive, unemphatic, elusive: I soon lost count of the times when she
began what we expected to be a broad line with a brittle sforzando/piano, a
sudden stab reduced at once to a bated-breath hush.
In late Debussy she capitalised upon the trick to striking effect. That
Sonata is at once haunted and mannered, abrupt and whimsical; Rolland
captured not only its sudden mood-switches, but also its sense of a chill
ironic distance. Its original title was to have been Pierrot fache avec la
lune ('Pierrot being cross with the moon'), invoking both commedia dell'arte
and an absurdist joke - for which Hamelin scaled-down scrupulously to play
an elegant foil to Rolland's nervy soliloquising.
Yet the swimmy St. John's acoustic guaranteed that the piano-resonance would
swallow up the cello's bass-register: even when Rolland was at her most
delicate and agile down there, what we heard was only a soft oleaginous
mutter. As solo-with-accompaniment, a lot of the music sounded the wrong way
round. I think she deserves another partner with a naturally chamber-sized
attack, and Hamelin a thrusting competitor of another clean-edged,
super-polished order.

Class changed The controller of BBC2, Alan Yentob, seems to have decided
that the first two hours of Friday evening should be devoted to what might
be called 'heritage television'. Thus the 1965 children's puppet series
Stingray (6.00) is followed at 6.25 by another series from the same year,
The Man From UNCLE, the United Network Command for Law Enforcement whose
main agents were Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin, played by Robert Vaughn
and David McCallum.
At 7.15 comes an old Dr Who story starring Jon Pertwee which the BBC had
junked. Luckily some fanatic somewhere had kept a monochrome recording and
the BBC has now 'colourized' this so that it can be re-shown. Dr Who began
in 1963, but the oldest series of the lot in this early evening blitz is
What The Papers Say which began in 1956 and looks like it.
If you liked 'Civvies' with its violence and sentimentality, and 'Prime
Suspect' with its unusually nasty murder plot and hatred of men, and
'Widows' with its amoral attitude towards female criminals, then you may
well like Framed (9.00 ITV) since all these works are by Lynda La Plante.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: Forged in the face of Nature - Susan Moore admires the
work of the Barbizon school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outdoor painting in oil began long before Monet shocked the art
establishment with 'Impression, Sunrise'. The biographers of Claude claim
that this revered master of the classical landscape was making oil sketches
direct from nature in the mid 17th century. The practice was revived in
France by Desportes early the following century, and continued in Italy,
with the Welshman Thomas Jones, Claude-Joseph Vernet, Valenciennes and Corot
all following in the great man's footsteps.
The broadly painted oil sketch 'made in haste, in order to seize Nature as
she is' was a well-established element in a young artist's training by the
time a group of French naturalist painters began to converge on the small
town of Barbizon, at the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleu, in the 1830s.
Barbizon &amp; l'Ecole de la Nature, organised by Agnew's in association with
Brame &amp; Lorenceau of Paris and the Artemis group, is a delightful show
bringing together over 40 paintings and pastels, plus a staircase of
drawings, by the now unfashionable and unjustly neglected precursors of
Impressionism. The exhibits are witness to the fresh, responsive and highly
expressive techniques forged in the face of nature by the open-air painters
 -and to the extent to which the informal lessons of the field were applied
to the finished studio pictures destined for public exhibition.
Corot, like his English near-contemporary John Constable, remained a keen
outdoor painter long after his student years, frequently working with the
Barbizon painter Daubigny after 1852. His view of M. Wallet's park at
Voisinlieu on a chill, bright winter's day in 1866, is ample proof that he,
like Constable, kept faith with the idea of the natural landscape. The bare
trees in the middle distance are well observed and show great sensitivity to
infinitely subtle nuances of tone. Nonetheless, the mood he evokes is
essentially poetical and romantic, the muzzy technique typical of his later
works. There is none of the directness of touch and tonal clarity that
characterises the small oil sketches.
A similar distinction between the experimental, private sketch and the
finished work of art seems to have been drawn by Rousseau who, like Diaz,
sought absolute fidelity to nature. The sombre, rugged and untamed nature he
found so close to Paris in the Forest of Fontainebleu provided endless
motifs. His major canvases bring to mind Baudelaire's description of him as
'a naturalist ceaselessly swept towards the ideal'. They are in marked
contrast to the series of deliciously fresh and fluid oil sketches here. To
our eyes these are works of art in their own right, and highly covetable. I
doubt Rousseau would have agreed.
A handful of sun-dappled forest glades, presumably painted at Fontainebleu,
come from the hand of Diaz. In their rich tone and impasted paint they
recall the robust realism of Rubens's landscapes, and serve as a reminder of
the Barbizon painters' enthusiasm for 17th century Dutch and Netherlandish
landscape art. The influence of contemporary British art in stimulating a
fresh approach to nature is also apparent. A number of British pictures -
Constable's 'Hay-Wain' among them - had taken the 1824 Paris Salon by storm.
Constable's animated touch and unaffected response to the natural world, the
light and breadth of Turner and Bonnington, and the general high-key colour
of the British school, seem to have left their mark.
Landscape was not the primary concern of all the Barbizon painters and their
associates. Millet, represented here by pastels and drawings, was more
concerned with recording rural life rather than scenery. His depictions of
the peasantry at work are radically different from the sentimentalised
rustics portrayed by George Morland - the artist, along with Constable, whom
Dupre most wanted to study in England. 'Scottish Deerhounds' is an
impressive piece by Constant Troyon who was responsible for re-establishing
the genre of animal painting in France.
The outdoor painting of Daubigny and Harpignies, both disciples of Corot,
provide the link between the Barbizon painters and the Impressionists.
Particularly notable is Harpignies' depiction of the immense aqueduct at
Briare, designed by Eiffel; and the breadth and boldness of Huet's romantic
description of the play of light on the surface of the sea, seems only a
step away from Monet's infamous 'Impression'. The crucial difference between
them is that Monet signed and dated his 'sketch' and sent it for public
exhibition.
Pissarro, another protege of Corot, takes pride of place in Oeuvres
Choisies, an exhibition of Impressionist and Post Impressionist art at JPL
Fine Arts, 26 Davies Street, W1, until January 29. On show are paintings,
pastels, watercolours and drawings by Pissarro, Degas, Sisley, Berthe
Morisot, Guillaumin, Cross, Luce, Signac, Roussel, Bonnard, Vuillard and
Denis.
'Barbizon &amp; l'Ecole de la Nature' continues at Agnew's, 43 Old Bond Street,
London W1, until December 18.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: Hansel and Gretel - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it was new in 1987 David Pountney's staging of Hansel and Gretel seemed
a rare stroke of operatic inspiration, an unforgettable piece of
re-invention which opened up Humperdinck's opera to a new set of resonances.
Now, on its second revival at ENO (overseen by David Sulkin) the spell is
less potent. There are still many incidental delights, and continued
evidence of the thoughtful preparation that informed the production from the
start, but the spark of enchantment is missing and the weak points in the
concept have become less easy to accept.
There was, always, the feeling that Pountney's painstaking post-war
reworking was pandering to the fortysomethings' nostalgia for the
coin-in-the-slot gas meters and wardrobe-sized refrigerators of their
childhood. Instead of universalising this little tale of redemption he had
given it a frisson of recognition for his own generation, overladen with the
heavy hint of family violence and child abuse.
All that, and the stage pictures it created, saw the production through its
stickier patches. No one could pretend that the final scene with the
Witch/Mother was a polished and convincing piece of theatre: Gretel's fussy
wanderings around the house, Hansel's casual escape from his cage and their
contrived tumbling of the Witch into the cooker seemed decidedly
half-hearted. But such moments were banished by the memory of the pantomime
sequence, its parade of familiar figures - postman, policeman, courting
couple - dusted in radiant, make-believe white to conjure up a wonderful
tableaux, which transformed the everyday image into the escapist dream.
That first-act ending remains a bewitching piece of theatre, but on
Wednesday the rest of the evening only sporadically caught the same spirit.
It was sensitively but all rather placidly conducted by Lionel Friend; one
sensed the Wagnerian echoes being pinpointed and gently emphasised rather
than left to contribute to the whole unselfconscious effect. The stage
action too seemed respectful rather than wholeheartedly engaged; only Ethna
Robinson's Hansel, the single survivor from the 1987 cast, went about her
business with real zeal and spirit.
The remainder of the cast, though, was much more than adequate, merely short
of an ounce of vividness. Rose Mannion's Gretel was beautifully sung, just a
little too prim for a production that sets out to demonstrate the grinding
consequences of deprivation. As the Mother Phyllis Cannan caught that
downtrodden feeling well; as the Witch she wisely never went over the top.
Donald Maxwell is now the Father, smartly besuited in pointed contrast to
his wife's grimy pinafore. Julie Gossage and Yvonne Barclay provide sharp
cameos of the Sandman and the Dew Fairy; certainly some of their magic
remains in this intriguing production.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Technology: Stalking the enemy within - Thousands of people
die every year from infections that resist antibiotics. Clive Cookson
continues a series on drug discovery by looking at new ways of killing germs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Infectious diseases are re-emerging as a serious threat to health in
advanced industrialised countries, the US National Academy of Sciences says
in an alarming new report. A particular cause for concern is the growing
resistance of microbes to antibiotic drugs.
The NAS report follows a series of calls by American microbiologists and
epidemiologists for an end to the 'era of complacency' about infectious
illnesses.
'The medical community and society at large have tended to view acute
infectious diseases as a problem of the past,' said Robert Shope of Yale
University. 'But that assumption is wrong. We claimed victory too soon.'
The drugs industry is listening to such views - and is attracted by the
growing commercial potential of antibiotics. Their sales are now
accelerating fast, after a sluggish spell in the 1980s. Stewart Adkins, a
pharmaceutical analyst at Shearson Lehman, estimates that the worldwide
market for antibiotics was worth Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) last year, 12
per cent up on 1990. 'Drug resistance is the key driver of the market,' he
said.
Soon after penicillin came into use in the 1940s, microbiologists began to
find resistant strains emerging, as a simple result of selective evolution.
If any bacteria survive a course of antibiotic treatment, they will be the
ones with natural resistance, while their more susceptible sisters are wiped
out.
However, pharmaceutical researchers managed to avert a penicillin resistance
crisis by discovering new classes of antibiotics - cephalosporins,
tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, carbapenems - which doctors could use
instead.
As bacteria became resistant to one drug, doctors could prescribe another.
But for some bacteria, this approach has come to the end of the road. All
over the world, people are dying as a result of infections which do not
respond to any of the 160 different antibiotics on the market.
The problem has been exacerbated by excessive use. Although antibiotics
attack bacteria rather than viruses, there are still many doctors willing to
prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients with ill-defined symptoms
that are almost certainly viral in origin. And the veterinary industry has
contributed by dosing farm animals with unnecessary antibiotics.
Estimates of the total cost of antibiotic resistance in the US range up to
Dollars 30bn a year. Organisms in which resistance is a serious problem
include Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and many others. They cause a horrifying range of diseases,
from pneumonia to meningitis.
People are most likely to fall victim to a resistant organism when they go
into hospital. In the US, 5 per cent of patients - some 2m people - pick up
infections they did not have when entering hospital, and more than 20,000 of
them die every year, according to the NAS report. 'Every year,
hospital-acquired infections account for between Dollars 5bn and Dollars
10bn in additional medical-related expenses.'
Meanwhile, drug companies continue to develop novel antibiotics for use
against microbes that are resistant to the old ones.
Several promising newcomers come from Japan. Lorabid, discovered by Kyowa
Hakku and just launched in the US by Eli Lilly, is the first in a new class
of oral antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity, the carbacephems.
Pharmaceutical analysts say Lorabid could be a Dollars 1bn-a-year
blockbuster for Lilly, the leading US antibiotics manufacturer.
In the UK, ICI has high hopes for meropenem, discovered by Sumitomo and
developed as an Anglo-Japanese collaboration. Meropenem - due to be launched
in Europe in 1994 - belongs to a related class of antibiotics, the
carbapenems, which also have a very wide range of anti-bacterial activity.
But SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US group, has taken the lead in tackling
resistance head on. Bacteria protect themselves against many antibiotics by
producing an enzyme called beta-lactamase which destroys the antibiotic
before it has a chance to destroy them. After a long search SB found a
substance, clavulanic acid, which inhibits the production of beta-lactamase
in bacteria.
SB combined clavulanic acid with amoxyllin, a well-established derivative of
penicillin, to create Augmentin. Augmentin cures a wide range of infections
that are resistant to amoxyllin itself and its sales are rising rapidly.
This year or next, Augmentin is expected to overtake Lilly's Ceclor and
become the world's best-selling brand of antibiotic.
According to SB, no resistance to Augmentin has yet emerged. But the drug is
by no means powerful enough to deal with all bacteria, and SB scientists are
developing other combinations of antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors,
which promise to be more potent and wide-ranging.
At the same time, several small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
are working on more radical solutions to the resistance problem. They are
using natural peptides - small protein molecules produced by living
creatures such as frogs, insects and bacteria themselves as a chemical
defence against microbes - as a basis for developing alternative
bacteriocidal drugs.
These peptides, which go by various names such as bacteriocins, magainins
and cecropins, work in a quite different way to conventional antibiotics.
They kill bacteria by 'punching holes in their cell walls so that their guts
spill out,' as David Guttman, chief executive of Applied Microbiology, puts
it. It is far more difficult for bacteria to evolve resistance to this
external attack than to antibiotics, which interfere with their inner
workings.
Applied Microbiology, a biotechnology company based in New York, is
developing drugs based on nisin, a peptide produced by Lactococcus bacteria
in milk to kill off competing microbes. Nisin is manufactured in the UK by
Aplin &amp; Barrett - now owned by Applied Microbiology - and has been used as a
food preservative for 30 years without any resistance emerging.
By combining nisin with chemicals known as chelating agents, scientists at
Applied Microbiology have created powerful drugs with a broad spectrum of
anti-bacterial activity. One target is Helicobacter pylori, an important
cause of peptic ulcers.
Magainin Pharmaceutical, based in Pennsylvania, is focusing on defensive
peptides which frogs secrete from their skins. The company's first magainin
drug, a topical antibiotic for skin infections, started human clinical
trials last month.
In the UK, Proteus is using computer-aided molecular design techniques to
change the structure of the peptides, so as to make them more potent and
longer-lasting than the natural chemicals. Its drugs have shown promise in
laboratory tests but are not yet ready for human trials.
A limitation of many peptides is that they are broken down by the human
digestive system and therefore cannot be taken by mouth to give a systemic
effect. But Magainin is developing modified versions which could be systemic
antibiotics. And Jay Moorin, chief executive, is excited about a recently
discovered molecule, squalamine, which circulates in the blood of sand
sharks. 'It is the broadest spectrum natural antibiotic we have every seen,
and it's absorbable orally,' he says.
Entirely new antibiotics such as squalamine may help to turn back the tide
of infectious disease in the next century. Until then both the human and
animal health sectors must learn to curb their excessive use of antibiotics.
An article on drugs to treat depression will appear shortly before
Christmas.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Technology: Ten light bulbs for the price of one - Worth
Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chandeliers at Chatsworth House and the light bulbs in the Goat Inn
public house near Peterborough both exploit a British design for increasing
the life of the ordinary light bulb.
The Bulbsaver, developed by Microcel, of Peterborough, is a tiny device
installed behind the wall switch. The chip-on-a-circuit reduces the
electrical surge which occurs when the light is switched on and which
weakens the filaments in the bulb. The designers say the life of bulbs
should be increased 10 times.
At Pounds 4 per unit the Bulbsaver will be most widely used where it is
difficult to replace bulbs - in belisha beacons or railway signals - or
where one switch controls a large number of bulbs. Microcel: UK, 0778

An extract of toadstool has been adapted by ICI Agrochemicals, of Haslemere,
Surrey, to attack its nearest and dearest - fungi. The broad spectrum
fungicide should be most effective on cereals, vines and rice.
ICIA5504 has been developed from the strobilurins and oudemansins found in
toadstools. Unlike traditional fungicides, the chemical penetrates the
fungal spores and mycelium and blocks the energy-producing processes needed
for growth. This means fungi have built up no resistance to the chemical.

Many strange facets of natural behaviour have been blamed on the phases of
the moon - not least the existence of werewolves. Now, one strange
phenomenon has been given the seal of authority from the highest scientific
sources.
The European laboratory for particle physics (Cern), in Geneva, has
demonstrated that the earth's surface has tides, like the sea. These tiny
deformations were discovered when scientists noticed variations in the
energy of the particle beams circulating in an electron positron collider
(Lep) which is helping research into the structure of matter.
Over the 27km circumference of the Lep, scientists noticed variations of a
millimetre depending on the phase of the moon - a miniscule amount to the
layman but of the utmost importance to particle physicists. Cern:

FT  27 NOV 92 / Management: When to contract out and when to stay in -
Christopher Lorenz considers the view that outsourcing must be handled with
care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After all the action of the past few years on the popular but controversial
topic of subcontracting and 'outsourcing', you could be forgiven for
thinking that companies now understood all the competitive and financial
benefits involved.
Witness the recent flood of head office cutbacks in favour of 'outsourced'
services such as computing and even accounting. Observe also the myriad of
corporate decisions to subcontract the manufacture, and sometimes also the
design, of a growing number of components and sub-assemblies.
Witness, too, the considerable concern which has been expressed about the
risks of taking the process too far, to the extent that a company becomes
'hollowed out' by outsourcing even products and processes which should be
kept in house if it wants to retain vital 'core competencies'.
So it comes as quite a surprise to find a senior executive at one of the
world's leading manufacturers arguing that outsourcing has not gone nearly
far enough.
Too many companies are continuing to over-invest in the proprietary
development and manufacture of simple commodity (or standard) components, he
argues. But such is their confusion over sourcing policy that they are also
subcontracting key items which are hard to make but which should be
proprietary.
In place of this confusion, Ravi Venkatesan, assistant to the group vice
president of operations at Cummins Engine, proposes a practical and
systematic way of deciding which components are 'strategic', and should be
kept in house, and which can be subcontracted safely.
Cummins' development of this approach in the late 1980s had painful results.
For instance, an emotional three-year debate led to a decision to outsource
the design and manufacture of pistons to two more advanced world-class
suppliers whose scale enabled them to invest 20 times as much as Cummins in
the development of new products and processes.
Instead, Cummins decided to focus organisational energy and resources on
other areas where it hoped to build leadership, notably electronics,
ceramics and alternative fuels.
Venkatesan then decided to look more carefully at other companies in
Cummins' league which were facing the same conundrum. Between 1990 and this
year, he studied six other large manufacturers, including John Deere, JI
Case, and Navistar International (the former International Harvester).
Venkatesan says in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review* that his
investigations produced disturbing findings.
He explains: 'Many of these companies have systematically over-invested in
commodity parts and have neglected developing the proprietary components
that could, and must, become sources of competitive advantage.'
Among other disadvantages, this causes a low rate of improvement in
manufacturing performance, as resources are spread thinly across thousands
of parts.
Venkatesan's 'strategic sourcing' process starts by examining the strategic
or other characteristics not of individual components, but of the systems
and sub-systems into which they fit. Only then is the status of individual
components assessed.
The first thing for each company to decide is which sub-systems will be key
to its competitive position in subsequent product generations. This choice
will vary between competitors and influence product differentiation
fundamentally.
Sub-systems should be classified as strategic when they:
have a high impact on what customers perceive as the most important product
attributes;
require highly specialised design and manufacturing skills and specialised
physical facilities, for which there are very few, if any, capable
independent suppliers;
involve technology that is relatively fluid and in which there is a
significant likelihood of gaining a technological lead.
Two key questions must then be answered.
What are the supplier's design and manufacturing capabilities relative to
the company?
What would it cost to catch up with the best suppliers and can the company
afford it?
As with Cummins' difficult decision to outsource pistons, the answers to
these questions may prompt a company to exit from a component business even
when the item in question is deemed 'strategic'. But if design, as well as
production, of the part has to be outsourced, Venkatesan claims that a
company can still protect itself by controlling its design and production
'architecture'.
In this sense, the term 'architectural knowledge' applies to the detailed
and specialised power of translation which is needed to capture customer
requirements and reproduce them as performance specifications for
sub-systems.
The ability to specify and control the performance characteristics of a
sub-system is more important than in-house manufacture, or even design,
concludes Venkatesan.
But his advice carries a sting in its tail. If such outsourcing is
carelessly planned and executed, it 'can result in the destruction of
architectural knowledge within a single product generation', he warns. 'Lost
architectural knowledge has always been difficult to get back. Today it is
virtually impossible.'

FT  27 NOV 92 / People: Shuffle in HSBC boardroom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank, has been appointed a
non-executive deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, replacing John Gray who is
stepping down as an executive deputy chairman in order to concentrate on his
new job as chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Sir Peter's promotion follows HSBC's acquisition of Midland earlier this
year and, while not unexpected, is part of a boardroom reshuffle which means
that Midland directors will hold a quarter of the seats on HSBC's 20-strong
board.
Sir Peter, 61, who was chairman of BP for eight years until March 1990, is
being joined on the HSBC board by Sir Colin Marshall (left), 59, chief
executive of British Airways, and Geoffrey Maitland Smith (right), also 59,
chairman of Sears. Richard Delbridge, a former JP Morgan banker who only
joined Midland three years ago, is joining the HSBC board as executive
director finance.
It was originally intended that Sir Patrick Meaney, the chairman of Rank
Organisation and one of Midland's longest serving directors, would go on the
HSBC board, but he died some months ago. In addition Brian Goldthorpe, who
had represented Midland on the HSBC board since 1991, also died recently.
Meanwhile, Nigel Rich, managing director of Jardine Matheson Holdings, and
John Swaine, deputy president of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, will step
down as non-executive directors of HSBC Holdings but will remain on the
board of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. John Gray will remain on the
HSBC board.

Eric Cliffe (above), Boots Pharmaceuticals' managing director, is to retire
next month after 33 years with The Boots Company. He is not being directly
replaced; the organisation he headed has been divided into three separate
units: Boots Pharmaceuticals, Boots Healthcare International and Boots
Contract Manufacturing.
Barry Clare has been appointed managing director of Boots Healthcare
International which is responsible for Boots' European consumer products.
Meanwhile, John Watson has been made managing director of Boots Contract
Manufacturing which supplies Boots The Chemists.
Gordon Solway is now managing director of Boots pharmaceuticals as well as a
main board director of The Boots Company. He faces the difficult job of
overseeing the international launch of Manoplax, a heart treatment vital to
the company's hopes of remaining a credible drugs group. Boots expects the
medicine to be approved in the US, the world's largest market, by the end of
this financial year next March.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tom Butler (right) makes the move up from heading EDS-Scicon's manufacturing
division to managing director of the UK subsidiary as John Bateman takes
responsibility for the US computing services firm's operations in Europe.
Butler, 'just the wrong side of 40', has been with the company for just two
years but his former career includes periods with Hoskyns, now part of Cap
Gemini Sogeti, Andersen Consulting and Perot Systems, the company started by
US presidential candidate Ross Perot after his controversial exodus from
General Motors.
A mechanical engineer by background, educated at Glasgow and Strathclyde
universities, Butler's early experience was in the oil and chemical
industries.
EDS-Scicon was formed through the merger of the US company EDS with
SD-Scicon of the UK a year ago with Bateman as its first managing director.
It is now one of the largest facilities management companies in the UK,
taking responsibility for its customers' entire data processing operations.
Butler will continue moves to focus the company on customers' needs.
EDS-Scicon is now well integrated structurally but unifying the two, very
different, companies would take 'several more months if not several years'.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Motor credit sales improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for cautious optimism in the motor trade came yesterday in
statistics released by HPI, the vehicle credit information agency.
Third-quarter sales of new and used vehicles bought on credit showed a
recovery from steep drops in the first half of this year and the final
quarter of 1991. That comes in the wake of an 8.1 per cent rise last month
in total new car sales.
'It appears that interest rate cuts and low prices - particularly in the
used-car market - are helping finance sales on the way to recovery,' said Dr
Brian Bailey, HPI's chairman.
Third-quarter sales of new cars on credit were down 1.1 per cent
year-on-year ard with a fall of 12.7 per cent in the second quarter.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Rover to cut Metro numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP is to end night-shift production of Metros at Longbridge to
bring output more into line with demand in the UK's currently depressed
market for new cars. It is also to reduce output of the Rover 200/400 range
from 4,500 a week to 4,250, John Grifffiths writes.
Both cuts will start when Longbridge's 15,000 employees return to work after
the Christmas break. There will be no lay-offs and the 1,800 Metro night
workers will be re-assigned to an expanded Metro day shift and other tasks.
The net effect will be to reduce Metro output by about 15 per cent to 1,650
cars a week.
Yesterday Rover said the lower output levels would be indefinite but under
constant review.
Rover's decision has been influenced by the continued depressed state of UK
demand and the weakening of several continental markets. Rover's
introduction of a 'lean' distribution system, in which the holding of large
stocks by dealers has been discontinued, has also been a factor.

<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUPA, the UK's biggest private health insurer, yesterday announced that it
will not increase small-business customers' insurance premiums in January,
thereby stemming the drift upwards in rates over the past four years.
Customers of Bupa's CompanyCare scheme, available to businesses with fewer
than 100 employees, will face average rate rises of 7.2 per cent on policies
renewed through to next spring, reflecting an increase announced last May.
Bupa said rates for bigger corporate subscribers, whose premium rates
directly reflect the value of claims during the year, are not affected by
yesterday's move.
Individual customers renewing their BupaCare programme will face a total
rise of 14.7 per cent, reflecting changes in July and an average 6.1 per
cent increase from January.
Bupa has negotiated a number of deals with hospital groups - reducing the
cost of hospital care - and has also persuaded more subscribers to use
day-care surgery.

FT  27 NOV 92 / 3i rebels poised to seek a stronger voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of companies from all over the UK will attend a meeting in
Birmingham today to set up a national club for clients of 3i, the venture
capital company owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks.
About 100 people are expected to attend. The group, consisting of some of
the 4,000 companies in 3i's investment portfolio, is seeking a stronger
voice in the organisation.
The originators of the club, Mr John Garrod, founder, chairman and managing
director of Tyne and Wear-based engineering company Rite-Vent, and Mr Roy
Stabler, his financial director, are concerned that the planned flotation of
3i may mean the long-term interests of its customers are sacrificed.
'It's a battle between the interests of shareholders' short-termism and the
pace at which the soul and heart, their customers, want to run their
businesses', says Mr Garrod.
Yesterday it became clear that Rite-Vent is involved in a legal dispute with
3i. It issued a writ last year against now-defunct 3i Consultants, claiming
damages and alleging negligence as result of work carried out in the mid
1980s.
3i said yesterday it did not feel Rite-Vent was the right sponsor for the
club because of the legal proceedings.
A request from Mr Alan Wheatley, chairman of 3i, for two 3i representatives
and a secretary to be admitted to the meeting was refused.
Mr Garrod also declined Mr Wheatley's request to send him the letters he has
received from 3i customers in response to the club proposal. Mr Garrod says
250 of the 300 received from 1,000 companies contacted support the club's
formation, and a number express dissatisfaction with 3i.
If today's meeting agrees to the club's creation, it will then decide its
objectives. Proposals include a place on the 3i board, an ombudsman and
complaints clearing house and a generous share-purchase scheme for existing
clients when the flotation of 3i goes ahead.
The flotation was postponed earlier this year, and was expected to have a
market capitalisation of up to Pounds 1.2bn.
3i, which has no formal representation for client companies, says it
believes its branch network already provides good communications. It adds
that if companies wish to form a club it is happy to co-operate.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Surge forecast for car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CAR production will begin to rise strongly next year as two new Japanese
plants come on stream and the UK market starts a slow recovery after three
years of recession, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says in
its latest forecast.
It adds that UK car production will rise by 12 per cent to 1.4m next year
from this year's 1.25m, and will reach 1.5m in 1994.
The SMMT suggests that UK demand for new cars will begin to pick up next
year from the deep recession of the past three years with sales rising to
1.62m next year and 1.75m in 1994.
UK sales of new cars peaked in 1989 at 2.3m but have fallen by about a third
in the past three years to 1.59m last year and 1.56m this year.
The SMMT also expects demand for new commercial vehicles to begin to recover
next year.
Sales of trucks above 3.5 tonnes have more than halved in the past three
years from 69,234 in 1989 to an expected 30,800 this year, the lowest level
since 1954. Demand is forecast by the SMMT to recover to 35,500 next year
with a further rise to 41,400 in 1994.
UK car output has performed relatively well during the recession with much
higher production for export markets largely making up for lower output for
the home market.
Production fell by only 4.8 per cent from the peak of 1.3m in 1989 to 1.24m
in 1991 in spite of a 30.9 per cent fall in UK sales of new cars in the same
period.
UK car production is now set to rise significantly throughout the 1990s
largely as a result of the three new car plants under development by Nissan,
Toyota and Honda.
The Nissan plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, which began limited volume
output in 1986, is expected to increase output next year to 270,000 from
175,000 this year. The plant is developing a capacity to produce 300,000
cars a year.
Honda began initial car production at its plant in Swindon, Wilts, last
month and Toyota will begin car output next month at its Pounds 700m
Burnaston plant near Derby.
According to the latest forecast by DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive
analysts, UK car output will rise from 1.4m next year to reach a record 2m
in 1997.
UK car production reached its previous peak in 1972 at 1.92m, but then
declined rapidly in the following decade to reach a low point of 888,000 in
1982.
The DRI forecast says production by the three Japanese carmakers in the UK
will have jumped to 660,000 by 1997 from 125,000 last year and will account
for about a third of UK car output by the late 1990s.
Rising output by Nissan and by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors
of the US, was the driving force behind UK car production in the first nine
months this year, figures released by the SMMT showed yesterday.
Higher production by these two carmakers compensated for lower output by
Rover and Ford. The specialist luxury carmakers continue to be hard hit,
however, with Rolls-Royce suffering a 35 per cent drop in output in the
first nine months, and Jaguar declining by 25 per cent.
Vauxhall has won one of its largest single orders from British
Telecommunications for cars and vans worth Pounds 105m at showroom prices,
John Griffiths writes.
The three-year order is for 10,000 vehicles including 5,000 Cavaliers, 1,500
Astra cars and 2,500 Astra vans.
BT runs one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe and last month placed an
order with Ford worth Pounds 220m at showroom prices for 8,300 Transit vans
and chassis cabs, as well as 9,000 Escort and 1,500 Fiesta vans.
The actual value of the orders to manufacturers is lower because of
discounts, which can be 30 per cent or more on large contracts.

ONE OF the main independent review bodies for public-sector pay is still
considering whether it is worthwhile preparing the annual report on its
sector since being stripped of its ability to recommend pay rises.
The doctors' and dentists' review body, like four of the five review bodies,
has been asked not to make a recommendation this year. The teachers' pay
review body was set up by statute and is obliged to make a recommendation.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in his Autumn Statement that
public-sector pay settlements for next year would be restricted to a maximum
of 1.5 per cent. He asked the review bodies to amend their remits for the
coming year and to make no recommendations about overall levels of pay, fees
or allowances for April 1 1993.
The doctors' and dentists' review body was asked to report on 'miscellaneous
matters' including general practitioners' fee scales and merit awards for
consultants.
The review body at first said that such a report would be 'inappropriate'.
But after correspondence with the government it has been reconsidering its
response and will make a final decision on Wednesday.
The other review bodies have said they are prepared to accept restricted
briefs.

26 prosecutions were brought against employees, with 19 convictions carrying

FT  27 NOV 92 / Women 'find new jobs more quickly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN executives find new jobs more quickly than men after being made
redundant or being fired, according to InterExec, the career management and
outplacement consultants, Lisa Wood writes.
A survey of the company's clients says men in the Pounds 30,000-Pounds
40,000 salary range took more than six months to get a new job while women
in the same bracket took just over three months.
The results are endorsed by DBM, another outplacement consultancy, which
said the most likely explanation was that women have to work harder to
become executives and therefore they are the better qualified when it comes
to making new job applications.
Consultants said, however, that men are better at networking among contacts
to find new jobs.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Lautro executive resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KIT JEBENS, chief exec-utive of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the
life assurance industry, said he had accepted the resignation of his deputy
after she had publicly expressed doubts about plans to reform regulation.
Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and administration officer, told Mr Jebens
last week she would resign rather than work for the proposed Personal
Investment Authority, which is to replace Lautro, arguing that it would not
take sufficient account of consumer interests.
Her remarks touched off a storm of protests from the financial services
industry. Lautro's board also strongly supports the creation of the PIA.
In a statement yesterday, Ms Leisching said she believed that
self-regulation had worked and that Lautro had been effective in raising
standards in the life industry.
Mr Mike Ross, managing director of Scottish Widows, the mutual life
assurance group, said yesterday that he had resigned from the board of
Lautro, which is checking on whether products sold to about 20,000 clients
by Scottish Widows' tied agents were appropriate.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Severe cuts in services feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authority associations reacted with dismay to the rate support grant
settlement and tight capping rules announced yesterday, claiming that they
would lead to severe cuts in local services.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle upon Tyne council and chairman of the
Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said the
'unrealistic' spending targets plus capping would leave 'local government
services in the worst state I've known them in my 25 years in local
government'.
The Association of County Councils pointed to the government's inconsistency
in allowing central government spending to rise by 6.6 per cent over this
year's actual expenditure, while local spending is to be restricted to a 0.4
per cent increase.
The government's failure to provide additional relief for business
ratepayers - who face a 3.5 per cent increase - was criticised by the
Federation of Small Businesses. 'All government help and rebates are aimed
at council-tax payers, yet the uniform business rate will raise twice as
much as council tax,' it said.
A warning of severe cuts in vital public services and of job losses even if
there was a public-sector pay freeze came from Labour MPs listening to Mr
Howard's statement, while Tory backbenchers complained about the
'inefficiencies' of Labour councils.
There were cross-party complaints about the way the government calculates
how much it thinks each local authority needs to spend.
Though MPs generally welcomed the government's move to incorporate some 1991
census data in drawing up its standard spending assessments, Tory and Labour
backbenchers were seriously concerned about the way these worked in
practice.
Mr Howard emphasised that the precise mechanism of distributing the grant
was still provisional, and undertook to look carefully at further
representations from councils about the way they were affected by the
system.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Labour plea over Civil Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR last night accused the government of trying to deprive Britain of a
national Civil Service through compulsory competitive tendering and the use
of private contractors.
But claims in the Commons by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow public service
minister, that she favoured testing public services against the market were
ridiculed by Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, and his
colleagues on the government front bench.
Mr Robert Jackson, junior public service minister, told Ms Mowlam: 'You are
in favour of market-testing on the basis that no contract is awarded to any
outside bidder.'
Mr Waldegrave envisaged the development of the so-called Next Steps agencies
resulting eventually in the Civil Service forming a 'relatively small
policy-making core' with independent organisations delivering services.
He said the National Health Service was benefiting from reforms separating
the purchasers of services from their providers, and said he aimed to
establish the same system throughout public service.
Mr Waldegrave accepted that there should be a level playing field between
'in-house' bids and those made by private contractors.
Inland Revenue typists and secretaries yesterday lobbied parliament to
protest at the alleged threat to taxpayers' confidentiality in plans to
privatise their work.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Council tax bills depend on local spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S ability to keep the average council tax bill in England
down to Pounds 500, the target announced yesterday, will depend critically
on ministers keeping firm control over local spending.
To that end, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has notably tightened
the rules allowing him to cap local council spending. But their
effectiveness will depend on the success of councils in keeping their pay
settlements for next year within the government's target range of 0 per cent
to 1.5 per cent for the public sector.
Applying the government's multiplier to the eight council tax bands, which
divide properties by their value in April 1991, gives the average bills in
the table, provided councils spend at or below government targets.
The government believes that the great majority of councils, if they keep
the lid on pay, should have no difficulty in keeping within its estimates of
spending needs ('standard spending assessments'). SSAs have been increased
by an average of 3.1 per cent on last year's, allowing for the transfer of
responsibilities to and from local government. Its rate support grant
funding for councils is to increase by 3.7 per cent.
However, the local government associations claim that the government's
Pounds 41.17bn target for total spending in 1993-94 represents only a 0.4
per cent increase on what councils are actually spending this year. They
also point to the fact that pay settlements for part of next year are
already agreed at above 3.7 per cent, a funding increase which in any case
includes money (like that to cushion the council tax) that cannot be applied
to existing services.
Most councils are now spending at or above SSA, which is also used as the
basis for capping. Of England's 39 county councils, only five are this year
spending more than 1 per cent below SSA, while two are more than 1 per cent
above. Barely one or two are expected to budget significantly below SSA next
year. Much therefore will depend on the ruthlessness with which the
government applies its capping rules for next year.
The capping rules are more generous than those announced for Scottish
authorities earlier in the month, but will still cause severe problems for
the large inner-city authorities spending well above SSA.
Under the rules, authorities planning to spend less than 1 per cent above
SSA will be restricted to a 2.5 per cent increase in total spending. That
will have the effect of capping most county councils to a spending increase
of about 3 per cent. However, authorities already more than 1 per cent above
SSA - including most cities - will be capped at much smaller increases.
Those planning to spend more than 10 per cent above will be capped at a 0.5
per cent increase on this year's bud-get.
Mr Howard claimed that councils need not raise any more from council tax
payers than they are taking from poll tax payers. Most analysts believe the
skills of a magician will be needed to achieve that.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Steelmaking gear may be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is negotiating with an unnamed Indonesian company for the sale
of plant and equipment from the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland, which
closed in June with the loss of 1,200 jobs.
The potential purchaser would transport the equipment to Indonesia to make
steel for the Far Eastern market, which is expected to be the most important
growth area in the world steel market over the next few years.
Reports that the steel would then be exported back to the UK were being
discounted yesterday.
The dominant Indonesian steel company is state-owned Krakatau Steel, but
there are smaller private producers and conglomerates such as Bakrie and
Brothers which have steel interests.
It is believed the Indonesian company is likely to be interested in
steelmaking machinery and control equipment rather than blast furnaces.
The equipment could include the hot strip mill, commissioned in 1962 and
closed early last year. The mill was regarded as an efficient strip producer
but too small to be economic except at very high throughput levels.
The Scottish National party said: 'This gives the lie to British Steel's
claim that Ravenscraig was clapped out or uncompetitive.'
But Dr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for Motherwell South, which includes the
plant, said: 'Ravenscraig is never going to operate again so the sale of the
plant doesn't affect Motherwell.'

FT  27 NOV 92 / Big cement groups switch from rail to roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE and Castle Cement, two of British Rail's biggest freight
customers, yesterday said they were switching nearly 500,000 tonnes of
freight a year from rail to road because of BR price increases.
The move will result in an extra 20,000 road journeys a year by fully laden
38-tonne articulated trucks. Other railfreight customers say they are
considering similar moves.
News of the shift came as Charterail, the pioneering private-sector
railfreight distributor which ceased trading in August, announced that it
had gone into liquidation with the loss of 120 jobs.
Charterail had earlier accused BR of prompting its collapse by charging too
much for use of its locomotives and tracks. The company's failure has put an
estimated 10,000 truckloads of freight a year on the road. Charterail's
failure and the loss of the cement business are the most significant
indicators yet that the government is not prepared to intervene to stop the
continuing drift of freight from rail to road.
They will also heighten fears that privatisation will increase the drift
because charges to railfreight users will rise as the railways are put on a
more commercial footing.
Castle Cement said yesterday that it was switching 210,000 tonnes of cement
a year from rail to road. Mr Jonathan Dale, director of logistics, blamed
BR's Trainload Freight for raising prices to uneconomic levels when the
recession was bringing road transport costs down.
'To make our rail operations viable we would need a cut of 75 per cent in
the freight rates on offer - that's the sort of gap that has opened up,' he
said.
Blue Circle said it was moving 275,000 tonnes of cement a year to road
because of BR's rising prices. A further 210,000 tonnes a year was
transferring to road because of changing distribution patterns, and the
company was reviewing its other railfreight flows.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturing company, said
it was also reviewing its options.
The Freight Transport Association said BR was losing freight to the roads
because it was raising prices to cut losses in the run-up to privatisation,
and that had left its freight charges uncompetitive. The transport
department said there was no connection with privatisation. Some of BR's
freight operations had been losing money for some time and it was a
commercial decision by BR to tackle them. BR could not be contacted because
part of its telecommunications network had broken down.

restricted briefs.
None of the bodies has agreed on the final content of their reports. That
covering nurses and midwives, which was asked whether there should be a flat
rate or differentials within the 1.5 per cent pay limit, is still
considering whether it should look at recruitment and retention.

AN INDICATION that demand in the economy may be expanding has come with the
latest figures for the volume of banknotes in circulation, released
yesterday by the Bank of England.
They indicate that M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which is a
good guide to overall demand, has risen this month by about 3 per cent
compared with November last year. If confirmed when the Bank issues official
M0 figures on December 18, that would be the biggest year-on-year rise for
M0 in any month this year.

to a slow recovery starting in the spring of next year. Growth for the year
as a whole will average only 0.7 per cent.
Output will accelerate to an average annual growth rate of 2.3 per cent in
1994 thanks to an improvement in UK competitiveness and a recovery in world
markets, but this will not be strong enough to dent the rise in
unemployment. The CBI forecasts that unemployment will rise to 3.1m by the
end of next year.
Inflation will gradually pick up, but with the recovery still modest, the
underlying rate will remain within the chancellor's target of 1 per cent to
4 per cent by the end of 1994. House prices will stabilise over the next two
years.
The November monthly trends survey, which questioned 1,421 companies shortly
before the Autumn Statement earlier this month, shows that total order books
improved slightly this month compared with October. But only 8 per cent of
companies considered their books to be above normal against 58 per cent
which said they were below normal.
The outlook for exports was not encouraging. In spite of the recent
devaluation of sterling, making UK goods cheaper, export orders deteriorated
this month. Half the companies surveyed described export order books as
below normal against only 11 per cent that said they were above normal. That
was the worst result, apart from January's, since 1983.
The CBI says it is too early for the devaluation to have had its full impact
on exports, and says the drop in orders also reflects weaker European
economies.
The CBI has made only small changes to its forecasts for the economy since
August, even though monetary policy has eased considerably since then as a
result of the UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.
The CBI says the stimulating impact of recent base-rate cuts has been offset
by weaker-than-expected domestic demand. That leaves the forecasts broadly
unchanged.
The organisation expects base rates to drop to 6 per cent early next year,
and to remain at that level until the second half of 1994.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Housebuilders optimistic on sales recovery
</HEADLINE>

HOUSEBUILDERS are more optimistic about prospects for a recovery in housing
sales next year, the House Builders Federation said yesterday.
It reported that 43 per cent of builders questioned just before the Autumn
Statement expected to sell more homes next year. A further 27 per cent
expected sales to remain steady.
Interest rates have fallen further since the survey, making house prices the
cheapest they have been in real terms for more than a decade, the federation
said.
Some builders expect prices to continue to drift downwards for a while even
when sales start to pick up. That is because of the backlog of properties to
be sold and concern about the economy.
The federation believes, however, that its survey indicates that the market
now may be near the bottom. 'The main pointer to recovery is that, in almost
every region of the country, housing is more affordable than at any time in
the last decade,' it said.
A two-income household in south-east England with an 80 per cent mortgage
and a likely interest rate of 8.5 per cent by next year could expect to pay
only 19 per cent of their total post-tax income in repayments, the
federation said. That compared with 57 per cent in 1989 and 23 per cent 10
years ago.
A similar couple in Wales, on the same basis, could expect to spend just 14
per cent of their combined post-tax income on repayments by early next year
compared with 35 per cent in 1990 and 15 per cent in 1983.
The federation's Housing Market Report also shows that court orders for
house repossessions were 29 per cent lower in the third quarter of this year
than in the corresponding period last year.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Union chief to quit early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LESLIE CHRISTIE, the 53-year-old general secretary of the National Union
of Civil and Public Servants, is to stand down six years early, his union
said yesterday.
Mr Christie would have faced re-election within the next 18 months, and most
Civil Service union officials believe he would have been successful. He took
over as leader of the 100,000-strong NUCPS when the Society of Civil and
Public Servants, the mainly lower-management grade Civil Service union which
he led, merged in 1987 with the smaller Civil Service Union.
The pressures on Mr Christie have been intense in recent months. The union
faces radical changes in the Civil Service including devolved pay bargaining
and contracting-out.
It is also having to restructure itself to accommodate the Civil Service
reforms at a time when it is making large losses. In the year to December
1991 it recorded a deficit of more than Pounds 500,000 on income of Pounds
10.8m and this year is expected to be worse.
Mr Christie was not available for comment.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Eastern Electricity opposes coal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN Electricity has come out against suggestions made this week by other
regional electricity companies that liberalisation of the industry should be
postponed to allow coal purchases to be increased.
The Ipswich-based company's stance is the first opposition to emerge from
the industry to a plan many are backing as a relatively easy way of keeping
10 to 15 British Coal pits open.
In its submission to the Department of Trade and Industry's energy review,
Eastern has joined other regional companies in calling for increased
competition for the two generators.
However Dr James Smith, Eastern chairman, said yesterday that his company
could not support calls for the government to delay the planned reduction of
the so-called franchise market through which regional companies have a
monopoly to provide electricity to all but the largest customers in their
own areas.
The government intends to phase out the franchise market in stages from 1994
so that by 1998 even households could choose from which regional company to
buy their supplies. This week regional companies including Southern told MPs
that delaying these plans would enable them to buy more electricity
generated from coal on long-term contracts because they would be more
certain of the size of their markets.
Dr Smith said yesterday that it was illogical for regional companies to
argue for more competition to be introduced for generators but not for
themselves. He said that 'providing the price was right' more coal could be
used for electricity generation than has been tentatively agreed between
British Coal and the generators.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Birt admits BBC's share of funding will fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC has reconciled itself to attracting a third of the radio and
television audience and winning about a third of broadcasting funding as
commercial broadcasting expands, Mr John Birt, who will become
director-general next month, said yesterday.
Launching the BBC's vision of its future, Mr Birt denied he was planning an
orderly retreat for the corporation.
It was simply a realistic assessment of what was likely to happen, and there
was no point trying 'Canute-like' to hold back the tide of competition or
plunging downmarket in pursuit of ratings.
'The average British household will still watch or listen to BBC services
for something like 24 hours a week,' Mr Birt said. The BBC at present has
between 42 per cent and 45 per cent of audiences.
'The BBC in the late 90s will continue to be a significant and positive
force in everyday life in Britain,' he said.
Flanked by Sir Michael Checkland, the departing director-general, and Mr
Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, Mr Birt yesterday outlined the BBC's
view of its future.
The document argues that a single integrated corporation should survive and
provide all its present services, funded almost entirely by a universal
licence fee.
The main changes will be in the type of programme offered, the efficiency
with which they are made and the corporation's accountability to the
audience in everything it does.
Because all households pay the licence fee the BBC will continue to serve
all groups and work in all programme areas. But increasingly it will seek to
complement commercially funded broadcasting by providing services which will
be put under pressure or not provided elsewhere in a more competitive
broadcast market.
The BBC, Mr Birt said, would stick to its traditional task of providing a
rich mix of programmes which entertain, educate and inform, but 'in ways
which press forward; which break new ground; which pioneer; which innovate
and challenge the audience; which are marked by intelligence, invention and
wit; which strive for quality and excellence'.
The BBC would move away from making or transmitting programmes of the kind
provided abundantly elsewhere or making programmes which are derivative or
imitative.
Mr Birt said that 'significant sums' would be released for programmes from
the review of overheads and the initiative giving BBC producers the right to
buy services in the outside market.
In future the BBC will set itself four roles to complement the commercial
sector:
Providing comprehensive and impartial news and information across a range of
broadcasting outlets, with serious information programmes staying in
prime-time slots.
Supporting and stimulating the development and expression of British culture
and entertainment.
Guaranteeing the provision of programming and services that create
opportunities for education.
Stimulating the communication of cultures and ideas between Britain and
abroad.
BBC1 will be the main national network television channel delivering
programmes to a wide audience, while BBC2 should be more innovative,
addressing different audience groups.
Radio 1 and Radio 2 would survive, but the BBC would develop 'distinctive
and innovative services', he said.
There is a commitment to the BBC orchestras but there will be discussion of
'ways in which they can play a full part in the national pattern of
orchestral funding and provision'.
The BBC also plans to be more accountable to its audience both with the
value for money that it provides and on dealing with complaints.
A well-defined framework of objectives and performance indicators will be
created, against which management will be held accountable. It will involve
much more detailed research on who is watching what and how appreciative the
audiences are.
A further document is expected soon setting out a more clear division of
responsibilities between the BBC governors and the board of management.
Mr Birt promised that the future BBC would be a 'lean, efficient,
enterprising, unbureaucratic BBC,' dedicated to quality and focused firmly
on programme creativity and innovation.
With the publication of the document - the product of more than 15 internal
committees - the debate on the renewal of the BBC's royal charter which runs
out at the end of 1996 is officially under way.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Judges seek curb on search orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURT ORDERS which direct defendants to allow plaintiffs to enter their
premises to search and seize documents and other evidence, known as Anton
Piller orders, should be placed on a statutory footing, a committee of
senior judges said yesterday.
The committee, set up by the Judges' Council to look at how the orders
operate, recommends they should still be available provided there are proper
safeguards.
The committee was set up following widespread concern that the procedure was
being abused. Anton Piller orders, first granted in 1974 but named after the
1976 case of Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Process, have acquired a body
of case law defining how and when they should be granted.
The judges say that at their best they protect plaintiffs' rights and so
promote the interests of justice. At their worst they can be oppressive and
prejudicial to defendants, whose businesses may be blighted and whose
privacy may be invaded without notice.
The complexity of obtaining the orders has also made them expensive for
plaintiffs. The judges are keen that any safeguards for defendants built
into the legislation should not make them more costly.
The committee, chaired by Lord Justice Staughton, recommends a number of
practical safeguards for defendants. These cover the making of an
application for an order, the execution of it, and the 'return date' on
which defendants can challenge the order in court.

FT  27 NOV 92 / European court to rule on dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Court of Justice is to rule on whether an employer is guilty of
sex discrimination if he dismisses a worker who becomes pregnant shortly
after being engaged to cover for a colleague taking maternity leave.
The Law Lords decided to adjourn their final judgment on an appeal by Mrs
Carole Nardin until after the European court has considered the case.
Mrs Nardin of West Drayton, London, was engaged by EMO Air Cargo (UK) as an
import operations clerk in June 1987. She was told the job was available
because another clerk, Mrs Valerie Stewart, would be leaving to have a baby.
Two weeks into a six-month training period Mrs Nardin suspected she was
pregnant. The company's managing director said he had no alternative but to
dismiss her.
Having lost her industrial tribunal case Mrs Nardin unsuccessfully appealed
to the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal before taking the
case to the House of Lords.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Tighter rules on assets promised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standard Board's forthcoming paper on off-balance-sheet
finance will restrict the scope for assets to be removed from the balance
sheet, the FT Financial Reporting Conference was told yesterday.
Mr Graham Stacy, senior technical partner of Price Waterhouse and an ASB
member, said its draft will allow de-recognition of an asset only when:
No significant rights to the asset are retained.
Any risk retained is immaterial in relation to the variation in benefits
likely to occur.
Mr Andrew Lennard, assistant technical director of the ASB, said the board
was considering taking a less restrictive approach to debt maturity
following the hostile reaction to its treatment in the discussion document
on capital instruments.
He said it was likely to permit short-term debt to be reported as long-term
where the same lender is firmly committed to provide further finance on the
same terms.
Mr Allan Cook, the ASB technical director, said the board was conducting
tests with about a dozen large companies to determine the continuing value
of goodwill - the difference between the net assets and the purchase price
of an acquisition.
That will help the ASB determine how to treat goodwill in its future
proposals on accounting for business combinations.
Mr John Shaw, a member of the Financial Reporting Council and chairman of
the conference, said the ASB had identified a tension in enlisting support
for greater disclosure and transparency in accounts from City analysts.
He said this was because they in part made their livelihood from translating
complex financial information.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: The Royal income and perks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL INCOME AND PERKS
Income from property: Income from the 36,500 acres of the Duchy of Lancaster
was pounds 3.1m last year. This is used to fund the privy purse, which pays
minor royals and staff pensions. The Sandringham estate provides about
pounds 600,000 pf private income. The Queen also derives some income,
possibly around pounds 1m, from her stud farm and winnings of her horses.
Investments: Estimates of the value of the Queen's investment portfolio,
managed by stockbrokers Rowe and Pitman, vary from under pounds 50m to
almost pounds 600m. This is based on a portfolio said to be worth about
pounds 30m in 1971. The higher estimates assume dividends have all been
reinvested, which is unlikely. Income from the portfolio is estimated at
pounds 1m to pounds 42m.
Perks: The royal yacht, Britannia, costs the Ministry of Defence about
pounds 9.5m a year. Government departments spent about pounds 2.5m on the
royal train last year, pounds 21.8m on palaces and residences, and pounds
6.9m on the Queen's Flight. Other perks of the job include additional travel
costs, around 400 out of more than 1,000 personal staff and security cover.
PAYMENT FOR ROYAL DUTIES
Civil list: The Queen is the biggest recipient of funds from the civil list,
receiving pounds 7.9m this year, due to rise to pounds 10.4m by the end of
the century. Next comes the Queen Mother, with pounds 640,000, and Prince
Philip with pounds 360,000. They are the three who will continue to be paid
by the state under the new arrangements. Other current recipients are the
Duke of York, whose allowance was pounds 250,000, in addition to his naval
salary, which is fully taxable. Prince Edward got about pounds 100,000, the
Princess Royal pounds 230,000, Princess Margaret pounds 220,000 and Princess
Alice pounds 90,000.
The last five royals will continue to be included in the civil list, but the
Queen will reiburse the Treasury the full value of their allowances. A total
of around pounds 5.1m will be repaid from income from the Duchy of
Lancaster.
Royal cut back: The Queen, Prince Philip and the the Queen Mother will
continue to receive money from the tax payer. The rest of the Royal Family
will be paid for by the Queen.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Audit confounded by ritual secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, PHILIP COGGAN and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN'S personal fortune and the income that will be subject to tax are
impossible to estimate accurately because so much secrecy has traditionally
surrounded her accounts. This is unlikely to change even when she starts
paying tax.
Her personal fortune could be as little as Pounds 50m or as much as Pounds
6.5bn, according to estimates published in unofficial surveys.
The huge disparity is caused by the lack of information and by whether the
value of palaces and paintings, technically owned by the monarch, are
included.
The Queen has three primary strands of income:
Income from her personal wealth, which reliable sources say could be around
Pounds 50m. It is already clear that this will be liable to income tax at up
to 40 per cent, and capital gains tax.
The civil list settlement presented to parliament in 1990 which ensures an
income of Pounds 79m between 1990 and 2000, rising by 7.5 per cent a year to
take care of inflation. The Queen's share of the civil list payments is
about Pounds 7.9m. This is not taxed at present, and will not be under the
new regime, as it is regarded as money to cover the Queen's function as head
of state.
The most complex area of the privy purse which includes a mix of public and
private functions, and part of which will probably be taxed. The dividing
lines are still to be devised by the Queen's advisers and the Inland
Revenue.
The proposed changes will also mean that the only members of the royal
family funded directly by the taxpayer will be the Queen, the Duke of
Edinburgh and the Queen Mother. Others will still receive money from the
civil list because they perform public duties, but much more money will be
repaid by the Queen in future.
It is estimated that the Queen at present reimburses the Exchequer by about
Pounds 650,000 a year for minor members of the royal family, and this will
rise by a further Pounds 800,000. This money comes from income and rents
from the Duchy of Lancaster estates owned by the Queen.
The new arrangements, which should be completed in the new year ready to be
introduced at the start of the next tax year in April, follow growing unease
that the monarch pays no personal taxes.
Increasing public clamour over the royal family's financial arrangements has
come to a head following a succession of royal scandals and the disclosure
this week that the taxpayer is to foot the bill for the fire damage at
Windsor Castle, which could reach Pounds 60m.
The pivotal question now will be how much the public will be allowed to know
about the Queen's private income from her shares and property.
She would presumably be entitled, like any individual, to a personal
allowance of Pounds 3,445. After that, the first Pounds 2,000 of her income
would be taxed at 20 per cent, and the next Pounds 21,700 at 25 per cent.
Everything else would be taxable at the top rate of 40 per cent.
Dividend payments are normally taxed (at basic rate) at source and the Queen
has presumably been reclaiming the tax credit to date. It accordingly would
be quite easy to collect the tax on her investment income once her immunity
ended.
Although some estimates have put the Queen's private wealth at as much as
Pounds 6.5bn, Philip Hall in his book Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the
Monarchy estimates a more conservative figure for investments of Pounds
341m, and annual income of Pounds 18.4m. On that basis, her tax bill would
be just under Pounds 7.35m a year.
Then there is the Queen's rental income from her estates. She would be
allowed to offset costs against this income but according to Richard Law of
accountants Ernst &amp; Young, these costs might be small since the Queen would
not have borrowing costs on the properties.
But there is a further issue. An ordinary employee would face a tax
liability on those perks provided to the Queen, such as rent-free
accommodation and a company car. Presumably the Queen will still be exempt
from tax on these.
Capital gains tax is payable, at the individual's highest tax rate, on
realised gains of over Pounds 5,800 in the current tax year. Investors are
allowed compensation for the effects of inflation on asset prices since
1982.
Should the Queen dispose of any of her art collection, that would also
attract CGT. A CGT liability can be triggered by other events, such as
destruction, which might lead to a tax problem if the Windsor fire were to
recur.
Inheritance tax is payable at a rate of 40 per cent on estates worth more
than Pounds 150,000. There are many vehicles for getting round the tax,
however, such as the use of trusts.
Palace officials have previously justified the fact that the Queen has paid
no taxes on the grounds of tradition. According to Buckingham Palace, 'taxes
are levied in the Queen's name and therefore it would not be appropriate for
the Queen to pay taxes.'
The palace also argues that any cost-to-taxpayer assessment had to include
the benefits brought by tourism and the 'prestige, access and reputation'
that the UK had acquired internationally thanks partly to the presence of
the royal family.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Confusion reigns over status of royal
assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST complex area for negotiation between palace authorities and the
Inland Revenue will be over what the Queen owns as a private person and what
she owns as sovereign and head of state, Richard Evans writes.
Any properties or assets owned personally could be subject either to capital
gains tax when sold or to inheritance tax on death.
Some assets - like the royal yacht Britannia - are owned and paid for by the
government, others are owned by the sovereign and must be passed on by law
to her heirs.
Nearly all the official royal residences are owned by the sovereign and are
passed on to successors. It is assumed that these assets cannot be subject
to inheritance taxes.
Two residences, Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk, are owned
personally by the sovereign and could technically be sold. They were among
the many complications at the time of the abdication of Edward VIII and had
to be purchased by his successor, George VI.
The assumption is that special arrangements will be made to ensure that they
would pass to her heirs rather than be subject to inheritance tax.
Virtually all of the Queen's extensive art collection has been amassed over
many generations and from gifts. It technically belongs to her, but
according to Buckingham Palace 'it is not regarded as being disposable'. The
same is true of the crown jewels.
A small number of pictures and pieces of jewellery have been purchased
privately by the Queen and these are likely to be included in her personal
estate and be subject to taxes.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons to debate Maastricht next
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday honoured its pledge to resume work on legislation
to enact the Maastricht treaty before the Edinburgh summit on December 11
and 12 by declaring that the committee stage will begin next week with two
days of debate.
But even before the official announcement, Lady Thatcher issued a fresh
rallying call to Euro-sceptics in a speech she gave in Germany on Wednesday.
The text was released in Westminster yesterday.
Addressing an audience of bankers and politicians in Frankfurt, the former
prime minister paid compliments to the monetary rigour of the Bundesbank
while also praising the UK government for adopting an independent economic
policy after the sterling devaluation of September 16.
She also backed German opposition to any dilution of the D-Mark in a unified
European currency, described economic and monetary union as a federalist
project and warned: 'Scepticism is on the increase.'
In the Commons yesterday, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, gave notice
that the government would press on with debate on the floor of the Commons
next week in a process that ministers acknowledge could continue at least
until the end of May next year.
He assured one pro-treaty MP that plenty of time would be given to the bill
to ensure the adequate debate of amendments.
The limited two-day start to the ratification process, with no further dates
yet set, underlines the government's determination to play the process
low-key and long.
Further discussion of the bill may not begin until the House of Commons
returns from its Christmas recess in mid-January.
In Whitehall, meanwhile, attention is now firmly fixed to the run-up to the
EC summit in Edinburgh and preparation of the fine detail of the gathering's
heavy agenda.
Ministers have made clear that the British presidency hopes to use the
meeting to reach broad conclusions to key questions such as the treaty
addenda for Denmark.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to get free vote on Sunday bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEE PROTECTION emerged as a potential flashpoint last night as the
government unveiled its plans for a bill to implement the reform of Sunday
trading in England and Wales.
Confirming that MPs would be offered a free vote on the core issue of
whether restrictions to Sunday trading should apply, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, pledged that the envisaged bill would contain government clauses
to protect 'existing' shopworkers from being compelled to work on a Sunday.
But he skated around Labour demands that protection should additionally be
given to future employees who objected to Sunday working. His 'instinct'
would be not to aim at a set of regulations applicable solely to those
employed in shops, he said.
It later emerged that the government was not ruling out seeking to whip its
employee protection provisions through the Commons.
MPs are to be offered a choice between a set of options for Sunday shopping
ranging from full-scale deregulation to a tightening of existing laws.
Full deregulation - the choice favoured by Mr Clarke - would be on the
present Scottish model, while the most restrictive option would be along the
lines advocated by the Keep Sunday Special campaign.
A third option, proposed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, is included.
This would allow small shops to open on Sundays essentially without
restrictions, while permitting larger outlets to open for up to six hours.
It is uncertain whether the bill will come before the Commons in the present
parliamentary session.
The drafting of legislation must await a decision by the European Court on
whether the present law was overridden by the free-trade articles of the
Treaty of Rome. Mr Clarke said yesterday that this ruling was now unlikely
to be available before January.
The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since
1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated
by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986.
For Labour, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, welcomed the proposals
if they were handled in a 'sensible' manner and said the challenge was to
present 'a lasting reform' which ended 'the present de-regulation through
anarchy'.
The 'nub' of the issue was whether all employees - present and future -
would be subject to the voluntary principle and entitled to premium payments
for Sunday working.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: School fees ruling raises wider
issues - Robert Rice and Andrew Jack on how Hansard was cited to clarify
legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER many years of dispute, lawyers and accountants were yesterday
digesting the impact of the Law Lords' decision in the Pepper vs Hart case.
At issue was whether schoolmasters were permitted to pay fees at marginal
cost for their children attending the school at which they taught, without
them being taxed as a benefit. Had they lost, thousands of employees could
have faced changes in benefits provided by their employers.
By ruling in their favour, the Law Lords have raised far wider
constitutional questions over the extent to which ministerial statements in
Hansard - the official report of parliamentary debates - can be used to help
clarify the intention of a piece of legislation.
The Law Lords said it was common ground that concessionary fees more than
covered the additional cost to the school of educating the taxpayers'
children and that the childrens' education at reduced fees was a taxable
benefit under the 1976 Finance Act.
The crucial question was how much should be treated as an emolument - the
cash equivalent of the benefit. The taxpayers argued that the only expense
incurred by the school 'in or in connection with' the education of their
children was the additional or marginal cost to the school.
The Revenue argued that the expense incurred in or in connection with the
provision of education for children of the taxpayers was the same as the
expense for all other pupils. Therefore the expense of educating any one
child was a proportionate part of the cost of running the whole school.
The Law Lords said the cost to the employer of providing an 'in-house
benefit' for the employee (in this case concessionary education) depended on
whether the courts could look behind the language of the statute to reports
of parliamentary proceedings in order to determine the true legislative
intention of parliament.
The taxpayers would win if the courts were allowed to refer to parliamentary
material as an aid to statutory interpretation, as was clear from a reading
of Hansard covering parliamentary debates on the 1976 act and from
statements made by the financial secretary at the time.
But if the courts were not entitled to refer to parliamentary material, a
literal interpretation of the 1976 act meant the Revenue's argument would
succeed.
Under present law there is a general rule (the exclusionary rule) dating
back to 1769 that references to parliamentary material as an aid to
statutory construction are not allowed.
Although the courts' attitude to this rule had varied, they had made
reference to reports which lead to legislation. But until 1989 there was no
modern case in which a court had looked at parliamentary debates as an aid
to construction.
In 1989 the House of Lords made big inroads by looking at a minister's
parliamentary words to help them decide a statutory regulation's meaning.
Mr Anthony Lester, QC for the teachers, argued that where the words of a
statute were ambiguous or obscure or were capable of giving rise to an
absurd conclusion it should be legitimate to look at the parliamentary
history to identify the intention of parliament. But he said the exclusion
rule should not be relaxed entirely. The attorney-general argued that the
rule had a sound constitutional and practical basis and should not be
relaxed. The use of Hansard would constitute a 'questioning' of the freedom
of speech or debate as it would involve an investigation of what a minister
meant by the words he used, and would inhibit him in what he said by
attaching legislative effect to his words.
The Law Lords disagreed. The only real objection to a relaxation of the rule
was that legal advisers would waste hours at the expense of litigants
researching parliamentary intent. This would raise the cost of litigation.
But Lord Browne-Wilkinson said it was easy to overestimate the cost of
research. Hansard would show whether the minister said anything significant,
making further research pointless.
The Law Lords therefore said the rule should be relaxed to allow reference
to parliamentary material where:
Legislation was ambiguous, obscure or led to an absurdity.
The material relied or consisted of one or more statements of a minister or
other promoter of a bill.
The statements relied on were clear.
Looking behind the language of the 1976 act it was clear the teachers must
win the appeal.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Queen could face king-sized life
insurance policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF the Queen does agree to pay inheritance tax, her advisers Peat Marwick
could be faced with a lot of work. The planning could involve writing the
biggest life insurance policy in history.
No definitive figure has been reached on her wealth, but if her investments,
art and jewellery collections and her private homes are included, it could
be as much as Pounds 6.5bn. Since inheritance tax is 40 per cent on estates
of more than Pounds 150,000, that could leave her facing a bill for around
Pounds 2.5bn.
The good news is that clever tax planning could reduce that bill to
virtually zero. The first thing the Queen must do is write a will, since
elaborate tax planning is impossible without one.
The next step is to get the Treasury to give National Heritage exemption to
all the art, jewellery and stately homes. According to Mr David Rothenberg,
senior tax partner at accountants Blick Rothenberg, this would mean that
portion of the Queen's wealth could pass to her heirs tax-free.
A second bonus for the Queen is that, in the last Budget, agricultural land
 -a significant element of her wealth - was granted 100 per cent relief from
inheritance tax - with some exemptions.
The biggest remaining element of the Queen's wealth is her investment
portfolio. Here, Mr Rothenberg says she could follow a more elaborate
strategy.
First, she could sell all her shares and buy them back immediately - known
as bed-and-breakfasting - before she becomes eligible for capital-gains tax.
This would establish a new, high base level for any future capital-gains tax
liabilities.
Then she could give away the investments to her relatives. These gifts would
be subject to capital-gains tax, but only on any gains made after the
bed-and-breakfast process.
Provided the Queen then lives for seven years, these gifts would be free
from inheritance tax. To cover that period, however, the Queen could then
take out a massive life insurance policy, says Mr Rothenberg. This would be
written in trust for her heirs, and thus the proceeds of the policy would
not themselves be subject to inheritance tax.
If the Queen dies within the seven-year period, the proceeds of the policy
could be used to meet the inheritance-tax liability.
The Queen has other opportunities to save tax. Money left to a spouse is
tax-free, although this would only postpone the problem until Prince
Philip's death.
A more populist solution would be giving the money away. Gifts of up to
Pounds 3,000 each year can be made to a particular person, and be exempt
from inheritance tax.
On top of this, small gifts of up to Pounds 250 can be made to any number of
individuals without incurring tax. On death, gifts to charities, political
parties and some other non-profitmaking organisations are exempt.
So this Christmas, never mind the begging letters to Santa Claus, send them
to Buckingham Palace.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major gives cool response to
France's threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, made a cool response in the Commons
yesterday to France's threats to veto the draft farm deal reached by the
European Community and the US, Ivor Owen writes.
He predicted a change in the French attitude when account had been taken of
the benefits to be derived outside the agriculture sector from the
completion of the current round of negotiations on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva.
Mr Major said he was sure that an examination of every aspect of the Gatt
deal would lead to a realisation that 'liberalisation of trade, services and
manufactures is a very valuable prize for the French economy as well as for
the economies of every other industrial nation in the world'.
The prime minister emphasised that with a trade war averted and a single
market of 340m people on their doorstep, British businesses had better
opportunities than they had known for some time.
They had the benefit of low inflation, the lowest interest rates in the EC
and an extremely competitive exchange rate.
Anxiety about France's attitude was expressed by Mr Gary Waller (C Keighley)
who warned that if the Gatt liberalisation were to be jeopardised it would
be against the interests of Britain and all the other members of the EC, as
well being against the interests of international trade generally.
He called on all the EC states to agree the Gatt deal with 'one voice'.
Mr Major described the the farm deal agreed with the the US as being good
for the entire EC and for the entire world trading community.
It was desirable that it should be agreed by all member states as speedily
as possible.
The prime minister underlined the success of the UK in attracting inward
investment and assured MPs: 'I intend to keep it that way'.
He identified low inflation, low taxation and the absence of any involvement
in the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty as key factors.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to get free vote on Sunday
trading law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEE PROTECTION emerged as a potential flashpoint last night as the
government unveiled its plans for a bill to implement the reform of Sunday
trading in England and Wales.
Confirming that MPs would be offered a free vote on the core issue of
whether restrictions to Sunday trading should apply, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, pledged that the envisaged bill would contain government clauses
to protect 'existing' shopworkers from being compelled to work on a Sunday.
But he skated around Labour demands that protection should additionally be
given to future employees who objected to Sunday working. His 'instinct'
would be not to aim at a set of regulations applicable solely to those
employed in shops, he said.
It later emerged that the government was not ruling out seeking to whip its
employee protection provisions through the Commons.
As outlined by Mr Peter Lloyd, home office minister, at last month's Tory
party conference, MPs are to be offered a choice between a set of options
for Sunday shopping ranging from full scale deregulation to a tightening of
existing laws.
Full deregulation - the choice favoured by Mr Clarke himself - would be on
the present Scottish model, while the most restrictive option would be along
the lines advocated by the Keep Sunday Special campaign.
A third option, proposed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, is included.
This would allow small shops to open on Sundays essentially without
restrictions, while permitting larger outlets to open for up to six hours.
It remains uncertain whether the bill will come before the Commons in the
present parliamentary session. The drafting of legislation must await a
decision by the European Court on whether the present law was overridden by
the free-trade articles of the Treaty of Rome. Mr Clarke said yesterday that
this ruling was now unlikely to be available before January.
The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since
1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated
by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986.
For Labour, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, welcomed the proposals if
handled in a 'sensible' manner and said the challenge was to present 'a
lasting reform' which ended 'the present deregulation through anarchy'.
The 'nub' of the issue was whether all employees - present and future -
would be subject to the voluntary principle and entitled to premium payments
for Sunday working.
'There are many inside and outside this House who believe that people should
have greater freedom to shop on a Sunday provided that 'open on a Sunday'
for us does not mean 'exploited on a Sunday' for those who will work in the
shops that serve us,' he said.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Aids, 'killer of the fittest', debilitates developing world
/ Review of a survey of the disease's economic impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST OVER a decade after the world learned of an epidemic that echoes the
Black Death of the Middle Ages, reliable statistics remain hard to obtain
and evidence is sometimes anecdotal, but the consequences are becoming
starker.
Aids (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the fatal condition that results
from long-term infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), currently
kills 100,000 people a year worldwide. But worst-hit are vulnerable
economies of developing countries in general, and Africa in particular.
In Uganda, the condition is inflicting a terrible toll on the country's
railway corporation. Ten per cent of its employees may have died of Aids;
labour turnover is 15 per cent a year.
In Zambia, the country's copper mines, responsible for 75 per cent of the
country's export earnings, are vulnerable: 'The danger is that skilled
workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements
can be trained,' warns one expert.
'The result will not be a sudden collapse in mine output. Rather, there will
be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents and
delays, and output will suffer.'
From South Africa comes other ominous news. Life insurance companies paid
Pounds 855,000 in Aids-related claims between 1985 and 1988. In 1989 alone,
payments were Pounds 700,000.
In Zimbabwe, claims in group life schemes of one insurance company doubled
between 1986 and 1990, and the amount paid out multiplied 25-fold. And in
Malawi a leading insurance company pulled out of the market when the
government banned Aids test on applicants seeking cover.
These examples come from an extensive survey of the possible impact of the
disease on development by the Panos Institute, the independent London-based
research body*.
Although the study takes a global view, some of the most frightening
statistics come from Africa.
The World Health Organisation, drawing on a World Bank model, says that life
expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa could fall to 47 years by the end of the
century, compared to 62 without the HIV/Aids factor. Unicef predicts that
the under-five mortality rate in central and east Africa is likely to rise
to between 159 and 189 per 1,000 live births, instead of dropping to 132.
But Africa bears a double affliction - it has nearly half the world's
HIV/Aids victims but the continent's economic crisis has left it almost
bereft of the resources required to meet the challenge.
In 1990, says the Panos report, the global cost of Aids treatment was
estimated at between Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and Dollars 3.5bn - no
more than 2 per cent of which was spent in sub-Saharan Africa.
It is estimated that up to 12m adults are infected with HIV - one in 250 of
the world's adult population. Over 80 per cent of cases in the developing
world, and most of those infected, are between 14 and 44. By the end of the
century the death toll is expected to be at least 400,000 a year. And by
then at least 40m people, perhaps 100m, are expected to have been infected
by HIV.
The world faces other killers, some of which are readily preventable or
curable. Malaria claims 1m lives a year; tuberculosis 3m, diarrhoeal disease
4m. But most of these deaths are among the vulnerable - the very young or
the aged: the former are unproductive, and the latter have ceased
production.
Aids, however, threatens the development prospects of whole nations, the
report points out, by primarily attacking men and women aged between 20 and
45, 'the backbone of the labour force'. Because HIV hits active young adults
hardest, it could be described as 'the killer of the fittest'.
As the epidemic advances, warns the report, to be published on Monday, the
eve of World Aids Day, existing skills shortages will be exacerbated and new
ones will be created. Productivity will be threatened: 'As the young
sexually active members of the labour force (20-40) become infected, fewer
will survive to form the older segment (40-60) which has accumulated
skills.'
The higher the income, the greater the opportunity for sexual activity. Thus
a 1988 study in Zaire found that HIV infection rates in better educated and
higher paid male workers was 5 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in the
lower-graded categories. Further evidence comes from Zambia, where one
sample revealed 8 per cent infection among urban adults with fewer than five
years of schooling, rising to 33 per cent of those with 14 years or more.
The picture is incomplete, the report acknowledges. Chapters on the
implications for labour rely heavily on information from central and east
Africa. Nevertheless, the impact of Aids may be as severe in other
developing regions.
'Cash crop production may decline . . . labour costs rise as shortages
develop, and employers may face spiralling medical costs,' warns Mr Jon
Tinker, president of the institute, in his foreword to the 170-page study.
No cure or vaccine is in sight, most experts agree. Part of the anti-Aids
strategy, says Panos, should involve more money for prevention. It cites one
calculation that suggests that Dollars 100m spent in anti-HIV/Aids
activities in Thailand in 1991-92 could stop 3.5m people being infected and
save Dollars 5.1bn in potential losses: 'Spending Dollars 1 now to save
Dollars 51 later does sound like quite a good investment,' says Mr Tinker.
But even if infection were to cease overnight, the challenges posed are
enormous, warns Panos. The lengthy incubation period means that . . . the
number of Aids cases would continue to grow over the next decade at an
average of 10 per cent a year, a total of 40m by end of century - almost 90
per cent of them in the developing world.
This means that planners must prepare to adapt, says Panos. In the
agricultural sector it may mean less labour-intensive crops. The schooling
systems must accommodate the special needs of a forecast 10m orphans;
economic policies must take into account the changing age profile of the
labour force.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk yesterday spelt out his government's
timetable for a transition to multi-racial democracy, saying he expected
all-race elections to take place by April 1994, with an interim government
of national unity in place by the end of that year.
However, he issued a veiled threat that, if this timetable could not be
achieved through multi-party negotiation, 'other ways will have to be found
to bring about a government of national unity'.
The African National Congress, the biggest opposition party, said 17 months
was too long to wait for an end to white rule.
'South Africa cannot afford any delay,' an ANC statement said.
'The economy cannot sustain a further year of corruption and mismanagement,
the people will no longer tolerate lack of governance or the increasing
uncertainty that will clearly be accompanied by escalating violence, growing
unemployment and deteriorating socio-economic conditions.'
Mr de Klerk gave no details. But South Africa's constitution calls for a
general election by late 1994. He has often said he would never hold another
whites-only election, leaving him little option but to try to co-opt
moderate blacks into his cabinet if negotiation fails.
He said the timetable involved the completion by February of the current
bilateral constitutional talks with leading parties with a multi-party
negotiating forum to convene by March and agree an interim constitution by
the end of May.
Mr de Klerk added that township violence which has killed more than 7,000
blacks in less than three years had to be curbed. 'By this time next year,
if the violence has not abated, we will be faced by a totally different
situation that will make this timetable irrelevant,' he said.
Asked about control of the security forces in the lead up to elections, de
Klerk said a transitional executive council representing all parties would
ensure 'a level playing field'.

FRANCE will press the European Community to create an Ecu1bn (Pounds 800m)
fund for economic development in the Middle East to back peace negotiations
in the region, President Francois Mitterrand said in Jerusalem yesterday.
Stressing the role Paris and the Community could play in the multilateral
negotiations on regional co-operation, he said the EC should levy up to
Ecu1bn from its economic development fund for joint projects in areas such
as water, tourism, transport and trade.
It would also encourage 'useful forms of dialogue' between Arabs and Israel,
Mr Mitterrand said. 'This is an initiative which France very much wishes to
pass on to the European Council.'
The president was speaking after talks with Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister.
He and Mr Roland Dumas, his foreign minister, also met Mr Faisal Husseini,
the senior Palestinian leader in the occupied territories, and members of
the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East negotiations. He travels on to
Jordan today for talks with King Hussein.
He described Israel's approach to the peace talks, which have progressed
only slowly since they began a year ago, as 'very positive' and expressed
support for the process despite reservations about exclusion of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Rabin said he had asked France to urge
the Palestinians to shed their objections and press ahead with the
negotiations.
But both Mr Mitterrand and Mr Rabin played down suggestions that the
president was acting as an intermediary in the bilateral talks.
French and Israeli officials signed four bilateral co-operation agreements,
including an accord on joint scientific research and an outline for an
electric railway project.

A BAN excluding Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani opposition leader, from the

continuing government-opposition rift would end soon.
Ms Bhutto, who last week tried to lead a march to parliament to demand the
dismissal of the government of prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif, was yesterday
in Lahore vowing to continue her campaign to remove the administration on
allegations of corruption.
Opposition politicians will meet in Rawalpindi today to discuss strategy.
In Rawalpindi, police fired tear gas and beat back demonstrators with batons
as opposition politicians, including Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, Ms Bhutto's mother,
arrived. The campaign is the most aggressive attack on Mr Sharif's
government during its two years in office.
Concern is growing that the confrontation is causing nervousness among
investors, western diplomats say.

THE US has offered to provide up to 30,000 armed troops to deliver relief
supplies to thousands of starving people in Somalia and will use force if
necessary, AP reports from Washington.
The troops would be part of a proposed multinational force operating under
United Nations auspices that would attempt to end the disruption of food
supplies by feuding clans in the stricken African nation, officials said.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, acting secretary of state, made the offer on
Wednesday to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, in response to
his plea for more help in a so-far unsuccessful UN relief mission, they
added.
Mr Boutros Ghali did not decide immediately whether to accept the offer,
conditional on other nations also providing troops as part of the operation.
'It was a tentative discussion,' said one official, 'but there was broad
agreement in the UN Security Council that things aren't working out.'
The troops would help deliver supplies and also provide security, the
official said.

MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday listened politely
to the democracy proposals of Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, but
said only that Tokyo 'understands' the proposals and did not give a clear
signal of support.
Japanese officials said Mr Miyazawa was concerned he would anger China by
expressing support for the proposals to broaden Hong Kong's democratic base.
The US, Canadian and Australian governments have already announced that they
support the plan.
Mr Patten is in Japan until tomorrow to raise the consciousness of Japanese
politicians about the position of Hong Kong and to encourage economic links
with British colony. In spite of the indecisive response from Mr Miyazawa,
the Hong Kong governor said he was pleased with the discussion.
'I think that the Japanese government recognises that the matter of the
joint declaration (between London and Beijing on Hong Kong's status) is a
matter for Hong Kong, the UK and China,' he said.
British officials said Mr Patten understands that it is not the Japanese way
to give the stamp of approval to his proposals, but he is keen to have
Japanese politicians more aware of the sometimes heated debate between China
and the Hong Kong government.
AP adds from Beijing: China yesterday criticised Mr Patten for seeking wider
support for his proposed political reforms.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Takeshita has to fight for his political life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NOBORU TAKESHITA, the former Japanese prime minister, was fighting for
his political life last night after lengthy testimony to the Japanese
parliament failed to dispel allegations that an organised crime syndicate
played a vital role in his election in 1987.
Mr Takeshita, still one of the most powerful politicians behind the scenes
in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, is likely to come under increasing
pressure from opposition parties to resign from parliament.
A series of snap opinion polls taken after the testimony showed a majority
of the public - even in his own constituency - did not believe Mr
Takeshita's account of events leading up to his election in 1987.
Mr Kansei Nakano, a leader of the minority Democratic Socialist party, said:
'Mr Takeshita must understand that he is politically finished.'
Mr Takeshita told the parliament he would not resign because it would be
seen as an admission of guilt.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, led half-hearted efforts by the LDP
leadership to support Mr Takeshita and end the scandal that has recently
destabilised the party leadership.
Mr Takeshita is still the titular leader of the LDP's largest faction, which
is almost certain to split after the controversy that engulfed him.
He was impassive during most of his two-hour testimony.
The case involves whether Mr Takeshita knew that corrupt businessmen - then
bosses of Japan's largest organised crime syndicate - were enlisted as
intermediaries to quell an embarrassing right-wing street campaign against
him.
Mr Takeshita admitted he met Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of
the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company, who is on trial for breach of
trust over the company's huge losses. The company made illegal donations of
Y500m (Pounds 2.6m) to LDP politicians.
Mr Takeshita said Mr Watanabe tried to stop the right-wing campaign of his
own accord, and he became aware only in 1988 that Mr Susumu Ishii, the
organised crime boss, also intervened on his behalf.
In court testimony last month Mr Watanbe said he told Mr Takeshita the
right-wingers would cease their harassment campaign only if Mr Takeshita
made a humiliating visit to the home of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime
minister. The right-wing group wanted Mr Takeshita to apologise for deposing
Mr Tanaka from the leadership of the LDP's main faction in the mid-1980s.
Mr Takeshita visited Mr Tanaka's home the day after meeting Mr Watanabe, but
said it was a courtesy call, denying it was designed to stop the right-wing
campaign.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Mongolia aims to put economy in new hands: Stalinism has
been crushed in rush to privatise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MONGOLIA is pressing ahead with a privatisation scheme which it claims to be
the fastest in history.
The country's conversion to free market economics is being overseen by the
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. The party ran a Stalinist regime for
nearly 60 years but is now pursuing a policy of reforms including price
liberalisation and banking and private property laws - though it is also
having to re-draft previous legislation which was pushed through too fast.
Privatisation is central to its policies. Between February and October, 121
companies were floated on the Mongolian Stock Exchange, and the target is
500 by the end of the year.
All companies are being considered for privatisation except those which are
bankrupt or considered too important to the country; among the latter are
significant earners of hard currency.
The country is using a voucher scheme similar to that under way in Russia.
Each Mongolian citizen receives a free voucher worth 10,000 tugriks (Pounds
167 at the official rate), of which 7,000 tugriks can be use to subscribe to
larger privatisations and 3,000 tugriks to buy small businesses or
livestock.
Says Mr Naidansurengiin Zolzhargal, 27-year-old chairman of the stock
exchange in Ulan Bator, the capital: 'This is mass give-away privatisation
for its own sake. The goal is not raising capital, but changing the
ownership structure of the economy.'
Mr Zolzhargal, a self-assured man educated in Germany and the US, heads an
exchange with 29 stockbroking firms employing 700 traders - though as yet
there is no formal secondary market in shares.
The brokers, operating on what Mr Zolzhargal says are the only dedicated
telephone lines in the country, concentrate on channelling the new share
issues to investors through an auction system.
There is a flourishing trade in the vouchers themselves. Many Mongolians
prefer to sell their 7,000 tugrik vouchers for as little as 200 tugriks in
cash.
The gleaming white interior of the stock exchange, situated in a former
children's cinema built by Japanese prisoners of war in 1946, contrasts with
the crumbling plaster of most government buildings. The Austrian contractors
who refitted it last year for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 985,000) are awaiting
payment from a government which can barely afford such symbols.
Not all Mongolians share Mr Zolzhargal's enthusiasm. 'There simply are not
enough viable factories for everyone to buy,' says Mr Gongorjavin Boshigt, a
leading architect of the democratic movement, who has turned businessman.
He believes profitable concerns will fall into the hands of rich
individuals. He himself has taken advantage of the government's 'small'
privatisation scheme, paying 15m tugriks and 3.4m tugriks for two shops sold
at a state-run auction last year. Around 90 per cent of small shops and 60
per cent of the country's 25m head of livestock are now in private hands.
But few Mongolians are as well off as Mr Boshigt. The average urban wage is
around 4,000 tugriks a month, with the tourist exchange rate standing at 250
tugriks to the dollar.
Inflation is rampant. The price of bread, which was freed in September, rose
from 3 tugriks to 13 in one day. Inflation in 1991 was 120 per cent, and in
the first seven months of this year it averaged 14 per cent per month,
partly because of the liberalisation of prices.
Gross domestic product fell by 9.2 per cent in 1991, and a further
contraction of 5 per cent is expected this year. Exports tumbled by 22 per
cent and imports by 43 per cent in 1991; in the first seven months of 1992
exports rose by 6.6 per cent and imports fell by 15.7 per cent.
Mongolia did 97 per cent of its trade with Comecon countries before the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and lack of hard currency on both sides has
limited trade and caused severe shortages of essential goods in Mongolia.
An acute shortage of oil, formerly supplied by the Soviet Union, has pushed
the Mongolian transport system to the brink of collapse. In the first
quarter of this year, imports of petroleum virtually ceased amid confusion
in negotiations with Russia. A new agreement was struck in June and supplies
resumed.
Mongolia is dependent on foreign aid to pay for imports of food, energy and
spare parts. A meeting of donor countries and organisations in Tokyo last
May pledged Dollars 409m of assistance until the end of 1993. Japan is the
largest bilateral donor of aid to Mongolia, having granted Y3.8bn (Pounds
20m) so far this year.
'If balance of payments support was not forthcoming this would be a country
without heating and supplies, disconnected from the rest of the world,' says
Mr Johannes Swietering, resident representative of the United Nations
Development Programme in Mongolia. However, he notes an encouraging shift
from emergency aid towards project finance.
Mongolia, despite its vast size, has a population of only 2m, of whom
two-thirds still live in traditional nomadic tents, called yurts. It claims
a literacy rate of 98 per cent.
Most of its hopes for prosperity are based on unexploited natural resources.
British Petroleum and Exploration Associates International, a US company,
have carried out feasibility studies for oil development in the eastern Gobi
desert. Morrison Knudsen, a US mining concern, has signed an agreement with
the Mongolian Bureau of Mines to produce three tonnes of gold annually.
Some heights of the Mongolian economy are considered too important to
privatise. Among them is the Gobi cashmere factory, which exports 98 per
cent of its produce to 14 countries and has annual revenues of Dollars 13m.
Unlike much of Mongolian industry, the factory's machines, many of which
were donated by the Japanese government in 1977, are not brought to a halt
by shortages of energy or spare parts.
By contrast, the Mongolian felt industry, which is currently working
half-time, is slated for privatisation. The breakdown of a barter
arrangement with Poland means the factory no longer has the spare parts and
man-made fibres it needs to make felt of export quality. Its product is sold
on the domestic market as material for yurts.
According to one manager at the felt factory, 'Ordinary people are not
interested in the privatisation process. They do not have enough information
to judge which factories will make a profit.'

FT  27 NOV 92 / Japan's economy to recover in 1993 on strong spending, OECD
reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese economy will stage a steady recovery next year, fuelled by a
revival in consumer spending and strong public investment, according to the
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development's annual survey of the
Japanese economy.
The survey predicts Japanese gross domestic product will grow by only 1.8
per cent this year, rising to 2.5 per cent next year before reaching the
government's target of 3.5 per cent in 1994.
Despite mounting bad loans at Japanese banks after the collapse of the
bubble economy of the late 1980s, the report says there is no evidence
Japanese companies are suffering a severe credit crunch imposed by banks.
The trade surplus is forecast to reach Y137,000bn (Pounds 725bn) this year,
rising to Y152,000bn next year.
The current balance is likely to amount to 3.2 per cent of GDP next year.
Despite anaemic money supply growth and sharp cuts in private sector capital
investment, the OECD forecasts the Japanese economy will not suffer from a
prolonged bout of slow growth because its capital stock is still growing at
a rate likely to generate growth of about 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent a
year over the next five years.
This is likely to be 1 to 1.25 percentage points higher than the rest of the
OECD.
Japanese bank lending has contracted sharply in the last year but the OECD
says this cannot be interpreted as the start of a credit squeeze as banks
reduce lending to offset debts.
The report says that the contraction in bank lending may be offset by
increased lending from other financial institutions.
The banks might strengthen their balance sheets by issuing more long-term
debt, allowing them to expand lending.
The main impact of more restrictive bank lending and the collapse in the
Tokyo stock market has been to increase the cost of capital for Japanese
companies, despite an increase in the rate of Japanese household savings.
Japanese companies find it more expensive to raise capital than their US
competitors, reversing the trend of the late 1980s when Japanese companies
had significant cost advantages over American rivals.
The report accepts much of the Japanese Finance Ministry's argument that
there is limited room for further fiscal stimulus through tax cuts or higher
public spending, despite a large general government surplus.
The OECD says that, if the rapid ageing of the population and rise in the
cost of the pension system are taken into account, the general government
financial balance would be in unsustainable deficit.
It also warns that cuts in current spending to offset sharp decline in tax
revenues, which the government is considering for the 1993 budget, would not
be justified as the drop in tax revenues reflects strong revenue growth
during the boom from 1988 to 1990.
Japanese keiretsu, groupings of companies with cross-shareholdings -
attracting considerable criticism in the US for allegedly restricting
foreign companies' access to the Japanese market - may be efficient because
they give managers more scope for long-term planning, the report says.
It calls for a significant tightening of regulation of securities markets as
well as further liberalisation to eliminate collusive relationships between
brokers and their clients.

Mongolia's prime minister, Mr Puntsagiyn Jasray, has made a new appeal for
emergency aid, saying his country needs Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) to make it
through this winter, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator.
The money would be used to pay for imports of Russian petroleum products,
heating oil among them. Mongolia (which celebrated its national day
yesterday) imports all its fuel from Russia, but economic difficulties
associated with its transition to a market economy have wiped out hard
currency reserves.
Mr Jasray said his government would appeal for aid at an emergency meeting
to be held next Monday in Washington. Japan, the US and Germany are expected
to attend with officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. Mongolian officials say donors will not be asked for new pledges, but
for faster disbursement of aid.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Campaign for Brazil Indians hit by cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTS in public spending are threatening the survival of Brazil's indigenous
Indians, the president of the government agency for Indian rights warned
yesterday.
Mr Sidney Possuelo, president of the Funai agency, said in London that his
organisation had been paralysed by a 90 per cent funding cut, and could no
longer campaign effectively for Brazil's estimated 250,000 Indians. The cuts
put in jeopardy a programme to demarcate Indian reserves, which Funai must
legally complete by November 1993.
Mr Possuelo said the agency had received only 6 per cent of the estimated
Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) cost of the project. Only 197 reserves had been
demarcated so far. 'We will not be able to reach our targets,' he said.
Demarcation of Indian areas is necessary to prevent intrusion by wildcat
miners, who bring disease, and developers.
Funai's power to defend Indian tribes is also being threatened by a bill in
Congress backed by the powerful anti-Indian lobby of forestry and mineral
exploration companies.
The bill, if passed, would severely reduce Funai's control over demarcation.
'They are trying to devalue the presence of Indian people in their own
land,' said Mr Possuelo.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GUATEMALA'S Congress has cleared the way for the resolution of a
130-year-old territorial dispute with Britain and Belize, in which Guatemala
was claiming the former British colony with which it has a common border,
writes Canute James.
Guatemalan legislators have ratified a recent ruling by a constitutional
court supporting the decision of President Jorge Serrano to recognise
Belize's political independence and to establish diplomatic ties between the
two countries.
The decision by the Congress is likely to end the dispute, although a
referendum must be held in Belize before the treaty is ratified.
Repeated indications over the past two decades that the Guatemalan military
might invade Belize in pursuit of their territorial claim led to the
stationing of a 1,500-member British garrison in Belize.
However, the 78-24 vote by Congress is likely to anger sections of the
Guatemalan military and political right.

<TEXT>
CHILE'S best-known human rights organisation, the Catholic Church's Vicaria
de la Solidaridad, closes its doors today after dedicating 16 years to the
defence of victims of political repression.
Monsignor Sergio Valech, the Vicaria's last head, said: 'The task is not
finished. But the church believes it is now the duty of civilian society to
safeguard the basic principles of human rights that it once lost.'
While the closure of Vicaria, which won the UN peace prize in 1978, reflects
the respect for human rights in Chile today, it also underscores
difficulties in dealing with the legacy of the past. The Chilean military
enjoys effective immunity from human rights violations committed during Gen
Augusto Pinochet's rule. It has refused to disclose the fate of some 900
detainees who 'disappeared' under arrest.
The International Commission of Jurists in Geneva this week urged Chile to
prosecute military and police officials accused of torture and murder. It
criticised President Patricio Aylwin's government for abandoning the pursuit
of justice for the sake of political stability.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Go-ahead for Dollars 2.6bn Sao Paulo river clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian state of Sao Paulo has received the go-ahead to begin a
Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) clean-up of the state's Tiete River, following
agreement by the InterAmerican Development Bank to provide finance for the
project.
The board of the IADB this week approved a loan of Dollars 450m to the
state, Brazil's largest. It is the first part of a planned Dollars 1.2bn
IADB financing, which would be the largest granted by the bank.
The initial loan will finance half the Dollars 900m needed for the first
stage of the scheme, designed to resuscitate the river, which has been
devoid of aquatic life since the 1950s. The goal of the first phase is to
reduce industrial and human waste by 50 per cent by 1994.
An estimated 1,100 tonnes of waste a day are dumped into the Tiete, 800
tonnes of domestic waste and 300 tonnes of industrial effluent.
The reduction will be achieved partly through basic sanitation projects for
domestic sewage. The sewerage system will be expanded to increase coverage
of the Sao Paulo metropolitan region from the current 63 per cent to 70 per
cent. Two new treatment plants and expansion of an existing one should
increase the proportion of waste treated from 19 per cent to 45 per cent by
1995.
Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, the state governor, said in London yesterday that
five European companies had voiced interest in participating in the project,
which was open to international tender. They included Thames and North-West
Water in the UK and Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux of France.
IADB financing will also help boost pollution control agencies. Some 1,200
companies, responsible for 80 per cent of the Tiete's industrial pollution,
have been identified and companies are expected to develop individual or
joint schemes to reduce the flow of toxic waste into the waterway. About
Dollars 500m is expected to be spent on pollution control equipment.
Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) has made Dollars 250m available
for this.
The river runs through Brazil's most populous and industrialised region.
About 16m people live in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo city. The
state, with 33m inhabitants, accounts for 32 per cent of the country's gross
domestic product.
Brazilian officials compare the recovery effort to that used for the Thames
in the UK, although the Brazilian project is more ambitious. The Tiete is
1,100km long, 300km of which are severely polluted, against 338km for the
Thames.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Argentina picks its way through pension maze: A scheme to
introduce private funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY Wednesday about 500 pensioners gather outside Argentina's Congress to
protest about their pitiful benefits and demand more money, only to face
riot police, dogs and, on some occasions, armoured vehicles.
Militant pensioners have tried storming the Supreme Court and one has
threatened to burn down Congress.
The plight of Argentina's 4.2m pensioners has become a political issue that
makes the government appear indifferent to the social costs of economic
reform.
Private pensions were seen as a way out of the dilemma. As well as ridding
itself of costly, corrupt and insufficient state schemes, the government
hoped such pensions would improve companies' competitiveness by reducing
payroll taxes and breathing life into capital markets.
Argentina aimed to have its private scheme in place by January, but trade
union and Congress opposition has delayed approval all year. Yesterday,
however, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said he was confident a tripartite
council from government, trade unions and business would agree a compromise
version that would ensure congressional approval before Christmas.
Mr Walter Schulthess, social security secretary, promises: 'There is going
to be a total transformation of the pensions system in Argentina.'
He has designed a hybrid scheme retaining some features of the state-run
pay-as-you-go system while copying features of a scheme operating in Chile
and introducing a mechanism to tide over existing contributors.
Initially the state will pay out a minimum benefit equivalent to about 20
per cent of the economy's average wage to all who have contributed to
pension funds for at least 30 years. Those who have contributed for longer
than this will get a 2 per cent annual premium for each year over the
30-year limit.
The state will also compensate people who are already paying into the state
system with a credit equivalent to 2 per cent of the economy's average wage
for each year's contribution, with an upper limit of 30 years.
Thus, contributors to the old system will be entitled to benefits equivalent
to 60 per cent of the average wage when reaching the retirement age of 65,
plus an automatic minimum benefit of 20 per cent of average wages. These two
state-run schemes will be funded by a 16 per cent payroll tax paid by
employers plus a fixed slice of tax revenues.
Finally there is a compulsory private pension fund scheme similar to
Chile's, funded by a 10-11 per cent wage deduction. Employees will channel
the money directly to a savings account held at a pension fund company.
Contributors will be free to pick and choose among competing funds, creating
competitive pressure to provide good service.
Mr Schulthess promises the private system will be 'strongly supervised by
totally independent regulators, since there will be strict norms on where
funds can be invested, that stipulate maximum amounts that can be invested
in each instrument.' Compulsory credit ratings, both of companies issuing
paper and of each fund's investments, will limit the scope for fraud.
The government will also create several reserve and emergency funds topped
up by the management funds themselves. Part of the money will come from a
mechanism limiting profits.
Any fund that yields 30 per cent over the pension system's annual average
yield will have to pay excess profits into the reserve funds, a sure way of
discouraging high-yielding but risky investments.
If there is a weakness in the system, it is regulation; Argentina has an
atrocious record of corrupt and incompetent state supervision and
private-sector fraud.

<TEXT>
CANADA'S military authorities have warned that the country's United Nations
peacekeeping operations are being threatened by cuts in government spending.
Canada is the second-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, after France.
It has 4,300 troops, about a tenth of the total, in 15 different UN
contingents.
With an estimated 20-25 per cent of defence resources now earmarked for UN
missions, the Defence Department has indicated it requires a big increase in
its 1993/94 budget if it is to maintain Canada's commitment.
Mr Marcel Masse, defence minister, told a Senate committee in Ottawa: 'It's
not a question of will, it's a question of dollars.' The department has been
among the heaviest casualties of recent government spending cuts.
The number of Canadian peacekeepers does not include replacement forces
training in the country concerned, nor air and naval support operations,
such as aircraft ferrying relief supplies in Yugoslavia and Somalia.
Mr Masse said the peacekeeping bill was CDollars 170m (Pounds 87.6m) over
budget so far this year. The mission in Yugoslavia, involving 2,400 Canadian
troops, has been a particular drain as individual countries are paying the
full cost of participation in the peacekeeping effort.
Mr Alex Morrison, director of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies,
forecast yesterday that the number of Canadian peacekeepers would increase
further next year, but probably at the expense of other military
commitments. 'There is a bias towards participating,' he said.
Ottawa has begun to scale down its 500-troop contribution to the UN force in
Cyprus. However, General John de Chastelain, chief of defence staff, said
Canada had been approached to take part in possible UN missions in Macedonia
and Mozambique.

LEONID KUCHMA, the Ukrainian prime minister, built his career at Iuzhmash,
the world's largest rocket factory. It is one of the places the Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev had in mind when he warned the west, whose
capitalism he aimed to bury, that 'we can turn out missiles like sausages'.
As it turned out, it was communism that Mr Kuchma reluctantly buried in
Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, last week. Less than a month after becoming
prime minister, Mr Kuchma announced a U-turn in Ukrainian economic policy.
After denouncing the efforts of his predecessors to shore up the old,
centrally planned economy which has produced hyperinflation and recession,
Mr Kuchma told Ukrainians in a live television broadcast that their new
nation had no alternative but to reform.
The importance of Mr Kuchma's message extends far beyond his country's
borders, for instability in Ukraine poses a danger to the rest of Europe.
The country, which is the size of France, has a 650,000-strong army, the
largest in Europe, and 176 long-range nuclear missiles. It flanks four east
European states and shares a long border with Russia.
But Ukraine has a fragile state structure after centuries as a virtual
colony of Russia. It also has a weak economy. Inflation is out of control -
consumer prices increased more than 20-fold in the first nine months of 1992
 -and sharp falls in consumption and industrial production have prompted an
18 per cent decline in gross national product over the same period.
Faced with these bleak statistics, Mr Kuchma unveiled a plan which includes
many of the ingredients of the economic reforms pioneered in eastern Europe:
an effort to balance the budget, tight control over credit and money supply,
and a programme of privatisation.
But for all his willingness to borrow from the free market gospel, Mr Kuchma
represents a fundamentally different architect of reform from his
counterparts in eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union.
The scientist from eastern Ukraine who has been abroad only four times -
twice to China - is a world apart from the young, westernised intellectuals
who are bringing the market to other former communist states.
Whereas the economic changes in the fast-track reform central European
states such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland are part of a deeper
commitment to western values and desire for rapid membership of the European
Community, Mr Kuchma has a more limited goal - to stave off economic
disaster.
In practice, this means the prime minister has few reservations about using
heavy-handed state intervention to secure his economic goals. Mr Kuchma has
proposed a wage and price freeze, strict exchange control and restrictions
on imports and exports. He has hinted at limiting the right to strike and
the freedom of political parties.
Mr Kuchma's hand has been strengthened by an extraordinary political coup
last week. Parliament granted the prime minister the authority to rule the
economy by decree for the next six months and voluntarily restricted its own
right to pass economic legislation. So sweeping are Mr Kuchma's new powers
that one Russian newspaper has dubbed him an 'economic dictator'.
The first and toughest test of Mr Kuchma's new-found commitment to reform
will be whether he sticks to his goals of bringing inflation down from more
than 30 per cent a month to between 2 and 3 per cent a year and reducing the
budget deficit from 44 per cent of GNP to less than 6 per cent.
To do that Mr Kuchma will need to end Ukraine's spendthrift practice of
issuing credit to support failing state industry. According to Mr Viktor
Penzennyk, the country's young, reform-minded minister of the economy, the
government issued Rs800bn of credit to faltering enterprises in May and June
alone.
The second test of Mr Kuchma's commitment to reform will be privatisation.
When he first came to office just a few weeks ago Mr Kuchma said that it was
premature even to speak of privatisation of large state enterprises. But the
gravity of the crisis has forced him to change his tune. He now wants
'forced' privatisation at all levels.
Although Mr Kuchma does not share the ideological commitment to the market
of some of his counterparts in eastern Europe, his background in the the
government and defence industries could give him the political strength they
lack. Mr Kuchma - who has challenged the inner circle of Ukraine's
ex-communist elite with his anti-corruption drive - may prove less
vulnerable to the attacks of the industrial lobby.
One of the biggest dilemmas faced by all reforming ex-communist economies is
how to compensate for the closure of inefficient state factories. In Mr
Kuchma's view, arms sales may be part of the answer. Syria has already
bought tanks from the Ukraine, while China has expressed interest in
acquiring its aircraft carriers.
And observers suspect that weapons are part of a barter agreement for oil
which Ukraine has concluded with Iran. India is purchasing spare parts from
Ukrainian arms factories and is considering buying weapons.
With so much at stake, the west may be convinced it has to pay a higher
price in the future. So far, western aid to Ukraine has come only in dribs
and drabs: Dollars 210m worth of credit from the US to buy American grain, a
CDollars 50m (Pounds 25.5m) line of credit from Canada, Ecu130m (Pounds
105m) to fund technical assistance from the EC.
The prospects for substantial assistance from the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank have brightened considerably since Mr Kuchma came to
office. Yesterday, for example, the World Bank announced it was close to
finalising its first project in Ukraine, a Dollars 50m fund to finance
institution building.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, yesterday ruled out
compromise on four key planks of his pro-market reforms, threatening a
delicate compromise worked out between the government and the powerful
opposition Civic Union (CU).
The breach in what had been assumed to be a firm deal offering Civic Union's
support for the government in return for a moderation of the economic
reforms, could return the Russian political world to serious confrontation.
The agreement had received quiet encouragement from international financial
institutions.
Mr Gaidar told parliament he was willing to compromise with the Civic Union.
But he insisted there would be no going back to a state distribution system;
no large increase in the money supply; no freeze on wages and prices; and no
fixed exchange rate lower than that set by the market.
Civic Union's leaders will probably delay a decisive response until it has
met tomorrow. Moreover, both sides still have several days left to manoeuvre
back into agreement before the opening of the Congress of People's Deputies
next Tuesday.
However, the Itar Tass news agency reported that Mr Arkady Volsky, a Civic
Union leader and president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, had charged the government with reneging on the agreement
reached over the weekend.
An immediate crisis was averted yesterday when Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker, deflected calls for the government's resignation from
hardline deputies representing the now-banned National Salvation Front.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party, one of CU's three
founding parties and the most consistently hostile to the government, told
parliament that while the Gaidar government had done a service in destroying
the old system, it must still be sacked.
President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, offered a conciliatory gesture by
abolishing the post held by Mr Gennady Burbulis, state secretary and a
figure hated by the CU for his caustic dismissal of their policies. But Mr
Burbulis was immediately named head of the president's advisory council,
essentially the same function he now fulfils, and the move was generally
seen as a transparent manoeuvre.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister and another CU target, flatly denied
rumours that he had also been fired. He said Mr Yeltsin had told him there
would be no further changes in the cabinet, at least for the present.
In his speech to parliament, Mr Gaidar did make some significant concessions
to Civic Union's stance, calling for an industrial strategy absent in Russia
until now. It would involve selective aid, export credits, the assistance of
Russian companies to win large contracts and more assistance to lower income
groups.
He wanted, he said, to 'replace a general crisis with a structural crisis' -
that is, to allow decline only in those industries for whose goods there was
little or no demand rather than in all industries irrespective of demand.
At the same time, Mr Gaidar said that a de facto Russian currency would be
introduced from January 1 - with exchange rates set between the rouble and
the coupons introduced by other former Soviet states, customs regulations
with all these states, and a transition to world prices for all exports to
those states.
Reuter adds: Russia's foreign trade minister, Mr Pyotr Aven, said yesterday
the Paris Club of creditor states had made outstanding concessions on
deferring the debts of the former Soviet Union, paving the way for an early
deal. 'We are satisfied,' he said after a two-day meeting with official
creditors in Paris.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Warning by Tietmeyer on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN inflation could persist as a threat to monetary stability beyond the
end of the decade, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank,
suggested yesterday.
As new figures were published showing inflation in western Germany
stubbornly refusing to fall, Mr Tietmeyer said he hoped the new century
would be an era of stability.
However, he warned: 'At present this is unfortunately oriented more to the
principle of hope than to reality.'
Germany in particular was in a difficult transitional period, he said in a
speech at Cambridge University, England. The challenges of German
unification were still far from being met. Nor had 'necessary decisions' on
corrections to fiscal and wage policies yet been taken.
'In our opinion, price increases of 3.5-4 per cent cannot be consistent with
the principle of monetary stability in the long run,' he added.
The government of Bavaria yesterday reported its fourth consecutive
month-on-month increase in inflation, which took the annual rate to 4 per
cent.
North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most heavily populated state, said earlier
that prices there had risen 0.5 per cent since October and that the annual
rate was now 3.7 per cent. Prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.3 per cent
during the month, leaving the annual figure unchanged at 3.3 per cent.
Provisional figures for the whole of west Germany are due in the next few
days.
Mr Tietmeyer said that a public debate on 'necessary corrections' had
recently started in Germany, and this was a positive sign. But he hinted
that while his country sorted out its problems, others had work to do. In
the meantime, further realignments within the European exchange rate
mechanism might be necessary.
Exchange rate stability was desirable, but justifiable only if economic
fundamentals in the economies concerned were kept closely in line. 'As long
as this is not the case, exchange rates must be adjustable to avoid
disadvantages for all countries,' he added.
German inflation, a crucial element in the criteria governing the
Bundesbank's present punishing interest rates regime, has benefited from
external factors such as falling oil prices and lower costs for seasonal
goods.
However, according to a new study from the Berliner Bank, when these are
stripped out, prices have been increasing since July at an annual rate of
4.8 per cent.
The source is home-made inflationary pressure from rents and the price of
services. These are sectors not yet hit by or immune from competition or the
weaknesses in the domestic economy, which account for more than 40 per cent
of household spending.
The cost of repairs and other services in Germany has risen at an annual
rate of 8 per cent in the past three months, and rents have gone up 6.4 per
cent, the bank said.

THE DANISH government has announced an expansionary budget programme for
1993, stressing job creation and investment in infrastructure.
The announcement follows long negotiations between the partners in the
coalition government and other centre parties.
Prime Minister Poul Schluter's Conservative Party has had to make
substantial concessions in its efforts to reduce unemployment and other
welfare benefits.
The Social Democrats, in particular, had criticised the government's
original budget plans, outlined in August, for not giving enough stress to
creating jobs.
The agreement between six of Denmark's eight parties was also hastened by a
desire to put on a show of economic unity after last week's devaluation of
the Swedish krona.
The government has agreed to find an extra DKr500m (Pounds 53m) for
construction projects, including road building, railways, sewerage and
housing. It says this should create at least 25,000 jobs.
However, the minister of finance, Mr Henning Dyremose, said he would still
be able to reduce the budget deficit from the latest forecast of DKr40bn for
1992, which is DKr12bn more than budgeted. Mr Dyremose forecast that the
economy would grow by 2 per cent in 1993 compared with 1 per cent in 1992.

The man, named as Michael Peters, was arrested in the town of Gudow, 10km

He is accused of founding a terrorist group, and of having taken part in two
previous attacks with Molotov cocktails against houses occupied by
asylum-seekers, and of having thrown petrol bombs at a police guarding a
home.
Mr Alexander von Stahl, the prosecutor, said the investigation of Mr Peters
and 10 other members of his group would focus on possible involvement in the
Molln attack.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, is expected to ban at least one
neo-Nazi organisation tomorrow.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE is at last making progress on economic reform but must take further
steps to reduce a ballooning public debt, the European Commission says in
its latest report on the Greek economy.
The confidential report was made available by Greek officials before next
week's meeting of the EC monetary committee, where Greece is expected to ask
for the second Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) tranche of a special Ecu2.2bn loan.
Greece postponed asking for the loan tranche, due to be paid last February,
after being criticised sharply by the Commission for falling short of 1991
targets for trimming the public sector deficit and failing to introduce
structural reforms. The reforms were agreed when the first Ecu1bn tranche
was transferred.
Officials in Athens hope this year's improved performance will help to
ensure payment of the loan early in 1993, after Greece's plan for economic
convergence with its EC partners has been approved.
'Grounds for optimism, albeit restrained, have emerged for the first time,'
the report said. 'Since the spring of 1992, the government has pursued a
more determined course to attain its fiscal objectives and to reform the
economy.'
It noted the government had implemented reforms of the tax and social
welfare systems, speeded up privatisation, and kept a tighter control on
spending by public enterprises.
A budget surplus, amounting to 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product, is
expected this year, the first in over a decade. The deficit is being
contained, with central government borrowing down from 13.1 of GDP in 1991
to 8.3 per cent this year.
But despite the rescheduling of about Dr3,100bn (Pounds 10.2bn) of domestic
debt in the past year, the public debt will rise by 5 percentage points this
year to an estimated 130 per cent of GDP, as a result of increased interest
payments.
The Commission's report warned that Greece's financial stability was
threatened by such a high level of debt, adding: 'Debt stabilisation is a
key fiscal question which remains to be addressed in an adequate manner.'
Mr Sotiris Hadzigakis, the Greek agriculture minister and a strong opponent
of privatisation, resigned yesterday in protest at a cabinet decision to
seek bids from international companies for a forest fire protection
programme for Greece.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Bank ready to aid European growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank is ready to take on a bigger role in financing
infrastructure projects in the EC if asked to by European politicians, its
president, Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, said yesterday.
He emphasised, however, that it would only take on projects that made
economic sense, adding that the bank has recently strengthened its credit
appraisal methods.
He also warned that it would take 'a year or two' from the time a project
was brought to the bank to when money was paid out.
Mr Broder's comments, made at a London briefing, follow suggestions from
other EIB officials in recent days that the bank would look askance if asked
to take a leading role in any emergency growth package to stimulate economic
activity in Europe.
'As far as the bank is concerned, we would be prepared to get involved in
any scheme to appraise projects,' Mr Broder said. 'If asked, we would
increase the speed of financing. We are ready to do this.'
He added that the bank, which can lend up to half a project's costs, waits
for proposals to be brought to it by member states. Of the big
infrastructure projects mentioned in recent days as a way of stimulating
growth, he said: 'They are all projects we had on our desks before.'
The EIB uses only about half its capital base to support current projects,
leaving capacity for substantial extra lending. Given the backing of
European member states and its track record, there is no limit on its
ability to borrow in the international capital markets, said Mr Broder.
He added that the bank would consider in some cases issuing guarantees to
commercial banks to back their loans. rather than lending directly itself.
The EIB is prepared to provide up to Pounds 100m towards building the
Jubilee Line underground extension to London's docklands, officials
suggested yesterday.
The bank, which has already lent Pounds 100m to Olympia &amp; York, developer of
the Canary Wharf project, said it was willing to back the extension to
ensure Canary Wharf's future.
The bank would lend only to support private backers of the project.

WITH French opposition to farm trade reform already clouding the relaunched
Uruguay round of global trade negotiations, Japan and South Korea yesterday
served notice that they will oppose plans obliging them to open their closed
rice markets.
Speaking at a meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC),
which agreed to work for a 'political' conclusion of the six-year-old round
by the end of the year, Mr Minoru Endo, Japan's chief negotiator, said
Tokyo's 'difficulties' with draft farm trade proposals 'must be resolved
appropriately'. Japan and South Korea have consistently opposed proposals in
the Uruguay Round's draft package of rules or 'final act' that would require
all agricultural import barriers to be converted into tariffs and reduced
over time.
However, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and TNC chairman, yesterday played down the risk to
the round posed by Tokyo and Seoul.
'Perhaps they are reminding public opinion that they are fighting,' he said
at a news conference.
He said that he had no reason to think French objections to the emerging
farm trade accord would upset the timetable for concluding the round.
Mr Dunkel said the US-EC deal struck last week would entail 'some minor
changes' in the agricultural section of the draft 'final act' presented last
December, but the basic structure and objectives had not been put in
question.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Gatt regime may outlive French revolution
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S explosion of fury on Wednesday, inside and outside the
parliamentary walls of the Palais-Bourbon, was a moment of maximum heat and
minimum light in the country's reaction to the EC's draft farm deal with the
US.
Maximum heat, because MPs were giving their first reaction to the Gatt deal
in a televised debate under extra-mural pressure from several thousand
protesting farmers. Minimum light, because MPs were at that point still in
the dark about the details of the Washington accord and of the European
Commission's judgment on it.
An outpouring of emotion about the need to preserve the French rural way of
life from attack by US agri-business - uncluttered by technicalities about
the precise extent of that attack - was just what the government wanted, and
why it rushed the debate onto parliament's agenda.
Equally important was to trumpet the threat of a French veto early and
loudly. As Liberation commented yesterday, resort to the Luxembourg
compromise is like nuclear deterrence. 'As with the atomic bomb, one has to
talk about it as much as possible so as never to have to resort to it,' the
newspaper said. Mr Bruno Durieux, the French trade minister, claimed
yesterday that having brandished the veto threat, 'we have already benefited
from half its effect' in frightening partners in the EC and adversaries in
Gatt. So, the government got a 301 to 251 majority for its motion
complaining that Brussels had 'gone beyond' its Council of Ministers mandate
in striking the farm deal, and calling for an EC ministerial meeting at
which Paris 'will confirm it will veto any draft agreement contrary to
France's fundamental interests'.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy had hoped for unanimous backing. But,
because the declaration was cast in the nature of a motion of confidence in
the government, the opposition, strong-armed by the RPR Gaullists, voted
pretty solidly against.
Yet, Mr Beregovoy's anti-Gatt tactics were scarcely undermined by this. For
the opposition said they wanted even tougher action, demanding immediate use
of France's veto and a re-opening of EC negotiations with the US. The prime
minister refused to narrow his room for manoeuvre to this extent.
Better still from his viewpoint, the CNJA young farmers' union bridled at
the opposition's divisive tactics and threatened to take it out on them at
next March's parliamentary elections. Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR president,
sought to limit any electoral damage. A post-March conservative government,
he said, 'will take on, if need be, a European crisis by vetoing a policy or
concessions to the Americans which do not take France's interests into
account'.
Is France, therefore, set on a collision course with its EC partners over
Gatt? Certainly, that was on Wednesday what the government seemed to want
the world to think. But yesterday Mr Beregovoy appeared to be softening his
stance. He went as far as to say that France's veto threat on the
agricultural agreement with Washington was 'not intended to paralyse
negotiations' in the world trade talks.
Any crisis scenario has to take account of three variables:
The timetable. The French prime minister was very careful to say that France
would use its veto 'at all stages of the procedure, from the moment a legal
text (on the Gatt farm deal) is presented to it'. That could be a long way
off. France yesterday asked the British presidency for a jumbo meeting of EC
foreign and farm ministers as soon as possible.
But even if the UK agrees to such a meeting, there would not be on the table
any legal text enshrining the Washington deal, with its 21 per cent cuts in
subsidised EC farm exports and restraint on oilseeds output, into EC law.
The decision to table EC texts lies with the presidency - Britain for the
next six weeks and Denmark for the six months thereafter. 'Now that all the
world now knows that France will veto the Washington deal, it will be up to
the British and then the Danish to decide when that veto comes,' said a
close aide to Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, agriculture minister.
Allies. France is now busy calling in its cards with potential allies; it
has even reminded Spain of its role in rounding up Basque terrorists on the
French side of the border. Paris hopes it can count on Latin support from
the south, and on specific farm sector anxieties in northern states like
Denmark and the Netherlands. This lies behind France's request for farm
ministers to join their foreign affairs counterparts in a jumbo Gatt
session. But key to these countries' attitudes will be that of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. Germany's backing was invoked by Mr Beregovoy on Wednesday and
by Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, France's EC minister, yesterday.
The German chancellor is clearly wavering on the fence. This week he told
the Bundestag he hoped for French approval of the Gatt deal, but called for
understanding of 'our French friends' situation'. President Francois
Mitterrand is reserving his persuasion for the Franco-German summit on
December 3-4. Compensation. For the moment, the talk in Paris is all of
principle in refusing the Gatt deal, not of pay-offs for accepting it. But
the French Agriculture Ministry will in the next few weeks be trawling again
through the Gatt deal and the CAP reform for discrepancies between the two.
It may, in the process, be able to foster enough discontent with the
existing CAP reform to get a revision of last May's EC accords. The chances
of 'a reform of the reform' is not very promising, Mr Soisson concedes.
But there is a formula which would suit France - extra EC income support for
its small southern farmers, offset financially by an even bigger cut in EC
cereal intervention prices which few farmers in the Community outside the
Paris basin could tolerate.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Row looms over UK plan to resolve EC budget: Whitehall has
its sights on a tough compromise to end the impasse over Community spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S proposals for breaking the deadlock over the European Community
budget are bound to cause a row when they are presented to community finance
and foreign ministers in Brussels today.
The idea of a 'tight and restrictive' package for the EC's future financing
is unlikely to win instant friends among the member states lining the
Mediterranean Sea. But the proposals, circulated to other governments
yesterday as a presidency compromise, do provide for big increases in the
transfer of funds to the four poorer community members compared with
existing financing arrangements.
It is on this basis that Whitehall hopes for a settlement when EC leaders
meet for their next summit in Edinburgh in two weeks' time.
The core of the British proposal is to raise the maximum size of the EC
budget - the so-called own resources ceiling - to 1.25 per cent of community
gross national product by the end of 1999 from 1.2 per cent at present.
The ceiling would be frozen at the present 1.2 per cent for the three years
starting in January, then raised to 1.22 per cent for 1996 and 1997 before
being lifted to 1.25 per cent for 1998 and 1999.
Using the Commission's latest assumptions for EC economic growth, this would
increase the EC budget, expressed in 1992 prices, to about Ecu79.3bn (Pounds
61bn) by 1999 compared with Ecu61.1bn this year. According to UK Treasury
figures, the EC budget would increase by an average 3 per cent per year in
real terms, compared with about 5 per cent annually over the five years
ending this year.
The UK plan is tougher than those advanced by the Commission. The most
recent official proposal from Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president,
was for a five-year budget deal that would lift the own resources ceiling to
1.36 per cent of GNP (Ecu81.9bn or Pounds 63bn) by the end of 1997.
More recently, Mr Delors has been suggesting a package to lift the EC's
budget to 1.32 per cent of GNP (Ecu83.2bn or Pounds 64bn) after seven years.
But the big selling point from Whitehall's viewpoint is the doubling of so
called structural and cohesion funds for Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland
 -the four poorest EC member states - in the next seven years compared with
the average of the past five years.
Under the UK plan, the cohesion fund - a new pool of resources first agreed
at the Maastricht summit a year ago - would total Ecu12.25bn (at 1992
prices) over the seven year period. Originally Mr Delors proposed Ecu10bn
for five years, increasing this to Ecu15bn over seven years in his later
informal plan.
In addition, the UK proposes increases in commitments under the structural
funds for poorer EC regions. These funds - covering regional development,
the social fund and certain agricultural payments  - would rise to Ecu23.8bn
by the end of 1999 from Ecu19.4bn at present. Mr Delors' proposal envisaged
an increase in the structural funds to Ecu27.7bn after seven years.
Britain has also proposed changes to the Community's complex revenue-raising
rules that will help the weaker member states. These envisage a reduction in
the role played by value added tax-related levies in meeting the community
budget in favour of levies linked to the GNP of the member states.
The UK plans no change to the present formula for financing farm spending,
which is structured gradually to reduce the share of farm spending in the
overall EC budget. Whitehall officials believe that the share of farm
spending in total EC spending could fall to around 50 per cent by 1999 from
55 per cent at present. Britain wants a review of the so-called agricultural
guidelines in 1996.
But Britain wants changes in other parts of the budget. It has proposed a
big increase in the Community's external spending - on programmes such as
technical assistance for the new democracies of eastern Europe, the former
Soviet Union and humanitarian and disaster aid for Africa - to Ecu5.3bn by
1999 from Ecu3.9bn at present.
However, the figure envisaged for 1999 is lower than the Ecu6.1bn put
forward by Mr Delors.
Whitehall has taken a big axe to Mr Delors' plans to increase substantially
internal spending on programmes such as research and development and
trans-European communications networks. It is planned that these should rise
no faster than EC GNP over the seven years.
At the same time, the UK insists that the EC budget rebate, negotiated by
Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher in 1984 should be subject to 'no adverse
change' as a result of negotiations on the EC's future financing.
The rebate, which returns to the UK 66 per cent of the excess of its
contributions to the Community over its receipts, has been worth an average
of Pounds 2bn a year since it was agreed.
The UK's determination to keep its rebate is likely to raise the hackles of
Community partners such as Germany and the Netherlands, which otherwise
could be expected to applaud Britain's tough line on overall EC spending.
The presidency compromise is not being put forward as a 'take it or leave it
offer'. Whitehall recognises that it has to achieve consensus in a Community
of 12 nations. But Treasury officials are hoping that the limits to own
resources put forward in the budget plan will hold through the difficult
negotiations that lie ahead.
They point out that the UK itself recently completed its spending plans for
the next three years and managed to hold its planned outlays for 1993-94
within a Pounds 244.5bn total that was set a year before. Britain will
commend its experience with the Autumn Statement to its community partners.
There will be no question of the community having to declare bankruptcy if
there is no agreement on future financing at Edinburgh. The current 1.2 per
cent GNP ceiling will continue indefinitely in the absence of a deal.
But several other important policies hinge on an agreement, not least the
enlargement of the community to include aspiring member states. When Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
detail the UK's EC budget plans today, they will make this linkage clear.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Commission squares its US deal with CAP -
A Brussels report that seeks to demonstrate their compatibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAY MacSHARRY, the rumbustious EC farm commissioner, asserts flatly that the
US-EC deal on food export subsidies is compatible with the Community's
reform of its Common Agricultural Policy.
That compatibility is the crux of the compromise which negotiators hope will
pave the way for a world trade agreement in the Uruguay Round under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - and thanks to the publication of
detailed figures in Brussels yesterday, it is possible to assess Mr
MacSharry's argument and the strength of potential objections from France.
In 10 pages crammed with statistics and EC jargon, the Commission sets out
Mr MacSharry's case. Its technical merits were accepted during a meeting of
the full Commission on Wednesday after objections by Ms Christiane Scrivener
of France.
The US-EC deal is based on two commitments: the reduction of direct export
subsidies by 36 per cent from the average outlay in the period 1986-90; and
the reduction of subsidised volume by 21 per cent over the same period.
Whether this is compatible with CAP reform turns on whether one accepts
assumptions about future production, prices and consumption in a six-year
period, starting June 1994.
By far the most sensitive area concerns the exportable surplus of cereals.
France claims that CAP production cuts will be deeper than foreseen if
export volume restraint exceeds 18 per cent. France argues that any figure
higher than 18 per cent is unacceptable. It also argues that the deal does
not take into account technological advances which will result in higher
yields in spite of land 'set aside' under the CAP reform.
The draft EC-US agreement lays down that the volume of cereals that can be
exported with export subsidies will be 23,410,000 tonnes at the end of six
years, according to the report. Also, food aid will be at least 2.5m, it
says.
The crucial question is about likely future production. A worst-case
scenario is that yield would increase 1 per cent a year, with a starting
point of 5 tonnes a hectare; this would mean 176.8m tonnes by the end of the
century.
But the report argues that internal EC consumption should increase because
falling cereal prices will mean the replacement of substitutes such as soya
cakes by cereals. Cereals demand should also increase because of a
foreseeable rise in the production and consumption of white meat such as
pork and poultry. This in turn means an expected rise in internal
consumption of 12m tonnes by 1999/2000.
Yet even this assumption of future prices and production is a bit of a
gamble, as the report suggests. 'The most likely outcome is that the
exportable surplus will remain within the limits authorised in the draft
agreement and be compatible with CAP reform.'
On dairy products, the Commission paper argues there is no problem with
butter and skim milk powder: the volumes corresponding to a reduction of 21
per cent in export subsidies are 'above the exportable surplus' foreseen at
the end of the six-year period.
However, because of commitments to 'minimum access' for cheese imports and
required cuts in subsidised exports, between 3m and 3.5m tonnes of milk
equivalents need to be dealt with. Settling this depends on consumption of
cheese increasing by 1-2 per cent, and persuading Spain and Italy to cut
milk production by 2m tonnes.
The other serious problem lies in the beef sector. Because member states
watered down CAP reform proposals for cutting beef production last May, the
exportable surplus at the end of six years is likely to be above the
authorised export volume (817,000 tonnes) by between 300,000 to 400,000
tonnes. Already, there are some 1m tonnes of stocks.
The Commission paper argues that the problem of stocks should be dealt with.
But it recognises that extra EC money will be needed, possibly in incentives
to discourage production. It concludes, rather weakly, that 'a combination
of the application of these CAP reform measures will enable the EC to meet
the commitments laid down in the draft agreement.'
But as Mr MacSharry said yesterday, the attraction of the deal is threefold:
compensation to farmers under CAP reform will continue under the terms
agreed; a 'peace clause' with the US provides security; and a favourable
agreement on oil-seeds has prevented a damaging trade war with the US.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: 'Luxembourg compromise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asserting a country's right of veto, the 'Luxembourg compromise', has
political force, particularly now with the EC's stress on subsidiarity,
David Buchan writes.
But it has no formal legal status, because it does not appear in the Treaty
of Rome, or subsequent treaty amendments.
Its name derives from the statement made by France's ministers when, after a
six-month boycott, they returned to Council sessions in Luxembourg in 1966.
The statement, accepted by France's five partners, asserted that a country
could veto an EC proposal if its 'very important interests are at stake'.
Its use, declining in recent years, has largely been confined to farm
legislation. Germany has invoked it successfully, and Britain
unsuccessfully.

The US-EC farm trade deal has widened divisions within the Dutch farm
sector, industry officials said yesterday, Reuter reports in Amsterdam.
Farmers in the Netherlands - the world's third largest agricultural exporter
after the US and France - are struggling in vain to find a common stand on
an issue that has left them divided.
'Cereal producers are against Gatt, but market gardeners are strongly in
favour,' said one farm representative.
Grain farmers and the cheese industry rely on subsidies.

<TEXT>
WITH French opposition to farm trade reform already clouding the relaunched
Uruguay round of global trade negotiations, Japan and South Korea yesterday
served notice that they will oppose plans obliging them to open their closed
rice markets.
Speaking at a meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC),
which agreed to work for a 'political' conclusion of the six-year-old round
by the end of the year, Mr Minoru Endo, Japan's chief negotiator, said
Tokyo's 'difficulties' with draft farm trade proposals 'must be resolved
appropriately'. Japan and South Korea have consistently opposed proposals in
the Uruguay Round's draft package of rules or 'final act' that would require
all agricultural import barriers to be converted into tariffs and reduced
over time.
However, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and TNC chairman, yesterday played down the risk to
the round posed by Tokyo and Seoul. 'Perhaps they are reminding public
opinion that they are fighting,' he said at a news conference.
He added that, as far as France was concerned, the EC negotiated as a unity
in Gatt. He had no reason to think French objections to the emerging farm
trade accord would upset the timetable for concluding the round.
Mr Dunkel said the US-EC deal struck last week would entail 'some minor
changes' in the agricultural section of the draft 'final act' presented last
December, but the basic structure and objectives had not been put in
question.
In his remarks to yesterday's TNC, Mr Dunkel appealed for 'discipline and
self-restraint' by all participants in going over the draft 'final act' for
the last time in the coming weeks and said any changes must be made by
consensus.
Trade officials hope to complete country schedules on tariff reductions and
services liberalisation early in 1993, to catch the March deadline for
submitting the pact to the US Congress.

FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Spain troubled by Paris threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French threat to veto the EC-US farm accord has caused concern among the
European partners but something close to anguish in Spain.
Officials in Madrid, who need no reminding of Spain's close trading and
political links with France, are shocked by what they view as a veiled
threat issued by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, when he
addressed the parliament in Paris on Wednesday night.
Mr Beregovoy said France had backed Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece when
they sought increased funding that would narrow economic imbalances within
the EC and that France therefore counted on the solidarity of these
governments when essential French interests were at stake.
The Spanish government is torn between its desire for a Gatt agreement, and
its fears of discord both within the Community and with the US provoked by
the threatened French veto. Spain's discomfort is made all the more acute
because it is counting on French support for an agreement on the EC's Delors
II package, which includes budgetary provisions for cohesion funds, at the
Edinburgh summit next month.
'The Spanish government is in a quandary,' an EC diplomat in Madrid said
yesterday.
The Spanish Foreign Ministry said Spain saw the EC accord with the US as
'very important' and perceived any veto as 'extremely serious'. Spain has
far more to gain than to lose from the compromise because it has never
subsidised its farming to the extent that France has and because, as a
latecomer to the EC in 1986, it has never been a significant beneficiary of
the Common Agricultural Policy.
France, the recipient of more than 20 per cent of Spanish exports, is
nevertheless Spain's main trading partner. France is also a key player in
the Spanish economy, where it is present in strength in sectors ranging from
insurance and distribution to petrol refining and car manufacturing.
The economic ties have moreover been cemented over the years by increasing
political links.
In addition to French backing for expansionary EC budgets, the Madrid
government has in the past sought close French co-operation in its struggle
to contain cross-border Basque terrorism.
Lately Madrid has been counting on France to support its bid for increased
Brussels funding in North Africa so as to stem the stream of immigrants.
Caught in a web of conflicting interests, Madrid fervently hopes for an EC
compromise that will satisfy Mr Beregovoy and save Spain the pain of taking
sides.

<TEXT>
FRENCH employers yesterday warned that a veto of the proposed US-EC trade
accord would 'greatly damage' companies' interests, their first official
contribution to the heated debate.
A veto could provoke 'a very serious' European crisis, 'with very important
consequences for the future of Europe', said Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere,
chairman of the economics commission of the Patronat employers' group.
Mr Seilliere, a former senior diplomat and member of the French negotiating
team in the Kennedy round of Gatt, declined to give an opinion on whether
the government should veto the deal, but said: 'The threat to block the
process is not credible.'
Mr Seilliere stressed that industrial employers felt 'strong friendship and
solidarity' with farmers, but pointed out at the same time that France's
general interests in an overall Gatt deal far outweighed farmers' perceived
losses, both in terms of economic activity and jobs. 'Nothing opposes us,'
he argued.
'We are struck by the fact that the reality of agriculture must be put into
perspective with the whole of France's economic interests,' Mr Seilliere
added. Farming generates 3 per cent of French gross domestic product, as
against the 20 per cent produced by exports from all sectors, the Patronat
said.
The French farm industry's FFr350bn (Pounds 42.5bn) annual turnover is less
than than the FFr385bn combined overseas turnover of five leading industrial
groups, Alcatel Alsthom, Usinor Sacilor, Thomson, Peugeot and Renault, the
Patronat calculated. French farm sales are also dwarfed by the FFr500bn per
year of sales lost by all countries through counterfeiting of goods, a
practice which harms France more than most, and which would be curbed by a
general Gatt accord, said the Patronat. It estimated that 70 per cent of
counterfeited goods are copies of French brands.

FT  27 NOV 92 / NatWest security probe on Lamont card disclosures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATA protection registrar launched an inquiry yesterday into security at
National Westminster Bank's Access credit card subsidiary after apparent
details of the card debts of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were
published in The Sun newspaper.
The newspaper alleged that Mr Lamont had received five legal warning letters
for failing to make regular payments on his Access card, and had overspent
his Pounds 2,000 credit limit.
Neither the Treasury nor Downing Street denied the claims, but they provoked
protests from senior Tories at the intrusion into Mr Lamont's personal
affairs. They also prompted an internal investigation by NatWest.
Labour MPs could barely disguise their delight at the disclosure, with
several asking how the chancellor could be expected to keep the nation's
accounts in order if he was unable to keep track of his own.
By contrast, Downing Street defended the chancellor, saying that the
oversight was caused by his heavy workload and would be immediately
rectified.
Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons' Treasury committee,
also supported Mr Lamont saying the leak of the account's details
constituted an 'outrageous' breach of customer confidentiality.
'I would expect NatWest to conduct a very rigorous inquiry to find who it is
in their organisation who has been disclosing this sort of information,' he
said.
In spite of the protests, the revelations are an embarrassment to the
chancellor. His judgment has attracted some criticism over the years, most
recently when he left the Grand Hotel in Brighton after the Conservative
party conference without paying his Pounds 900 bill. The bill was later
settled in full.
Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said he was investigating the
incident under the 1984 Data Protection Act. If the bank or any of its
employees are found to have breached the act, they could face an unlimited
fine in the High Court.
Mr Howe said he would ask an inspector to investigate the incident under two
sections of the act. 'I am concerned that if there is substance in this
report, other people's financial details could be at risk,' he said.
Like other companies and individuals using computers to store personal data,
NatWest has to register the use to which it intends to put information. It
also has to follow a series of 'data protection principles'.
The bank or any of its employees could be fined either for using data for an
unregistered purpose, or for breaching the principle that any organisation
should have 'appropriate security' to prevent the unauthorised use of data.
The maximum fine on either count in a magistrate's court is Pounds 500, but
the registrar can ask for the case to be heard in the High Court. The
registrar makes about 50 enforcement orders to encourage data users to
improve security each year.
NatWest said it was launching its own inquiry into the apparent disclosure
of the information. It said it took very seriously unauthorised disclosure
of any data, but it was not yet clear that the bank was at fault.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Queen will start to pay income tax from April: Decision seen
as move towards a smaller, European-style monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEEN ELIZABETH II has heralded the most sweeping reform of the British
monarchy since her accession 40 years ago by agreeing to pay income tax and
to support financially all but three members of her family.
Her decision amounts to a move towards a smaller continental European-style
monarchy. It was announced by Mr John Major just two days after the Queen
hinted that she recognised public dissatisfaction over the cost - and
behaviour - of her family. The prime minister said the move came at her
initiative.
The Queen is said to be the richest woman in the world with investments
alone estimated at Pounds 50m. From next April she will pay tax on her
private income at the 40 per cent top rate. She will probably also pay
inheritance and capital gains tax - but under arrangements still to be
decided because normally her wealth could be wiped out on her death.
Discussions are taking place between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and
the Royal Household before a fuller statement early next year. The Prince of
Wales is likely to pay more tax on income from the Duchy of Cornwall. After
escaping paying the poll tax, the Queen will pay the council tax on her
Sandringham and Balmoral homes.
From next year only the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh
will be paid incomes out of the 'civil list' voted by parliament. At present
the Queen receives Pounds 7.9m, the Queen Mother Pounds 643,000 and the Duke
of Edinburgh Pounds 359,000 from the civil list.
The salaries drawn by five other members of the royal family will be
reimbursed to the public purse. Buckingham Palace said the five - the
Queen's three younger children, her sister Princess Margaret, and her
90-year-old aunt Princess Alice - will go on performing public duties.
Although the Inland Revenue will keep details of royal finances secret, as
for any taxpayer, and even though taxes were paid by Queen Victoria, George
V and Edward VII, the move marks a watershed for the monarchy.
It was seen at Westminster as an attempt to restore the monarchy's
reputation after, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis dominated by
rumours about royal marriages and rows over its extravagance. The political
debate over who should pay to restore the fire-damaged Windsor Castle may
have led to the changes being announced.
Moreover, the Queen, in whose name the Inland Revenue collects taxes has
become liable herself. Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, said she could
have created an extra 25 jobs for tax inspectors at the Inland Revenue's
high-security unit in Cardiff.
The announcement came in pre-scripted exchanges in the Commons between Mr
Major and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who had been briefed on Tuesday.
Mr Smith asked the prime minister if, 'in view of the evident public
concern', he had had discussions with the Queen about her finances.
Mr Major replied that 'affection and respect' for the monarch were
widespread and the sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her personal
income. 'But Her Majesty some months ago, before the summer recess,
indicated to me that she wished consideration to be given to changing these
arrangements.'
The Queen will not be taxed on sums voted by MPs to cover costs of items
such as royal flights and trains, which totalled Pounds 57m last year. But
she will pay tax on private income from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Prince
of Wales already pays tax on his private income and voluntarily contributes
25 per cent of income from the Duchy of Cornwall.

FT  27 NOV 92 / School fees ruling preserves perks for thousands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS OF THOUSANDS of em-ployees have been saved from losing their perks at
work by a landmark ruling against the Inland Revenue from the House of Lords
yesterday.
The decision will allow many companies to structure their benefits without
fear of incurring additional costs. Many have delayed tax planning while
awaiting the judgment.
The case, Pepper v Hart, concerned the reduced school fees paid in 1983 for
their own children by 10 teachers at Malvern School, including Mr John Hart,
a senior master.
But, it had enormous implications for many employers offering benefits to
their staff. Those affected would have included employers with subsidised
canteens, sports facilities or travel, and those able to buy goods at a
discount.
British Airways confirmed last night that it was one of several companies
and professional firms which contributed to a Pounds 100,000 'fighting fund'
to help in the appeal. If the case had been lost, its employees might no
longer have been able to buy airline tickets at 10 per cent of the retail
price.
The teachers at Malvern argued that they should only be taxed on any
difference between the reduced fees they paid for their own children and the
marginal cost of providing this education - such as meals, laundry and
books. The Inland Revenue claimed the teachers should be assessed for tax on
any difference existing between the fees they paid and the average cost of
the fees.
The Revenue said yesterday it would be issuing a statement shortly on the
implications of the judgment.
It still has the option of seeking new legislation which could push for
average cost on employee benefits to apply in the future.
Mr Hart said: 'It's an absolute rout. There was tremendous interest from the
boys, wishing us good luck. I was bullish at every point. I'm going to buy a
new car next week.'
The law lords' statement was described last night as a landmark decision by
Ms Leslie Ferrar, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, because it said
ministers' speeches in parliament could be taken into account when
interpreting the law.
The ruling means lawyers may have to consult Hansard to understand
ministers' intentions when they were debating legislation, even though their
ideas may not have been reflected clearly in the letter of the law.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Council tax relief for 3.75m households
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 3.75m households will benefit from transitional relief designed to
ensure that no household is more than Pounds 182 worse off after the
introduction of the council tax, which replaces the flat-rate poll tax.
The scheme, announced yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary,
is slightly less generous than had been expected. Nonetheless, it appeared
last night to have defused a potential rebellion by Tory MPs for London and
south-east constituencies. They were concerned about the impact of the
property-based tax in the region which has relatively higher property
values.
The system, which will cost Pounds 340m in the first of its two years, is
tilted towards giving most help to people in the lower property bands. Those
in the least expensive houses will have to bear an increase of only Pounds
91 a year before qualifying, while people in the most expensive homes must
be paying an extra Pounds 182 before becoming eligible.
Government estimates now of the number of those who will gain from the tax -
just over half of England's 19m households - are notably lower than when the
council tax was originally put forward.
In April 1991, Mr John Major said that seven out of 10 households would be
better off.
The move was announced as Mr Howard released detailed figures for local
spending, which suggest that council tax bills will range broadly from about
Pounds 300 to more than Pounds 1,000 a household in England next year.
Mr Howard said that, for the first year of the property-based council tax,
the Environment Department had made its calculations on the basis of a
Pounds 439 bill for a property worth Pounds 52,000 to Pounds 68,000 (band
C), if the council spent in line with government assumptions. Two thirds of
homes are in this band or lower.
But other factors, such as poll tax arrears, and the slight scope for
overshooting budgets even within the tough regime for limiting local
spending, are likely to push the figures higher.
Ministers are still smarting from the difficulties caused by providing
illustrative figures for the poll tax. Mr Howard emphasised that the
calculations were not his forecast or prediction of council tax bills, since
levels would have to be set by individ-ual councils. That stance also
reflects the highly charged political battle over whether central or local
government should take responsibility for the level of bills and what
happens to local services as a result of the local spending settlement.
Mr Howard said there was no need for job losses provided councils 'behaved
sensibly' but critics warned that the settlement would mean swingeing cuts.

<TEXT>
A BRITISH-led customs team trying to help enforce United Nations sanctions
against the rump Yugoslav federation over six weeks have halted 950 trucks,
barges and trains, most carrying petrol, at the Hungarian border, UK
officials said yesterday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday appealed under
Britain's presidency of the European Community for the enforcement of
sanctions by Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. These countries have taken steps
to improve enforcement along the River Danube and over land but more had to
be done.
Mr Hurd yesterday spoke to the ambassadors of the three countries and asked
them to press on their governments the need to keep up the pressure. So far,
sanctions had produced a 50-70 per cent drop in Serbia's trade, unemployment
of about 60 per cent and inflation running at 50 per cent a month, according
to British officials.
Teams of customs officers from the UK, US, Netherlands, Sweden and Germany
are working alongside local officials to help enforce the embargo. On the
Hungarian border, British customs officers are leading a team of 10, backing
up local enforcement. Reuter adds: A UN relief convoy reached the Moslem
town of Gorazde yesterday.

Nearly 40,000 private companies have been established in Poland since the
fall of communism in 1989 and the private sector generated more than 45.3
per cent of gross domestic product last year, Reuter reports from Warsaw.
But latest figures from the Privatisation Ministry show that after the
initial rush of privatisation, covering mainly shops and small businesses,
the sell-off has slowed.
In the first nine months of this year only 45 state companies were
transferred into private hands, a figure which reflects the problems the
government is having attracting buyers to industry.

NORWAY'S central bank yesterday said it had used about half of its foreign
currency reserves to defend the krone during last week's intense speculation
that the currency would be devalued.
The Bank of Norway said it bought NKr49.9bn (Dollars 7.7bn) between last
Wednesday and Friday, but there had been a net currency inflow of NKr13.9bn
on Monday of this week. The amounts were in the higher end of the range of
dealers' estimates.
The krone closed yesterday at 0.26 per cent below its central value of
NKr7.9940 against the Ecu. The Oslo bourse was 1 per cent higher on
continuing devaluation speculation. Norway was the first Scandinavian
country to link its currency to the Ecu, from October 1990.
At the end of October, Norway's foreign currency reserves were worth
NK107bn.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (10): Place to be pampered -
The Plaza Athenee, classically 'haute Parisiene' and probably the prettiest
of the city's luxury hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Plaza Athenee is a seductive blend of the old and the new, with early
19th century directories decking the corridors and cascades of fresh
flowers. The Plaza is also far smaller than most of the other grand Paris
hotels - with just 220 rooms and an army of 400 staff - so the atmosphere is
more intimate and you feel pleasantly pampered throughout your stay.
The aesthetics are classically haute parisienne - with stucco flurries on
the ceilings and marble fireplaces in the rooms - but never too formal and
never, ever kitsch. The Plaza is also adept at tiny finishing touches. The
monthly bills for its flowers are said to be higher than those for
electricity.
The rooms themselves are amply proportioned, at least by Parisian standards.
The bathrooms are bliss - meticulously renovated 1930s marble with big
baths, steamy showers, heaps of thick, white towels and lovely old-fashion
toiletries blended specially for the hotel.
All the rooms are sound-proofed, so you can sleep in peace even in those
overlooking the busy Avenue Montaigne. The most expensive rooms are those on
the Avenue, where the upper floors have stunning views over the rooftops to
the river islands and the Left Bank. But the garden rooms are lovely looking
out over the pretty frieze of ampelopsis and rosy red geraniums in the
courtyard which looks as though it could be anywhere other than a city
centre.
In the summer you can dine al fresco in the courtyard to the strains of a
string quartet. A harpist plays each day at tea-time in the 1930s ocean
liner-like Relais-Plaza restaurant. The food at the Relais-Plaza, or its
counterpart, the Regence-Plaza, is not sensational. But both restaurants
score highly on ambience, the Relais-Plaza for its Art Deco decor and the
Regence-Plaza, for grandeur. They also rate well on snob appeal as favourite
haunts of the fashion designers along Avenue Montaigne.
Meanwhile the Bar Anglais, where Marlene Dietrich liked to take cocktails
and the scene of Mata Hari's arrest, is now a discreet retreat in carefully
polished leather and wood.
The bustle of the Champs-Elysees is only a stone's throw away and the
designer shops of Avenue Montaigne are on the doorstep, so women guests can
pop out to treat themselves at Chanel, Christian Dior or Christian Lacroix
after a busy working day.
Plaza Athenee, 25 avenue Montaigne, 75008. Tel: 4723 7833.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Bonds: UK bank's Tier 2 capital issue meets
strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank enjoyed a big success yesterday with the first
issue of Tier 2 capital by a UK bank which is convertible into Tier 1 or
'core', capital at the bank's option.
The bank issued 11 1/2 per cent undated subordinated notes, convertible into
non-cumulative preference shares at any time. Following strong demand, the
amount was quickly increased to Pounds 200m from the original Pounds 150m.
NatWest Capital Markets and Salomon Brothers International jointly arranged
the issue. Salomon said it was the largest issue of undated fixed-rate
sterling securities in the UK by a bank.
The structure will give NatWest undated bonds in Eurobond form, paying
interest gross. All previous issues of bank preference shares or building
society permanent interesting bearing shares have been structured as
domestic placings, paying dividends net of advance corporation tax or
interest net of withholding tax.
Advantages to the bank of this structure are that while upper Tier 2 capital
is acceptable to meet the capital adequacy requirements of the Bank for
International Settlements, it is difficult to raise. Previously it was met
by issuing perpetual floating-rate notes, a market which collapsed in 1987.
'This instrument gives us great flexibility in terms of tax and capital
planning,' said Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's group chief financial officer,
who believes that capital should be raised strategically, when it is
available, rather than when it is needed.
'There is a tactical aspect too; at some point we will look back on this
period as being a very attractive time to have raised long-term fixed-rate
funding.'
Other advantages to the bank are that interest payments are deductible for
tax purposes; only if the issue is converted into Tier I capital will the
sums paid count as dividends to be paid from net income. Further, the bank
does not have to pay a premium on conversion. In the meantime, investors get
the same yield as if they had bought preference shares.
While they are notes, if the bank misses an interest payment the interest
missed is cumulative. Preference shares have to be non-cumulative to qualify
as Tier I capital. In the event of liquidation, the notes will rank
alongside other preference shares. If they are converted into preference
shares they will pay interest at 8.392 per cent a year.
NatWest said the issue was well taken up with the core going to UK
investors. Although the launch spread of 235 basis points over comparable
gilts gives a handsome yield, it represents a total cost of 90 to 100 basis
points less than NatWest's last preference share issue, says Mr Goeltz. That
offered a launch spread of 250 over and is currently trading at around 185.
Elsewhere, sterling continued to be the most popular currency for borrowing
in the international bonds market yesterday. This owed less, however, to
overwhelming demand from investors than to the unhappy state of other
markets, said traders.
Three sterling deals tapped slightly different areas of demand, limiting any
adverse effect they might have had on each other. The consensus was that all
the issues were priced to sell quickly, particularly to UK investors.
Kyushu Electric Power's Pounds 150m five-year issue was said to have gone
extremely well. Lead-manager SG Warburg said it was trying to establish the
issue firmly as a liquid Eurobond issue, and had sold most of the paper to
UK investors. This is in contrast with past experience which has seen the
bulk of such issues placed in Japan, hitting their liquidity.
The new-look Lasmo, making its first appearance on the international capital
markets since its acquisition of Ultramar last year, issued Pounds 100m of
bonds maturing in mid-1999, to refinance existing debt. One trader said it
was priced to get the support of the investment community in the UK.
Another said it was priced to appeal to people greedy for yield. One trader
noted that a triple-B rating from Moody's is somewhat lower than one would
normally expect to see in the Eurosterling markets. The bonds were priced to
yield 155 basis points over the comparable gilts.
Baring Brothers said it continued to make sales of the World Bank's Pounds
200m six-year bonds at or inside the launch spread of 20 basis points.
The Colombian government is likely to lead Colombia's entry into
international bond markets next year, raising Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m
to open the way for other state-owned and private companies, Reuter reports
from Bogota.
Mr Juan Fernando Ocampo, sub-director of public credit planning at the
Finance Ministry, said the government was working on a sovereign bond issue
for next year. 'What will very probably happen is that the Republic will
open the way and set the benchmark so that afterwards other public and
private entities can follow,' he said.
Carbocol, the state-owned coal mining company, is in preliminary discussions
about the possibility of placing a Dollars 650m bond next year to refinance
existing commercial debt.

FT  27 NOV 92 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Japan's commercial
banks smile in adversity

Correction (published 28th November 1992) appended to this article.
JAPAN'S leading commercial banks, although announcing an embarrassing fall
in profits and a leap in loan loss reserves yesterday, could take some
comfort that their balance sheets were generally less unsightly than those
of the country's seven trust banks.
The banks' miserable results for the first half to September reflected the
new-found determination of the banking industry and the Japanese government
to clean away the debris from the stock and property market collapse.
As a result, the 11 commercial banks yesterday confessed to large securities
appraisal losses and a non-performing loan problem that required, on
average, a 42 per cent increase in loan loss reserves.
However, the seven trust banks deferred booking securities losses until the
year-end in March. On present reckoning, appraisal losses would have pushed
five into the red, with only Mitsubishi Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Trust
and Banking strong enough to take the hit and make a profit.
The banks were fortunate that a decline in interest rates during the period
allowed them to book sharply higher business profits, creating a cushion for
the new provisions and saving them the embarrassment of reporting a loss.
At Mitsubishi Bank, for example, interest received on its loans fell by 24.9
per cent, while interest payments on deposits were down 35.1 per cent. The
difference contributed to a 32.8 per cent increase to Y277.6bn (Dollars
2.2bn) in net interest income, the primary component of core earnings.
The banks realise that they cannot expect another 1 per cent to 2 per cent
fall in rates in the next half, and concede that their balance sheets will
be under more pressure.
'In the current environment, the stress that Mitsubishi Bank has
traditionally placed on credit review and asset quality control has taken on
renewed significance. Additional measures included upgrading systems and
procedures for risk rating and exposure control,' the bank said.
Japanese industrial companies take the stress on asset quality control by
Mitsubishi and other banks as a warning that it will be more difficult for
them to get loans over the next year. The finance director of a leading
Japanese steelmaker said yesterday his company had no trouble in borrowing
from banks, but that any industrial company with a record of speculation in
stocks or property faces great difficulty in getting funds.
While the banks are cautious in new lending and withdrawing from some
international projects, most said that their gross profits on international
business increased during the period. Fuji Bank said these profits rose 2.5
per cent, and Sanwa Bank reported a 37 per cent increase.
Sanwa has taken the title of Japan's most profitable bank from Sumitomo
Bank, as the former recorded a business profit of Y198.6bn and a net profit
of Y40.2bn, while Sumitomo had profits of Y175.9bn and Y37.8bn respectively.
Even Sanwa is struggling to reduce costs. The bank reported general and
administrative expenses of Y165.4bn, up from Y156bn in the first half last
year, suggesting that deeper cuts in personnel may be needed in coming
months.
Sanwa has cut its graduate intake, but it and other leading banks may be
forced to cut the workforce over the next year and review operations.
Pressure for cuts is particularly extreme at the trust banks, which have a
far thinner cushion of profits even though the restructuring of the banking
system is only just beginning. Mitsui Trust and Banking reported a net
profit of Y9.5bn, down 34.1 per cent, without taking a stock appraisal loss,
while Nippon Trust Bank had a net profit of Y1.1bn, down 47.3 per cent.
The seven trust banks were more modest in increasing their loan loss
reserves, which rose by a total of 26.5 per cent to Y35.8bn. Like the
commercial banks, the trust banks all managed to save face by keeping their
capital adequacy ratios well above the 8 per cent level required by next
March.

ROYAL Bank of Canada (RBC) has become the first Canadian bank to acquire an
insurance company with its purchase of Voyageur Insurance, Canada's largest
underwriter of travel insurance for retail travel agents.
The seller is Crawley Warren Group, the UK insurance brokers specialising in
accident, health and aerospace business.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Voyageur writes about CDollars 100m
(USDollars 78m) of premiums a year, and has 180 staff in six offices.
Financial service reforms implemented last June allowed Canadian banks for
the first time to acquire insurance companies, but put strict limits on
links between banks and their insurance subsidiaries, mainly to protect
brokers. For instance, the banks were barred from using their extensive
branch networks or their employees from selling insurance policies.
However, Mr John Hudson, Voyageur's president, said that the link would
benefit both his company and the bank. Voyageur may expand into the US,
where RBC already has a presence and where the market for travel insurance
is less developed than the UK or Canada.
Petro-Canada, the national oil company partially privatised two years ago,
has raised CDollars 250m with a 30.4m-share issue placed with a syndicate of
underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities at CDollars 8.25 a share.
Proceeds will reduce long-term debt to CDollars 1bn and bolster working
capital. The underwriters were given the option of a further 3.1m shares.
The federal government's holding will fall to 70 per cent from 80.5 per
cent.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHF-Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, began this month's reporting
season for the German banking sector with a set of sparkling figures for the
10 months to the end of October. Partial-operating profits - profits without
a contribution from trading activities - rose 17.2 per cent to DM238m
(Dollars 149.3m) at the parent bank against the comparable period for last
year.
The figures, achieved on business volume up 6.7 per cent to DM35.6bn,
suggest that the German banking sector remains an island of prosperity amid
a rapidly deteriorating economic environment. In the next few weeks, other,
larger German banks are expected to report significant profit growth for the
10 months, reflecting strong growth in lending despite high interest rates.
Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner, warned, however, that the lending
climate had clearly deteriorated in recent months and was likely to do so
further over the course of next year. The mounting risks hung 'like
Damocles' sword' over the whole banking sector and would be met with
extremely vigilant credit assessment, he said.
Mr Strutz attributed the profits climb primarily to earnings on interest
which rose 12.6 per cent to DM410m in the 10 month period. Fee income from
areas such as corporate finance, securities business, and foreign trade
financing was of special importance for the bank, he said, and would
probably amount to about half of the interest earnings over the full year.
BHF, unlike most other larger German banks, gives no figure for total
operating profits.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Thyssen cuts payout as steel
division deteriorates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THYSSEN, the German steel and engineering group, is to cut its dividend by
40 per cent to DM6 a share following a 33 per cent slump in net earnings for
the year to the end of September.
Describing the results as 'satisfactory' - profits were DM350m (Dollars
219.5m) compared with DM520 last time and DM690m in 1990 - the group
reported advances in all key divisions except steel.
The business environment had worsened considerably in recent months, Thyssen
said. There were virtually no signs of growth anywhere, and threatened
subsidies and protectionism in steel markets were making a bad situation
even worse.
Even so, the group expected its capital goods and trading divisions to
report successful results for the current year.
Volume sales, turnover and profits at Thyssen Stahl, its main steel
business, all suffered from the cyclical crisis afflicting the international
market. Output fell 4 per cent and sales were down 5 per cent at DM9.9bn.
Turnover from the group's special steel activities, which are being merged
with Thyssen Stahl, fell 8 per cent to DM3.1bn.
Government statistics, released yesterday, reflected both the recent rapid
deterioration in the steel market and companies' efforts to cope with it.
Raw steel output in western Germany during October was 10.5 per cent lower
than a year earlier.
However, production for the first 10 months was down only 1.9 per cent. Last
month's sudden drop was caused in part by implementation of Thyssen's plans
to cut output by 25 per cent in the last quarter of this year and reductions
in other companies forced by falling demand from industries hit by the
general domestic slowdown.
Group sales fell 2 per cent to DM35.8bn for the year under review despite a
4 per cent improvement to DM8.7bn in the capital goods and processing
division, whichalso showed improved profits.
HOESCH, another leading German steelmaker, announced an almost complete
shutdown over Christmas and the new year, and said further cuts could not be
ruled out.

<TEXT>
SIR PHIL HARRIS, who sold the Harris Queensway furniture and carpet group in
1988 and then saw it go into receivership, is planning to take his
Carpetright retail chain public next year, he said yesterday.
He received about Pounds 70m for his shares in Harris Queensway when it was
taken over for Pounds 450m. He then set up the Carpetright chain, with some
backing from MFI Furniture Group, which still has a 22 per cent stake. Mr
Derek Hunt, chairman of MFI, is also head of Carpetright, which rents 18
stores from MFI.
Sir Phil was speaking at the annual meeting of Great Universal Stores, the
retail and finance group, where he is a non-executive director.
Lord Wolfson, chairman of GUS, told his shareholders that profits for the
half year to end-September were ahead of the comparable period last year.
Then they were Pounds 186.6m.
Asked by a shareholder about possible enfranchisement of the non-voting
shares, Lord Wolfson said the matter was being kept under review.

FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Banks agree rescue deal for Rosehaugh
Stanhope schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS OWED an estimated Pounds 1.25bn have agreed a five-year refinancing
package with Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the owner of two of London's
largest office schemes.
The deal, which involves around 50 banks, was signed earlier this week. It
was crucial to the survival of the company which is jointly owned by
Rosehaugh and Stanhope, two of the UK's hardest hit property developers.
Separately, an announcement is expected in the next few weeks about the
acquisition by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew of the building it occupies and financed
in RSD's Broadgate office complex. UBS, which is owed Pounds 200m by RSD, is
negotiating the purchase of the building in order to secure the repayment of
its debt next April.
RSD is also in talks with Credit Lyonnais, another Broadgate tenant, about
the sale of its building. RSD is expected to make further write-downs in the
value of its assets, which comprise the Broadgate and Ludgate office schemes
in the City of London, when it publishes its accounts for the year to June.
In the year to June 1991, its net asset value fell by 15 per cent to Pounds
341.2m.
Rosehaugh and Stanhope have been particularly badly hit by the depression in
the London office market, where values have fallen by two-thirds from the
peak of the market three years ago. Merger talks between the two companies
were called off earlier this year.
RSD's management is becoming increasingly independent of either parent
company, although this will not involve a change to RSD's ownership
structure. Earlier this year, Rosehaugh agreed a refinancing of its Pounds
310m debt until January 1994. Stanhope is currently discussing the
restructuring of its debts with its banks, led by Barclays.
The banks have been prepared to support companies like Rosehaugh, Stanhope
and RSD because they are reluctant to sell assets at distressed prices in
the severely depressed London office market.

FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Thyssen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the deteriorating German economy, it is natural to wonder whether
yesterday's dividend cut from Thyssen will be its last. After all, British
Steel cut its dividend last year only to omit its interim this. Germany may
not yet be facing a UK-style recession, but its steel producers confront
some particular handicaps compared with European rivals whose currencies
have devalued. Still, things would have to get much worse for Thyssen's new
dividend, which is nearly twice covered, to come under threat.
Yesterday's preliminary - and incomplete - figures suggest that operating
profits held up better than many expected. The 33 per cent fall in 1991-92
net profit will have been struck only after as yet undisclosed provisions
for steel rationalisation which should boost net profits by some DM200m from
1993-94. The question for the current year is how much other businesses will
contribute to offset continuing weakness in steel.
Budd will clearly benefit from any US recovery, and there may be a modest
gain from a stronger dollar. But the German market for capital goods will
hardly be anything other than depressed. Even a secure net yield just below
4 per cent thus looks low. Earnings will doubtless snap back with economic
recovery, but that will need help from the Bundesbank.

Clothing stores have long used tagging systems to prevent shoplifting, but
supermarkets have found it almost impossible to prevent the theft of beans,
light bulbs or even caviare.
With this in mind, Knogo, of Long Island, has developed undetectable tags
for small items. The fine electromagnetic metal strips, encased in a clear
material, are stuck on randomly selected foods, disguised as part of the
label or bar code.
When the honest customer puts the tagged item on the conveyor belt, plates
in the check-out system break down the electro-magnetic force in the strip.
But if an item is slipped through surreptitiously, twin gates positioned at
each check-out detect the stolen item. Knogo: US, 516 232 2100; Belgium, 65

FT  27 NOV 92 / Management: Wooing the shareholders / A look at a shift in
German attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the 800 top managers at Veba, one of Germany's biggest industrial
companies, got together for the group's bi-annual strategic conference last
month, they heard what for a German company was an unusual message.
Klaus Piltz, the group's chief executive and Ulrich Hartmann, finance
director of the Dusseldorf-based group, both delivered speeches laying heavy
emphasis on the importance of shareholders, the first time the topic had
come up at one of these gatherings.
In the UK or the US, there would be nothing exceptional about the theme: in
the Anglo-American environment it is taken for granted that shareholders
come first. Managers of publicly-quoted companies know that if they do not
keep shareholders happy, they are likely to find themselves on the receiving
end of a takeover bid and out of a job.
In Germany - as in other countries in continental Europe - management has
traditionally had different priorities. The interests of employees,
customers, the tax authorities, politicians, local communities, and
established bank and insurance contacts have all traditionally come before
those of institutional investors - pension funds, insurance companies,
investment trusts and other investors.
But this is changing. More German companies, of which Veba is at the
forefront, say that they are committed to enhancing 'shareholder value'  -
managing the business for the benefit of the shareholder as measured in
terms of an increased share price and higher dividends.
This reflects the growing number of institutional shareholders in the German
market: between 1980 and 1990, the proportion of freely traded shares owned
by institutional investors rose from 58 to 68 per cent. There have also been
a number of hostile takeover battles which have reminded managers that they
can be displaced if they do not deliver sound financial performance.
Veba, with turnover of nearly DM66bn (Pounds 27bn) this year and more than
1,000 subsidiaries in areas as various as energy, transport and chemicals,
started its corporate existence more than 100 years ago as a department of
the Prussian state. After the second world war, it was gradually privatised,
the government selling its last 25 per cent stake in 1987.
The last tranche of shares was placed deliberately with overseas
institutional investors and the last shareholder survey (there are no share
registers in Germany) found that foreign institutional shareholders own 43
per cent of the shares.
With institutional investors came increased attention from Anglo-American
investment analysts. Their assessment of the company has not always been
complimentary: a particularly hard-hitting report from the London-based SG
Warburg last year accused the management of failing to extract anything like
full value from the group's highly diversified portfolio.
The report suggested that the shares were trading at a big discount to the
group's break-up value and that the company was vulnerable to a takeover
bid.
Hartmann rejects this assessment, but the judgment has on the face of it
unsettled the group's management board. Since the report came out in May
last year the company has taken a number of shareholder-friendly steps.
It has become noticeably more willing to communicate with shareholders and
the Anglo-American investment community. Board directors have made
presentations to institutional investors outside Germany - a still rare move
for German groups. Veba has also appointed its first director of investor
relations.
It has made an effort to disclose more financial information than is
strictly required under Germany's notoriously opaque accounting rules.
Veba was one of a handful of big Germany companies to increase its dividend
for last year. The company has said it will maintain its dividend at DM12
per share for this year, despite a slump in profits. The dividend is hardly
generous by Anglo-American standards, but the 'decoupling' of payout from
profits performance is especially appreciated by overseas shareholders.
It announced plans to introduce what it called a 'value-orientated
controlling system' as a way of assessing the worth of the portfolio.
Hartmann denies that the Warburg report - or pressure from the
Anglo-American investment community - has led to a fundamental change in
business strategy.
'I would like to make a distinction between our communications policies,
which we have consciously strengthened since the Warburg report came out,
and the way we run the business,' he says. The measures which do impinge on
the way the company is managed, for example the introduction of the new
controlling measures, were decided long before Warburg published its report,
he says.
He argues that the group has been run aggressively, in the interests of
long-term wealth creation, for the past 30 years. This has involved both
purchases and sales of large businesses - a highly active management of the
portfolio. Perceptions have been otherwise, he acknowledges, and the new
emphasis on communications is designed to correct the impression that Veba
is a 'sleeping giant'.
What Veba will not do is take conscious steps to unlock the value of its
portfolio in the interests of shareholders: partial flotations are deemed to
be a sign of weakness.
This attitude, common among Germany's big companies, shows the gulf that
still exists between German and UK-US management philosophy. No German
conglomerate would go so far as to restructure itself purely for the sake of
its shareholders, to sell off businesses in the recognition that the parts
would have a greater value than the whole.
ICI's current plan to split itself into two in order to maximise value for
shareholders would be unthinkable in Germany.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UN may take hard line in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council is considering taking a tougher line against the
warlords impeding the international operation to get help to the starving of
Somalia.
Diplomats indicated that peacekeeping troops could have a much stronger role
in Somalia. After closed-door consultations, Mr Andre Erdos of Hungary, the
council president, said member states were unwilling to tolerate the
'rampage' of the Somali warlords any longer.
About 70-80 per cent of food and other relief supplies being sent to Somalia
is being looted before it can get to the famine-stricken population.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has been asked to
present a report with recommendations on how to resolve the problem.
Three months ago, the council agreed to send 3,000 more UN troops from
Belgium, Canada, Egypt and Nigeria to join a 500-strong Pakistani battalion
already in Somalia. But none of the new units has arrived because UN
officials have been unable to pin down agreements with the warring factions.
Under traditional UN rules, peacekeepers are lightly armed and permitted to
use their weapons only for self-defence.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Wang's Dollars 356.6m loss worse
than forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANG Laboratories , the office computer systems manufacturer, issued its
final results for fiscal 1992 which had been delayed by its bankruptcy
protection filing in August.
Restated net losses for the year were Dollars 356.6m, or Dollars 2.10 per
share, much higher than the preliminary estimate of Dollars 139.2m issued in
August. Restructuring costs and other extraordinary items resulted in
charges against earnings of Dollars 277.3m.
The results compare with a net loss of Dollars 385.5m, or Dollars 2.31, for
fiscal 1991, which included restructuring charges of Dollars 444.8m.
Revenues for 1992 slipped to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 2.1bn.
Wang said its protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code enabled
it take certain restructuring actions and accelerate others that would not
have been possible under normal conditions.
The 1992 restructuring charges included Dollars 123m for asset write-downs,
Dollars 36m for abandonment of facilities, Dollars 65m for employee
termination costs, Dollars 37m for the disposal of certain sales and
manufacturing subsidiaries and Dollars 49m for various other restructuring
actions.
Fourth-quarter losses, as expected, were heavy, totalling Dollars 333.7m, or
Dollars 1.96 per share - after restructuring and other charges of Dollars
306.7m - compared with Dollars 314.5m, or Dollars 1.88, a year ago. Revenues
were Dollars 473.6m, down from Dollars 491.9m.

<TEXT>
CAROLCO, the cash-hungry Hollywood studio, yesterday posted a third-quarter
loss of Dollars 33.1m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, and said it had failed to
comply with some of its credit covenants. The company said it was in talks
with its lenders to extend its credit.
A year earlier, Carolco had a deficit of Dollars 43.7m, or Dollars 1.53,
including a loss of Dollars 11.9m from discontinued operations. Revenues
rose to Dollars 180m in the latest quarter from Dollars 165.6m.
In October, the Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency lowered its rating on
Carolco's senior debt to double C and kept the ratings on credit watch,
reflecting the company's continuing debt and liquidity pressures.
For the first nine months, Carolco had a net loss of Dollars 51.9m, or
Dollars 1.90.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Embassy Property, the USM-quoted property development,
housebuilding and construction group, were reduced from Pounds 2.4m to
Pounds 1.45m in the six months to September 30.
The improvement was achieved on turnover which declined from Pounds 6.3m to
Pounds 5.9m.
Losses per share worked through at 9.9p (26.1p).
However, as a result of the financial restructuring in September, the group
is showing a retained profit of Pounds 4m, against a loss of Pounds 2m in
1991.

THE US Army cancelled yesterday a Dollars 594m (Pounds 393.3m) research
contract with McDonnell Douglas to develop and test a tracking system for
the Strategic Defence Initiative, or Star Wars, anti-ballistic missile
defence, Agencies report from Washington.
The army said the shrinking defence budget forced it to withdraw the
contract from the nation's biggest defence company and four big
subcontractors.
The move is a further sign of financial distress and delay for the proposed
defence programme. The SDI has suffered a succession of financial setbacks
in Congress in recent years. Legislators this year slashed from Dollars
5.4bn to Dollars 3.8bn President George Bush's request for 1993 research
funds.
Army officials said the contract was won by McDonnell Douglas in 1988 and
that about Dollars 200m of the funds had already been spent.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Tarmac gets extra PSA cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group, is to
be paid some Pounds 5m more than originally announced to take over the
Property Services Agency's projects division, the government disclosed
yesterday.
Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said in a parliamentary written
answer that Tarmac would receive a total of Pounds 54.9m as a result of the
most recent changes in the net liabilities to be transferred.
This would consist of a Pounds 44.4m cash subscription for shares in the
privatised company and a Pounds 13.3m cash asset for which the company would
pay the government Pounds 2.8m. It was estimated last month that the
consideration payable to Tarmac would amount to some Pounds 49.75m.
Replying to a question from Mr David Evans, Tory MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Mr
Redwood said that final details would not be available for 'some
considerable time.' The final amount would depend on the number of
transferred staff remaining with the business for more than five years from
the date of sale, he said.
The Pounds 10.5m net cash asset related to 'the excess of the estimated
value of amounts owed by Projects to sub-consultants and others for work
done up to the point of sale over the estimated value of assets being
transferred to Tarmac. These assets exclude the estimated Pounds 40m owed by
customers at the point of sale. This will be retained in government.
The Pounds 10.5m figure will be further increased by between Pounds 3.1m and
Pounds 6.3m after one year depending on staff still in the business.
Government liability for severance payments to PSA staff is limited to
Pounds 40.33m.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minister hints at road tax increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTION TAKEN in next year's spring Budget to recoup the revenue lost through
the abolition of the five per cent car tax which took effect on November 12
could result in the annual vehicle excise duty being increased from Pounds
110 to Pounds 141.
This possibility was acknowledged by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary
to the Treasury, in the Commons last night when MPs approved the Car Tax
(Abolition) Bill.
He stressed that the full range of motoring taxation - leaded and unleaded
petrol, and diesel fuel as well as the vehicle excise duty - would be
considered by Mr Norman Lamont,the chancellor, before determing how to
effect the recoupment.
If the recoupment burden fell entirely on fuel, it could result in an
increase of 2.2p per litre in the price of leaded petrol and 1.8p in the
price of unleaded petrol and diesel fuel, he added, saying he could not
anticipate the chancellor's decision.
Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour Treasury spokesman, asked why the government was
assessing the cost of abolishing the tax at Pounds 750m rather than the
Pounds 628m figure that would be arrived at after accounting for the extra
VAT proceeds the government would rake in from a forecast 70,000-vehicle
increase in sales.
'Recouping the revenue in this way does not actually give any extra fiscal
stimulus,' he said, adding that Labour nonetheless welcomed the abolition.
'It just shifts the burden of tax from the shoulders of those who can afford
new cars to those who cannot.'
Mr Smith said that a second Labour concern was that abolition of the tax
would not provide 'the scale of stimulus that the motor industry needs.'
Consumer confidence remained very shaky owing to the fear of unemployment
and outstanding debt, he said.
Even if the forecast 70,000 sales increase did indeed materialise, that
would still leave sales 29 per cent lower than in 1989.
For the Liberal Democrats, economic spokesman Mr Alan Beith urged the
government to consider placing the recoupment burden on company cars.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Identifying the
shape of bins to come / A look at the link between good design and success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Thomas J Watson, the former chairman of International Business
Machines, who coined the phrase 'good design is good business'.
In the 1950s, Watson inculcated a tradition of excellence in product design,
graphics and architecture that has persisted within his company to this day.
Watson's phrase is oft-repeated, though mainly by designers rather than
their clients.
But the truth is rather more complicated. Is good design bad business? A
number of high-profile design users have recently experienced difficulties.
In some cases, design is connected with downfall. In others, it provided a
means of escape.
The new Lotus Elan won a Design Council award in 1989, but the car was never
economical to build. Design was not to blame, however. In addition to coming
on to the market as the recession took hold, the new Elan required expensive
refitting to meet safety requirements imposed by its owner, General Motors.
Had the stubby design been just the first in a line of models culminating in
four-wheel-drive four-seaters as GM intended, the design strategy would have
been vindicated, says Graham Arnold of Club Lotus. 'When they scrapped the
Elan, they scrapped Lotus's future in one fell swoop.'
Belling also won awards for a new range of cookers introduced in 1990, but
the company went into receivership in May 1992. These cookers were one
factor that made Belling attractive to Dimplex as a going concern, but if
the company had invested earlier in design, might its difficulties have been
avoided entirely?
According to Andrew Smith, now marketing planning manager of the Belling
Cooker Division of Dimplex UK: 'The company went down for reasons more to do
with the overall market than with individual models in the market. By
maintaining competitive prices we doubled market share, but the competitive
prices undermined profitability.'
Belling's design consultant, Paul Priestman, had been brought in to move the
company's dowdy product image up-market. He believes that if the company had
invested earlier in design, it could have penetrated vital foreign markets
and higher-priced sectors early enough to avoid collapse.
Good design, then, is not a sufficient condition for good business. Is it
even necessary? The Design Business Association, which represents design
consultancies, set up its biennial Design Effectiveness Awards in 1988 to
judge design, not on the customary basis of aesthetics, but on success in
the market.
Packaging for Highland Spring mineral water by Michael Peters and Partners
was the first overall winner. In 1990, the prize went to a range of electric
shavers designed for Boots by Fitch RS. The products reversed a decline in
market share and sales increased by 80 per cent in a year.
The difficulty is to quantify the contribution of design. Says Barbara
Walker, associate director responsible for marketing from the Confederation
of British Industry: 'Little is known about design effectiveness at a
project level. It is difficult to come up with hard figures because it is
interwoven with other things.' Walker is organising seminars to analyse the
separate roles of advertising, design and corporate videos.
This year's Design Effectiveness Awards will be presented at a ceremony next
Tuesday. The winners will have presented sound quantitative evidence to
support their case.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM (UK) who chaired the panel of judges,
says he was impressed by some entrants' scientific method, shown in their
willingness to treat a new product development almost as an experiment,
isolating design from other variables such as advertising spending. 'They
created a backcloth against which they could measure the success of the
design.'
One finalist in the product design category is a waste container made by
Egbert H Taylor, certainly not an object that would win an aesthetic design
award. The new plastic design replaces a traditional steel container.
The brief required new functions to be introduced at no extra cost and new
European standards to be met. Colin Stanwell-Smith of design consultancy
Cosine says: 'We had to make it look credible. It looked terrible before
although it basically did the same job.'
Like other finalists, Stanwell-Smith and Taylor presented an analysis
showing that design was a discrete factor that could otherwise have been
left out. The containers are becoming more visible to the general public
because of roadside recycling, but this activity accounts for a very small
proportion of sales.
The market - mainly local authorities - is well known and understood by
Taylor, and this is not the sort of product to be launched with an
advertising blitz. Thus, the design was the only change.
Each year since the launch, sales have increased by 40 per cent and market
share has risen from 40 to 55 per cent.

FT  26 NOV 92 / People: Kwik Save picks another Australian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graeme Seabrook, the Australian retailer who has transformed discount chain
Kwik Save since he took over in 1988, is stepping down as chief executive
next June. As expected, he has secured the top job at Dairy Farm
International, the Hong Kong-based food group which is part of the Jardine
Matheson empire and which holds 25 per cent of Kwik Save.
The UK food discounter is again to be headed by an Australian - to avoid
confusion, also called Graeme - who has been running Franklins, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dairy Farm and Australia's biggest force in food
discounting, since 1985. 'Graeme Bowler knows how to run a 'no-frills'
business,' says Seabrook, 53, who points out that Franklins has been the
inspiration for a lot of the changes at Kwik Save.
During Bowler's time, turnover has doubled to ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.35bn)
and operating profits have trebled to ADollars 90m. 'There are not that many
people who really understand discount groceries. While our chairman Sir
Timothy Harford did look outside the Dairy Farm group for other candidates,
I asked for him and Dairy Farm was prepared to offer him,' explains the
current boss.
Bowler, (right) 55, who worked for Dairy Farm in Hong Kong for 12 years
before returning to Australia to take up the Franklins post, is resigning
his executive responsibilities at Dairy Farm when he moves in June.
Seabrook, by contrast, who had joined Dairy Farm from Coles Myer where he
had been joint managing director, was immediately seconded to Kwik Save,
where he says he has doubled both turnover and profits and has taken the
company's market share of basic groceries, by volume, to 10 per cent. He
says he was promised from the beginning that he would be a candidate for the
top job at Dairy Farm at the end of his stint in the UK. He remains at Kwik
Save in a non-executive capacity.
Seabrook replaces Owen Price, who has been joint managing director since
1990 and on the board since 1986. Price, 66, is yet another Australian
retailer, who spent 27 years in that country before joining Dairy Farm in
1974.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce yesterday announced another big shake-up of senior executives
that creates a company-wide engineering and research supremo and brings a
new managing director of the company's aerospace group.
Stewart Miller, 58-year-old managing director of the Rolls-Royce aerospace
group, is moving to the new post of director, engineering and technology,
from January 1.
The moves come two weeks after Frank Turner, director of Rolls-Royce's civil
engine business, was appointed head of Lucas' aerospace division. Turner's
replacement, who has not yet been named, will report to John Sandford,
Miller's successor as managing director of the aerospace group.
Sandford is also 58 and currently president and chief executive of
Rolls-Royce Inc in the US. British-born, he is a well-known figure in the
North American aerospace industry, where he has held senior posts at
Rockwell, De Havilland Aircraft Canada, Rohr Industries and Gulfstream
Aerospace.
The appointment of Sandford means that both the Rolls-Royce aerospace group
and the industrial power group - which includes NEI - have new chiefs.
Earlier this month Richard Maudslay became managing director of the
industrial power group.
*****
John Maxwell was yesterday appointed chief executive of BPB Industries,
Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer. Alan Turner, chief executive
since 1978 remains as chairman.
Turner, who will be 60 next year, has combined the post of chairman and
chief executive since 1985. During that period he has had to fight against a
bitter European price war as BPB, Knauf of Germany and Lafarge Coppee of
France have battled for market share. The struggle, however, has abated and
prices have started to rise again this year after falling by as much as 50
per cent in the UK since 1987.
John Maxwell, 47, formerly chief executive of financial services company
Provincial Group, joined as finance director earlier this year. He had
previously been with Grand Metropolitan and Rank Xerox.
He is replaced as finance director by Peter Sydney-Smith, previously finance
director of a British Gypsum subsidiary. Martin Clark, a director of
Northern Foods, joins the BPB board as a non-executive director.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The urgent need for a firm inner core
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For supporters of the European exchange rate mechanism - and there are still
some, not swayed by fashion - the year 1992 has been a struggle to survive
until German short-term interest rates fall to a more normal level. The fate
of the ERM depends on how soon and how far German interest rates fall, and
whether France can hold on until then.
German interest rates may well be too high and the German measure of broad
money, M3, may be giving misleading signals, as its US and British
equivalents did in the early 1980s. German critics such as Norbert Walter,
the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, have been saying so for months, and
with better right than most.
The finance ministers of the weaker countries are, however, in no position
to censor the German authorities for their counter-inflationary zeal. A
monetary squeeze works in Germany, like in most other places, first by
creating a recession or slowdown and then going through to prices and wages.
If the National Institute for Economic and Social Research is right, German
consumer price inflation will be below 2 per cent in 1993 - still less if
the VAT increase due in January is discounted. If the inflation drop is
combined with internal recession - industrial production is already 3 per
cent below a year ago - German interest rates will fall sharply without the
kind of outside prodding which only makes the Bundesbank dig in its heels.
Lack of ERM credibility in the run-up to the French referendum and after has
affected several countries. But they have fallen out of the ERM less messily
than the UK. Italy is floating, but is still committed to rejoining at the
earliest opportunity. Sweden and Finland, which are not Community members,
but were shadowing the Ecu, are now floating. Norway is still, precariously,
shadowing. Spain and Portugal have devalued - the former twice - but remain
within the system.
Denmark and, even more, Ireland, have been left exposed - Ireland because
more than 40 per cent of its exports go to the UK and other non-hard core
west European countries, and Denmark because more than 30 per cent of its
exports do so. It is touch and go whether they succeed in keeping their
place in the grid. At the other end of the scale, the inner bloc of Germany
and Benelux remains solid.
Will there remain an ERM for countries to adhere to or rejoin? What makes
the ERM core more than a German bloc is the continued adherence of France.
Nothing is for sure in this world. The biggest blow to franc credibility was
the sinking of sterling and other currencies, which raised the effective
exchange rate of the franc by nearly 4 per cent. The franc survived the
Black Wednesday trauma with the aid of the Bundesbank, which was impressed
by the fact that by all the Maastricht convergence criteria - low inflation
and low budget deficits (as well as a low balance of payments deficit) -
France has done better than Germany.
By the time of the Swedish departure a week ago, France had repaid all its
borrowings from the Bundesbank and had reversed all its emergency interest
rate increases. Since then, the franc has inevitably come under further
pressure, and will doubtless do so again until the European currency
structure is clearer. If I were placing bets (which I am not) they would be
in favour of the franc maintaining its parity with the D-Mark and even more
in favour of its remaining within a monetary association with Germany.
Meanwhile, I would recommend a magnificent diatribe against the search for
alibis and scapegoats for recent currency events by Richard Portes, director
of the Centre for Economy Policy Research*. In particular he rounds on the
conspiracy theorists, who talk about markets being determined to bring a
currency down. 'It is absurd and misleading to anthropomorphise a collection
of competing firms taking very short-run decisions. The markets have no
collective view; nor do they try to crack the ERM. They have better things
to do, like making money.' The 'salivating predatory packs of speculators
are sons and daughters of the gnomes of Zurich', the scapegoats of a
previous generation.
He is even more scathing about officials who said they were taken by
surprise by the size of the speculative capital flows which overwhelmed
their defences. 'If true, this is shocking - surely they know that foreign
exchange trading is of the order of Dollars 1,000bn daily, of which probably
less than 5 per cent is to finance trade in goods and services.'
The NIESR outlines three possible paths for Euro-pean money:
The most advanced is 'some kind of federal constitution within which Emu
would take its place'. We can forget about the prospect for this generation,
irrespective of the Maastricht treaty.
The intermediate and most likely outcome is a multi-tier Europe.
The least advanced is that national economies 'may retain their distinctive
features, including national monetary policies, and hence national rates of
inflation'. In that case 'the single market will never really live up to its
name'.
Karl Otto Pohl has suggested a variant of the second option: abandoning
Maastricht and moving quickly to a full monetary union for Germany, France,
Benelux and two non-EC countries, Austria and Switzerland. Something like
this is quite likely to happen de facto. Portes is worried about the
geopolitical problems of a northern European monetary club and its
implications for those who stay outside. But in all probability the
peripheral members would benefit from a more secure core to which they could
relate their own currencies than the present so-called 'hard ERM'.
In an outer tier will be countries like Spain or Italy, prepared reluctantly
to change their ERM parities, but aspiring to eventual full monetary union.
A further tier will consist of countries, maintaining indefinitely wide
margins of say 6 per cent, and ready to realign. The outermost tier of all
will consist of countries for which even that is too much.
The most likely member of this far-out tier is too obvious to name. While
the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin describes the British
withdrawal as 'temporary', the chancellor spoke in Brussels about the
conditions which will have to be fulfilled before Britain 'would consider
rejoining'. Thus the UK is back to the Thatcher stance of doing the ERM a
favour by joining one distant day, perhaps.
The future of all the outer tiers depends on the centre holding. A rapid
drive to full monetary union by France and the German group, so far from
being divisive, would be a condition of the outer tiers remaining in some
looser form of the ERM. It will also, in the words of the NIESR, be easier
for the Bundesbank to 'begin the process of sharing responsibility for
setting interest rates' if it did so within an inner circle of sound money
countries than if it waited to be dragged in kicking and screaming to a

FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Regulatory separation would upset system that works
well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M V BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Alexander's contribution to the debate about self- regulation
('Single City regulator proposed', November 23) is to be welcomed. The views
on a 'system of tribunals' proposed by such an eminent lawyer and City
practitioner will be studied with interest. Nevertheless, I am concerned
that his views on separating retail and professional investment
practitioners into separate regulatory organisations are somewhat
over-simplified.
At present, stockbrokers dealing with private clients - obviously retail
business - are regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority, alongside
their colleagues who act for 'professional' clients. This system has
considerable merit, and benefits stockbrokers, their clients and indeed the
regulators, as all business transacted on the Stock Exchange is governed by
one self-regulatory organisation (SRO). The system's merits were recognised
by Sir Kenneth Clucas, Sir Bryan Hayes and the foundation committee
establishing the new Personal Investment Authority. All have agreed
stockbrokers should continue to be regulated by one SRO, namely the SFA.
I am sure that Lord Alexander would not want to upset a system which is
working very well solely to satisfy a theoretical division between retail
and professional business.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Gilts indexed to wage rates would aid UK pension
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PRITCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Barry Riley's article, 'Too many eggs in one basket'
(November 11), on the proportion of the assets of UK pension funds held in
equities.
As a trustee of a pension fund, I have been dismayed by the preoccupation of
the investment management industry with its performance relative only to its
other members, and not relative to the liabilities of its customers.
Liabilities of a pension plan with defined benefits rise in line with pay,
but I have been unable to find an investment manager willing to have his
long-term performance judged against wage growth.
Mr Riley observed: 'In fact pension schemes that are immature can continue
to stick quite safely with equities, almost whatever happens.' I wonder if
that will prove to be true. If mature schemes move large amounts of their
funds from equities into bonds, the resultant sharp drop in UK equity prices
could invalidate the historical observations on which his comment was based.
Also, as he observed elsewhere, it is crucial that the sponsoring employer
remains solvent in the long term. A prudent trustee has to ensure that the
fund can meet its liabilities both in the long term and on an unexpected
near-term winding up.
The faction which believes mature funds are over-invested in equities
suggests a move to fixed interest bonds. But this is only sensible if one
believes that inflation will not rise significantly. Index-linked gilts
would be a risk-averse alternative but, here again, there are potential
problems. If we ever get a single European currency, index-linked gilts
would be re-denominated in Ecu, and the indexation would therefore
presumably be changed to a pan-European inflation rate. UK wage rate growth
has traditionally exceeded changes in the RPI by 2 per cent a year, but if
the inflation index becomes Europe-wide, then UK wage growth may become
uncoupled from it for material periods.
Trustees are, therefore, left with no ideal investment. They can, of course,
reduce the risks through a mixture of investments. More likely they will
elect to move away from defined benefit schemes, and adopt defined
contribution plans. The risk of investment performance is then transferred
from the fund to the pensioner - which seems to be undesirable in social
terms. I am therefore proposing to the chancellor that the government should
issue gilts indexed to UK wage rates. The gilts would be issued with a
spread of maturities, and would work in the same way as the existing
index-linked gilts, with the indexation being to average wages, rather than
to the RPI. Economically, this is not a great leap for the government from
issuing RPI-linked bonds. Politically, it allows it to do something for the
pensions industry; socially it could avoid the demise of the defined benefit
plan.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: More luck with insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN A L BORGARS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I can sympathise with Prof Kennaway (Letters, November 17), it
would be wrong to disparage the entire British insurance industry simply as
a result of his bad luck. When I needed insurance for using Pounds 2,000-odd
of personal computer equipment in eastern Europe my household insurance
policy naturally did not cover it since it was for business purposes. The
insurance company I tried as an alternative did not cover eastern Europe, so
I asked my employer, which had some experience in eastern Europe, if it
could help. The office manager obtained the cover I needed with a couple of
telephone calls to her insurance broker. John A L Borgars,

Time was when generals who ordered their troops not to waste bullets meant
only one thing: use their bayonets on the enemy instead. But those days of
gore are mercifully over, at least in Britain and the Netherlands.
For their armies, saving bullets is now a high-technology business thanks to
former world champion racing driver Jody Scheckter. After retiring from the
professional track in 1979, the South African set up a US company which has
just won contracts worth Pounds 53m from the UK and Dutch defence
ministries.
With the end of the cold war bringing cuts in military budgets, the
Georgia-based Firearms Training Systems company is to supply both countries
with combat-practice equipment that does away with the need to expend costly
conventional ammunition. Projectors are used to simulate a battle in which
the trainees fire at their targets with lasers.
How's that for a game of soldiers?

Meanwhile, is Moscow making a secret bid to be the capital of the world
junk-mail industry? A colleague was surprised to get a press release from
Moscow telling how Supertravel, a London ski tour operator, was training its
chalet girls in the New Forest.
It is hard to believe that it is cheaper to write a press release in London
and air freight it to Moscow, so that it can then be put in an envelope and
posted back to London. Supertravel's Susan Birkin admits that sending
promotional bumf via Moscow doesn't save any money but she thinks it a
'super' marketing tool.
A Moscow postmark might just prevent a punter binning an unopened
promotional circular. 'It conjures up images of 'From Russia with love. . .
', and one client even thought that the KGB had supplied her name,' gushes
Birkin.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Nikolai Travkin has anything to do with it, the embattled Russian prime
minister, Yegor Gaidar, will get his final comeuppance at the meeting of the
Supreme Soviet today.
Travkin, chairman of the Democratic party of Russia, rushed back for the big
event from London after speaking at the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, where he claimed westerners were wrong to view Yeltsin and Gaidar
as reformers and everyone else as conservatives.
Take himself, for instance, Travkin said. Whereas in reality Gaidar had only
talked about privatisation and other reforms, he had actually put same into
force in the district of Shahovskaya, where he is head of the local
administration. There, 100km north of Moscow, trade was totally privatised,
and prices were '50 per cent lower than in neighbouring regions'.
Hence the solution to Russia's problems was simple: 'We must do on the scale
of the country what is being done in Shahovskaya.'
Travkin - who is allied in the Civic Union with Russian vice-president
Alexander Rutskoi and industrialist leader Arkady Volsky - is confident of
commanding the votes today.
What is more, he believes that its outcome will prove decisive for next
week's Congress of People's Deputies which 'will put a stop to the Gaidar
experiment'.

Life's definitely getting tougher in the civil service. Last week the
Defence Ministry staged a conference in Birmingham to tell private

as part of the government's market-testing programme.
All attending received glossy brochures produced by the ministry's graphics
department describing the juicy opportunities on offer.
These included the good news for the graphics department's own staff that
they were number four in the list of targets, and would shortly be forced to
compete for their own jobs.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Observer: Baker beats the drum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson director Kenneth Baker may no longer be a cabinet minister, but his
capacity to amuse and annoy simultaneously survives intact.
Hence merriment mingled with outrage yesterday as he used his role as the
master of ceremonies at Highland Park/Spectator parliamentarian of the year
awards to champion his own unpopular cause as prime minister in waiting.
Norman Lamont, he suggested, would do well to follow the advice of a corrupt
building society chief who counselled: 'Keep the accounts in pencil and
don't press too hard.'
But the comment that caused most umbrage touched on the Tories' sorest
bruise of Europe, about which Baker's enthusiasm in office changed to
rampant scepticism on his return to the backbenches.
Since The Spectator was only one among many onlookers who had recognised
that the Maastricht treaty was to all intents and purposes dead, he
concluded that government policy in this area now amounted to little more
than 'necrophilia'.
That last comment was the final straw for Richard Ryder, honoured as whip of
the year, who suggested that his 'old friend' might qualify for some special
award - two-faced politician of the year, perhaps - given that at the
crucial Maastricht vote a fortnight ago, Baker had voted with the
government.
'Without you,' he pointed out, to laughter and applause, 'we might not have
won.'

FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Facilities to relieve road congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEFAN B TIETZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Conclusions drawn in your leader, 'Cars, congestion and pollution'
(November 20), were shared by a conference held in London last week, which
considered Greater London's transport problems. There was one important
difference. There was considerable agreement that road pricing is inevitable
and other forms of constraint would be needed.
It was not, however, felt that there would ever be enough space for all the
roads necessary in suburbs or towns. It is therefore essential that
alternatives are put in place which would allow for the adequate movement of
people and goods by the time that such constraints come into full force.
The needs that were identified are, first, improved radial and cross-London
services, and, second, an orbital ring railway around London. A ring railway
would link the suburbs which now generate over 50 per cent of the total car
traffic in greater London. A further need is for local services such as
light rail and tram links.
Only with such facilities in place would there be opportunities to
rationalise road traffic without serious harm to London's economy.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Accountability essential with aid to east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL A ZIEGLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding the letters by Dr Seppain and Mr Crossick (November 23) in
response to Edward Mortimer's characteristically challenging arguments: they
take the US, other western leadership and the international financial
institutions to task for failing to assist reconstruction in eastern Europe
adequately, in the interest of world security.
Reconciliation of policy initiatives by the West requires a tightly
monitored emphasis on accountability. When the Financial Times reported the
pending Dollars 24bn package to assist the former command economies of the
old Soviet Union ('G7 pledges Dollars 24bn Russian aid', April 2), central
to the plan's success was to be the installation of auditors to monitor the
foreign exchange receipts in the larger relevant exporting industries.
In reality, 'offshore banking centres' have far greater knowledge of such
industries' foreign exchange proceeds than do internal auditors, who thus
far have not been appointed, or who remain silent in the face of
intimidation. In the interest of eastern European and world economic and
military security, these 'black holes' must be exposed, plugged and
regulated immediately.
Throwing good money after bad will help neither proposed recipients nor
well-meaning donors.

FT  26 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selective selling drives equities
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISAPPOINTING session in the London stock market saw shares lose ground
steadily in spite of further satisfactory news on the progress of the US
economy. Although sellers were very selective, trading volume remained high
enough to indicate the presence of the big institutions, which have already
begun to tidy up their portfolios ahead of the end of the calendar year.
The FT-SE Index opened steadily but showed no inclination to respond to the
overnight strength of the new York market. The combination of uncertainty
over the currency outlook and the progress of the domestic economy soon
depressed UK equities. Pressure on the banking and blue chip international
stocks drove the FT-SE Index down to a close of 2,709.6, a loss of 17.5 and
virtually the low point of the day.
As it approached the close of business, London made little attempt to follow
Wall Street's early gain of 12 Dow points in response to a significant
revision of US third quarter gross domestic product statistics to show a
gain of 3.9 per cent.
Dealers suggested that the UK market was now losing impetus as the news of
higher money growth in Germany and the continued turmoil in currency markets
undermined the opportunity for another early cut in Britain's interest
rates.
Several leading securities houses believe that the UK stock market could be
pinned into a range of Footsie 2,650 - 2,740 over the Christmas period. The
strategy team at Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities
house, yesterday repeated its view that current forces in the marketplace
were not strong enough to move the Footsie far from the 2,704 area.
At Nomura Research Institute, Mr Nicholas Knight who has been among the
market bulls, believes that the recovery in the UK economy 'next year and in
1994' is being under-estimated by the market. For end-1993, his Footsie
target is 3,500, and says further turbulence in the ERM will not rob the UK
of the advantages of competitive devaluation.
Seaq volume of 522.1m shares yesterday against 578.4m in the previous
session indicated lively trading. A large programme trade, begun on Tuesday
evening, was completed early yesterday, and the institutions were said to be
rounding off portfolios ahead of the calendar year-end, which is effectively
mid-December from a stock market trading viewpoint. Retail business on
Tuesday was worth Pounds 1.2bn, sustaining the significantly improved
business levels seen since mid-September. The London-based securities
industry regards Pounds 1bn as the minimum daily turnover level required for
profitable trading in equities, and the prolonged run of improved retail
volume has lifted some of the gloom.
The company news front was quieter, but analysts were looking ahead to the
next meeting of the FT-SE Index Constituent Committee at the end of
December. Several leading names in the Footsie list are believed to be in
danger of relegation, moves which would prompt more re-shuffling of
institutional portfolios.
However, underlying confidence in the UK stock market appeared to remain
firm. The improved data on the US economy disclosed this week has buttressed
support for expected moves to re-stimulate economies in the UK and elsewhere
in Europe.

FT  26 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by patent setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of Glaxo shares ticked off sharply yesterday as the market got
wind of news that rival SmithKline Beecham had won an important patent case.
The case revolved around Zofran, Glaxo's potential blockbuster drug, and
could, according to one analyst, involve 'tens of millions of pounds'.
SmithKline Beecham has been granted European patent rights on the
anti-emetic use of the drug. It is now expected that the company will demand
royalty payment from Glaxo for the rights to continue administering it to
cancer patients.
Agency broker James Capel was one of the first financial houses to get a
whiff of the news and analyst Mr Robin Gilbert discussed the implications
with clients immediately. Consequently, Glaxo fell 25 at one stage while
SmithKline firmed 7.
However, Strauss Turnbull said the news was no more than mildly negative for
Glaxo and mildly positive for its rival. Also, Gruntal Financial, the New
York broking house, was giving Glaxo a push yesterday afternoon. The gap
between the two stock prices had narrowed by the close when Glaxo was 20 1/2
off at 786 1/2 p with 8.4m traded and SmithKline 2 higher in the 'A' at 538p
with 4.6m dealt. After the London market closed, Glaxo said it believed it
was entitled to the relevant US, European and Japanese patents and would
continue to defend its position vigorously.
Redland upset
The worst performance among the Footsie constituents came from building
materials group Redland whose shares dropped 5.8 per cent. The stock fell
after institutions adopted an even more bearish stance on the building
materials sector following a presentation given by rival RMC at BZW on
Tuesday. RMC shares were down some 3.6 per cent.
At the presentation, RMC representatives told institutions of a worsening
economic picture in continental Europe, emphasising the deterioration in
France and Spain where the company is thought to have spoken of expected
volume reductions of around 10 per cent next year.
RMC retreated to close 18 off at 487p, albeit in relatively thin turnover of
609,000. Redland were heavily sold as the bearish stories on Europe
circulated and the shares closed 21 lower at 343p on 2m traded.
Laporte falls
Consideration of Laporte following a visit by analysts and fund managers to
the company's plant in Widnes led to some cuts in profit forecasts by
analysts and the shares fell 22 to 593p.
Smith New Court reduced its estimate for 1992 to Pounds 87m from Pounds 92m
and for the following year to Pounds 90m from Pounds 95m after making a
greater allowance for currency devaluation. However, Smiths likes the
fundamentals and says output is rising strongly. The house is happy to pick
up stock on weakness.
Despite positive full-year figures from Kwik Save, the shares fell initially
as the market took a negative view of the group's strategy in what it
perceived as a rapidly saturating market. The stock market continued to fear
that Kwik Save's margins would come under pressure as competition increased.
However, a meeting with analysts changed perceptions, with the group's
impressive earnings growth coming to the fore, and the shares rebounded.
Kwik Save also tried to reassure the market that its expansion policy would
target new areas, such as Scotland and East Anglia. Analysts suggested the
group might target unwanted Gateway Stores, north of the border. Most
brokers upgraded forecasts for next year to around Pounds 130m. The shares,
off 20 at one stage, closed 4 down at 748p.
A series of important board changes, including the splitting of the role of
chairman and chief executive, plus a growing feeling that the company will
maintain its interim dividend at 4p, drove BPB shares higher. The market
expects the group's half-time profits to either break even or come in
marginally higher than those during the same period last year when profits
were Pounds 24m. County NatWest is forecasting profits of around Pounds 20m
while BZW expects a small rise in profits to around the Pounds 27m-mark. BPB
shares closed 5 firmer at 190p, the highest level since May this year with
turnover a hefty 6.3m shares.
Heywood Williams slipped 3 to 147p after one leading UK broking house was
said to adopted a more bearish line on the stock. Pilkington, where some of
the market's extreme bears are said to be forecasting a decline to 60p by
Christmas, dipped 3 to 75p on good turnover of 44p. Tarmac, whose shares ran
up from a low of 53p in September this year to 98 1/2 p early this month on
a mixture of recovery and takeover hopes, dropped back sharply to close a
net 7 down at 88p.
Utilities fell across the board with the power generators still said to be
feeling the effects of the bearish view adopted by Smith New Court and the
water stocks upset by the slightly disappointing interim figures released by
North West Water. The latter closed 12 down at 481p.
Rothmans International lifted 12 to 610p after announcing half-year profits
that were flat but at the higher end of forecasts.
A statement by Fisons that it had agreed to sell its US and Canadian
Consumer Health businesses to Ciba-Geigy for about Dollars 140m (Pounds
92.7m), well above expectations, came too late to help the shares which
closed unchanged at 199p.
ICI remained without support and fell through the Pounds 10 barrier for the
first time since February 1991. The shares closed 15 off at 994p.
Inchcape, by far the biggest company in the business services sector of the
market, fell 17 to 485p as the market responded to hints that the group may
be about to launch a sizeable rights issue, possibly to fund an acquisition.
Inchcape shares fell 17 to 485p after trade of 1m shares.
Guinness stayed under selling pressure as County NatWest advised clients to
take profits in the short-term. The shares tumbled 13 to 520p.
Despite a fall in profits, shares in Tate and Lyle moved forward as the
market discounted the setbacks which were well signalled and blamed largely
on the weather and on abnormal market conditions. While some analysts
declared themselves disappointed, the company was said to have produced a
good defence at the post-results meeting. Forecasts ranged from Pounds 230
to Pounds 240m for next year. The shares rose 12 to 368p.
Worries over the potential for recovery in the hotel sector hit both Forte
and Ladbroke as Kleinwort Benson surveyed the effects of US tourism on the
UK market. Kleinwort forecasts a 6 per cent rise in US tourists next year
will be offset by an increase in hotel rooms.
Arguing that both shares should be sold, Mr Paul Slattery at Kleinwort said:
'Forte and Ladbroke are on a very high multiple on expectations of a
recovery in the hotel market underpinned by a big increase in US visitors.
This will simply not happen.' Forte dropped 6 to 172p and Ladbroke the same
to 182p.
Television group TVS lost 3 at 25 1/2 p after announcing that one potential
bidder had dropped out.
Shares in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce were volatile with broker
Smith New Court early sellers sending the shares 3 lower to 89p. However,
bargain hunting, the winning of a number of small orders and the possibility
of further engine orders, left the shares 4 up at 96p, with turnover at
7.2m.
The market was relieved that plans to slow production of several Boeing
lines excluded the Boeing 737. Shares in Smiths Industries, a supplier of
737 parts, gained 3 to 315p with sentiment boosted by talk that new aircraft
orders may lead to more orders for Smiths.
A first half loss of Pounds 1.48m at M L Holdings sent the shares sliding 6
to 15p.

FT  26 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fading hopes of a further cut in interest rates saw stock index futures
surrender most of Tuesday's gains from a late squeeze in another lacklustre
trading session, writes Joel kibazo.
The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,750,
some 3 points below the previous day's close, and the contract traded in a
narrow range of 2,740 and 2,750 right through into the afternoon with profit
taking, mainly from independent traders, playing the major role. Poor form
in the fixed interest markets also played its part in dampening enthusiasm.
It was however a large sell off by two leading US houses just before 3pm
that led to the slide in December. It finished at 2,724, down 29 on
Tuesday's session and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium
to cash of about 6. A healthy premium was maintained for most of the session
until just before the close when it briefly traded at a discount. Turnover
was 5,482 contracts.
Dealers talked of continued selling in after hours trading.
In Traded options, the 10.10am expiry of several stock options provided the
only excitement in another poor session and it accounted for a majority of
the day's turnover. Total volume reached 28,248 lots with trade in the FT-SE
100 option a meagre 4,885 contracts. Asda was the busiest stock option with
a day's total of 2,929.

FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Second-liners reach
anotherrecord high

Wall Street
US SHARE prices continued to build on recent gains in the wake of more
economic good news, with secondary stocks setting a new record high for the
second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.56 at 3,266.26.
Although the Dow is still more than 150 points short of its all-time peak,
the Nasdaq composite rose 2.38 to 648.32, another record for the index. The
broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 climbed 1.59 to 429.18, and the American
composite index put on 1.35 at 392.88. Turnover on the NYSE was 207m shares,
heavy for what is normally one of the quietest weeks of the year. The market
is closed today for Thanksgiving. Advances led declines by 1047 to 749.
Stocks surged on Tuesday on unexpectedly good economic news, which prompted
hopes that the economic recovery, having been disappointingly weak for more
than a year, is finally picking up. Yesterday's statistics on the economy
did nothing to dispel that notion.
The most bullish news came from the Commerce Department, which reported that
Gross Domestic Product - the best measure of economic growth - rose by 3.9
per cent in the third quarter of this year, and not by 2.7 per cent as
originally estimated last month. The figures surprised analysts, who had
been expecting only a modest upward revision of the GDP number.
The day's other good news included a big 9.1 per cent increase in October
existing home sales, and the 12,000 drop in the number of people claiming
state unemployment insurance during the second week of this month.
This combined with traditional pre-Thanksgiving Day buying, and share prices
advanced across all fronts.
Among individual stocks, blue-chips and cyclicals continued to benefit from
strong demand, although most ended off their highs for the day.
International Paper climbed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 63, General Motors
firmed Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 7/8 , IBM edged Dollars  3/8 higher to
Dollars 65 1/4 , and Westinghouse, which has fluctuated up and down recently
following the announcement of a major restructuring, rose Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 12 1/2 , aided by a ratings upgrade from the broking house,
PaineWebber.
Berlitz International soared Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 20 7/8 on news of an
amended merger pact with Fukutake Publishing of Japan.
Gap Stores fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 in turnover of 1.5m shares
after the broking house, Goldman Sachs, removed the stock from its
recommended list.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended flat after a session of thin volumes as the market
bides time until the end of Thanksgiving holidays in the US, dealers said.
'We're just moving sideways for the time being,' one dealer said, adding
that fears of rate rises are also capping gains.
The TSE-300 Index ended up 1.2 points or 0.04 pct at 3,260.4 on turnover of
18.3m shares valued at CDollars 222.6m compared to Tuesday's volume of 31.8
million. Declining shares led advances 300 to 264 with 286 unchanged.
Eight of the TSE's 14 subgroups climbed, led by a rebound in thereal estate
and construction sector.

FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: ERM influences volume in October -
Equity turnover jumped in Italy and Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
October saw a decline in hard-currency markets as a home for equity
investment funds in Europe. Equity market turnover figures also demonstrate
the appeal of markets linked with devaluation prospects, after the partial
collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in September.
After a 37 per cent gain in September, turnover at Europe's top eight
bourses eased back by 5.7 per cent last in October, says Mr James Cornish at
County NatWest Securities, which produces the turnover figures.
There were big variations at national level. In Italy, a stiff budget
following the lira's devaluation in mid-September and the government's
determination to make its financial legislation effective was the key to the
equity turnover revival which took it up by 58 per cent on the month, and
nearly trebled the figure from a depressed base in August.
The view that the Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, is doing a good
job and speculation regarding the country's privatisation plans also lifted
turnover. With the government giving up control of major companies and
reorganisation prospects in the Italian economy, the thought is that Italian
minority shareholders could benefit for once as the companies concerned lose
their takeover-proof status.
Spain has now devalued twice over two months. The process left it with a
sharp drop in equity values in September and a meagre recovery in October.
However, a 3 per cent rise in the Madrid general index has been outdistanced
by a 19 per cent gain in equity market turnover - taking activity to more
than double the level of two months earlier.
There seems to have been little short-term reward for good fiscal and
economic stewardship in the other European equity markets. The French, Swiss
and Dutch economies have paid for their hard currencies with high interest
rates, an effective revaluation against their trading partners and the
obvious consequences for corporate earnings.
In September, while there may have been some inward investment,
international equity business in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands
involved divestment out of markets lifted by currency appreciation.
In October, French equity turnover fell by 19.5 per cent; the traditional
safe havens, the Netherlands and Switzerland, by 2.8 and 12.1 per cent
respectively; and Germany by 9.5 per cent after a miserly pick-up a month
before.
Last month, the efforts which the hard-currency countries had made to stay
in line with the D-Mark were overshadowed by the recovery in the dollar.
This left them less attractive as a target or as a home for overseas
investment; and Germany was about to sustain the shock of its corporate
performance figures in the fourth quarter of 1992.

FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average extends
winning streak to fifth day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REMARKS by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that the government could
undertake further public works projects for fiscal 1993 sent the Nikkei
average higher for the fifth consecutive trading day, the longest winning
streak since October last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 205.92 to 17,302.01. After a day's low of 17,025.98 in the
morning on arbitrage selling, buying by public funds and institutional
investors lifted the index to a high of 17,303.01 in the afternoon.
Volume was little changed at 200m shares against 194m. Advances led declines
by 656 to 321 with 153 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 12.25 to 1,294.14 and the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.95 to
1,041.38.
Public funds and domestic institutional investors were seen buying actively.
Traders said that some investors had bought on the assumption that the
active trading by public funds was prompted by financial authorities.
Banks were higher on buying by public funds. Industrial Bank of Japan rose
Y10 to Y2,420 and Mitsubishi Bank gained Y60 to Y2,260. Banks had been weak
on fears that US-based hedge funds were looking to sell the shares short. Ms
Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said thatforeign hedge
fund traders were moving away from the Tokyo market due to the recent lack
of volatility in share prices.
Dealers traded Aids-related shares actively. Hitachi Chemical, the most
active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y956. However, SS Pharmaceutical fell
Y40 to Y1,200 on profit-taking.
Gajoen Kanko, the hotel operator, was the largest gainer of the day and
jumped Y33 to Y180. Traders said the rise was technical since the share had
been heavily sold after the company's auditor accused the company of
window-dressing its interim earnings. The company amended its earnings
report last week.
NEC recovered Y16 to Y650 on buying by public funds. However, other leading
electricals were weak on profit-taking, with Hitachi down Y1 to Y703 and
Fujitsu retreating Y8 to Y527.
Nomura Securities fell Y10 to Y1,420 on reports of credit downgrades by
Moody's, the credit rating agency. However, Nikko Securities remained
unchanged at Y640 and Daiwa Securities gained Y1 to Y840.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 105.39 to 18,481.46 in volume of 20m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y300 to Y10,500.
Roundup
AUSTRALIA and New Zealand continued their recent run against a background of
mixed performance elsewhere.
AUSTRALIA was pulled off the day's high on profit-taking in the afternoon.
After climbing to a high of 1,463.8, the All Ordinaries index fell back to
close 9.1 higher at 1,459.2 in turnover of ADollars 291m.
Westpac closed 8 cents higher at ADollars 2.98 amid ongoing speculation that
a mystery buyer is attempting to purchase a large stake.
Coles Myer fell 9 cents to ADollars 4.52 after it adjourned its annual
meeting on Tuesday, pending clarification of the group's accounts.
NEW ZEALAND finished a bullish session fractionally short of the day's high
as the NZSE-40 index rose 25.59 or 1.7 per cent to end at 1,499.64 in high
turnover of NZDollars 57m.
BANGKOK closed broadly lower in low volume as a Bt10bn rescue fund pooled by
brokers failed to start support buying. The SET Index lost 12.10 or 1.4 per
cent to 847.33 in low turnover of Bt3.4bn. Bangkok Bank fell Bt1 to Bt91,
Thai Farmers Bank Bt8 to Bt668 and Bangkok Land Bt3 to Bt100.
HONG KONG ended lower in volatile but light trading. The Hang Seng Index
broke above the 6,000 level in the morning but fell back later to close
53.98 lower at 5,918.54. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.46bn from HKDollars
2.52bn.
SINGAPORE ended mixed with Malaysian speculative shares accounting for much
of the day's trading. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.45 higher
at 1,419.79 in volume of 129.3m shares, up from 93.5m.
SEOUL slid in lethargic trade mainly due to a persistent sell-off in Kepco,
the market's most heavily weighted issue. News that South Korean GNP rose by
a real 3.1 per cent in the third quarter, the lowest in 11 years, also put
pressure on the market. The composite index shed 2.58 to 652.47 in turnover
of Won460.45bn after Won755.99bn.
Kepco lost Won600 to Won22,800 as foreigners showed only modest buying
interest after the government's decision on Tuesday to allow direct but
limited foreign investment in the company.
TAIWAN was pulled down by late profit-taking and the weighted index closed
13.71 lower at 3,673.51. Turnover was little changed at TDollars 6.58bn
against TDollars 6.5bn.
Hualon preferred stock lost TDollars 2 to TDollars 74.50 on news that
Taiwan's central bank had begun reviewing loans extended by banks to the
Hualon group.

Nordic bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORDIC bourses continued to attract attention following Sweden's currency
devaluation and on hopes that Norway would follow suit, writes Our Markets
Staff.
STOCKHOLM resumed its upward trend after Tuesday's brief pause as lower
credit market yields gave extra impetus to the market. Export-oriented heavy
engineering groups, Astra and Ericsson were all in demand. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 24.7 or 2.9 per cent to 866.0 in brisk turnover of
SKr1.37bn after SKr916m.
Ericsson B shares jumped SKr9 to 181 in heavy turnover of SKr266m and Astra
A advanced by SKr23 to SKr726.
OSLO climbed 2.3 per cent on continued devaluation speculation, the
all-share index closing 8.04 higher at 354.72 in moderate turnover of
NKr266m.
Industrial and shipping companies, which would benefit most from a weaker
crown boosting their exports, made biggest gains and Norsk Hydro put on
NKr3.5 to NKr139.5.
HELSINKI rose 5 per cent after the government and trade unions reached an
agreement on a dispute over plans to cut jobless benefits and avoided a
strike which would have started today. The Hex index closed 40.3 higher at
850.4, banks and finance houses rising by 10.4 per cent.
FRANKFURT barely maintained the improved tone of Tuesday's post-bourse
during which Volkswagen made a minor recovery, and the stock closed DM2.50
higher at DM271 yesterday. The DAX index climbed 7.44 to 1,517.72 as
turnover eased from DM4.6bn to DM4.5bn.
Sentiment sank on further consideration of third quarter reports, including
VW's, and news that the Bundesbank was keeping its repo rate unchanged at
8.75 per cent weighed further on failing interest rate hopes, described as
wishful thinking from abroad.
Among other blue chips, Siemens climbed DM7.40 to DM589.50, supported by the
view that its profits will remain fairly steady in 1993, in contrast to
Germany industry as a whole. Utilities, a conventional defensive sector,
were also strong, as Viag gained DM6.70 to DM338.30 and RWE DM5 to DM404.
Steels were weak, and Thyssen dropped another DM3.80 to DM154.90 as
expectations of strong results for 1991-92 today continued to recede.
PARIS survived an invasion by firecracker-throwing farmers and trading was
dominated by the futures market, which caused the CAC-40 index to jump more
than 10 points in the final minutes. The index closed 0.36 higher at
1,720.97 compared with a low for the day of 1,705.71. Turnover fell back to
FFr1.85bn.
Eridania-Beghin-Say fell FFr13 to FFr562 in heavy volume of 70,250 shares as
some players took the view that the recent Gatt accord between the EC and
the US would lead to lower sugar prices.
Trading in Hachette and Matra resumed after a two-day suspension following
the publication of revised merger terms. Hachette dropped FFr10.40 or 10.9
per cent to FFr85 and Matra dropped FFr10.70 or 5.5 per cent to FFr184.
Television stocks featured, with the pay television group, Canal Plus,
adding FFr35 to FFr1,045.
DUBLIN marked the Irish election by extending its climb from its 1992 lows,
the ISEQ overall index closing 37.04 or 3.2 per cent higher at 1,193.90 for
a four-day gain of 8.6 per cent.
Dealers said that the stock market was in the first phase of a rally on the
expectation of a 10 per cent devaluation in the punt, bringing the Irish
currency back into line with sterling. Buying was mainly by domestic
institutions, and could be expected to enter a second phase when the
currency realignment, expected within the next few days, takes place.
MADRID closed moderately higher, boosted by strong gains in Telefonica which
closed Pta30 higher at Pta1,125. The general index closed 1.72 higher at
211.94 in turnover of Pta19.6bn, bloated by a Pta6bn put-through in the
small security company, Prosegur, at Pta1,755 a share.
MILAN ended flat after an uneventful trading session. The Comit index rose
0.35 to 446.80 in turnover estimated at less than Tuesday's L270bn.
Sme remained in the limelight, the shares rising L192 to 3.6 per cent to
L5,553 and hitting L5,590 later in the session.
Among leading stocks, Fiat was fixed L11 higher at L4,461 but slipped to
L4,385 after hours while Mediobanca closed L45 down at L13,520.
ZURICH liked the positive start on Wall Street, and the SMI index closed 6.5
up at 1,886,7. Brown Boveri bearers closed SFr10 firmer at SFr3,310 after an
interim report.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Easier day in the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRAINS in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism eased yesterday, as the
French franc rallied against the D-Mark and overnight rates in Ireland came
down to substantially lower levels, writes James Blitz.
However, dealers continued to question the future of the fixed exchange rate
system, amidst growing convictions that the Irish punt will have to be
devalued this weekend.
The relaxation in tensions was best reflected by the French franc's
performance. Dealers had expected Tuesday's plunge through FFr3.40 to the
D-Mark to be continued yesterday, but the franc rose to a close of FFr3.388
from a previous FFr3.402.
Overnight rates in Ireland also came down to around 30 per cent having been
at 75 per cent the previous day, although this level is hardly comfortable
for the incumbent Irish government.
After two days of acute tension in Europe, several factors combined
yesterday to strengthen European currencies against the D-Mark.
Although the Bundesbank left the lower rate at which it deals in its money
market unchanged at 8.75 per cent, the central bank added more liquidity
than expected in its weekly repo. There was profit taking after the French
franc's 2 1/2 centime fall in the few days of trading. The approach of the
Thanksgiving Day holiday in the US was widely cited as a reason for less
market activity.
How was yesterday's lull in tensions interpreted?
The most pessimistic view was that a new storm could brew soon. One dealer
said that nobody should forget how September's run on the Italian lira was
preceded by days on which the Bank of Italy was cutting rates and
confidently selling its currency.
However, according to Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International
in London, the volume of selling of French francs in the September crisis
was five times what the market has seen this week. And the seasonal timing
of these strains leads dealers to think that, at worst, another crisis can
be postponed till the New Year.
As one analyst put it: 'Foreign exchange traders never hold open positions
for long as the end of a year approaches. And far less reason if it is a
year in which they have made vast profits.'
Dealers believe that a devaluation of the Irish punt is still possible this
weekend. According to Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London, the
Irish punt should not, by rights, be a candidate for devaluation because of
the economy's intrinsic strength.
But sterling's devaluation in September has made the country's exporters
uncompetitive compared to its biggest trading partner. Mr Brett also points
out that the currency remained below its ERM floor against the Belgian franc
of BFr54.025 to the punt yesterday.
'Once a currency is in that position, only a flash of blinding light can
save it,' he said.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Franc futures rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED French franc futures rebounded sharply yesterday as the currency
regained some of its recent losses against the D-Mark on the foreign
exchanges, writes James Blitz.
After two days of growing strain inside the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism, the D-Mark lost ground against European currencies yesterday and
money market rates eased in France, Ireland and Denmark.
Profit-taking in the currency market was cited as one reason for the easing
of interest rate tensions. Dealers also said that the Bundesbank's injection
of a net DM10.9bn into the banking system in its weekly securities
repurchase operation was more generous than had been expected.
Funds were mostly allocated at the established lower rate of 8.75 per cent.
However, German call money remained constant at 8.75 per cent to 8.80 per
cent because liquidity was needed to offset the loss of cash from tax
payments this month, and from end-of-month pension payments.
The impact of yesterday's easing was mostly felt in French interest rate
markets. The December franc contract rose 19 basis points to a high of
90.20. It later fell back to a close of 90.04, however, as the franc came
under new pressure in US foreign exchange trading.
Rates in the French cash market were easier. Three month money closed at
around 10 3/4 per cent from 11 per cent the previous day, while 1-month
money closed at around 11 1/4 per cent from 12 per cent.
German futures reflected disappointment that there had not been a drop in
the Bundesbank's repo rate. The December Euromark contract fell 9 basis
points to a close of 91.33 yesterday, while the March contract was also down
9 basis points to a close of 92.42. At this level, it prices in nearly 130
basis points off 3-month money in the next four months.
Recent movements in futures markets reflect a belief that the currency
turmoil is a short-term phenomenon. One trader noted yesterday that the
March French franc contract closed virtually unchanged on its level last
Wednesday, despite big fluctuations ion the December contract.
The sterling cash market remained extremely quiet. Three-month money was
again unchanged at 7 1/4 per cent offered. The Bank of England forecast a
shortage of Pounds 450m at the start of its operations. The December short
sterling contract fell 6 basis points to close at 92.93.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec seems set to keep 24.2m
b/d output ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could move
towards maintaining their existing oil production ceiling of 24.2m barrels a
day when they meet later today.
The ministers heard reports yesterday that output by Opec's 13 members in
October was actually much higher than this ceiling at 25.04m b/d, chiefly
because of increases in output by Iran and Kuwait. A return to the September
ceiling centres on Iran's willingness to accept a production cut.
Opec figures put Iranian oil production for October at 3.8m b/d - well above
its previous output level of 3.4m b/d. Kuwait's new oil minister Mr Ali
Ahmad Al-Baghli has also boosted the emirate's production close to 1.4m b/d
 -approaching its target of 1.5m b/d by the end of the year.
The producers' club expects demand for its oil to rise to 25.64m b/d in the
first quarter of next year with 640,000 b/d of this to be met from stocks. A
re-imposition of the September ceiling would therefore imply cuts from
existing production levels, which some delegates believe would send a
message to the market that Opec is ready to support prices.
However, some producers want deeper cuts in output to be made in an effort
to improve price levels. Algeria's delegation felt Opec's economists were
being too cautious in their estimate for the draw on stocks during the first
quarter.
'If Opec is willing to avert the risk of a drastic price deterioration in
the first quarter, a more normal stock draw of 900,000 b/d to 1.1m b/d
should be enforced on the market,' the Algerians told yesterday's meeting.
Algeria's new oil minister, Mr Hacene Mefti, wrote to the president of Opec
at the beginning of November urging him to call on other members of the club
to exercise production restraint. However, world prices have slipped by
about Dollars 2 a barrel since October as members have continued to produce
more than their allocated levels.
Ministers broke up into small groups throughout yesterday evening in an
effort to massage the figures and draw up a compromise acceptable to all
member nations. They will also consider a request by Ecuador later today to
leave the organisation.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC potato plan 'unacceptable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR a lightweight European Community regime on potatoes that
emerged from Brussels yesterday call into question the future of the UK's
Potato Marketing Board.
The proposals, which were yesterday termed 'unacceptable' by the PMB and the
National Farmers' Union, will be discussed tomorrow in Brussels by
Copa-Cogeca, which represents both agricultural unions and co-operatives in
Europe. The plans could come before EC farm ministers at their next meeting
on December 14, although some observers think the volume of business will
delay consideration of the potato regime.
The commission is proposing an Ecu 1.5m regime for potatoes in order to
harmonise the different mechanisms applied in member states in the run-up to
the Single European Market. It aims to encourage a free market and to
establish a common approach to trade with countries outside the EC.
The PMB at present controls the supply side of the UK market by setting a
target area for potatoes and distributing quotas to its registered growers.
It said yesterday that it would continue to lobby hard to maintain the
system, which 'we consider protects not only farmers, but consumers and the
industry as well'. The NFU said the lightweight proposals made no reference
to 'our desire to see member states being able to take national measures
when required. There is no reason why not if the measures are in line with
EC competition law and do not disturb EC trade'.
The agriculture ministry said yesterday it had not seen the detailed
proposals, which would be subject to a lot more consultation before they
were finally adopted.
The Agriculture Bill at present passing through parliament gives ministers
the power to end the potato marketing scheme, but not necessarily to close
the PMB.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber prices stretch growers'
patience - Producer pressure for stronger market support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE IS changing on the Malaysian rubber estates. Trees are being chopped
down and the land is being planted with the more profitable oil palm;
plantations near towns are being sold for real estate development. Where
there were once forests of rubber trees there are now golf courses, and
rubber tappers have found new jobs as caddies.
The country's rubber production is expected to decline in 1992 - for the
fourth year in succession - by 2.6 per cent to 1.22m tonnes.
The estates, though highly efficient producers, are turning away from rubber
and now account for less than 30 per cent of Malaysia's total output.
Thousands of smallholders have become the mainstay of the country's
production.
Malaysia, for many years the world's premier rubber producer, has dropped in
output terms behind both Thailand and Indonesia, which between them now
account for more than 70 per cent of world natural rubber production.
One reason for Malaysian rubber's decline is the country's fast economic
growth in the past five years. Rubber is a labour intensive crop and the
country is now experiencing acute labour shortages in many areas.
But declining prices are the most important factor. Over the past five years
prices of natural rubber have gone down by about a third. Leading producing
and consuming countries are now gathering in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
capital, for what is seen as a crucial meeting to decide whether or not to
work out new pricing arrangements under a revamped International Natural
Rubber Agreement, Inra III. Inra I, agreed by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Sri Lanka and Ivory Coast and a number of consumer countries, was unveiled
in the late 1970s; Inra II expires at the end of 1993.
After countless earlier meetings, however, there seems little common ground
between the two sides.
The basic aim of Inra has been to offer on one hand fair prices to producers
and on the other security of supply to consumers. A central figure in this
policy is the buffer stock manager, empowered to buy and sell stocks when
prices reach certain levels.
Consumers say Inra has generally worked well and see no need for a new
agreement (under existing rules INRA II can be extended for an extra two
years). 'The question of whether there is a need for a new agreement or to
extend the present one is premature' said a US official last week. 'The
record has shown that Inra II is one of the most successful commodity
agreements in place.'
Producing countries angrily reject such views. They have warned that unless
progress towards the negotiation of a new pact can be achieved by next
March, Inra may collapse and they could be forced into introducing their own
pricing mechanisms.
'The only thing we want to see now is a decision by importing countries that
a successor agreement with economic provision is useful,' says Mr Ahmad
Farouk, chairman of the Malaysian Rubber Research and Development Board and
one of the producer countries' main negotiators at the meeting. 'We are
willing to wait till March and we know what to do if they don't agree by
then.'
Differences between supply and demand have had a serious impact on pricing.
Although the world rubber surplus is forecast to fall to 150,000 tonnes this
year from 180,000 tonnes in 1991, demand is still weak in many key
recession-hit markets. There has also been a dramatic plunge in demand in
recent years in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile some
non Inra signatories, like India, China and Vietnam, are raising production.
'One cannot run away from the fact that it is the overall supply and demand
situation which determines the health of the rubber market,' says Mr Lim
Keng Yaik, Malaysia's primary industries minister. But Mr Lim and others
also accuse consumers of refusing to recognise the need for changes in the
rubber marketing system.
Over the past 15 years the rubber market has become more concentrated. Where
before there was a multitude of buyers, now five large tyre manufacturers
consume more than 50 per cent of global natural rubber production; where
once there were legions of rubber traders, now there are very few.
So the big consumers can exert considerable pressure on the market. At
present more than 70 per cent of the world natural rubber trade is carried
out through direct, private deals. Producers want a more transparent, open
trading system, with a central rubber exchange based in the producing
region.
For their part the consumers say that the producing countries have failed to
agree among themselves on an appropriate marketing system or to make any
real efforts to improve quality in line with requested price increases.
Self interest might eventually bring about some compromises. Both sides
agree that in the long term the prospects for natural rubber are good.
Millions of farmers still depend on rubber for their livelihoods and the
commodity, particularly in the lower-cost countries like Indonesia and
Thailand, will not simply be abandoned as a cash crop. Producer countries
are also gaining more marketing clout; in future years the countries of Asia
are likely to become the biggest rubber consumers as well as producers.
For all their financial power, the big consumers need security of supply.
Inra has guaranteed that. It has also simplified the buying process. Mr Hoyt
Wells, Goodyear's chief operating officer, says that if the agreement is
abandoned his company will have to negotiate separate contracts with 26 or
27 different countries and '50 million' farmers.
'All we would have is a lot of paperwork and no rubber' says Mr Wells.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Giant CIS aluminium smelter
closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAJIKISTAN'S giant Regar aluminium smelter has shut down because of a lack
of raw materials, according to industry officials. Last year the smelter
produced about 370,000 tonnes of aluminium and exported virtually all of it
to the west. In the first half of 1992 it produced about 184,000 tonnes.
Yesterday's news will be welcomed by the western industry which blames a
sudden surge in exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States - to
more than 1m tonnes last year - for driving down aluminium prices to their
lowest-ever level in real terms.
Officials said only the plant manager, Mr Muxaur Sinani, and three other
Russians remained at the Regar plant. About half the workforce were Russians
or Germans - all key technical people - but they had been driven away by the
ethnic disputes which threaten to engulf Tajikistan.
The final blow to the smelter's output was when rail links with Russia were
cut, halting the flow of alumina (aluminium oxide), the officials said.
Azerbaijan, previously the smelter's main alumina supplier, stopped
shipments some time ago because it was claimed no aluminium was being
shipped back in payment.
Observers suggested that the smelter, which uses out-of-date 'pre-bake'
technology, would have to be converted before it could be brought back into
operation. This would take two years but work was unlikely to start before
political stability returned to the central Asian state. Hundreds have been
killed and thousands made homeless by ethnic conflicts.
A month ago output at the smelter, about 100 km (60 miles) west of Dushanbe,
the capital, was cut to an annual rate of 200,000 tonnes compared with its
nominal capacity of 520,000 tonnes, because of a dispute about the
ownership, which dried up money for spare parts and shut down two of the
three anode lines.
Both the Tajik government and Consortium Aluminiy, the new organisation that
includes most of the former Soviet Union's aluminium operations, claim
ownership of the smelter, said to provide most of Tajikistan's income.

</HEADLINE>

At sales in Australia this week, prices have continued to move into higher
ground. The market indicator has moved more slowly, but advances have been
recorded daily, with 533 cents a kg reached yesterday. Wool sold strongly at
higher prices in New Zealand and South Africa last week, and at a Bradford
sale of British wool. The British sector is important to the combing
industry as well as trading as merchanted wool, and sterling devaluation
made prices competitive on a world basis, but market improvement has only
just been evident but trade assessments are cautious.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drive to boost Welsh lamb sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW drive to highlight Welsh food products, with particular emphasis on
lamb, was launched in Builth Wells yesterday by Welsh Food Promotions. 'If
more food is to be sold to the trade and bought by the housewife it is
essential that the image of the product is enhanced,' Mr Alun Evans,
chairman, said at the opening of the first Taste of Wales Food Show.
Yesterday's show, which is intended to become a biennial event at the Royal
Welsh Showground in Builth Wells, was primarily aimed at shops and
restaurants. It will be followed by a drive to bring the merits of Welsh
food before the big supermarket buyers. Sainsbury has already committed
itself to buying almost Pounds 1m worth of lamb and Mr Peter Budd, chief
executive of the company, is working hard to woo chains such as Asda, Tesco
and Safeway to stock Welsh products.
Much of the emphasis yesterday was naturally on lamb as Wales has over 10m
sheep and Mr Evans said that Welsh lamb deserved its quality premium.
Lamb exports, especially to France, Spain and Italy, were rising
satisfactorily and had gone up by a third in the past two months alone. This
was before French farmers had threatened to dent the trade. A blockade
against British imports this weekend is threatened as part of their
opposition to the agreement on farm products just concluded between the
European Commission and the US on farm products.

Zinc and Nickel were the strongest markets at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, and their firmness helped to steady other metals. Traders said
that ZINC had been underpinned recently by trade buying, which emerged again
today, taking the three months delivery position above Dollars 1,080 a tonne
and touching off short-covering and stop-loss buying orders. At the close
the three months price was quoted at Dollars 1,089.50 a tonne, up Dollars
24.75 on the day. Chinese buying was cited as the main factor lifting NICKEL
prices, which rose for the sixth successive trading day. The three months
position closed at Dollars 5,515 a tonne, up 39 on the day and Dollars 200
from last week's 5-year low. At the London Futures and Options Exchange
COFFEE prices continued this week's retracement, with the January position
ending Dollars 5 lower at Dollars 944 a tonne. Dealers said talks on a new
pact to support prices at the International Coffee Organisation continued to
be monitored, although progress, as expected, was slow.

contract

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government yesterday confirmed that a multi-billion dollar
contract for the development of the world's biggest gas field had gone to a
Russian consortium and gave encouragement to another Russian group seeking
to develop one of the world's largest copper deposits.
A meeting in the Kremlin presided over by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, awarded the contract for the exploitation of an estimated 3
trillion (million million) cubic metres (105 trillion cubic feet) of gas in
the Shtokman field in the Barents sea to the Rosshelf consortium of 19
Russian companies mainly engaged in defence production.
Another group, known as the Russian Industrial Consortium, attended the same
meeting to present its case for the award of a contract, estimated to be
worth at least Dollars 1bn, for the development of the Udokan copper
deposits in the Chita region in Siberia, thought to contain 18m tonnes of
copper. This consortium is led by the giant Uralmash engineering plant.
Mr Yevgenny Velikhov, vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences and
chairman of Rosshelf, told the meeting that the Rosshelf consortium would
provide greater employment in Russia. This has been a key factor in the
Russian group's victory over a rival foreign consoritum including the US
energy company Conoco, Norway's Norsk Hydro and three Finnish companies,
Neste, Metra Engineering and Imtran Voima.
The cost of the Shtokman project has been put by the foreign consortium at
between USDollars 8bn and Dollars 10bn, but by the Rosshelf group at Dollars
5bn. The Russian group also claims it would spend Dollars 2.5bn in Russia,
with its rivals spending only Dollars 400m: it said it would employ 250,000
people in Russia, compared with only 30,000 by the foreign group.
Mr Yeltsin made clear at yesterday's meeting that the country's industrial
policy would tend to favour Russian companies and groups, though they would
be encouraged to work with foreign companies and consultancies.
No award has yet been made in the case of Udokan as the final date for
tenders is January 15 next year. However, the attendance of the Russian
Industrial Consortium at yesterday's meeting and the drift of government
policy appears to favour it.

BOZANO Simonsen, the Brazilian financial group, is to acquire a 12 per cent
stake in LatInvest, an investment banking group established this year to
specialise in Latin American capital markets and corporate finance.
The Brazilian group will subscribe for a package of new equity and long-term

The InverMexico group, a Mexican financial services company, will have a 60
per cent stake. Management will subscribe to new shares to maintain its 28

LatInvest, which has offices in London, New York and Geneva, is seeking
other investors from Latin America, in particular from Argentina.
But it is not expected that InverMexico's stake will fall below 50 per cent
nor that of Bozano Simonsen below 10 per cent.
LatInvest has appointed Mr Tom Gaffney, former chief executive in London of
Libra Bank, Chase Investment Bank and the Chartered West LB merchant bank,

FT  26 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Poor inflation figures help to depress
bund prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds fell on the combination of poor inflation figures
and disappointment that the Bundesbank failed to indicate any willingness to
lower interest rates at yesterday's repo operation.
The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM70.5bn at its tender for 14-day
securities repurchase agreements, allocating funds at 8.75 per cent and
above.
The bund market had hoped to see a lower rate at the repo, and was
disappointed that the rate remained unchanged. Although the amount allocated
represented a net injection of liquidity of DM10.9bn, dealers said this was
mainly for technical reasons.
The announcement of worse-than-expected inflation figures for two of the big
German states provided further disappointing news for the bund market.
North Rhine-Westphalia reported a 0.5 per cent rise in its consumer price
index in the month to mid-November, giving a year-on-year rise of 3.7 per
cent. Consumer prices in Baden-Wuerttemberg rose 0.3 per cent in the month
to mid-November, up 3.3 per cent year-on-year.
Preliminary November consumer price figures for west Germany are expected to
be published later this week or early next week.
The Liffe bund futures contract fell from its high of 91.65 to end at around
91.33. Dealers said the yield curve flattened at the longer end, and
steepened at the short end.
Elsewhere in Europe, French government bonds ended slightly firmer helped by
a rebound in the currency early in the day. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent
bond due 2003 opened at 8.25 per cent and ended at 8.24 per cent.
UK government bonds gave up some of Tuesday's gains as funding worries
continued to haunt the gilt market. Dealers expect concern about the
government's heavy borrowing requirement to depress prices ahead of the Bank
of England's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction on December 2.
The Liffe gilt future contract fell from 100.20 to 100.05 by late afternoon,
and prices drifted down in the cash market with the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due
2002 losing  3/32 to end at around 109 3/16
JAPANESE government bonds ended higher in Tokyo on dealer short-covering.
The announcement of a successful auction result after the Tokyo market
closed helped to push up JGB futures prices further in London trading.
The Finance Ministry offered Y800bn of 10-year bonds with a 4.8 per cent
coupon, the lowest coupon for a 10-year JGB in over three years. The average
auction price was 100.25, yielding 4.763 per cent, and the bid to cover
ratio was 3.9 per cent which dealers said signalled reasonable demand for
the issue.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 ended at 4.605 per cent, having traded in
a range of 4.6 to 4.625 per cent. The key March futures closed at 107.74 in
Tokyo, against its opening level of 107.65, and traded up to 107.79 in
London.
US Treasury prices eased across the board yesterday in the wake of more
statistics showing a stronger than expected economy.
At the end of a session shortened by the approach of Thanksgiving Day, which
will close all markets today, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
 3/32 at 101, yielding 7.535 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was slightly weaker, down  1/8 at 99 25/32 , yielding 4.691
per cent.
Trading was light throughout because many market participants were winding
down business early ahead of the holiday weekend.
Prices fell after the Commerce Department announced that third-quarter gross
domestic product grew by 3.9 per cent, and not the 2.7 per cent originally
reported last month. Analysts had been expecting the figures to be revised
upwards, but not by so much.
Later in the session, there was some more economic news that was bearish for
bonds. Weekly jobless claims fell 12,000 to 374,000, and October existing
home sales jumped 9.1 per cent.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: German banks win modification
to capital rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN banks have won a partial victory in their long-running battle over
new capital adequacy rules which are to be introduced into German law at the
beginning of next year.
The financial services committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of
Germany's parliament, has decided to modify the government's proposals for
capital adequacy rules to the benefit of banks.
The rules will still go further than the letter of the European Community
directives which the new law will implement, but they will go some way to
appeasing German bankers' worries about being put at a competitive
disadvantage to other European banks.
At issue is the treatment of unrealised hidden reserves, which consist of
extensive portfolios of shares, industrial participations and property,
often acquired decades ago and standing at a much lower book value than
market value. The German banks want to be able to unlock this value.
Under the letter of the EC directives, unrealised hidden reserves can count
towards so-called 'Tier 2' capital once a bank has accumulated 'Tier 1'
capital of 4 per cent. Banks' lending power is determined by the total
amount of capital, which under the EC directives must be 8 per cent.
The German government, with the support of the Bundesbank, proposed that
German banks should be obliged to accumulate Tier 1 capital - equity,
retained earnings and profit-participating certificates - of 5 per cent
before being able to count hidden reserves to a maximum of 1 per cent.
Under the compromise proposal, banks will be able to count their unrealised
hidden reserves up to a new maximum of 1.4 per cent, once they have built up
Tier 1 capital of 4.4 per cent.
Under the new rules, banks will not be allowed to take advantage of the full
market value of hidden assets: for prudential reasons banks will only be
able to count a certain percentage of the asset value.
In general, the new capital regime will be harder for German banks: at
present they are obliged to have core capital of 5.6 per cent.
Under the Brussels-inspired rules, the total required will increase to 8 per
cent but for the first time German banks will be able to include not only
unrealised hidden reserves but also classes of capital such as subordinated
debt.

<TEXT>
LOSSES in the contracting and trading divisions caused earnings at Dorbyl,
the engineering and industrial group in South Africa's Rembrandt group, to
fall by 21 per cent in the year to September.
Turnover rose marginally to R2.98bn (Dollars 597m) from R2.90bn, but
operating income was 19 per cent lower at R141.1m, compared with R173.2m.
Higher borrowings increased interest charges by 12 per cent, but a lower
effective tax rate, mainly due to export incentives, resulted in a reduced
tax charge. Attributable earnings fell by 21 per cent to R92.3m from
R116.5m.
Mr David Mostert, chief executive, described this performance as
'satisfactory' given a 'marked decline in activity' in most sectors.

Fukutake
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of Berlitz shares rose by nearly 22 per cent yesterday morning
after the US language school and publishing group said it had agreed to
accept a revised and lower takeover offer from Fukutake, the Japanese
publishing company.
Fukutake, which will reduce the cash part of its payment from Dollars 21.62
to Dollars 19.50 per share, had asked for a renegotiation of its bid earlier
this month after Berlitz reported a sharp decline in profits for the third
quarter.
The company's operating income for the quarter was Dollars 1.2m, down from
Dollars 5.2m in the same period last year. Net income for the 1992 quarter
tumbled by 88 per cent, to just Dollars 700,000.
On Wall Street, the Berlitz share price jumped by Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars
21 at mid-session yesterday, above the actual amended offer price.
One reason for this was that while shareholders will receive less cash,
Berlitz's outstanding borrowings will be Dollars 115m rather than the
Dollars 160m of the previous accord.
As in the earlier deal, shareholders of Berlitz will still receive a 0.165
share of new common stock, together with contingent rights to receive a
portion of the net proceeds from the sale of promissory notes issued by
Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), which is currently operating under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
MCC has featured in the Berlitz saga because some 56.5 per cent of Berlitz
stock was pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans made to the
late Mr Robert Maxwell. These shares have been the subject of litigation.
As in the earlier deal, Berlitz shareholders will end up with 33 per cent of
the company and the Japanese buyer will own the majority 67 per cent stake.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: The jewel in France's industrial
portfolio / A look at the transformation of Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French majority state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals
group, has transformed itself from a ragbag of chemicals businesses into the
envy of the industry.
Six years ago, the French government put a management consultant, Mr
Jean-Rene Fourtou, an expert on the pharmaceuticals industry, in charge. He
was told to shake some strategic sense into the company. Today, it is a star
of the government's industrial portfolio and is being readied for partial
privatisation before next February.
After some FFr40bn (Dollars 7.4bn) worth of acquisitions and FFr12bn worth
of disposals since 1986, Rhone-Poulenc now generates more than 60 per cent
of its operating profits from pharmaceuticals, a far more profitable and
less cyclical business than its original metier. The transformation has been
so complete analysts believe the healthcare businesses could provide all of
group operating profits during this year's fourth quarter.
New arrivals include Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals business, Connaught, the
Canadian vaccines group and the speciality chemicals businesses, Britain's
RTZ Chemicals and GAF of the US.
During the transformation process, Rhone-Poulenc has doubled its turnover to
FFr83.8bn last year, risen from 12th to seventh in the world chemical
industry rankings, and lifted foreign sales from 70 to 78 per cent of the
total.
Now that Rhone-Poulenc and other partially privatised state giants such as
Pechiney in aluminium, and Elf Aquitaine in oil have emerged from their
shake-ups, the government is starting to cash in on the results. It badly
needs to sell shares in such groups at a time when the budget deficit is
growing faster than expected and when it needs cash to fund job creation
programmes.
However, Mr Fourtou's achievement has not been without cost. The group has a
reputation for paying prices no private company would like to rival, such as
the estimated Dollars 1.7bn it spent two years ago for a majority stake in
Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group.
Rhone-Poulenc's acquisition binge has left it with debt that few
privately-owned businesses could manage. The company is struggling to reduce
gearing, presently at 86 per cent. Analysts believe it is unlikely to meet
its publicly-stated target of reducing gearing to 50 per cent by the end of
1993.
Mr Fourtou's efforts to reduce group debt have been hit by the general
decline in prices for chemicals companies. As one analyst explains:
'Forecasts for the chemicals industry are deteriorating and decent asset
prices are difficult to achieve.'
One asset sale Rhone-Poulenc would like to make is its titanium dioxide
business. But the group has not found anyone willing to pay the price it
wants. To achieve its disposals target of FFr3bn this year it needs two
substantial sales before the end of December. The polyester, rare earths and
aluminas businesses are potential candidates.
Meanwhile, the group has not remained immune from the worldwide downturn in
the chemical industry. Its agrochemicals business, the world's
fourth-largest, has also been hit by poor weather and the reform of the EC's
common agricultural policy.
Group profits before tax and after minority interests during the third
quarter fell to FFr31m from FFr757m in 1991, mainly due to exchange rate
losses, a risk of its internationalisation. Company forecasts for operating
profits growth this year have been downgraded from 20 to 10 per cent.
Next year's group results should improve. Although the cyclical chemicals
businesses operating profits are likely to deteriorate, they should be
offset by continuing growth in pharmaceuticals, in spite of an increasingly
tight pricing environment in the US and Europe.
The group should be cash-flow neutral this year and positive next year, even
without asset sales. Margins should benefit from cost-cutting. Capital
expenditure - including environmental spending - is likely to be cut next
year. Further job losses are probably in the pipeline.
Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting shares - or preferred investment certificates -
have fallen from FFr543 at the end of October, when the government sell-off
was announced, to FFr493.50 yesterday.
In normal circumstances, analysts argue Rhone-Poulenc would be a prime
candidate for a Lord Hanson-style break up. Its senior executives admit the
combined value of its holdings in Rorer, Roussel-Uclaf, Institut Merieux are
more than Rhone-Poulenc's market capitalisation, effectively giving the
chemicals operations a negative net worth.
Analysts believe the relatively modest size of the sell-off, between FFr3bn
and FFr4bn depending on the price, should ensure its success. More
problematical will be encouraging holders of the group's preferred
investment certificates (PICs) and participating shares (PSSAs) to swap them
for ordinary shares. The former have no voting rights, but offer
preferential dividends. Some analysts are dubious about the merits of
swaping a preferential dividend for a vote in a company effectively still
controlled by the state.
Where does the company go from here? Rhone-Poulenc reckons it has more or
less completed the reshaping of its business portfolio and it has achieved
the critical size required in its five sectors, health care, agrochemicals,
fibres, specialty chemicals and chemical intermediates.
It does not envisage any more big acquisitions in the near future and says
its asset sales programme will start to run down, from FFr3.1bn in 1991 to
FFr3bn this year and less next. Meanwhile, Mr Fourtou's team plans to devote
the next three to five years seeking productivity improvements across the
group and integrating the acquisitions. Increasing the flow of new products
will also be a priority, especially at Rorer, whose portfolio of non-generic
medicines is older than that of some competitors.
The coming share sale and the simplification of the group's complex share
structure that goes with it is widely seen in France as a step towards full
privatisation. It will 'closely resemble a private-sector company,' claimed
Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, the finance director, yesterday. For example, the
chairman will be chosen by the public-sector dominated supervisory board,
rather than nominated directly by the government.
While the Socialist government is committed to keeping majority control for
the state and state-owned bodies, Rhone-Poulenc is likely to be a prime
candidate for a sell-off under a Gaullist government, likely to take power
after the legislative elections next March.
Yet, despite its high debts, it does not plan to take advantage of the
climate for privatisation to make a rights issue for the time being. Mr
Fourtou has said he prefers to live with continuing debts rather than risk
diluting earnings per share.

28%

<TEXT>
TRUST Bank, New Zealand's only remaining locally-owned trading bank,
yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 27.1m
(USDollars 14.2m) for the six months to September 30, writes Terry Hall in
Wellington.
The directors said they expected profits to be up 20 per cent for the full
year. Last year, the bank earned NZDollars 42.4m.
The country's other leading banks have been sold overseas - a process that
accelerated after deregulation of the country's banking system in 1984.
Mr Graeme Pentecost, managing director, said the result showed the bank was
recovering from losses on its commercial book, which marred the last
full-year result.
He said the improved performance reflected continuing growth and a rising
share of the local market. The bank has been promoting the fact that it is
locally owned.
Trust Bank increased its housing book by Dollars NZ310m to NZDollars 3.5bn
in the period. Assets climbed NZDollars 400m to NZDollars 7bn.
The bad debts reserve remained at NZDollars 27.3m. Mr Pentecost said the
bank's risk-adjusted capital adequacy ratio had strengthened from 9.9 to
10per cent, ahead of the New Zealand Reserve Bank's requirement of 8 per
cent.

share price
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government is awaiting a rise in the depressed Paris stock market
in the next few weeks before setting the price for the partial privatisation
of Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals group.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said that the government was
showing confidence in the stock market's 'great capacity to appreciate' by
giving the go-ahead for the sale of at least 6m Rhone-Poulenc shares, 10.6
per cent of the total.
The international offer for sale will take place before February on a date
to depend on stock market conditions, the finance ministry announced
earlier, as carried in late editions of yesterday's FT.
Of the total, 2.7m shares will be on offer in France, at least 1m will be
offered in the US and 1.7m will be placed on other international markets.
The remaining 600,000 shares, 10 per cent of the total being sold, will be
reserved for group employees, at a 10 per cent discount to the offer price.
French commercial banks Societe Generale and Banque Indosuez will manage the
French share sale, while the US shares will be handled by Morgan Stanley.
As a result of the sale and the enfranchisement of non-voting shareholders,
the government's direct voting stake will drop from 77.5 per cent to around
45 per cent.
However, the public sector will still have a majority, thanks to stakes held
by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, and AGF, a state insurer.
The government has reserved the right to sell more shares if required.
The finance ministry confirmed that, following the sale, the government will
offer to exchange Rhone-Poulenc preferred investment certificates and
participating shares series A - two kinds of non-voting stock - into
ordinary voting shares, at a rate of one for one.

higher than US

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S life insurers are in better financial shape than their US
counterparts, but face a significant competitive threat from the big
domestic banks, according to a report by Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York
rating agency.
S &amp; P predicted that the Canadian industry 'will continue to be
well-capitalised, generally profitable and financially strong'. Most of the
largest underwriters - including Sun Life of Canada, Manufacturers Life,
Great-West Life and Canada Life - still carry a Triple A rating on their
ability to meet policyholders' claims.
The optimistic assessment is based largely on the fewer number of
competitors than the US and the greater market penetration of the leading
companies.
S &amp; P estimates that the top five Canadian insurers have an operating
leverage of 8.9 times capital, well below the 14.6 times leverage of the
leading US companies.
The combined capital base of the five largest Canadian companies was
CDollars 8.3bn (USDollars 6.4bn) at the end of 1991, about one-third the
size of their US counterparts. The US economy is about 10 times the size of
Canada.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Moody's lowers ratings of top
Japanese brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE senior ratings of Japan's big four brokers were downgraded yesterday by
Moody's Investors Service, the US ratings agency, which suggested their
already weak earnings will be put under further pressure by planned
financial deregulation.
The four houses, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and
Yamaichi Securities, had senior debt ratings lowered, with Yamaichi falling
from A3 to Baa2, due to Moody's belief that the company is likely to lose
market share in coming years.
None of the four brokers made a net profit in the first half to the end of
September, though Daiwa broke even, and it, Nomura and Nikko reported small
pre-tax profits. Yamaichi, the weakest of the leading brokers, reported a
pre-tax loss of Y19.3bn (Dollars 155.5m), and a net loss of Y15.8bn, as
stock turnover and prices continued a fall that began almost three years
ago.
Moody's said Nomura would 'remain the undisputed leader in the sector', but
that even it was heavily dependent on brokerage commissions for revenue, and
likely to suffer because of 'a secular change in the nature of stock trading
activity in Japan.
'Future growth in the securities business, such as underwriting of straight
bonds for Japanese companies, are likely to be arenas of tough competition
with the entry of banks' securities subsidiaries, thereby reducing Nomura's
market share,' Moody's said.
Similar comments were made about the other three houses, which were also
said to have 'a relatively inflexible cost base'. Moody's said the four
houses 'may be required to help closely related securities companies', as
smaller brokers, which have less diversified revenue sources, have been
harder hit by the market's collapse.
In announcing the downgradings, Moody's said the four leading companies had
'good liquidity and good capital', characteristics absent at some smaller
houses, which reported particularly embarrassing losses in the first half
and have announced restructuring programmes.
Losses for most houses are likely to be larger for the full year to
end-March as they deferred the write-off of mounting losses on their stock
portfolios. However, some houses have already responded to criticism that
they have failed to cut costs - Yamaichi plans to reduce management staff by
40 per cent - but even deeper cuts are likely in coming months.
Moody's lowered the senior debt rating at Nomura and Nomura Bank
International from A1 to Aa2, while Daiwa's rating was lowered from A3 to
A1. Nikko's senior rating was downgraded from A3 to A2, and there were
similar falls at a range of subsidiaries. The agency confirmed Nomura's
Prime-1 rating for commercial paper.

<TEXT>
ILLINOIS Tool Works, the US engineering group, yesterday emerged as a rival
bidder for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group for
which BBA, the UK component maker, has offered ADollars 86m (USDollars
58.8m).
WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool, said it had offered
ADollars 2 a share for Siddons, valuing the company at ADollars 94m.
Pacific BBA, an Australian subsidiary of BBA, offered ADollars 42m in cash
and shares worth ADollars 44m.
Siddons, which has rejected the BBA offer, did not respond to the
announcement by Deutsher.
Siddons is seeking an order from the federal court to force Pacific BBA to
increase the information in its offer document.
Siddons claims the document does not provide shareholders with sufficient
information to make an informed assessment of the true value of the share
element of the offer.
Mr Graham Johnston, Deutsher managing director, said that the Illinois Tool
offer was subject to 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders and approval by
the Foreign Investment Review Board, which monitors overseas investment.
Mr Johnston said Siddons was a leading customer of Deutsher, while Illinois
Tool Works was an importer of Siddons products.
He said Siddons would continue to operate separately if the bid succeeded.
Illinois Tool is a multinational manufacturer of engineering components and
systems.
The group's head office is in Illinois, but it operates in more than 35
countries and employs about 18,700 people.
It reported net profits of USDollars 180m in 1991, on revenues of USDollars
2.6bn.
Campbell Soup, the US foods group, said the Australian Securities Commission
had granted it an extension until December 11 to mail takeover documents to
shareholders of Arnotts, the Australian bakery group, Reuter reports from
Sydney.
The documents originally had to be in the hands of shareholders yesterday.
Campbell had sought the extension on Monday after it said it had disagreed
with the Arnotts board's interpretation of a 1985 heads of agreement between
the two companies.

provision for 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASARCO, the US mining and metals group, is to make a Dollars 122m after-tax
provision to its 1992 results. The group reported net earnings of Dollars
30.4m, or 74 cents a share ,for the nine months to September.
The provision will include Dollars 57m for the adoption of Financial
Accounting Standard Board Statement (FASB) 106 on accounting for
post-retirement benefits. Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said the company had
the option of spreading the liability over 20 years, but 'rather than
burdening future earnings with this charge, we prefer to put it behind us.'
There will also be a Dollars 43m addition to the provision for environmental
costs associated with historic operations. At the end of the third quarter,
Asarco's environmental reserve stood at Dollars 92m. Mr Osborne said that
recent developments had enabled Asarco to estimate requirements with more
certainty.
The company is also including a Dollars 22m charge for the write-off of
certain older facilities following completion of its expansion and
modernisation programme.
Asarco has also adopted FASB 109, 'accounting for income taxes,' which will
not require a charge to 1992 earnings but prior-year earnings will be
reduced and restated by Dollars 20m. Of that, Dollars 13m will be made to
1990 earnings and the balance to the years before.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: John Fairfax board comes under
attack from shareholders
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group, was heavily
criticised by shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday over plans for
share options and housing loans to directors.
Mr Conrad Black, deputy chairman, clashed with Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the
Sydney merchant banker who helped organise the acquisition of Fairfax by the
Tourang consortium led by Mr Black's UK Daily Telegraph group.
The shareholder unrest followed the withdrawal of proposals for a senior
executive share option scheme after criticism by the Australian Stock
Exchange and legal action by Mr Turnbull.
Mr Black said he was 'chastened' by the controversy surrounding the scheme,
which he said had been caused by 'technical errors' in the drafting of the
resolution.
However, shareholders also criticised a separate distribution of options to
a South African company to secure the appointment of Mr Stephen Mulholland
as chief executive and a proposed ADollars 1m (USDollars 714,000)
interest-free housing loan to Mr Michael Hoy, deputy chief executive.
Employee shareholders said the remuneration packages were 'particularly
offensive' against a background of cuts in staff numbers and reductions in
editorial budgets.
Mr Turnbull, who resigned from Tourang after a series of disputes with Mr
Daniel Colson, deputy chairman of the Telegraph group, received prolonged
applause after criticising the option schemes.
He said that directors had tried to keep shareholders 'in the dark' about
the 'excessively generous' options relating to the employment of Mr
Mulholland, which represented 'a very poor reflection on the business acumen
of the board.'
Mr Black said that he was mystified by the support for Mr Turnbull's attack
on the board, which had re-established Fairfax as a profitable company
following several years in which it had been 'humiliated, degraded and rent
asunder.'
He added that there was nothing 'reprehensible or shifty' about the board's
treatment of the options issue, and claimed the board's commercial judgment
would be borne out by results.
Mr Black also attacked a suggestion by Mr Turnbull that the Australian
members of the board had failed to restrain the Canadian and US directors
representing the Telegraph group and Hellman and Friedman, the US investment
bank.
'Your attempt to discriminate between the Australian and non-Australian
directors I find dishonourable and disgusting.
'For us to be treated in this way, harangued and discriminated against by
you, is absolutely outrageous,' he said.
A resolution approving the housing loan to Mr Hoy was heavily defeated on a
show of hands, but is likely to be approved in a ballot of shareholders.
The result will be announced tomorrow.
Sir Zelman Cowen, chairman, said Fairfax had operated at budget levels in
the first quarter of the current financial year. The group reported in
August that pre-tax profits for the year to June increased by 9.8 per cent
to ADollars 130m.
Fairfax was acquired by the Tourang consortium in December for ADollars
1.4bn.
The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial
Review and The Age in Melbourne.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) has raised objections to an agreement
between MCI Communications and Stentor, a consortium of Canadian telephone
service companies, to create the first integrated North American telephone
network.
AT&amp;T said it had asked the US Federal Communications Commission to
investigate if the agreement, announced in September, violated policy
against exclusive arrangements between US and foreign telephone companies.
MCI is the second-largest long-distance telephone service provider in the
US, after AT&amp;T. The Stentor consortium includes nine of Canada's telephone
companies, including Bell Canada.
AT&amp;T also said yesterday it had notified MCI and Stentor that their proposed
use of MCI's 'intelligent network' software in Canada could violate AT&amp;T
patents.
Stentor is to pay MCI a one-time fee of Dollars 150m for rights to use this
software as part of the alliance agreement. The US and Canadian groups also
agreed to develop further 'intelligent network' services.
AT&amp;T claims, however, that the MCI software violates patents covering
technology enabling services such as toll-free numbers, credit card
verification and those allowing businesses to create private telephone links
using public network lines.
The longstanding patent dispute between AT&amp;T and MCI has taken on a new
dimension with MCI's agreement with Stentor.
'We will not allow MCI to get a free ride on AT&amp;T's Dollars 3bn annual
investment in research and development,' said Ms Judith A. Maynes,
vice-president (law) for AT&amp;T.
MCI responded to AT&amp;T's assertions with a strongly-worded statement accusing
AT&amp;T of 'trying to restrain competition around the world.'
Commenting on AT&amp;T's patent infringement claims , MCI said that its
intelligent network technology is not 'reliant on any AT&amp;T hardware or
software'.

MALTA is making its first appearance in the international syndicated loan
markets. Enemalta Corporation, the 100 per cent state-owned monopoly which
manages the islands' energy requirements, is raising Dollars 100m over seven
years to complete its new Marsaxlokk power station.
Chemical Bank is co-ordinating a group of banks underwriting the loan, which
is guaranteed by the republic. The other underwriters are ABN Amro, Societe
Generale, Sumitomo Bank and WestLB.
The margin over Libor is 52.5 basis points and front-end fees range down
from 30 basis points for lead managers at Dollars 10m. Bankers note that,
while the basic yield is not over-generous at around 60 basis points, tax
receipts available to lenders against corporation tax liabilities could
double or treble the return.
The syndicate is expected to have a heavy European flavour, with a large
German contingent. Maltese borrowings are 100 per cent-weighted for capital
adequacy purposes, as it is outside the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
Malta's net foreign assets are around Dollars 1.5bn while its official
external debt is about Dollars 150m, excluding lease finance for flag
carrier Air Malta.

ILLINOIS Tool Works, the US engineering group, yesterday emerged as a rival
bidder for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group for
which BBA, the UK component maker, has offered ADollars 86m (USDollars
58.8m).
WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool, said it had offered
ADollars 2 a share for Siddons, valuing the company at ADollars 94m. Pacific
BBA, an Australian subsidiary of BBA, offered ADollars 42m in cash and
shares worth ADollars 44m.
Siddons, which has rejected the BBA offer, did not respond to the
announcement by Deutsher.
Siddons is seeking an order from the federal court to force Pacific BBA to
increase the information in its offer document.
Siddons claims the document does not provide shareholders with sufficient
information to make an informed assessment of the true value of the share
element of the offer.
Mr Graham Johnston, Deutsher managing director, said that the Illinois Tool
offer was subject to 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders and approval by
the Foreign Investment Review Board, which monitors overseas investment.

SUZUKI Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, yesterday reported an
11.5 per cent fall to Y9.35bn (Dollars 76m) in parent-company pre-tax
profits in the half-year to September.
The results, relatively robust compared with most Japanese vehicle makers,
were underpinned by a 2.7 per cent rise in sales to Y518.5bn. Exports of
motorcycles were particularly strong, with sales up by 32.6 per cent to
203,416 units.
Unlike many competitors, Suzuki reduced general administrative and sales
costs, from Y66.8bn to Y61.8bn. As a result, Suzuki's operating profits rose
by 43.4 per cent to Y13.79bn.
But the pre-tax figure was dragged down by a sharp deterioration in
non-operating costs, following an improvement last year. Non-operating costs
were Y4.49bn, against non-operating income last year of Y990m.
Sales of motorcycles rose by 14.3 per cent to Y88.8bn, while car sales
climbed by 1.2 per cent to Y367.4bn.
Although Suzuki's mini-car business was hit by a decline in Japan's mini-car
market, with sales off by 6.2 per cent to 235,634 units, sales of small cars
with engines under 2,000cc rose by 25.9 per cent to 29,147.
Total unit sales of motorcycles were up by 8.2 per cent to 203,416 units,
while car sales were down by 2.3 per cent to 403,057 units.
Net profits fell by 14.3 per cent to Y4.14bn.

The announcement has been heralded as the end of a period of consolidation

The merger - which had been under discussion for two years - would have
required changes to the law.
The banks said this seemed politically unlikely at the present time, after
the collapse of the insurance company Hafnia and the problems faced by other

Tryg and Nykredit said they would try to proceed with their own merger.

<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, suffered a 19
per cent slump in pre-tax profit in the third quarter to Dollars 183m as
recessionary conditions persisted in most of its key markets.
Pre-tax profits for the year, expected to be similar to last year's, are now
forecast to be 'somewhat below' last year's level.
Order intake was up only 10.4 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn in the quarter,
compared with an 18 per cent growth rate in the first half.
'In western Europe, there was an unexpected deterioration of demand in
recent months for investment goods,' the group said. The turmoil in
financial markets also provoked customers to delay projects.
The intake for large infrastructure projects, particularly for power plants,
remained strong, with Asian and Middle East markets showing good growth.
Earnings in the power plant division were up, but the environmental control
segment was hurt by weak demand in northern European construction markets.
Restructuring of European operations was being stepped up in preparation for
an increase in cross-border public procurement in Europe following the
introduction of the single market next year.
For the nine months, pre-tax profit was down 11 per cent to Dollars 679m on
revenues up 4 per cent to Dollars 21.09bn. The order backlog on September 30
was Dollars 33bn, 28 per cent higher than a year earlier.

<TEXT>
EAST Asiatic Company (EAC), Denmark's largest trading group, has announced
plans to sell 60 per cent of its Plumrose meat processing division to a
group of Danish companies led by Tulip International.
The disposal is part of an attempt by EAC to raise funds to pull itself out
of its present financial difficulties.
The group is also negotiating the sale of its US graphics division,
Heidelberg Eastern, to the German company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, which
has interests in the west of the US. EAC said it would concentrate its
future graphics business on Asia and Australia while maintaining investments
in Scandinavia and Africa.
The divestments follow the recent appointment of Mr Michael Fiorini, former
finance manager of the A. P. Moller group, as chief executive of the
heavily-indebted EAC.
In its half-year report, EAC forecast a loss of DKr425m (Dollars 68m) for
1992. However, analysts now expect this figure to be considerably larger.
The Plumrose deal involves 10 factories in the UK, Germany and the US with a
combined turnover of about DKr4bn. A letter of intent has been issued to
Tulip International, which is seeking backing from international investors.
It hopes to conclude the sale before Christmas.
Tulip International already has factories in Denmark, Germany and the UK as
well as growing exports to the US, and has itself been through an extensive
restructuring in the past two years. Its partners in the deal are slaughter
companies Danish Crown, Steffi-Houlberg and Tican. The merger would create
one of the largest forces in the international meat trade.
EAC is also streamlining its shipping division through the sale of a 60 per
cent stake in EACBen, its container service between Europe and the Far East,
to American President Lines. EAC's two newest container vessels are being
sold to the venture, which is capitalised at Dollars 120m.

RICHEMONT, the Swiss holding company for Rothmans international tobacco
businesses and the Cartier and Dunhill luxury goods companies, appears to be
faring better in the recession than some of its competitors in the luxury
goods sector.
The group's consolidated pre-tax profit fell 2.1 per cent to Pounds 279.4m
(Dollars 424.2m) in the six months to September 30 on sales up 1 per cent to
Pounds 1.5bn as a result of currency effects and reduced interest on its net
funds. Operating profits were up 2.1 per cent to Pounds 266.8m.
Mr Johann Rupert, managing director, said he was 'satisfied' with the
result, considering the depressed economic conditions in many of the group's
important markets.
Operating profit of the tobacco products was up 6.3 per cent to Pounds
191.5m, while that of luxury products was down 4.5 per cent to Pounds 76.7m.
Mr Rupert said the luxury products result was depressed by a change last
year in Cartier's reporting currency from US dollars to Swiss francs. Sales
and profits were up 4 per cent in Swiss franc terms but down 5.3 per cent
when converted into sterling.
Dunhill, which is heavily dependent on the depressed Japanese market,
nevertheless managed to raise its operating profit 6.3 per cent to Pounds
21.8m. Mr Rupert said this reflected the increasing contribution of Mont
Blanc, the luxury pen business which had become 'a major profit earner,' and
was established mainly in western markets. Also, the slack in Japan was
being taken up by strength in other far eastern markets.
'The luxury goods businesses are still holding up better than I expected,'
he observed, adding: 'The people who were in this business in the 1970s will
cope better in the 1990s than the people who started in the 1980s.'
He said adverse conditions were expected to continue for the remainder of
the fiscal year, but hinted that the result from other interests, which had
an operating loss of Pounds 3.6m in the first half, could improve. In
particular, the Horn &amp; Hardart mail order business in the US, which lost
Dollars 64m last year, was making profits. Richemont has a 62.5 per cent
stake in it.

FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Audi favours Hungary for engine
parts plant

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUDI, the executive car division of Germany's Volkswagen group, has chosen
Hungary over eastern Germany as the likely location for a large new engine
components plant.
Audi's supervisory board yesterday gave approval in principle for an
investment of DM320m (Dollars 200m) in Gyor in western Hungary to establish
the facility. The board said a final decision would be made after 'concrete
negotiations' between Audi and Hungarian authorities over the precise site
and other conditions.
Audi hopes to begin production of up to 220,000 engine cylinder heads a year
starting in mid-1994 with a workforce of 200.
Audi referred to the planned DM320m investment in engine component
production as 'a first stage'. There has been speculation that the company
could eventually move to full engine assembly at the site.
Audi said that Hungary won out against eastern Germany and Austria, the
other two competitors to host the plant, because of the 'cost advantages'.
Mercedes-Benz decided last month to suspend plans for a DM1.5bn truck plant
in eastern Germany because of costs and a more cautious assessment of growth
potential in the German truck market.
Mr Rudolf Bohn, state secretary at the economics ministry in the eastern
German state of Saxony-Anhalt, went further by conceding that lavish
subsidies offered to induce Audi to eastern Germany had not been sufficient
to make up for high wage levels.
Contemplation of a new plant outside Germany comes at a sensitive time for
Audi, which last week announced job cuts of up to 4,000, or 10 per cent of
its workforce.
The reduction in employment is likely to particularly affect the plant at
Ingolstadt in Bavaria, where Audi has previously concentrated engine and
cylinder head production.
The opening up of eastern Europe to investment has particularly highlighted
German all-in labour costs, which in carmaking are six to 10 times the
Hungarian level, for instance.
The decision to invest comes despite a sharp downturn in earnings at VW in
the third quarter and a profit warning for the last quarter of the year. On
the other hand, VW reported this week that output at Audi rose 13 per cent
in the third quarter compared with 9 per cent growth for the whole group.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Kwik Save up 9% as market share grows:
Sales rise to Pounds 2.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, Britain's largest discount grocery group, saw pre-tax profits
increase from Pounds 101.7m to Pounds 110.6m in the year to August 29 while
turnover moved ahead from Pounds 1.9bn to Pounds 2.5bn.
Sir Timothy Harford, chairman, said the company had achieved significant
market share gains against a difficult economic background. 'The market will
continue to be tough this year, but we will continue to make progress.'
He said that Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive since 1988, would leave in
June to become managing director of Dairy Farm International Holdings, the
Hong Kong-based company which owns 25 per cent of Kwik Save.
Mr Seabrook will be succeeded by Mr Graeme Bowler, managing director of
Franklins, an Australian discount food retailer owned by Dairy Farm.
The 8.8 rise in pre-tax profits was achieved in a 52-week year, though Kwik
Save used a 53-week accounting period the previous year. On a comparable
basis, the increase was 10.8 per cent.
Operating profits rose by 14.8 per cent from Pounds 98.5m to Pounds 113.1m
but the pre-tax result was after interest payments of Pounds 2.46m on
borrowings made to finance the acquisition of stores from Gateway. Kwik Save
received Pounds 3.21m in interest payments the previous year.
Trading margins fell from 4.7 per cent to 4.2 per cent. Kwik Save said the
decline was due entirely to expansion of its drinks and tobacco businesses,
which now accounted for 20 per cent of its sales and carried lower margins
than grocery retailing.
Underlying volume from like-for-like sales grew by 12 per cent, while new
stores contributed growth of 7.4 per cent and acquired stores added 5.1 per
cent.
A further 9.3 per cent came from Liquorsave, the discount drink and tobacco
business purchased from Argyll.
Kwik save said its market share rose from 7.8 per cent to 8.9 per cent
during the year and that it was now the third largest retailer of branded
package groceries after J Sainsbury and Tesco.
Turnover in the current quarter was 15 per cent ahead of last year.
Mr Seabrook expected discount stores to increase their share of the grocery
market from about 10 per cent to about 15 per cent in the medium-term.
The final dividend is 11.3p, bringing the total for the year to 16p, an
increase of 8.8 per cent, while earnings per share increased by 8.9 per cent
to 48.21p (44.26p).

MOVES TO oust the board of Harmony Leisure, the pubs and restaurants group,
appeared close to collapse yesterday after the company agreed to demands by
leading shareholders for board changes and an independent review of its
loss-making operations.
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, and Southend Property Holdings, which
together control almost 20 per cent of the share capital, have nominated two
senior officials to join the board.
Mr Martin Marcus, joint managing director of Queens Moat, and Mr John Main,
a director at Southend Property, will become non-executive directors.
Harmony will also allow Guiness Mahon, the merchant bank, to scrutinise its
trading performance and future prospects following accumulated losses of
Pounds 6.9m over the past three years.
Rebel shareholders seeking the removal of Mr Stanley Lever, the managing
director, welcomed the changes and said they would no longer press for the
appointment of new executive directors, which was due to be considered at an
extraordinary meeting today
Their decision signals a partial victory for the board and Mr Lever, who has
been fighting an increasingly bitter struggle for control of the company.
'The dissidents are just marauders involved in a wasted effort,' the company
said yesterday in its latest salvo against the rebels.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A spartan approach that beats the recession
 -The challenge facing Kwik Save to consolidate its recent rapid sales
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MOST British companies and their shareholders, hopes of any improvement
in profits depend heavily on when the recession ends. But the challenge
facing Kwik Save is to continue to prosper once better economic times
return.
During the past decade, the company has increased annual sales and pre-tax
profits four-fold by doggedly pursuing a 'no frills' formula of selling
branded grocery products at prices 5 to 10 per cent below those charged by
the bigger supermarket chains.
Central to its strategy have been tighter cost controls and modest capital
investments. While J Sainsbury and Tesco have been building out-of-town
superstores at about Pounds 25m each, Kwik Save has stuck mainly to smaller,
more spartan, high street sites costing no more than Pounds 1m a time.
Though the formula has given Kwik Save the highest return on capital in the
industry, its margins are barely half those of its larger rivals. However,
Mr Graeme Seabrook, Kwik Save's chief executive, has always insisted that
the key to rising profits lay not in bigger margins but in rapid sales
growth.
The economic downturn and the changing structure of the food retailing
industry have played into his hands.
The company claims that its customers are no longer confined to poorer
shoppers but include a growing number of more affluent households attracted
by Kwik Save's emphasis on the value of its products as much as their
absolute price.
Mr Seabrook says Kwik Save has also benefited from the growing polarisation
of the retailing industry, which has increased the pressure on weaker
middle-market chains such as Asda, Gateway and the Co-op. During the past
two years, Kwik Save's market share has risen from 6.5 per cent to 8.9 per
cent, largely at their expense.
The question is how successfully Kwik Save will be able to maintain the
rapid volume growth essential to its long-term development. Mr Seabrook
insists there is unexploited potential, pointing out that Kwik Save's sales
per square foot were still only half those of Sainsbury's.
However, the strategy faces challenges from two directions. First, the
growth of competing discounters, including Aldi of Germany and Netto of
Denmark, which have opened about 100 stores in Britain.
Kwik Save says its newer rivals have made little impact. However, it admits
that it has held them at bay by offering extra deep discounts and
introducing cheaper 'secondary' brands in stores which faced direct
competition.
The second challenge is to retain the customers it has picked up in the last
few years. It is still unclear how far these gains are permanent and stem,
as Kwik Save claims, from a lasting consumer attachment to value, or whether
they are due to temporary bargain-hunting induced by the recession.
The company's response has been to try to define a distinctive image, which
differentiates it clearly from both the discounters and from the bigger
supermarket chains.
To counter the threat of discounters such as Aldi, which sell a limited
number of items in warehouse surroundings, Kwik Save has cautiously expanded
its product range and is investing in improved displays and computerised
check-outs. It is also building larger edge-of-town stores, though some of
the floor space is let out to other retailers.
To differentiate itself from Sainsbury and Tesco, it has stepped up
advertising - particularly posters and illuminated displays - which stress
its price advantage and 'no frills' approach.
It is a marketing strategy which requires a careful balance. How well it
succeeds is unlikely to become clear until well after the recession.

per cent from Pounds 8.17m to Pounds 10.5m in the six months to September
30, reflecting the acquisition of two companies last year and a continued
strong performance from the US.
The group also officially announced its intention to take on the European
lingerie market, by exercising its option to buy Aznar Industriel, the
Spanish underwear company.
Hartstone will pay Pounds 9m in cash and shares for the group, which was
linked to the hosiery manufacturer, Aznar, acquired last year.
Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, stressed the organic growth achieved in the
half year, with like-for-like leather goods sales up by 14 per cent in the
US and 7 per cent in Europe. In hosiery, the overall comparable advance was
just 1 per cent.
Group sales overall expanded to Pounds 162m (Pounds 92.8m).
Hartstone, which suffered a sharp decline in its share price over the
summer, came under some scrutiny earlier this year as a result of its
acquisitive nature.
'All we have done to the businesses since acquiring them is improve them,'
Mr Barker said yesterday. 'We will just plod on and prove to everyone that
we have a group where growth can be sustained.'
The interim dividend is raised by nearly 50 per cent to 2.8p (1.875p)
'reflecting our confidence in the future,' Mr Barker said. The shares closed
1p up at 197p.
The hosiery division benefited by Pounds 3m at the operating level due to
the inclusion of Cogetex in France and Aznar. This represented the bulk of
the operating profit improvement from Pounds 829,000 to Pounds 4.5m, with
trading in the UK continuing to be difficult.
Leather goods increased operating profits to Pounds 9.28m (Pounds 8.47m).
Most of that was earned in the US, where Hartstone had seen definite signs
of an increase in confidence. However, Mr Barker stressed that it was not
yet clear 'whether that is short-term, as it was in the UK following the
Tory victory.'
Interest charges rose from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 3.3m. Debt of about Pounds
67m left gearing higher than last year at about 80 per cent. This was due
partly to seasonal factors, with most hosiery sales in the second half.
Hartstone expected year-end gearing to be less than 1991's 51 per cent.
Earnings were depressed by the 28m shares issued to purchase Aznar and
Cogetex in December. They fell from 7.7p to 6.7p.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reduction in bad debts provides boost at
Marston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARSTON, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent brewer, increased interim
profits by 44 per cent to Pounds 10.1m, helped by a reduction of Pounds
2.47m in exceptional charges.
At the same stage last year a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m was achieved after
a Pounds 2.3m provision for bad debts. This time there was no such charge.
Trading profit for the six months to September 26 rose 5 per cent to Pounds
10.4m (Pounds 9.89m) on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 63.2m (Pounds
58.1m).
Interest charges fell from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 180,000.
Earnings per share expanded to 7.7p (5.27p) and the interim dividend is
increased to 1.45p (1.34p).
Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said the results were 'grounds for cautious
optimism.' But he added: 'The market is a tough one, characterised by
reticence on the part of consumers and aggression on the part of
competitors.'
Overall beer sales volume increased marginally, against a 1 per cent fall in
the market. Marketing expenditure was doubled. Pedigree draught and Low C
packaged beer gained from reciprocal distribution deals with several
national and regional brewers.
Sales through Marston's 671 tenanted pubs fell but there was a 29 per cent
increase in both liquor and food sales in the 185 managed houses. Most of
the Pounds 7m capital expenditure during the six months was on
refurbishments.
Net borrowings amounted to Pounds 15.5m, 6.9 per cent of shareholders'
funds.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reduced loss at Waverley Mining
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Waverley Mining Finance, the Edinburgh-based investment company, reported a
loss of Pounds 58,639 before and after tax for the six months to September
30.
The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 107,267 at the same stage
of 1991, came on gross income ahead from Pounds 38,243 to Pounds 50,334.
Losses per share came out at 0.5p (0.9p).
The net asset value per share declined from 25.2p in March to 21.9p at
end-September reflecting, the company said, a varied performance within the
smaller company sector and the weakness of the Australian and Canadian
currencies. However, the fall in sterling since the period-end had seen the
value improve to 24.8p.

Chester Waterworks Company, the statutory water company which acts as agent
for the Welsh Water Authority and the North West Water Authority, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04m for the six months to September 30.
The company has changed its year end, and for the 15-month period ended
March 31 profits were Pounds 2.45m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 2.86m
(Pounds 6.58m).
Mr Joseph Musgrave, the chairman, said the results were being published in
anticipation of proposed changes in the company's constitution, including
re-registration as a plc.
Pro forma earnings per share were 283p (655p) and the dividend 2.1p, the
maximum statutory rate. An interim dividend of 75p is forecast, subject to
the removal of the statutory restrictions in the new year.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Embassy Property cuts loss to Pounds 1.45m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant reduction in losses in its property development and
residential divisions helped Embassy Property Group cut its pre-tax deficit
by Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 1.45m in the six months to September 30.
The divisions were free of the Pounds 3.75m provisions carried in 1991-92
against the value of work in progress and investment properties.
Overall sales of the USM-quoted group in the first half came to Pounds 5.91m
(Pounds 6.33m). The input from property development and trading fell to
Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 778,000). But residential development raised its
share to Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 1.38m).
Losses from the two areas fell to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 1.32m) and Pounds
198,000 (Pounds 536,000) respectively.
Overhead and interest costs contracted to Pounds 351,000 (Pounds 416,000)
helped by the debt restructuring in September.
An extraordinary credit of Pounds 5.46m reflected completion of the
refinancing and connected share placing. The directors said the rights issue
was not reflected as the closing date was October 5.
This left a retained profit of Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 2m loss). On a much
increased capital base there was a loss per share of 9.9p (26.1p).

Earnings rose to 2.75p (2.48p) and the interim dividend is increased to

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML HOLDINGS, the defence and aerospace group, passed its interim dividend
after reporting a Pounds 1.48m pre-tax loss for the six months to September
30, against a Pounds 1.31m deficit last time.
Before interest and exceptional items, trading profits amounted to Pounds
988,000 (Pounds 2.04m). An exceptional provision of Pounds 1.06m related to
the settlement of a long running legal action connected with a hovercraft
supply contract.
Losses per share worked through at 3p (2.6p). An interim dividend of 0.85p
was paid in 1991.
Sales totalled Pounds 40.2m, a marginal gain on the previous Pounds 40.1m,
after adjusting for disposals and inflation.
The company said it had continued to suffer from three fundamental and
related problems: the impact of recession on margins, inadequate contract
management and control leading to losses and claims, and a high level of
borrowings.
Although the effect of recession on the group's defence and aerospace
businesses had been anticipated, it acknowledged that a cost reduction
programme had not been implemented early enough nor with sufficient vigour.
To resolve this situation, the company said improved financial controls had
been imposed on all subsidiaries.
The company also confirmed it was refocusing around its core defence and
aerospace businesses. It planned to shed non-core assets when it could
obtain realistic prices for these operations.
The group recently won a contract to supply the US Air Force with up to 113
of its Slingsby Firefly trainer aircraft worth about Dollars 50m (Pounds
33m).

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rothmans Intl flat at Pounds 266m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHMANS International, the cigarette and luxury goods group which is
controlled by Richemont, the Swiss holding company, yesterday reported flat
pre-tax profits, held back by lower interest rates on its investments.
Interim pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds
266m to Pounds 266.5m on sales 2 per cent up at Pounds 1.2bn. Net investment
income fell 35 per cent to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 33.1m).
Earnings per share rose to 20.9p (20p) and the interim dividend is increased
by 7 per cent to 4p (3.75p).
Lord Swaythling, chairman, said that because so much of the group's profits
were made abroad, it was almost paying out as much as it could in dividends
without running into an ACT problem.
At the operating level, Rothmans increased tobacco profits, from Pounds 180m
to Pounds 192m, despite a lower volume of cigarette sales. Sales increased
in eastern Europe, particularly to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
In the UK sales of Royals King Size 25's were strong.
These increases were offset by lower sales in Australia, because of what
Lord Swaythling called swingeing tax increases and a price war. Sales also
fell in Germany, because there were too many manufacturers, and in Indonesia
and the Philippines, where Lord Swaythling said it was tough to achieve
meaningful market share.
The operating profit was after a Pounds 9.2m exceptional charge covering
rationalisation of the Australian and Philippine operations and stock
write-downs of Pounds 3.9m in the Philippines and Indonesia.
Luxury products lifted their contribution at the operating level to Pounds
21.8m (Pounds 20.5m).
Translation of overseas company profits hit the pre-tax result to the tune
of Pounds 5m.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Associates help Caledonia to Pounds 19.3m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALEDONIA Investments, in which the Cayzer family holds a 48 per cent stake,
increased pre-tax profits by 11 per cent in the half year to September 30 on
the back of strong performances from associate companies.
Group profits rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 17.4m) reflecting the increase in
operating profits from trading activities to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 1.6m).
This included first time contributions from the group's 27.3 per cent stake
in Exco International and 45 per cent stake in Bristow Helicopter Group.
The two companies used to be part of British and Commonwealth Holdings,
which Caledonia once effectively controlled before the financial services
group collapsed more than two years ago.
Income from investments fell from Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 9.5m) because there
was no longer any contribution from the holding of British and Commonwealth
preference shares. The last instalment was repaid under the bank guarantee
arrangements on April 3.
Interest receivable declined to Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.7m) because of lower UK
interest rates. The group has net cash of some Pounds 140m.
Earnings per share increased to 14p (12.4p). The interim dividend is 5p
(4.8p).
Sterling Industries, in which Caledonia has a 21 per cent stake, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.59m), after an exceptional gain of
Pounds 238,000, on increased sales of Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.8m).
Earnings per share improved to 4.37p (3.75p); the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.5p.
Amber Industrial Holdings raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds
1.47m in the half-year to September 30.
The speciality chemicals company is 75 per cent-owned by Caledonia.
Sales rose 26 per cent to Pounds 9.48m. The interim dividend is raised by 1p
to 5.5p on earnings per share of 20p (16.8p).

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sale closer as potential TVS bidder
withdraws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of TVS Entertainment, the south of England company which lost its
franchise, to International Family Entertainment came a step closer
yesterday when a second potential US bidder decided to withdraw.
Broadway Video, a television production company, had asked for information
about TVS while the offer document for the sale to IFE was being produced.
Broadway has now said that it is not interested in making a bid for TVS,
whose assets include MTN, the US production company behind such shows as Lou
Grant and Hill Street Blues.
TVS said yesterday it had received no other approaches which would lead to
an alternative offer.
IFE, the company behind the successful Family Channel in the US, has made a
share offer worth about Pounds 45.3m, with a cash alternative of some Pounds
36m.
Many preference shareholders are still unhappy about the deal and Mr Julian
Treger of Restructuring Advisers, who speaks for a number of them said
yesterday he believed there would be enough opposition to block the sale.
Mr Treger said he believed the TVS assets should continue to be managed and
it was wrong to sell at this depressed stage of the cycle.
Mr James Gatward, former chief executive of TVS, yesterday expressed concern
that the most up-to-date information might not be available to shareholders
before the December 15 closing date for the offer.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tate sweetened by market growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, said yesterday that the world sugar
market was growing at 2 per cent a year, while the starch market was growing
at 6 per cent a year. The growth in sugar consumption was equivalent to a
new market the size of the UK opening each year.
He said this gave the group plenty of opportunities to grow. During the year
to the end of September, it recorded Pounds 172m of capital expenditure, up
from a normal level of Pounds 100m to Pounds 115m, while another Pounds 61m
was invested in buying companies or setting up joint ventures, such as in
Hungary and Slovenia. This included a Pounds 9m investment in a venture
owned by a consortium of food processors which would look at opportunities
in eastern Europe and Russia.
This, a higher dividend, and the expectation of a bounce back in profits,
lifted the share price 12p to 368p yesterday despite a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 230.8m to Pounds 189.5m. The previous year's figures
were restated for a change in accounting for post-retirement benefits which
cost Pounds 3.8m in 1990-91 and Pounds 4.3m in 1991-92.
Profits were hit by Pounds 15.7m of reorganisation and redundancy costs, up
from Pounds 6m, and a Pounds 7.1m write-off of start-up costs and stock
write-downs related to sucralose, the group's new low-calorie sweetener
which is awaiting approval from the US authorities.
However, there were non-recurring gains including a Pounds 3.3m write-back
of a provision no longer required, and a Pounds 11.7m refund, including
interest, of US tax.
At the pre-interest level profits fell from Pounds 280.5m to Pounds 237.4m.
Within that the Canadian sugar division saw profits down to Pounds 8.7m
(Pounds 10.1m), and in the US to Pounds 30.9m (49.3m).
In the UK sugar profits rose to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds 49.9m), in Portugal to
Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 9.5m) and in Australia to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 3.3m).
The group's sugar business in other areas made Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.4m).
In cereal sweeteners and starches, North American profits fell to Pounds
65.3m (Pounds 96.8m), but in Europe profits were up from Pounds 51.1m to
Pounds 54m. Sugar by-products, such as animal feeds, increased to Pounds
20.1m (Pounds 17.5m).
Other activities such as reinsurance which was hit by Hurricane Andrew, lost
Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 9.4m loss).
Movements in exchange rates cost Pounds 3.6m off pre-interest profits. But
this is expected to swing the other way in the current year with every 1
cent movement in the sterling/dollar rate worth Pounds 600,000 to Pounds
700,000 to profits.
The balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 641.9m at the year end, gearing of
89 per cent, up from 81 per cent a year earlier.
However, Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said the group borrowed at fine
rates of interest and most of the debt had a five to 10 year maturity. The
1992-93 financial year should see gearing fall, he said.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Institutions unhappy with Sugar's offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE A marathon four-hour annual meeting Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's
chairman and founder, appears to have failed to swing institution-al
investors firmly behind his 30p-a-share buy-out proposal.
Mr Sugar has a personal 35 per cent stake in Amstrad, but needs to muster
three-quarters of the shares he does not own in order to proceed with his
Pounds 113m plan to take Amstrad private again.
The support of a group of institutional investors, each with less than a 3
per cent stake but which together control about a quarter of Amstrad's
issued share capital, is therefore crucial, particularly given the hostility
of some of the individual invest-ors.
Mr Keith Gilham, associate director of Equity and Law, said yesterday that
it had not finally decided what to do. However, he added, 'it's a very
unsatisfactory offer and I don't want to prejudice our chances, but we feel
it is unlikely that we can extract more than the 30p being offered. We are
more or less resigned to accepting the offer.' Another institutional
investor said, 'we don't find what's being proposed attractive.'
Institutional investors said they remained uncomfortable that there was no
independent valuation and no financial forecasts for Amstrad, and felt there
was nothing except Mr Sugar's own word to go on. 'We're being taken out at
the bottom of the cycle and I just don't know what the value is,' Mr Gilham
said.
However he, like other institutional investors, expressed the hope that the
pressure on Mr Sugar might force him to make concessions.
Although the institutions felt that the Amstrad chairman had won the first
round, they noted that there were probably a few more rounds to come before
the extraordinary meeting in two weeks time votes on Mr Sugar's proposals.
If the pressure is kept up on Mr Sugar, 'it will be in our interest to join
those who feel we can get more,' said Mr Gilham.

MR ROBERT Lasagne, chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's Italian operation,
is to take up a new post as deputy chairman for Europe.
Mr Lasagne said the post will be one of co-ordinating the advertising
group's growing European operations.
'I will be responsible for the south of Europe,' he said. 'It is a
strengthening of the overall European company.'
Mr Lasagne helped form an advertising agency in Italy in 1979 after setting
up an Italian operation for Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the US-based advertising group,
10 years earlier. In 1986, his company, MVL, merged with Saatchi.
Mr Lasagne will remain chairman of Saatchi's Italian operation. He will
report to Mr Bill Muirhead, chairman for Europe, who will concentrate on the
north of Europe.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tony O'Reilly lifts his stake in Arcon to
23%

MR TONY O'Reilly, chairman of the Heinz food group, has increased his
personal stake in Arcon, an Irish exploration company, by 1.4m shares to 13m
shares, equivalent to 23 per cent of the ordinary capital. The deal was done
through Colombia Investments, Mr O'Reilly's holding company.
Together with parties he is deemed to be acting in concert with, he now
controls 29.99 per cent of the company, the maximum permissible without
being obliged to mount a formal takeover bid.
Arcon, formerly Conroy Petroleum, has discovered a 6.2m zinc/lead ore
deposit at Galmoy in Ireland, which, once developed, is anticipated to be
one of the lowest-cost zinc mines in the world. Over the past year it has
been the subject of a bitter boardroom battle between Mr Richard Conroy, the
chairman, and Outokumpu, a 22 per cent shareholder.
Mr O'Reilly was seen as a white knight by Mr Conroy, when the former first
took a 5 per cent stake through a IPounds 7.7m share-swap offer for Mr
O'Reilly's ailing Atlantic Resources exploration company. Mr Conroy believed
Outokumpu was planning a takeover and wanted 100 per cent control of the ore
marketing.
The move cost Mr Conroy his place on the board last February, but he was
reinstated a month later when Mr O'Reilly took a further 16.3 per cent.
Mr O'Reilly is estimated to have spent some IPounds 10m to date in building
his holding in Arcon.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Mid Kent shows marginal advance to Pounds
4.28m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN

<TEXT>
MID KENT Holdings, the water supply company, increased pre-tax profits from
Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 4.28m in the half-year to September 30.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 3.99m (Pounds 3.78m) on turnover 6.6 per
cent higher at Pounds 15.6m.
Mr Robert Atwood, finance director, said the results reflected the fall in
Mid Kent's K number - the rate at which it is allowed to increase prices
above the rate of inflation - to 2.5 per cent in 1992-93, against 9 per cent
last year.
Mr Atwood said the severity of the drought and the recession in the
south-east were key issues in the group's relations with Ofwat, the industry
watchdog.
Mid Kent planned at least Pounds 15m in capital spending this year, mostly
on the enlargement of its treatment plant, meeting quality requirements,
opening up new water reserves and a pilot metering scheme.
The limits of a water company's immunity from the recession were amply
demonstrated by the group's experience of the past six months. Water levels
were low, and although a hose pipe ban was lifted last month, customers were
warned it would be re-imposed in the spring. There had been few new
connections with the dearth of new housebuilding, and it faced a mounting
bad debt problem with a programme of 1,000 disconnections under way.
Mr Atwood added that while the group had the organisational framework in
place to meet the demands of 'the post privatisation regime', further
streamlining would be necessary. 'Water companies, without exception, have
to examine their staff numbers critically.'
The interim dividend is 4.75p (4.5p), payable from earnings per share of
19.3p (19.1p).

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reuters TV born from Visnews
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters is changing the name of its Visnews television subsidiary to Reuters
Television following its recent purchase of 100 per cent of Visnews shares.
Mr Mark Wood, Reuters' editor-in-chief, said the name change would be phased
in by the end of the year.
The change reflected the rapid integration of Visnews into the Reuters
organisation. Visnews subsidiary, BrightStar which operates a satellite
communications business, will retain its existing name. and Visnews
Corporate Video, will also retain their present names.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ABI Leisure ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of ABI Leisure Group, the caravan manufacturer, improved from Pounds
2.07m to Pounds 2.31m pre-tax for the year to end-August 1992.
The 11 per cent advance came from turnover Pounds 3.9m ahead at Pounds
56.2m.
However, with difficult trading conditions continuing it was felt prudent to
trim the final dividend to 2.19p making a 3.76p (4.7p) total.
Earnings per share were little changed at 5.8p (5.7p).
Directors said stocks had been reduced by 9.5 per cent and that full time
working would resume in December.
They added that the 'benefits of our involvement in five major markets is
clearly reflected in current trading'.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cut-price Midas who lost his touch - How
his price-over-quality ethos eventually backfired on Gerald Ratner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN with the Midas touch, they called him. But that was in the 1980s,
when every retailer on the high street appeared capable of turning whatever
they touched into gold. In Mr Gerald Ratner's case it was nine-carat gold.
But as the colder winds of the late 1980s blew down Britain's high streets,
the decade's retail stars began to fall one by one from the firmament.
For some time Mr Ratner, 43, stood alone as a 1980s retailer still in charge
of his company. Some thought he could survive while the others failed.
But yesterday he resigned from the group which his father founded, where he
spent his entire 26-year working life, and which he has run since 1984.
Mr Ratner, a man of slight build and medium height, an engaging charm and a
wicked wit, a tasteful dresser who confines his visible trinkets to an
expensive watch, was an unlikely character to be the man who transformed
jewellery retailing in the UK.
When he took control of the family business in 1984, it was making a Pounds
1m profit.
In those days jewellery shops were intimidating places, visited only for
those occasional purchases, an engagement or wedding ring, a gold watch.
The sales assistants were to be approached with hushed voices, and there was
a belief that the goods were not only for adornment but an investment.
Mr Ratner turned that upside-down. Within months of taking charge, the
Financial Times was quoting the new managing director saying: 'The new
merchanting and marketing strategies introduced in the second half of last
year have benefited the trading performance significantly in the current
year.' Sales were up by a quarter.
That was only the start. His aim was to sell people the jewellery they could
afford rather than the quality they could not. The price of a pair of
ear-rings came down from several pounds to a couple of pounds until they
reached 99p - the price, Mr Ratner once quipped, of a Marks and Spencer
prawn sandwich.
Plastering the shops with stickers proclaiming price cuts, cutting the
volume of gold in the jewellery, tightening up the supply chain and stock
control, and increasing the fashion element of the merchandise began to
attract more customers.
But at the same time it was permanently devaluing the company's products.
His now famous 'crap' remark was not new when he made it in April 1991.
It was first said in 1987, in reference to a sherry decanter and glasses
set, then retailing for Pounds 14.95. 'How can you sell it so cheaply?' he
was asked. 'Because it's crap.' His dismay when the remark appeared in the
Financial Times turned to delight when he discovered that people liked the
joke.
His nervousness in making public speeches meant he liked to work up a
reliable act. The crap joke became one of the highlights.
Mr Ratners' behaviour was angering others in the jewellery trade. As his
market share grew other retailers suffered.
His suppliers were angry too. Ratners would buy on a sale or return basis,
so unsold stock would be dumped back on them.
Mr Ratner, and his cousin Mr Victor Ratner who was in charge of buying, once
explained: 'We persuaded suppliers it was better for them as well as us to
have their faster selling lines in our windows'.
Profits flourished, reaching a peak of Pounds 130m in 1990. And Mr Ratner
could not resist talking about his success. Anyone who rang him to ask how
trading was going would receive an earful of numbers - sales in
like-for-like H Samuel stores were up 20 per cent last week, and Ratners up
26 per cent, he might say.
There was always a niggling thought that these figures were being plucked
from mid-air. But who cared - people wanted to believe him. And he always
came up with the goods in the form of rising profits.
Mr Ratner's other weakness was doing deals. He simply could not pass up a
bargain in the jewellery trade. He once achieved a notable double, launching
a rights issue to acquire a US chain before a previous equity issue to
finance a UK purchase had been completed.
Every deal was to be the last, but they kept coming. H Samuel, Ernest Jones,
Zales and Salisbury's in the UK, and Sterling and Kay in the US, plus many
more smaller ones.
At first there was a huge appetite from shareholders for more paper, and the
deals were financed through equity issues. But eventually that appetite was
sated. Ratners turned to borrowing.
All these things came together in 1990 and 1991. The Kay acquisition in 1990
was hard fought, and Ratner was persuaded to pay more than he should have -
he could not walk away from the deal.
As the high street recession deepened in 1990, his suppliers were to find a
large part of the Christmas stock returned to them - they would not be
prepared to suffer that again in the 1991 season.
And finally his comic turn, performed to the Institute of Directors at what
he thought was a private meeting in April 1991, led to headlines including
the words 'Ratners' and 'crap' in the tabloid press, the papers his
customers read.
The 99p ear-ring buyers were not amused. They felt deceived. A formal
apology from Mr Ratner did little to stop the downturn in sales.
By Christmas 1991 sales were falling badly. Yet more price cuts failed to
enliven them and in January this year - with the group's net debt at Pounds
223m and shareholders' funds of Pounds 303m - the talks with the bankers
began.
A new executive chairman was brought in over his head, his cousin resigned
and one of his longest serving directors retired.
Mr Ratner, a much subdued man, clung on. He saw through the publication of a
Pounds 122.3m pre-tax loss in August.
He announced a change in strategy - 'we cannot carry on being a sales-led
organisation.' He survived an angry annual meeting in September.
But with the Christmas season approaching, with Ratners' very future at
stake, he could stay no longer.

FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: North West Water ahead 5.7% to Pounds 130m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST CUTTING and price rises helped North West Water, the Warrington-based
water and sewerage company, lift interim profits by 5.7 per cent.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 123.7m to Pounds 130.7m in the six
months to September 30. Mr Bob Thian, chief executive, said full year growth
would continue at a similar rate. 'This was a good, safe performance,' he
said.
Turnover increased 13.1 per cent to Pounds 421.7m helped by average price
rises of 9.3 per cent in the company's 'core' regulated business and by
acquisitions. Turnover from measured water usage, which covers businesses
and new homes, also increased 13.1 per cent, suggesting the company
continued to weather recession well.
Operating costs were held back to a 10.7 per cent increase to Pounds 261.6m
while restructuring costs were similar at Pounds 12m (Pounds 12.4m).
The company's headcount has fallen by more than 700 people in the last year
to just over 8,000, leading to a 10 per cent fall in labour costs.
Interest costs increased sharply from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 18.6m as
investment programmes and acquisitions pushed net borrowings up from Pounds
146m to Pounds 388m.
Gearing rose from 17 per cent at the year end to 21.6 per cent and is
expected to rise to about 25 per cent this year.
Depreciation increased to Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 21.5m) and capital
investment, which last year totalled Pounds 512m, is expected to be higher
this time.
The tax charge increased from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 9.6m. North West's tax
bill was incurred on irrecoverable ACT and overseas tax.
Among non-core businesses, the process engineering division increased
turnover 40 per cent to Pounds 75.8m while operating profits were 64 per
cent higher at Pounds 5.9m. Most of the increase was due to acquisitions
made last year which inclu- ded Wallace &amp; Tiernan in the US.
Mr Thian said the division faced recession in its markets but remained an
important part of group strategy.
North West is the only water and sewage company to have resisted calls from
Ofwat, the water regulator, to limit price increases next year. The company
complained it could not afford the price cuts because it has an extra Pounds
430m of spending, mainly to improve coastlines and the Mersey estuary, to
carry out in the next two years.
Ofwat is expected to rule on the matter in December. Mr Thian said relations
between the company and the regulator remained good.
Earnings increased 4.6 per cent to 34p and the interim dividend is raised 9
per cent to 7.13p.
