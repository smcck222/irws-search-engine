FT  14 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Taxing policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I recently surrendered a single premium policy held in our joint
names. The difference between the premium and the surrender value is several
thousand pounds. Will my wife's half affect her over-65 age allowance?
Without her half of the profits her income does not exceed her personal
allowance limit for the age allowance. Therefore, although she would not be
liable to pay tax on her half of the profit directly, would she indirectly
have to pay tax on whatever position exceeds the age allowance limit?
Yes: the whole of your wife's share of the chargeable gain is taken into
account in calculating her age-allowance clawback, so there may be an
effective 12 1/2 per cent tax charge.
You will be eligible for top-slicing relief in calculating any 15 per cent
higher rate liability, but there is no top-slicing for age allowance
clawback.
If you provided the funds to pay the premium, it may be that section
547(1)(a) or section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
requires the whole of the chargeable gain to be treated as your own income.
An incorrect version of the above question appeared in the issue of October
31. We apologise for the error.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Expatriate's lump sum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE a question about the taxation of the lump sum paid to expatriates on
retirement.
I remained abroad on retirement on July 31 1991. My employer, a UK company,
paid my lump sum after deducting income tax - as, it seems, it was required
to do by law. Does this mean that I may expect to obtain a refund of the
tax?
Tax deducted by UK companies when making lump sum termination or commutation
payments are recoverable by the employee only to the extent that he can
show, by reference to Section 188 of the Taxes Act, that the true liability
is less.
There are de facto advantages which are sometimes gained when such payments
are made to British employees of foreign companies overseas. Although there
may be a liability under the legislation, the foreign company, being beyond
the reach of British jurisdiction, cannot be required either to deduct tax
or to declare the fact of the payment to the Inland Revenue which will,
therefore, be unaware of it. The liability cannot be enforced against the
individual either if he remains overseas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue has recently insisted that when losses have been created
in a previous year and carried forward to the following year, any profits
earned in that following year must be deducted from the losses. However, it
was my understanding that the limit, presently Pounds 5,800, was available
for use before gains should be deducted from losses. Am I right?
We suggest that you write to the District Inspector at your tax office
(marking both the letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the District
Inspector'), asking him or her to draw section 3(5) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (formerly section 5(4) of the Capital Gains Tax
Act 1979) to the attention of the officer who signed the recent letter to
you about old years' losses.
The law says:
a) where the amount of chargeable gains less allowable losses accruing to an
individual in any year of assessment does not exceed the exempt amount for
the year, no deduction from that amount shall be made for that year in
respect of allowable losses carried forward from a previous year . . . shall
not be greater than the excess.
You could ask the District Inspector also to check other cases handled by
the officer concerned, in accordance with the Taxpayer's Charter, to make
sure that nobody else had had allowable losses wrongfully restricted.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Still cautious over Clinton - Diary
of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S US presidential election result did not come as much of a
surprise to me. Last December, after a brief visit to New York and talking
with some 'average' Americans, I commented in an FT article: 'President Bush
appears to be more popular in Britain than at home,' and 'the Democrats
might win.'
However, I also mentioned that the Republicans could win if President Bush
stood down 'in favour of someone thought more likely by the voters to tackle
the problems of the economy and the country's rapidly decaying
infrastructure and educational system. This might result in a more
protectionist president which would have consequences for exporters in the
UK and elsewhere.'
It was these same domestic issues which resulted in a win for Bill Clinton.
It also appears likely that the US will adopt an increasingly protectionist
position in order to lower its unemployment rate, reduce foreign debt and
try to improve the economy and the average US citizen's standard of living.
It has been said that Bill Clinton and his supporters are 'a new type of
Democrat.' In my view, they are almost Republican. This could well be good
for America, but for other nations this could produce problems.
As a private investor, I am seeking ways of avoiding losses and trying to
make profits as a result of Bill Clinton and his team.
It is likely to be more difficult for non-US companies to take over American
firms. This could hit companies such as Hanson, unless it decided to split
itself into two and float off the US side as a separate US quoted company.
Reduced takeover activity could also affect the profits of merchant banks.
During the campaign there were allegations that non-US companies were not
paying their fair share of corporate taxes on their US activities. It could
be that some UK companies will be affected if the US tightens tax
regulations.
However, it is to be hoped the UK will not negotiate on such matters via the
EC bureaucracy but will come to an improved individual agreement with the
US. The UK could point out that US companies' activities in the UK gain
significant benefits from the UK's corporate taxation system - benefits
which are much better than can be obtained from many other countries.
In order to protect jobs in the US, Bill Clinton could well initiate 'buy
US' fiscal encouragements and provide extra incentives for US exporters.
This means that UK companies like Rolls Royce will not only face increasing
competition in the US market but also extra competition in other overseas
markets form incentivised US companies. Other UK companies, such as British
Airways, could also suffer.
Bill Clinton has said that the defence expenditure will be cut. This will
not help companies like British Aerospace which will face much greater
competition in overseas markets with those markets also showing a decline in
growth.
However, not everything is negative. The new administration will provide
extra opportunities for well-run UK companies which can market themselves
effectively in the US. For example, there are plans for an overhaul of the
health care service in the US to ensure universal coverage and value for
money. Perhaps UK companies operating within the National Health Service
could sell some of their expertise in the US.
The US education system is overdue for a shake-up. More money is likely to
be spent on education and US businesses will be required to increase their
training programmes. This should mean more money spent on schoolbooks and
training manuals and this could lead to increased opportunities for UK
publishers.
The new vice president, Al Gore, is a committed environmentalist. I think
this could have important implications for oil companies and, eventually,
there might be a new levy on petrol and increased import duties on oil from
overseas. However, there will also be opportunities for companies involved
in creating 'environmentally friendly' products and new techniques for
disposing of various waste material safely and efficiently.
As to the US stock market, I feel it is still too high. The average price
earnings ratio of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 Share Index is now around a
similar level to that seen just before the 1987 crash.
With increasing unrest in Russia, what would happen if president Yeltsin was
'removed' next month? Bill Clinton will not be inaugurated as president
until January 20. Until that time, any US response would have to come from
president Bush: how quickly could Bush and Clinton agree on a joint
response? It is this 'hiatus' period that most concerns me. It would be the
ideal time for unrest in trouble spots around the world.
A number of US banks look as if they will go the same way as many of the
savings and loan institutions: into administration. And is not now the best
time for a cathartic upheaval in the financial markets so that both the
outgoing and incoming presidents can disclaim responsibility for it?
Thus, although I like a number of US companies, such as Dole Food, I will
continue to avoid investing in the US market. I am also wary about prospects
for other stock markets after Clinton's inauguration. If, as expected, he
encourages Americans to invest even more in the US by providing tax
incentives, then will some of the US investment funds overseas be
repatriated to take advantage of those incentives? If so, it could cause a
drop in the share price of a number of non-US companies.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Belt and braces for new personal
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growing fashion for investment guarantees made its mark on the personal
pensions market this week. Three separate policies were launched, each
adding refinements to the formula 'stock market growth, or your money back',
which has been the basis for many products in the savings market.
Skandia Life has a policy which offers the capital growth of the FT-SE 100
Index, or a deposit-based return, whichever is the greater over five years.
The deposit return offers a rate equivalent to three-month Libor minus 2.5
percentage points (which currently works out at 4.5 per cent).
The plan is unusual, compared with other guaranteed products, in that it
allows for regular as well as single premiums, and that it offers a 'rolling
guarantee'. At the end of each five-year period, the guarantees will be
applied and the fund will then begin a new five-year term, under the same
conditions.
If the fund matures within five years of an individual's retirement, the
money will automatically be switched into Skandia's deposit fund.
There is a bid-offer spread of five per cent, which means that the guarantee
effectively applies to only 95 per cent of your investment. There is an
annual management charge of 0.75 per cent, and an investment charge of 0.25
per cent. The minimum investment in the personal pension plan is Pounds 25 a
month, Pounds 250 annually, or a lump sum of Pounds 1,000.
Legal &amp; General's new pension fund offers a different choice; the capital
rise in the FT-SE 100 Index, or the rise in the Retail Prices Index,
whichever is the greater. The guarantee applies over the five-year period to
April 29, 1998.
The fund is more limited in scale than Skandia's - it is only designed for
lump sum investments and will close by January 15. When the guarantee period
expires, the policyholder will have to switch into a new fund, where a
guarantee may or may not be available.
Legal &amp; General says the fund is suitable for self-administered funds, and
for lump-sum personal pensions and free-standing AVCs, particularly where a
policyholder is within five to ten years of retirement. The minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000.
There are two further points of note. For the purpose of the guarantee, the
change in the RPI will be that between May 1992 and August 1997 - not the
same as the investment period, and there is a risk that the policyholder
will suffer if inflation is high between August 1997 and April 1998. The
second point is the familiar one that the policyholder will not benefit from
the yield on the FT-SE, an important component of long-term equity
performance.
Moores Marr Bradley, an independent financial advisory group, has arranged a
scheme with Provident Life which offers the capital sum indexed in line with
the RPI over five years plus 50 per cent of the FT-SE 100 Index's growth.
The fund is available for trustee investment plans, personal pensions and
pension transfer plans, with a minimum contribution of Pounds 10,000. It has
a subscription period of November 9 to December 10, and a maximum size of
Pounds 2.5m.
Following the article headed 'Pension Pitfalls' on pIV last week, a number
of people have written in to dispute the basis of Life Association of
Scotland's campaign on the poor death benefits of section 226 policies.
'In my experience' wrote Ian Chalmers, director of Minet Consultancy
Services, 'the vast majority of retirement annuity policies carry a return
of full fund death benefit. Very nearly all unit-linked policies have return
of full fund death benefit, so the main problem is with profits policies.'
LAS maintains that large numbers of s226 policies were sold on a return of
premiums (or premiums with interest) basis. As the article stated last week,
it will do no harm for s226 policyholders to check what the death benefits
will be, and for them to consult an independent financial adviser, if the
answer is unsatisfactory.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Dipping a toe into foreign waters -
A look at funds that allow British investors to keep part of their
portfolios overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE big international investment trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial and
Edinburgh, are the doyens of the industry.
But in the world of unit trusts, the international growth sector is still
something of a backwater. Admittedly, there was around Pounds 5.25bn of
funds invested in the sector as of November 1. However, just under Pounds
920m of that money was in the Standard Life Overseas Larger Companies Trust
which, with a minimum investment of Pounds 50,000 and a bid-offer spread of
7.86 per cent, is hardly aimed at the private investor.
There are good reasons why a unit trust investor should consider the
international growth sector. For a start, the recent weakness of the UK
economy and the decline in the pound has emphasised that the smart British
investor would be wise to keep at least part of his portfolio overseas.
And the small investor who ventures overseas might be wise to rely on the
diversification provided by a broadly-based international trust. Short-term
performance tables are often dominated by single country trusts as markets
go in and out of fashion. But picking the short-term winner can be a
dangerous strategy.
Take the Schroder Japanese Smaller Companies Fund, for example. At the end
of last year, it regularly appeared in the lists of top performing unit
trusts over a five-year period and in one newspaper survey of investment
experts was selected as a tip for 1992.
In fact, over the year to November 1, an investor who had backed the fund
would have lost 31.5 per cent of his capital. This is no particular fault of
Schroders, since the fund is still top of the sector over three, five and
seven years. The Japanese market, 'undervalued' according to many experts at
the start of 1992 with the Nikkei 225 at 22,300, has fallen sharply.
An international growth fund would have only a small proportion of its fund
in Japan and so would have avoided the worst of these problems. Broadly
speaking, one would expect most of these funds to have a portfolio spread
across the major markets - the US, Japan, Europe and the UK.
But not all funds are broadly spread. The Framlington Health fund, top of
the sector over two, three and five years, is really a specialist trust,
with a large exposure to the US, over-the-counter stocks and biotechnology.
Framlington features rather strongly in the tables with two more general
funds - International (fifth in the sector over three years) and Recovery
(fourth in the sector over 10 years). The tables are based on Finstat
figures and reflect offer-to-bid performance, with net income reinvested.
According to George Greig, investment director at Framlington, the
International fund starts with an asset allocation approach and has
benefited in the last few years from being overweight in the US (although
this has changed in 1992) and underweight in Japan.
The recovery fund looks for companies which are in turnround situations and
has had a heavy concentration is US and UK stocks. Charges on the funds are
five per cent initially and 1.25 per cent annually. The minimum investment
is Pounds 500.
The other fund management group which stands out from the table is St
James's Place, which has two out of the top five funds over ten years. These
funds used to trade under the Bishopsgate label, with the international fund
a regular star of the long-term performance tables. (The former Bishopsgate
Progressive, another long-term star, was merged with a special situations
trust and is now in the European sector).
Minimum investment in the St James's Place funds is Pounds 1,500, with the
initial charge at five per cent and annual at 1.5 per cent.
Consistency can be more important than top-of-the-table performance. Those
funds with above average records in the sector over one, two, three, five,
seven and 10 years are: Allied Dunbar International; Bank of Ireland British
Overseas; Fidelity Managed International; GT International; M&amp;G
International Growth; Martin Currie International Growth; Perpetual
Worldwide Recovery; and Prolific Technology.
But what international unit trusts really need is a general improvement in
performance. The average trust in the sector has grown 235.6 per cent over
ten years but fallen by 0.2 per cent over three years. That compares with
growth of 449.9 per cent and 30.7 per cent for international general
investment trusts over the same periods. (The method of calculation slightly
favours investment trusts, but nowhere near sufficiently to account for the
difference).
Investment trusts may have benefited from a narrowing of discounts in the
1980s but international investing still seems one area where they are ahead
of their unit trust rivals.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Fair shares for employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE OPTION schemes have become very popular with employees in the UK. But
what happens when the scheme ends and employees try to claim the profits?
How can they stop the taxman taking a chunk?
There are two types of share option scheme in which the special 'approved'
status confers tax privileges on employees. Savings-related share options
are available to all full-time staff but those wishing to take up the offer
must enter into a five-year savings contract, the proceeds of which will be
sufficient to pay for the optioned shares.
By contrast, participation in an executive share option scheme is at the
company's discretion and there is no requirement for a linked savings
arrangement.
The crucial feature common to both schemes is that no tax is payable when an
option is converted into shares. This contrasts with the position under
non-approved schemes where the exercise of an option triggers an immediate
income tax liability.
The fiscal immunity of approved options comes to an abrupt end once the
optionholder has become a shareholder. Although this is obviously not a
problem for as long as they are happy to remain as shareholders, employees
will frequently wish to cash in some or all of their shares.
A sale of option shares is just as much subject to capital gains tax as any
other share disposal. Avoiding 40 per cent income tax at the point of
exercise will be a rather hollow achievement if the optionholder suffers 40
per cent capital gains tax on disposal.
The first line of defence against such a melancholy outcome will be the
annual CGT exemption - currently Pounds 5,800. Although a single allowance
will only shelter small-scale gains, a much more robust shelter can be
constructed by spreading disposals over more than one tax year and using a
spouse's exemptions.
Suppose that Mr Z has an approved option to buy 12,000 shares for Pounds 1
each and that he exercises it in November 1992 when the share price has
risen to Pounds 3. Full CGT on Z's gain of Pounds 24,000 (12,000 x Pounds 2)
would amount to Pounds 9,600, reducing his net profit to only Pounds 14,400.
This Pounds 9,600 tax charge can be virtually eliminated by a combination of
patience and marital teamwork. The first step is for Z to give 6,000 shares
to Mrs Z. An inter-spouse transfer is CGT-neutral, so no tax will be
payable, but Mrs Z will be deemed to have acquired the shares for the
original price.
The next stage - which must be implemented by April 5 next year - is for Z
and his wife to sell 3,000 shares each. Assuming the price has stuck at
Pounds 3, the Zs will each realise a gain of Pounds 6,000 - all but Pounds
200 of which will be taken care of by their annual exemptions.
As early as April 6 next year the same exercise can be repeated - this time
taking advantage of the 1993/94 exemptions. These manoeuvrings will have
whittled down the taxable gain from Pounds 24,000 to a mere Pounds 800 and
boosted the residual profit from Pounds 14,400 to Pounds 23,680 - a 64 per
cent rise.
While this technique can be equally effective for both executive and
savings-related schemes, executive holders who use it must beware of an
insidious statutory trap.
Whereas the exercise of a savings-related option is a once-and-for-all
event, executive options can be exercised in several slices. So, if Mr Z
holds an executive option, he may be tempted to save on financing costs by
not taking up the second tranche of shares until just before he is ready to
sell them.
This is a temptation to be resisted. The exempt status of executive options
is predicated on the basis of no more than one exercise every three years.
If Z breaches this rule, his second exercise will drop straight into the
income tax net. Gone will be the prospect of exploiting double CGT
exemptions. Instead, the Pounds 12,000 gain in April 1993 will suffer the
full rigours of income tax. The moral is: 'Stagger your sales but not your
exercises.'
Finally, a fresh angle for savings-related participants to explore is the
single company personal equity plan (SCP). Since the start of 1992,
investors have been able to contribute up to Pounds 3,000 per year to an
SCP, with the holders of savings-related options able to make their inputs
in shares rather than cash. Provided shares are transferred within 90 days
of emerging from the scheme, the transfer will be tax-free. From then on,
the SCP provides complete protection from income tax on dividends and CGT on
disposal.
Although the concept is appealing, the prospective tax savings will often be
insufficient to justify the complexity and expense involved. Employees such
as Mr Z who have other, simpler, ways of avoiding CGT may well find that the
tax saved on dividends is outweighed by plan managers' charges.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: A DIY fund that pays double
dividends - Planning Your Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL family businesses struggling to survive the UK recession could be
forgiven for ignoring their pension planning in the light of more pressing
financial needs. However, under a small self-administered scheme (SSAS), it
is possible to provide for directors' pensions while simultaneously using
the fund to develop the business. In particular, the fund can be used to
purchase business premises and to provide a sizeable loan to the company.
SSASs are extremely tax efficient and offer considerable investment scope.
The directors of the company, as trustees of the scheme, can select and
control the investment portfolio themselves or appoint a stockbroker to
manage it.
These schemes are complex and require expert help to ensure the company
complies with Inland Revenue and Department of Social Security (DSS)
regulations. Non-compliance could lead to the loss of tax approval.
The schemes became popular in the late 1970s; today more than 30,000 small
businesses use an SSAS as their main pension arrangement. Membership, which
normally is restricted to a maximum of 12, can be extended to any employee
but generally is limited to directors of the company. This makes sense if
the fund will be used for commercial purposes, since the agreement of all
members is essential, particularly where self-investment is concerned.
As an occupational scheme, the employer's contributions are tax deductible
and the employee's contributions, if applicable, attract tax relief at the
highest marginal rate. Advisers usually recommend that the scheme is funded
solely through employer contributions since this reduces the National
Insurance bill.
Other attractions include tax-free growth of the fund, a tax-free sum of up
to four times annual salary on death before retirement, and a tax-free cash
sum at retirement worth up to 1 1/2 times annual salary. Spouse and
dependants' benefits are automatically included and the scheme can also
provide a tax-free lump sum on death during retirement. The pension, worth
up to two-thirds of final salary, is taxed as income. For SSASs established
after March 1987, a maximum pension can be built up after 20 years.
Although the pension is linked to final salary, the SSAS fund grows on a
money purchase basis and therefore its value will depend on the success of
the investments. At retirement, the SSAS fund is used to purchase an annuity
which provides income for life. One attraction of the SSAS is that you can
choose to buy the annuity at the most advantageous time during the five-year
period after retirement.
Where the employee does pay contributions, these are limited to a maximum of
15 per cent of salary. Some higher earners may be caught by the 'earnings
cap' which was introduced in the 1989 Budget. For the current tax year, the
cap restricts to Pounds 75,000 the salary that can be taken into account for
contributions and the pension itself.
This limits maximum employee contributions for 1992/93 to Pounds 11,250 and
the maximum pension to Pounds 50,000. It affects those who joined a new
occupational scheme set up after March 14 1989, and new members who joined
an existing scheme after June 1 1989.
The Revenue does not impose a limit, as such, on employer contributions to
the SSAS. Instead, the contribution is based on the projected final salary
at retirement. This flexibility is useful during years of profit when high
pension contributions can be paid to offset corporation tax.
However, there is a concern that the threatened Revenue clampdown on
executive pension plan (EPP) contributions might also affect SSASs. EPPs are
similar to SSASs but the entire contribution must be invested in insured
funds.
At present, under an EPP and SSAS it is possible to justify employer
contributions of over 100 per cent of salary for employees in their
twenties. This would be cut to about 25 per cent of salary if the proposed
EPP rule change extends to SSASs.
Under Revenue rules, you can only run one SSAS at a time which makes the
choice of provider extremely important. There are two options. Fully
self-administered schemes are generally offered on a fee basis and are
available from about 60 firms of solicitors, actuarial consultants and life
offices.
These provide all the administration and legal requirements including
audited annual accounts, three-yearly actuarial valuations and a
'pensioneer' trustee service. A pensioneer trustee is a professional trustee
approved by the Revenue, whose chief function is to oversee the winding up
of the scheme if it is terminated. If the trustees appoint a stockbroker as
manager there will be an extra fee.
The second option is a 'hybrid' SSAS offered by about 30 insurance
companies. Under this, a significant annual contribution - usually about
Pounds 5,000 in total - must be paid into an insurance fund, while
contributions in excess of this can be self-administered. The insurance
companies deduct a percentage of contributions and may also have other fixed
charges.
As a rule of thumb, hybrid SSASs which charge on a percentage basis are
thought more cost-effective for annual premiums of less than Pounds 10,000
to Pounds 12,000. Where contributions exceed this amount, the flat rate fees
charged on fully self-administered SSASs look attractive.
The decision to go the wholly self-administered route is not just a matter
of cost but also depends on the extent to which the directors of the company
want to have control over their investments.
SSASs can invest in quoted stocks and shares, pooled investments such as
unit and investment trusts, cash funds, and commercial property.
Occasionally it may be possible to invest in mixed commercial / residential
properties. It is also possible to invest in unquoted shares but strict
guidelines must be followed. In fact, most SSASs are predominantly invested
in cash and property. Trustees cannot buy an investment from, or sell an
investment to, a scheme member.
In August 1991, the Revenue issued new investment rules for SSASs. In
particular, companies must report and submit documentation to the Revenue
within 90 days if there is any investment or sale of property and unquoted
shares. Reportable transactions also include any loans to connected
companies and borrowing.
Adrian Waddingham, partner with actuarial consultants Barnet Waddingham,
warned: 'It is essential that directors are aware of the investment
transactions that must be reported, and the time limits, otherwise they
could inadvertently lose Revenue approval.'
Also in 1991, the Revenue limited loanbacks from the pension fund to 25 per
cent of the fund value during the first two years of the scheme, and 50 per
cent thereafter. Previously, the limit had been 50 per cent from the outset.
Apart from the loanback facility, it is also possible for trustees to borrow
against the scheme's assets provided Revenue rules are followed. Property is
important to small companies, many of which use their SSAS fund to purchase
business premises. This must be done on an arms-length basis and a
commercial rent must be charged.
In March this year, the DSS introduced regulations that restrict self
investment to 5 per cent for most pension schemes. SSAS funds are exempt
from the rules, provided:
All members of the scheme are trustees
All members agree in writing before the self-investment is transacted. This
includes property let to the company.
Finally, Schedule D taxpayers such as professional partnerships and
practices cannot set up an SSAS but similar facilities are available through
a self-administered personal pension (SAPP), run by several life offices and
stockbrokers and through 'private funds', only run by a few life offices.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Alternative to bank deposits - A
look at a savings bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUT in base rates hits those with savings, as banks and building
societies reduce the rates they pay on deposits. Bristol &amp; West building
society, for example, yesterday cut rates on its Balmoral postal account by
0.55 of a percentage point.
But higher-rate taxpayers who want to keep their money on deposit can
consider an alternative which offers the same security as the building
societies but often at higher rates than those offered directly to savers.
Providence Capitol's building society bond, launched in July, is an
insurance bond, linked to units in its building society fund, which invests
in the deposits of the top ten building societies chosen by asset size.
Alan Parsonson, broker operations director at Providence said: 'The
objective of the fund is to offer investors a return which is comparable
with rates on 90-day accounts on more than Pounds 10,000.'
There is no initial charge or penalty on surrender. Brokers are paid 1 per
cent commission but the rates quoted are net of charges for customers.
Access is the same as with a postal account.
Rates are fixed at the end of the month for the following month. However,
new investors are given a lower rate for their first month. Withdrawals are
penalty free and operate on the same time schedule as a postal account.
However, rates for November will not seem too exciting given the recent
falls in base rates. The bond was launched in July with a rate of 8.3 per
cent net. Interest on a minimum of Pounds 10,000 for November is now an
annualised 6.75 per cent net with interest paid annually (there is a monthly
income option at a lower rate of 6.55 per cent net). Those investing for the
first time will get 6 per cent net.
There are still a few fixed rates which are higher. Chelsea building
society, for example, is paying 8.06 per cent net on Pounds 10,000 - a rate
which is held to February 1 next year.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is paying 7.2 per cent net on a similar amount,
fixed until January 1 1993. The rate on Pounds 10,000 with Bristol &amp; West's
Balmoral postal account is now 6.83 per cent net.
The bond is unsuitable for non-taxpayers because the rates are paid net and
the tax deducted at source cannot be reclaimed.
Its real value is to higher rate taxpayers who can use it to defer payment
of tax. This is useful for those who expect to fall into the 25 per cent
income tax bracket, perhaps as a result of impending retirement.
James Higgins, of advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says the bond has particular
merit for those people who are tilted into the higher rate tax bracket by
virtue of their building society savings.
Tax flexibility derives from the bond being treated as a single premium
investment bond for tax purposes. It benefits from a system of taxation
known as top-slicing.
Top slicing allows the investor to divide the gain made on the bond by the
number of years for which he has held it. This average gain is then added to
his taxable income in the year of encashment, and only if that takes him
into the higher rate tax band is the top rate payable.
In addition, the investor can take 5 per cent of the initial investment
every year as income without paying tax on this amount immediately. When the
investor comes to cash the bond, these withdrawals are added to any
additional gains and are used to calculate the tax liability, with top
slicing relief available.
Clearly, care has to be taken about the timing of encashment. Those
approaching retirement, who are eligible for age allowances, must make sure
that these are not adversely affected when the bond is cashed in.
Savers are protected by the Policyholder Protection Act which pays up to 90
per cent of the amount guaranteed under the policy. Those interested in the
bond can get further details from an independent financial adviser.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Should you join the stampede into
gilts . . . - . . . or will you find yourself buying at the top of the
market?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THIS the moment to buy gilts? For anyone looking to a modest capital to
provide them with a secure return on which to live, the options are
shrinking.
Base rates are down to 7 per cent, and most savings accounts will offer less
than that. Ten-year gilts, on the other hand, still offer a yield of around
8 per cent, while 15-year government bonds yield 8.5 per cent.
The higher returns available on longer-dated gilts have prompted a stampede
by private investors in recent weeks. They have been busy selling
short-dated gilts, which return little more than 6 per cent, and reinvesting
the money in higher-yielding bonds - 'moving along the yield curve', in City
jargon.
The risk, of course, is that the value of these gilts will fall, leaving
holders with a capital loss. The gilt market has already experienced a
strong rise in prices in recent months: just ahead of the general election,
the 9.75 per cent gilt due in 2002 was trading at a price of around 99 1/2 .
By yesterday, the price had jumped to 111 1/4 - a significant capital gain.
Could it be 1987 all over again for the private investor? After the
institutions have reaped the rewards of rising gilt prices (many began
diverting a larger share of their cash into gilts a year ago), private
investors could find themselves buying near the top of the market.
The amount of new borrowing the government has to do next year is one factor
threatening prices. The official prediction this week was for borrowing to
reach Pounds 44bn next year. Who is going to buy all those gilts?
Foreign investors backed out of the market after sterling left the Exchange
Rate Mechanism and have yet to return in force. UK insurance companies and
fund managers have been expressing mixed feelings about gilts, wondering
where to turn their attention. Pension funds, on the other hand, could
continue buying: a massive 85 per cent of their investment is in equities, a
lop-sided approach which could be amended by a shift into gilts.
The attractions of gilts would also shrink if British inflation starts to
pick up, or if German interest rates do not fall as fast as most investors
expect. For the moment, these are risks that most pundits discount - a view
shared by many private investors, given the recent stampede.
The rush into longer-dated gilts has caused trading volume to jump threefold
in recent weeks, putting a strain on the market. Only three market-makers
handle trades for stockbrokers who have private clients, and all three faced
some difficulties last week in settling the deluge of deals thrown at them.
Occasionally it was not easy to trade - brokers found in some cases they had
to wait overnight to buy or sell gilts for customers. Market-makers claimed
that disruption had been minimal and, anyway, had largely been resolved by
the week's end.
For investors who are not concerned about dealing immediately, and who do
not rely on a broker's advice, there is an alternative way to deal in gilts:
through the National Savings Stock Register. A department of National
Savings, the register accepts instructions by post and charges only a
minimal commission (Pounds 1 for deals worth less than Pounds 250, with
another 50p for every extra Pounds 125). Details are available from Post
Offices.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Going for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO have faith that UK chancellor Norman Lamont will succeed in 'going
for growth' might be interested in a new UK growth unit trust launched this
week by Newton. The trust is aimed to complement the company's existing
income fund and will have the same managers. It will invest primarily in
low-yielding companies where there is a chance of significant growth.
Up to 20 per cent of the fund can be invested outside the UK in
international equity and bond funds. Newton does not plan to use this
facility much and will not invest in speculative stocks, but could use it
for currency hedging.
The initial charge is high at 6 per cent (although there will be a discount
to 4 per cent during the offer period, which lasts until November 30), with
an annual management charge of 1.25 per cent. The fund can be used for a
Pep. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
Investors must decide whether the UK economy is going to start showing
decisive growth. But Newton's record on its other UK funds withstands
scrutiny - according to Micropal, in the five years to this month, Newton
Income stands second out of 95 in its sector, with growth of 73.89 per cent.
The sector itself could do with a recovery. Even after the Black Monday
crash of October 1987 fell out of the five-year figures, the average UK
Growth trust has grown only 23.24 per cent.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: The watchdog bites harder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO LIFE insurance customers finally have a strong watchdog looking out for
their interests?
Lautro, the life assurance regulator, yesterday fined Guardian Royal
Exchange Pounds 100,000, the highest penalty it has yet imposed. It has
increased its record fine three times this year.
In June it levied a fine of Pounds 50,000 on Norwich Union, for a misleading
advertisement, and then fined General Accident and Commercial Union the same
sum for investing in the disgraced Levitt Group.
Then, last week, it fined London &amp; Manchester Assurance Pounds 80,000 for
breaches of sales rules by its tied agents.
GRE had made the same mistake. Lautro found that it had failed to monitor
two agents tied to selling its life products exclusively, Centrust and
Coventry Investment Group, in the three years up to February 1991. Both
companies are now out of business, and investors are claiming compensation.
So it looks like Lautro is getting tougher.
However, Julia Liesching, Lautro's chief policy and administration officer,
denies this. Instead, she says that procedures have been improved, and the
disciplinary process had speeded up, leading to a faster resolution of
cases.
Has the watchdog bitten GRE hard enough? Peter Buckell, a spokesman for the
Centrust Investors' Action Groups, said he was pleased the fine had been
levied, but disappointed Lautro had not used its power to demand that
compensation be paid to investors. He also regretted that Lautro had taken
so long to act.
Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy for the Consumers' Association,
welcomed the trend towards stiffer penalties. She said: 'Certainly Lautro is
looking a lot more effective than it did a year ago. The trend is right.
Whether it is enough is another matter.' She pointed out that other
regulators had not been as strict as Lautro, particularly where the
insurance operations of high street banks were concerned.
In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission can levy fines in millions
of dollars, according to Eaglesham.
GRE said that important changes had been made to its control procedures and
it had not appointed any new tied agents for 18 months. Its total number of
agents has gone from 900 to about 500. So far, the company has offered
Pounds 164,000 in compensation to 30 Centrust clients, and another 20 claims
are being processed. It has asked other policyholders to come forward.
Even if Lautro has not deliberately toughened its stance, a leaner, more
efficient watchdog should still provide valuable added defence for
investors.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE largest transaction this week was the sale of 750,000 shares by Serge
Crasnianski, a director of Photo-Me International. This sale takes his
interest, as held through Imaging Systems International, to 11.25 million
shares, just under 20 per cent of the share capital. Photo-Me's business of
operating photographic booths has proved remarkably resilient to worldwide
recession and consequently the shares have traded at a premium to the
market.
Raymond Parsons, life president of electronic component group, Bowthorpe,
has sold 135,000 shares at 270p. That reduces his holding to just under
100,000 shares and is the largest straight sale by a director of Bowthorpe
since 1990. Over the last year, the shares have outperformed by some 18 per
cent.
Shares in Alexander Proudfoot have been under pressure since May this year,
when it became clear that the previous levels of profitability were not
going to be maintained. Interim results in September revealed profits down
by half and sentiment has since deteriorated further. The purchase of 30,000
shares by John Prosser, the recently-appointed chief executive, follows
purchases of 10,000 and 5,000 shares by Christopher Mills and Sir Campbell
Fraser during the summer. William Eberle has also bought 5,000 shares at
71p.

FT  14 NOV 92 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is expected to report a 40-45 per cent increase in first
half pre-tax profits on Tuesday confirming its position as one of the
world's most profitable airlines. However, the City expects the figures to
show a small decline in the company's second quarter profits reflecting the
increasingly difficult outlook in the airline industry.
BA's first half pre-tax profits are expected to be in a range of Pounds
250m-Pounds 260m compared with Pounds 185m in the first half of the last
financial year. But profits in the second quarter are expected to total
around Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m compared with second quarter profits of
Pounds 176m the previous year.
British Steel, struggling in face of the depressed worldwide steel market
and a floods of cheap metal entering the EC particularly from Eastern
Europe, is expected to report on Monday a significant pre-tax loss this
week. Analysts put it at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m in the half year
to September, compared with a a Pounds 13m profit last year.
The big question is whether the steel group will maintain or cut its interim
dividend, held at 3p last time.
There is no financial reason to maintain the pay-out, but British Steel may
want to keep its options open, and wait to play with the final dividend.
The market is expecting on Monday another solid year to September from BOC,
the industrial gases and healthcare group, but the slow-down in earnings
growth is likely to continue. Analysts expect pre-tax profit of Pounds 345m
(Pounds 310m) and earnings per share of about 45p (40.98p). BOC has forecast
a 22p (20.4p) dividend.
Whitbread is expected to report flat first half profits of about Pounds 142m
when it opens the brewers' reporting season on Wednesday. The company's
retail operations have continued to suffer from tough trading conditions,
particularly in south-east England.
The first half results of electricity company have only limited value as
they take in the spring and summer months when activity is low. However this
year's crop, which start on Tuesday, are bound to attract attention because
of the coal mine closures programme.
National Power starts off the month-long electricity results season with
analysts expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 230m, against last year's
Pounds 202m. PowerGen reports on Wednesday with expectations at about Pounds
100m (Pounds 97m). Dividend rises of about 10 per cent are likely.
Cable and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, is expected
to report flat pre-tax profits of around Pounds 355m compared to Pounds 351m
for the half year to the end of September 30 when it announces its results
on Thursday.
Strong performances from HongKong Telecom and Mercury Communications in the
UK have been offset by the weakness of the US dollar.
Storehouse, the high street retailer, is expected to report a break-even
interim result on Thursday. Analysts are already looking forward to a better
second half pre-tax profits of around Pounds 30m.
Analysts will be keen to hear if Storehouse is making any progress on
selling the loss-making US operations of Habitat, having sold the rest of
the business last month.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Wait for the good news - The falls
in mortgage rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of building societies have reduced their mortgage rates in response
to the base rate cut.
Lending institutions are always keen to announce such cuts well ahead of
their actual implementation for existing borrowers, who will have to wait
before they feel the effect on their monthly mortgage payments.
The banks and building societies which have announced cuts so far are not
passing on the full base rate cut to their borrowers. Take, for example,
Abbey National, Britain's second largest lender. It is cutting rates by 0.75
of a percentage point to 8.5 per cent with immediate effect for new
borrowers and from December 23 for existing customers. But savings rates
will be trimmed by up to one point.
Gareth Jones, director of retail operations, said: 'It is difficult to be
kind to savers and borrowers and, at the moment, we are being kind to
borrowers.'
However, borrowers who have not had the full one-point reduction passed on
to them and have to wait another six weeks for the new rate, may feel that
Abbey is being most kind to itself.
Rates on loans over Pounds 60,000 are being reduced to 8.3 per cent and to
8.1 per cent for mortgages over Pounds 100,000. A borrower with a Pounds
50,000 mortgage will save Pounds 26.56 a month on an interest-only mortgage.
A Pounds 70,000 loan will be cut by Pounds 39.06 a month. Those with
mortgages of Pounds 150,000 will see monthly payments fall by Pounds 89.06.
West Bromwich, Newcastle, Yorkshire and National &amp; Provincial building
societies are cutting their rates to 8.5 per cent from 9.25 per cent.
Yorkshire's rates will be implemented on Monday for new borrowers. Existing
customers will benefit on December 1 at West Bromwich but mortgage holders
at Yorkshire and Newcastle will have to wait for an announcement. Woolwich
and Northern Rock cut rates from 9.25 per cent to 8.55 per cent; existing
borrowers benefit in December. Alliance &amp; Leicester cut its basic rate from
9.29 per cent to 8.55 per cent immediately for new borrowers; others will
have to wait. Halifax, Nationwide and Leeds will announce cuts next week.
Britannia will cut rates 'at least' half a point from 9.29 per cent next
week for new borrowers (December 1 for existing customers).
A number of competitive fixed-rate mortgages have been launched. John
Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips and Drew said: 'A fixed-rate mortgage of 7.75
per cent reflects base rates of 6 per cent. You can't get fixed rates much
below this.'
Abbey National is launching a 6.99 per cent mortgage from Monday, fixed
until January 31 1995. It is available for a fee of Pounds 200, with an
early redemption and early capital repayment penalty of 90 days' interest.
National &amp; Provincial is offering first-time buyers a fixed rate of 6.25 per
cent - its lowest for 30 years - until January 1 1994, arrangement fee
Pounds 150. John Charcol, mortgage brokers, has a seven-year rate of 9.29
per cent capped until January 31 2000, with a fee of 0.25 per cent of the
advance.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Houses are cheap, but are they good
value? - A look at property returns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAKE NO mistake about it, houses in the UK are currently cheap by recent
standards. A difficult question is whether they will get cheaper still.
An analysis of housing affordability by the Weekend FT shows that following
Thursday's base rate cut, houses are cheaper to buy than at any time since
1971 - before the notion of a 'property-owning democracy' took hold.
How has this been measured? The usual crude definition is to take average
house prices relative to average earnings. But this tells nothing about the
true cost of buying a house, which is shown by mortgage interest payments.
These vary with the level of interest rates.
The graph uses a subtle definition of affordability adapted from the
Building Societies Association, which divides average monthly earnings by
the amount needed to finance an 80 per cent mortgage for the average-priced
house at prevailing interest rates. All prevailing tax reliefs have been
taken into account.
The boom of the late 1980s can clearly be seen as an aberration. During the
1950s and 1960s, housing affordability was almost constant - financing a
house accounted for around 8 per cent of gross earnings on average (although
bear in mind that income tax then stood at 42.5 per cent).
Those feeling euphoric about mortgage rates of 8.5 per cent (effectively 7.2
per cent after tax relief for our typical borrower) might note that the net
mortgage rate in 1956, when there was no limit on mortgage interest tax
relief, was 3.06 per cent. It did not rise above 5 per cent until 1970.
Reductions in tax relief, coupled with increasing base rates, have levered
up effective mortgage rates. In 1990, they combined with high house prices
to make the average mortgage bill account for 45.1 per cent of average gross
earnings, on the FT's assumptions. That was significantly more than half of
take-home pay.
Assuming a current pre-tax mortgage rate of 8.5 per cent, houses now cost
only 19.4 per cent of average earnings - the lowest figure since 1971.
The bad news is that it will be difficult to make houses any cheaper without
more cuts in nominal prices as the base rate cuts are coming to a halt -
building societies believe that 6 per cent is the lowest base rates can be
expected to go.
So the time seems right, on all historical criteria, to buy a house. Would
it be a good investment?
Perhaps not. As we have seen, house prices have kept dropping, despite big
improvements in affordability. People were still rushing to buy houses when
base rates were put up to 15 per cent in October 1989. But the Halifax
Building Society recorded successive monthly house price falls of 3.1 per
cent and 1.2 per cent in September and October this year, in spite of the
reductions in base rates.
Three key factors have been identified as distinguishing this housing
recession from the previous downturns and forcing price reductions:
Uncertainty: Fears about the general economy and jobs have made many people
nervous about buying a house. Negative equity: Real house prices fell in the
mid-1970s without any fall in nominal prices because inflation was so high.
In the last few years, low inflation meant that nominal prices had to drop.
This led to 'negative equity' - where the value of a home is less than the
outstanding loan secured on it, making it impossible, using usual lending
criteria, to move house. This has artificially constricted demand, forcing
prices down further.
Repossessions: Houses grew so expensive, just as people were losing their
jobs, that the level of forced repossessions of houses by lenders is at an
all-time high. Once a house has been repossessed it has to be sold, thus
creating extra supply - another force towards lower house prices.
The measures in the Autumn Statement are aimed at precisely these problems.
Will they work? In theory, the sudden appearance of Pounds 750m buying
20,000 empty properties cannot fail to stimulate the market and cut into the
problem of over-supply. Uncertainty should also be helped.
The measures have been broadly welcomed by building societies. But John
Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, does not
think the measures are enough to prevent a fall in property prices of 'at
least' 5 per cent next year. He attributes this to oversupply and the 'fear'
factor - people who can afford to buy are holding back because of fears of
unemployment and further house price falls. If he is right, then it must pay
to wait even longer. But most analysts now see prices stabilising.
David Goldsworthy, president elect of the National Association of Estate
Agents, welcomed the moves, saying: 'If we can take repossessions off the
market, then first-time buyers will be buying houses from people wanting to
go up the housing ladder.'
The slide in interest rates is making the return on cash-based savings
unattractive, so should people with Pounds 100,000 to spare be thinking
about buying property as a long-term investment in the hope of outperforming
equities?
The chart below compares the performance of the FT-All Share (without income
re-invested) with that of property prices, both in real terms since the end
of 1970. During that period, houses outperformed equities  - but the outcome
would differ depending on the timing.
The return on equities has been greater than on private property over the
period from 1973 to date. But if you take 1962, when the FT-All Share index
was first compiled, as your base date, property has done better. If you had
bought a house then, it would now be worth double the amount you paid for it
in real terms, compared with a 22.4 per cent real increase in equities since
then.
But if you had bought shares after the stock market crash of 1974, your
money would have increased almost four-fold today, compared with a return of
only 6.6 per cent on property, in spite of the property crash of 1973-74.
These examples, and the smoother real house price curve on the graph, show
one great advantage for property investors - house prices are far less
volatile than equities.
'The utility value of housing keeps their prices rising with income so you
should not lose money but it will not necessarily be the best performing
investment,' said Wriglesworth. 'But property can be a useful part of a
diversified portfolio.'
The case for some recovery in house prices looks strong. But it may take
time for the fundamental factors to outweigh the lack of confidence of
potential homebuyers and the negative equity trap.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Main points of the Autumn Statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Base rates down one percentage point to 7 per cent.
Government spending in 1993-94 remains on target for Pounds 243.8bn. Targets
are Pounds 253.6bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn for 1995-96. This means
average growth of 1.4 per cent in public sector spending over the next three
years, half the average growth rate of the past three years.
National Insurance Contributions will stay at 9 per cent of relevant
earnings. Upper and lower earnings limits will be indexed as usual. Hence
the lower earnings limit moves to Pounds 56 per week from Pounds 54, while
the upper earnings limit will rise from Pounds 405 to Pounds 420. The
maximum possible increase in contributions per week will be Pounds 1.21.
Social security benefits The real value of unemployment benefits and
pensions will be maintained. Most social security benefits will increase by
3.6 per cent in April, in line with the increase in the retail prices index
to September this year.
Housing market measures involve giving housing associations an extra Pounds
750m this year to buy currently unoccupied accommodation. This will then be
rented. There will be a temporary relaxation of controls on local authority
receipts realised between today and the end of next year, including receipts
from council house sales. The measure is expected to stimulate extra capital
spending of Pounds 1.8bn.
Car tax abolished altogether. This should provide a saving of around Pounds
400 on a Pounds 10,000 car.
Gross Domestic Product is forecast to contract by 1 per cent this year,
followed by growth of around 1 per cent next year.
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is expected to rise to Pounds 37bn this
financial year, up from the Budget forecast of Pounds 28bn and higher than
independent forecasts. In 1993-94 PSBR is expected to rise to 7 per cent of
GDP, about Pounds 44bn.
General government expenditure, which includes central government and local
government spending and debt interest, is predicted to rise to 44.75 per
cent as a share of national income this year 'mainly as a result of the
recession'. It is projected to rise to 45.5 per cent in 1993-94 before
dropping to 45 per cent the following year and 44.25 per cent in 1995-96.
Public sector pay settlements will be restricted to a maximum increase of
1.5 per cent.
Moves for businesses include increase in capital allowances for plant and
machinery from 25 per cent to 40 per cent for one year. Initial tax
allowance of 20 per cent for new industrial and agricultural buildings
introduced for a year.
The statement included a new initiative on private finance to enable public
and private sectors to work more effectively together, particularly on
infrastructure projects. Privately financed projects which can be operated
profitably will be allowed to proceed. No comparison with a theoretical
public sector alternative will be required.
Spending on transport includes maintained cash plans for the national roads
programme - the number of new schemes next year should be double this year's
levels. British Rail will be allowed to lease about Pounds 150m of new
rolling stock orders over the next three years. Funds of Pounds 1.2bn will
be made available for London's Jubilee Line Underground extension, provided
negotiations with the private sector are completed successfully.
Local government will receive an extra 3.7 per cent of central government
support in England next year, when the council tax will be introduced.
Other news this week
Small company shares continued their recent rally this week. The Hoare
Govett Index (capital gains version) rose 1 per cent to 1111.5 over the
seven days to November 12, and the County index also rose 1 per cent to
857.9 over the same period.
Sun Life has launched an Ecological Portfolio within its Luxembourg based
Global Portfolio range. The fund will aim for capital growth by investing in
an international spread of companies likely to be involved in
environmentally sound activities such as recycling, water purification,
pollution control and waste management, according to Sun Life. The minimum
investment is Pounds 3,000 and additional investments have to be in minimum
sums of Pounds 500. The initial charge is 6.5 per cent of the offer price
and the annual management charge 1.5 per cent.
Bradford &amp; Bingley is offering a two year bond which it guarantees will pay
at least 6 per cent gross above the base rate on its Timesaver account.
Investors should not get too excited, however, since this is paying 1 per
gross at the moment. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and interest can
be taken annually or on a monthly basis.
The bond is currently paying 9.10 per cent gross up to Pounds 24,999 and 9.8
per cent gross on higher amounts. The corresponding rates for those taking
monthly income are 8.85 per cent gross and 9.4 per cent gross respectively.
Bradford &amp; Bingley is holding these rates until the New Year.
Savers are only allowed one withdrawal during the two years without giving
prior notice, provided Pounds 5,000 remains, but they will lose 90 days'
interest if they do so.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Conjuring up confidence is hard to do - London
Markets / Andrew Bolger examines the City's cautious reaction to the Autumn
Statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer warned us recently he was no magician, able
to pull rabbits out of the hat. The roars of approval from his backbenchers
which greeted the Autumn Statement suggested relief that at least he had not
produced a mouse.
Yet the City's reaction to Norman Lamont's ingeniously crafted package was
notably muted. True, the FTSE 100 closed 29.6 points higher on Thursday -
within 12 points of its post-election high in April - but the index dropped
7.4 points from the level it reached before the Chancellor started to speak.
After yesterday's 28.9 point fall, the FTSE closed 5.2 points down on a week
which was meant to be make-or-break for the government's economic policy.
One reason for the market's caution was that the one percentage point cut in
base rates had already been factored into share prices. More fundamentally,
there was little faith among equity analysts that this week's measures would
make the difference between recession and recovery.
There is a degree of fatalism about this: it may be that the combination of
the 13 per cent devaluation since sterling left the ERM in September, and
subsequent reductions in borrowing costs, will prove enough to get the
British economy moving again. If not, Lamont's bag of tricks is unlikely to
turn the tide.
Stuart Aspinall, of Panmure Gordon, said: 'It is not a question of 'too
much' or 'too little', but very much a question of 'Is it too late?'. The
Chancellor produced about as much as anyone could reasonably expect. Now we
have to sit back, cross our fingers and hope that descent into the second
leg of recession/depression can be quickly turned round.
'All the forecasts - the Treasury's, mine, and everyone else's - are based
on the wishful thinking that the debt depression of the large minority will
be overcome by the increased well-being of the majority. The forecasts all
assume an imminent return to growth. It may be right, but it is a brave
assumption.'
It is in any case easy to overstate the impact of lever-pulling by the
government. The accompanying chart shows how sharply interest rates have
moved in the last six years. However, following the stock market's boom and
bust in 1987, the FTSE 100 has largely gone sideways over the same period,
once allowance is made for inflation.
Most shareholders have enjoyed a steady stream of dividend income, as well
as maintained the real value of their investment, but there are clear signs
that these salad days for dividends may be over.
The week started with the annual conference of the Confederation of British
Industry, which rivalled a Labour Party gathering for its scathing criticism
of government and City attitudes towards business.
Speaker after speaker said Britain must learn from competitors and retain a
larger proportion of profits for re-investment. Companies have already
started lowering dividends to reflect the ravages of the downturn, but the
tone of the CBI gathering suggests many more will do so next year.
A cut in dividend income spells bad news for pension funds, which are the
leading institutional investors in the UK stock market. Companies which
enjoyed pension holidays for much of the 1980s may have to resume paying
pension contributions out of profits, just when those profits are under most
pressure.
Against this uneasy background, some of the week's best performances came
not from recovery stocks but boring old utilities. Anglian and Northumbrian
kicked off the reporting season by water companies, but the whole sector was
lifted when a regulatory statement was judged to pose no threat to
continuing dividend growth and security.
British Telecommunications shares also performed well, in spite of reporting
a 36 per fall in interim profits to Pounds 1.03bn. The shortfall was mainly
caused by redundancy charges of Pounds 442m, reflecting a cut of 33,500 in
BT's workforce since the start of the financial year. BT said 'the first
signs of a slight improvement may have been perceptible.'
General Accident and Royal Insurance cheered the market with figures
suggesting that these two composite (general and life) insurers are at last
battling through a period which has seen heavy losses from mortgage
indemnity policies, motor and householders' business.
Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical chain, was apparently ill-rewarded for
15 per cent growth in its interim pre-tax profits by a 2 per cent drop in
its share price. The group's chemist shops continued to increase their
margins, but the shares suffered from profit-taking after a good run ahead
of the figures.
Apart from Lamont's prediction of 1 per cent growth next year, which several
analysts considered to be optimistic, most City concern focused on the
government's ballooning public sector borrowing requirement. This is due to
the recession both lowering tax receipts and increasing the demand for
benefit payments.
Government borrowing is now expected to total Pounds 37bn in 1993, compared
with an estimate of Pounds 28m made as recently as the March Budget. The
Treasury suggests the figure could rise to Pounds 44bn in 1993, but sceptics
in the City would add about another Pounds 10bn.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'The PSBR is through the roof and heading higher.
Coupled with a mighty balance of payments deficit, something unpleasant is
bound to happen at some stage. But the Chancellor is is no mood or position
to take preventive measures.'
The government faces no immediate problem in the gilts market, but next year
it may have to be selling bonds at the rate of Pounds 1bn a week - which
will require the buying power of international funds.
That may prove difficult if this week's package proves to have been achieved
at the cost of storing up long-term problems - such as the public-sector pay
freeze, or the level of next spring's council tax.
The accident-proneness of the government has been well established in recent
months. But it would not do to underestimate the self-destructive capacity
of an administration which this week yet again shot itself through the foot
 -this time with embargoed equipment meant for export to Iraq.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Sceptics feel a bit more optimistic - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAMA running on Wall Street this week could be entitled Waiting for
Clinton. And, like Samuel Becket's play Waiting for Godot, it has been a
case of many words and little stock market action.
The Dow Jones industrial average has moved little over the past five trading
days as the market has awaited further clarification of president-elect
Clinton's economic policies.
The stock market has now been treading water for three weeks, ever since it
factored a Clinton election victory into its calculations, with the Dow
fixed in a narrow trading range between 3200 and 3300.
The next movement out of the range could be down, in part because the market
has a historical tendency to drop around the end of November as private
investors sell stock for capital gains tax purposes.
An initially sceptical Wall Street now seems to be warming to a Clinton
presidency. Some analysts are beginning to predict a rise in the indices
around the year-end or in January, which is traditionally a period of strong
stock market rallies.
Byron Wien, chief market strategist at Morgan Stanley, predicts that Clinton
will be inaugurated in January under a new high for the market. Several
factors are encouraging optimism. The most important are economic signals
emanating from Little Rock, Arkansas, where Clinton is fixing his Cabinet
and drawing up the legislative programme.
Clinton has repeatedly said measures to boost the economy, such as
investment tax credits, are at the top of his policy agenda. However,
whatever he puts before Congress will hardly be an economic panacea and will
take many months to have any impact. Yet the very fact that some stimulus is
in the offing could spur stock market optimism.
Economic and financial statistics over the next couple of months may also
give the market marginally more cause for hope. True, the US economy is
still growing extremely weakly, and remains weighed down by excessive debt
and a glut of unwanted commercial property. True, too, that there are signs
of a slowdown in continental Europe, which will weaken America's export
performance.
Yet many economists expect the pace of US recovery to pick up gradually next
year and more robustly in 1994, which is where the stock market's gaze will
be fixed.
Furthermore, the wave of corporate restructurings across the US over the
past two years should feed through into some handsome profits increases once
demand revives. Fourth quarter corporate results, due in mid-January, are
not expected to show a sharp improvement, but they could give a foretaste of
profits to come and help underpin a relatively high-priced market.
The greatest threat to this stock market picture comes from the bond market,
where the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue moved up from a low
of 7.23 per cent in early September to nearly 7.8 per cent in early November
on fears that a Clinton fiscal stimulus would reignite inflation and sharply
boost the federal government's borrowing needs.
A sustained rise in long-term rates would eventually hurt the stock market,
both because it means higher borrowing costs for companies and encourages
investors to move funds from equities to fixed income securities.
However, over the past few days the bond market has (at least temporarily)
put aside its fears of Clinton and the yield on the long bond has dropped
from 7.73 per cent to less than 7.60, reacting to statistics showing weak
inflationary pressures and to the latest words from Little Rock.
Clinton went out of his way at a news conference this week to stress concern
at the reaction of financial markets to his policies and to insist he wants
a 'disciplined reduction' in the federal budget deficit.
Wall Street is far from convinced. The tone of the bond market, and thus of
the stock market, should be powerfully influenced by the individual Clinton
names as treasury secretary, probably later this month.
The man the market would really like, but suspects the Clinton
administration could not live with, is Paul Volcker, the former chairman of
the Federal Reserve and a strict financial disciplinarian. With him at
Treasury, both stocks and bonds might really rally.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Burton man steps out of the firing line - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most potent symbol of a new atmosphere at Burton Group's Oxford Circus
headquarters must be the decision to remove the bullet-proof glass from the
windows of the fourth-floor dining room. Clearly, the board is feeling more
secure these days.
That feeling was reinforced this week by the fashion retailer's return to
profit. While Burton has been struggling to rebuild investor confidence
since the departure of former chairman Sir Ralph Halpern, Thursday's results
were the first sign that such an effort might be justified, with annual
pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.4m, against a loss of Pounds 13.4m.
Yet few investors were looking at the profit line. For a company with almost
Pounds 2bn in sales, the figure was largely irrelevant. Instead, they
acclaimed Burton's decision to bring its property portfolio costs onto the
profit and loss - thus clearing up one of the last big accounting
criticisms.
They were also pleasantly surprised by the maintained final dividend. 'The
sum total encouraged people to believe at last we have a potential recovery
story,' said analyst Philip Morris, of Goldman Sachs.
The City has had a difficult time forgetting the excesses of the 1980s. The
disastrous foray into development and mad whirl of store openings left the
group dangerously exposed to economic downturn; the series of 24 carat
handshakes - including Pounds 2m for Sir Ralph - are still a sore point; and
finally, the drive for profit at the expense of a clear retailing strategy
for the 1990s left many doubting the ultimate survival of the group as
recently as 13 months ago when it launched a Pounds 161m rights issue.
'The group looked tired and shabby. It lacked investment and focus,' Morris
says.
Much of that has changed, however, since the arrival in February of American
chief executive, John Hoerner. A 33-year veteran of retailing, his
straight-talking manner is in direct contrast to the flamboyance of the
past. Hoerner knows he has a lot on his plate. In his favour is his track
record at one of Burton's most profitable companies, Debenhams, where he
turned a loss into a healthy profit.
The past year has been one of addressing strategy and tactics. The group is
now more sharply focused on target markets in all its chains. Pricing has
been a priority with a more disciplined approach to promotions and initial
price points.
Finally, the simple act of restocking stores - enabling customers to find
what they wanted, when they wanted - was a big reason for last year's good
performance.
Going forward, the group can only benefit from tighter management and
clearer focus.
Sales are already running about 17 per cent ahead of last year. Although
much will depend on the all-important Christmas season, analysts are
expecting an eight per cent increase this year. That would still mean a
healthy addition to the bottom line for such an operationally-geared
company.
On the downside, various chains continue to make losses. The most obvious
difficulties concern the menswear businesses. While Top Shop and Dorothy
Perkins appear to have responded rapidly to the new strategies, the UK
menswear market is beset by inertia. That has hampered attempts to improve
chains such as Burtons Menswear and Principles.
A further negative factor is the sheer number of Burton brands. The task
compared with other fashion retailers, such as Next - which has just one to
worry about - is vast. It is clear that the struggle is by no means over.
Even Hoerner will not hazard a guess about when the company will achieve
respectable profits.
Nevertheless, those who gambled on last year's rights at 30p have seen
shares almost double in 15 months. Although the forecasts for the current
year of about Pounds 25m might look expensive on a p/e of about 30 times,
1994 appears to offer real value if the trend continues.
On that basis, the board may well have reason to feel secure in the dining
room - even without the bullet-proof glass.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Income dilemma for savers - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER UK base rate cut, another problem for those who depend on their
savings for income.
This dilemma for savers is a deliberate part of government strategy. It
hopes to reach the point where the return on savings has fallen so far that
the public decides it might as well spend the money instead. If that
happens, the economy will start to grow again.
But this theory does not apply to elderly investors for whom cuts in rates
represent a fall in their standard of living, especially if they have kept
most of their savings in the bank or building society.
Abbey National has indicated that it will cut gross savings rates by 1 per
cent, which means that if you have Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000 in its 90
day account, you are likely to receive 6.15 per cent gross, or just 4.61 per
cent net per annum. In December 1991, the rate was 10.2 per cent gross or
7.65 per cent net. For savers, that represents a 40 per cent fall in income
in one year.
And as rates fall, the options for investors become more difficult. This was
illustrated once more by the falls in National Savings returns which were
announced on Thursday.
The old 39th issue of certificates, which paid 6.75 per cent tax-free of
held for five years, will be replaced on December 7 by the 40th issue,
paying 5.75 per cent. Series F Capital Bonds, paying a taxable 9 per cent if
held for five years, will be replaced by Series G, paying 7.75 per cent, on
the same date.
Rates have now fallen to the point where savers must question the wisdom of
locking in such returns for five years. In the short term, rates may well
fall further, with experts looking to base rates of 6 per cent and even
less. Bitter experience, however, has taught Britons that interest rates can
move up very quickly once the economy recovers and the government starts to
worry about inflation and the balance of payments deficit.
A one year fixed rate offer might thus be all the more attractive, so it was
disappointing that the government has withdrawn the First Option Bond from
sale 'for the time being'. The building society lobby seems to have won its
battle and eliminated a keen competitor from the fray.
There was further bad news. The Weekend FT has been plugging the 5th issue
of index-linked National Savings for a long time now and it is hoped that
readers have stocked up on the issue, which paid 4.5 per cent above
inflation, tax-free. If you did not buy the issue, it is too late.
The 6th issue will pay just 3.25 per cent above inflation. Why 3.25 per
cent? The rate seems to have been chosen with reference to the government's
target range for inflation of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. The middle of that
range is 2.5 per cent - adding on 3.25 per cent takes you to 5.75 per cent,
the rate for the new fixed issue of certificates.
If you believe that inflation is going to be higher than 2.5 per cent, the
index-linked certificates offer a better deal than the fixed - and may well
turn out to have been a good purchase in five years time. But you can now
buy just Pounds 5,000, compared with the old maximum of Pounds 10,000.
To round off the cuts, the dreaded general extension rate, which applies to
certificates past their maturity date, has been lowered to 3.75 per cent per
annum. And the return on the premium bond fund has been lowered from 6.5 per
cent to 5 per cent per annum.
So where else can the private investor turn? Long gilts now yield just over
8.5 per cent gross to redemption. Private investors have been moving heavily
into gilts, so much so that it has caused liquidity problems (see Page IV).
There are dangers here. With a budget deficit of Pounds 37bn this year and
Pounds 44bn next, the government will have to issue lots of gilts. Demand
could be swamped and prices fall (and many gilts are trading above face
value). Inflation, the great enemy of gilts investors, may rise again.
Nevertheless, with inflation currently at 3.6 per cent, long gilts are
offering a real yield of around 5 per cent. It must make sense for investors
to have a proportion of their portfolios in this area.
The really big decision for investors is whether they risk going into
shares. The All-Share Index is now yielding a gross 4.6 per cent, equivalent
to the net return on a lot of building society accounts. As you can get
income from equities tax-free via a Pep, the net returns are probably not
too dissimilar for basic rate taxpayers and for the top rate taxpayer the
balance may well be in favour of equities (much depends on the charges).
Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at Warburg Securities, favours two
good income trusts - Securities Trust of Scotland, yielding 6.1 per cent and
TR City of London, yielding 5.4 per cent. The former is available in a Pep,
with an initial fee of Pounds 50 and an annual charge of Pounds 60. The
latter has a 1 per cent transaction charge and 1 per cent annual charge.
Aaron also points to the world of split capital trusts, citing River &amp;
Mercantile income shares, where a yield of 11.15 per cent is on offer even
assuming no growth in revenues between now and the trust's wind-up date in
the year 2000. And he says that well covered zeroes (which pay no income,
but offer return in the form of tax-free capital gain) are yielding around
7.5 per cent to redemption.
Advice from a good stockbroker is vital in this field, as is a commitment to
long term investment - five years at least. Dividend cuts are a real
possibility at some trusts and the stock market could easily fall in the
short term. But the longer term arguments for having part of your portfolio
in shares are harder to resist.

FT  14 NOV 92 / West's guilty role in arming Saddam: Revelations this week
in London and Washington imply high-level cover ups of illegal weapon deals.
Alan Friedman has been following the trail for six years

BRITISH ministers squirming under the torrent of accusations this week that
they helped to arm Saddam Hussein before the invasion of Kuwait may take
bleak comfort from the fact that they are not alone.
Fellow politicians, officials, bankers, businessmen, arms dealers and spies
stand accused of doing the same in countries as far apart as the US, Italy,
South Africa and Chile.
In spite of the publicly avowed policy of withholding the sale of arms and
weapons technology to Iraq, its war machine proved an irresistible lure.
This continued even when the president used the weapons to oppress his own
people, gas the Kurds and threaten the Middle East with a growing arsenal of
missiles and nuclear technology.
The Matrix Churchill affair, tantalisingly revealed in hitherto secret
Whitehall documents, is to be the subject of a judicial enquiry. But it is
only the latest twist in a bizarre tale which began in the early 1980s
At that time the west had decided that backing Saddam was the lesser of two
evils in its effort to protect strategic oil supplies in the Gulf where the
mullahs in Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran seemed increasingly hostile.
That Washington and London backed Saddam during the eight years' war between
Iran and Iraq is well documented. But the tilt to Baghdad continued well
after the end of that war in the autumn of 1988, and documentary evidence
has been uncovered which shows that it carried on until a few days before
Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Why? For some governments it was a
scramble for profits from Iraq's huge re-equipment programme. For others it
was the flawed judgment that Saddam was the man to provide stability in a
chronically unstable region.
Saddam turned to the west for weapons and technology after the Soviet Union,
long Iraq's patron, began to weaken. However, in most western countries
there were laws or strict policy guidelines, backed by United Nations
resolutions, banning the sale of weapons and military technology.
However, there is a large, shadowy sector of technology which can be used
for either military or civilian purposes. In this grey area officials had
wide discretion to interpret the rules strictly or - more often, it seems -
with flexibility. It is in this area that the scandal, already dubbed
Iraqgate, is unfolding.
A recently declassified US National Security directive, signed in October
1989 by President George Bush, shows that giving money and technology to
Iraq was considered a top political priority, a way of trying to make sure
Saddam served as the west's policeman in the region.
This week in the UK, documents released by the court where the case against
three directors of Matrix Churchill, an Iraqi-owned machine tools maker in
Coventry, collapsed, have shown that ministers in Margaret Thatcher's
government were briefed while the company acted as a lynchpin of Baghdad's
arms procurement network.
Paul Henderson, Matrix Churchill's former managing director, says he worked
with MI6, the espionage service, for nearly 15 years, passing information to
London on Saddam's nuclear weapons programme. The implication is that he,
and his company, were too valuable to lose.
In Washington it emerged yesterday that the Bush administration was moving
closer towards the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the
Iraqgate affair after a Justice Department investigator concluded that there
are credible and serious allegations of criminal wrongdoing by senior US
officials. It has not been proven that US officials knowingly broke their
own laws prohibiting military transfers to Iraq, but there is circumstantial
evidence to suggest they did.
The picture which is slowly emerging suggests that officials of three
nations may have been involved - using banks, companies, taxpayers' money
and government agencies to help in the covert arming of a dictator.
It is clear now that Matrix, in addition to being at the centre of Baghdad's
procurement network, was also at the heart of a related scandal. This was
the case of some Dollars 5bn of illegal loans to Iraq made from 1985 to 1989
by an obscure Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's state-owned Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro.
BNL Atlanta financed Matrix and many other companies that supplied
militarily useful technology to Iraq. An immunity from prosecution in the US
granted to Henderson in relation to the BNL scandal raises the question of
how much he knew of the administration's involvement in arming Iraq and why
he was granted immunity.
I started to follow this story in Milan and Rome nearly six years ago. Then
I learned about ties between European companies and a Swiss-based
procurement network of 16 companies. The system was known as the Consen
network and it helped to procure equipment for an Iraqi-funded
nuclear-capable ballistic missile project code named the 'Condor 2'. That
was between 1986 and 1988. When I claimed then that Iraq was working
secretly on a nuclear weapon, people were apt to smile, as though I was a
slightly eccentric uncle.
In August 1989, while reporting for the Financial Times from Milan, I was
struck one day by a terse four-line press release from BNL in Rome saying
that 'irregularities' had been uncovered at the bank's Atlanta branch. A few
days later a colleague in London sent me a tip concerning a company called
Matrix Churchill. When I telephoned a well-placed contact in Rome and
mentioned the words 'BNL' and 'Matrix Churchill' in the same sentence there
was a sudden pause on the line, then a strangely nervous invitation to hop
on an aeroplane and have dinner in Rome that night.
What followed in Rome was an all night session of dining, drinking whisky
and chain-smoking Marlboros in a hotel bar, discussing our suspicion that
BNL Atlanta might have been secretly financing Iraq's Condor missile. By 5am
my contact had travelled across Rome and returned with evidence that
appeared to prove the case.
What we now know from interviews and documents is that on the morning of
Friday August 4 1989, the FBI raided and sealed the Atlanta offices of BNL,
discovering hidden records of the huge Iraqi loans to Matrix Churchill and
others. The night before, Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, telephoned a senior official at the Bank of Italy warning
of the impending raid. Fed officials met Bank of Italy officials in Rome at
10am August 4 to discuss ways of avoiding a disruption in world financial
markets that might follow a major banking scandal. That evening, Nerio Nesi,
the chairman, and Giacomo Pedde, managing director of BNL, were called into
a meeting with Lamberto Dini, director-general of the Bank of Italy. When
the BNL executives were told of the Atlanta affair they looked shocked.
Although they said they knew nothing of the Iraqi loans, the Italian
government removed both from BNL within weeks.
What none of us knew in 1989 was that press reports of the military side of
the affair were having an impact on the ability of Washington and London to
continue to assist Iraq. At a time when Iraq's creditworthiness was very
poor, its main financial pipeline in Atlanta was being stopped. Only now do
the available declassified US and British documents tell this story, some of
them citing FT reports.
James Baker, then Secretary of State, was even harangued about western press
coverage by Tariq Aziz, then Iraq's foreign minister, at a meeting on
October 1989.
Then something extraordinary happened. On November 6 1989 the CIA sent a
report on BNL and the Matrix Churchill network to the State Department and
National Security Council at the White House. Some 48 hours later, on
November 8 1989, senior US officials in the White House, citing the personal
wishes of President Bush, approved Dollars 1bn of US government loan
guarantees for US farm exports to Iraq, no doubt partly in response to the
demands Aziz had made of Baker.
Numerous memos show that some officials feared that Iraq was deeply
implicated in the BNL affair and that since some of the BNL loans were
backed by government guarantees they should not blithely hand over another
Dollars 1bn of US guarantees. As one senior Bush official admitted to a
joint investigation last year by the FT and ABC Television's Nightline: 'We
knew the BNL thing was stinking. There had been enough yellow flags to make
us worry about BNL. But an aide to Baker told the meeting that terminating
the Dollars 1bn of guarantees would be contrary to the president's
intentions.'
By early 1990, we now know, the Italian government sent its Washington
ambassador to see US officials, including Dick Thornburgh, then the
Attorney-General, in an effort to lobby the Bush administration not to
indict BNL. Thornburgh said recently that he could not recall the meeting,
although it is detailed in internal BNL reports.
In February 1990, according to Federal Reserve memoranda, Thornburgh stopped
US investigators from travelling to Istanbul and Rome to pursue the BNL
case. By April 1990 the Fed's Corrigan was told in a memo that prosecution
of the BNL case in Atlanta was being made difficult 'by what is perceived as
interference from the Justice Department in Washington.'
From the autumn of 1990 a lone Democratic congressman, Henry Gonzalez,
chairman of the House Banking Committee, joined the chase. He ignored
Thornburgh's written demand in September 1990 to drop BNL hearings on
'national security' grounds. Over the past 18 months he has stood many times
before an empty House of Representatives, late at night, placing into the
Congressional record a series of secret Iraq-related documents.
Among the revelations documented by Gonzalez was the story of how BNL helped
to finance and how Matrix affiliates co-operated with Iraq's 'Super Gun'
project, the 1,000mm cannon designed by the late Dr Gerry Bull, the Canadian
rocket scientist who was murdered in Brussels in 1990. Gonzalez's staff
discovered that the Bush administration, contrary to stated policies,
approved export licences for Dr Bull's Space Research Corporation to send
equipment to places already identified by US intelligence as Iraqi military
sites. This week the Italian Senate voted to re-open its BNL / Iraqgate
investigation which by 1991 had been running out of steam.
On February 28 1991, hours after the end of Operation Desert Storm and some
19 months after the FBI raid in Atlanta, the Bush Administration finally
brought indictments in the BNL affair. It argued that the BNL/Matrix affair
had been single-handedly orchestrated by Christopher Drogoul, the Atlanta
branch manager who had been dealing with officials in Baghdad and with
Henderson in Coventry.
It took until June 1992 for Drogoul's trial to be scheduled and then, at the
last minute, the US authorities agreed to drop many of the charges in
exchange for a guilty plea on others and the pledge of his co-operation.
By July 1992, Gonzalez had been joined by five other Congressional
investigations and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee demanded that
a special prosecutor be named to investigate Iraqgate. The committee even
cited possible criminal wrongdoing by senior Bush officials alleged to have
joined the cover-up of the arming and financing of Iraq. These possible
crimes included obstruction of justice, perjury, financial conflict of
interest and falsification of documents.
William Barr, who replaced Thornburgh as Attorney-General and is himself a
former colleague of Bush from his days as CIA director in 1976, has so far
refused to appoint a special prosecutor. Instead he has named Frederick
Lacey, a retired Republican judge from New Jersey, to investigate further
and report to him; Barr however, will tell Congress on Monday that there are
sufficient allegations that members of the Bush administration have
committed crimes, to warrant moving toward the next stage: a further enquiry
that could lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor.
Two months ago the global dimensions of the Iraqgate saga became even
clearer in Atlanta when Judge Marvin Shoob, a fiercely independent federal
judge, presided over what were to have been brief hearings aimed at
establishing a prison sentence for Drogoul.
By then Drogoul had got himself a new lawyer - a clever Southerner named
Bobby Lee Cook. Cook promptly turned the Bush administration's case on its
head by introducing evidence and testimony that suggested BNL's Rome head
office was implicated in the Iraqi affair and that former US intelligence
agents might have been involved as well.
Midway through the Atlanta proceedings two former top BNL executives in
Italy detailed how they and six other Rome executives had been involved in
the Atlanta loans to Iraq. So much for the argument that Drogoul acted
alone. Then Judge Shoob said in court that he had read CIA documents that
'definitely proved' Rome was involved. Soon afterwards the Bush
Administration asked for the Atlanta hearings to be halted and said Drogoul
would be allowed to change his plea to innocent and face a full trial.
Last month an even stranger twist occurred when CIA and Justice Department
officials told a Senate committee that they had deliberately misled the
Atlanta prosecutors by concealing US intelligence reports on Rome's
involvement. CIA and Justice then engaged in an unusual public argument over
which agency pressed the other to lie. As opprobrium was heaped on the Bush
Administration by Congressional Democrats each agency then agreed to
investigate itself. Finally, the FBI was called in to investigate both.
Judge Shoob then summed up the affair in a judicial order stating: 'it is
apparent that decisions were made at the top levels of the United States
Justice Department, State Department, Agriculture Department and within the
intelligence community to shape this case and that information may have been
withheld from local prosecutors seeking to investigate the case.'
Strong words, and the collapsed Matrix trial in London mirrors the Atlanta
case in many ways.
Where is Iraqgate heading? If the Bush administration does not name a
special prosecutor, it will soon be up to President Bill Clinton to fulfil
his campaign pledge to name one.
I, among others, am convinced that there is a strong chance that if and when
the matter is investigated by a special prosecutor, Bush administration
officials will be indicted for taking part in a a cover-up. Like Watergate
it may ultimately be the cover-up rather than the underlying offences that
proves decisive.
The trail has been long - many miles and documents and years long. But it
shows no sign of petering out, not in London, not in Rome and certainly not
in Washington. These scandals take a long time to unfold.

FT  14 NOV 92 / The Long View: Dukes and duchesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS ago the British government was buying back its own gilt-edged
securities. Next year it will be selling Pounds 1bn worth every week, to
cover a public sector borrowing requirement which is pencilled in for Pounds
44bn, but which, if the public sector trade unions have anything to do with
it, will turn out to be quite a bit more.
In fact the PSBR for 1993-94 is officially heading for 7 per cent of GDP, or
perhaps 8 1/2 per cent if you exclude privatisation receipts, which is how
they did the sums in the 1970s, the last time that public borrowing got this
high. The crucial question over the next year or two, for the equity market
as well as for gilt-edged, will be the long-term interest rate at which this
public borrowing spree can be financed.
In the much more inflationary 1970s the interest rate sometimes reached 15
or 16 per cent as the government resorted to bizarre 'Grand Old Duke of
York' tactics, marching interest rates up and down the hill in order to lure
institutional investors into gilts with the offer of periodic quick profits.
You might think that the gilt-edged market would be in disarray today as
investors, already demoralised by the exit from the exchange rate mechanism,
stared up at the mountain of debt. A few weeks ago several leading
gilt-edged brokers were gloomily forecasting a rise in long gilt yields from
9 to 10 per cent. Not a bit of it. Gilt yields have been tumbling at all
dates, long and short, and the only disarray this week was to be found in
the back offices of the gilt-edged market makers which could not cope with
the rush of thousands of small orders from private investors.
There are some ironical comparisons with the French bond market. The French,
remember, won the battle of the franc and have stayed within the ERM. Their
anti-inflationary credentials are much more convincing than those of the
fickle British. Yet on some days this week French government ten-year bonds
were yielding more than the corresponding British gilts. True, there are now
fears that the ERM currencies are overpriced, making their bonds look risky
to international investors. However, the fundamental reason is that the fall
in short-term interest rates in the UK is generating a structural shake-up
in the financial markets, and is causing some international anomalies to
appear.
At 7 per cent, bank base rates in the UK are at their lowest for 20 years,
except for a three-month spell in 1977. For most of the past decade they
have ranged between 10 and 15 per cent. In recent years they have been above
the yield on long-term gilts, often substantially so.
Consequently there has been a huge build-up of savings balances in building
societies and banks, where the personal sector has some Pounds 260bn of
interest-bearing deposits, up Pounds 85bn during the past five years. We
have come to think of this pattern of savings as normal, but historically it
is definitely not; traditionally, investors had to turn to gilts and other
securities (both fixed interest bonds and equities) in order to obtain a
decent yield.
The shift can also be seen in terms of the collapse of the housing market.
Throughout the 1980s there was a vast demand for mortgages - up to Pounds
40bn a year - at comparatively high interest rates and the lending
institutions could bid up deposit rates in order to satisfy this demand,
which was insensitive to the cost of money. Now, not only is loan demand
weak but the lenders are forced to widen the spread between their deposit
and mortgage rates in order to pay for their bad debts. Shocked savers will
find, after the latest cuts, that accounts which a year ago returned 8 per
cent after tax will be yielding little more than 4 per cent. If you are
trying to live off the income that is grim news indeed.
For several years the banking industry will be licking its wounds and trying
to preserve its capital base. It will be in no position to finance recovery.
This is why the government, against its political prejudices, is being
forced to step into the gap, buying houses, digging tunnels in various
directions and running a very large deficit.
There is some comfort in that the government's debt starts from a very low
level in balance-sheet terms: since the mid-1970s the outstanding net public
sector debt has dropped from nearly 60 per cent of GDP to about 30 per cent.
Accordingly there is plenty of room for not only private savers but also
investment institutions to take on board large quantities of gilts.
However, this presupposes some shrinkage of the banking system and a
generally poor outlook for important areas of the economy such as housing
and construction. Once recovery starts the government must be ready to step
back quite quickly or there will be a crunch in the capital markets. In any
case, the forecast levels of borrowing cannot be permitted to drag on for
years, Italian-style. Debt is deferred tax, and when the PSBR rises towards
8 per cent of GDP the burden on the taxpayer will mount rapidly; the 1990s
will not be like the 1970s, when inflation wiped out the debt almost as fast
as it was issued.
So far, however, the rake has only just started to make his progress. When
interest rates are falling rapidly the securities markets are bound to be
gripped by strongly bullish forces. But at some stage next year the
sustainability of the state borrowing spree will come under serious
question. A heavy balance of payments deficit, perhaps the single most
frightening statistic in the Treasury's forecast, will also leave the
government highly vulnerable to sharp shifts of sentiment in the financial
markets.
The government may come to seem extravagant and in need of a new financial
adviser: a Duchess of York situation, perhaps.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Brazil's suspended president to fight reversal of policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FERNANDO Collor, Brazil's suspended president, yesterday accused his
opponents of carrying out his 'summary execution' and warned that the
country's new government was 'plunging Brazil into the fifth world'.
Speaking out for the first time since being suspended amid a multi-million
dollar corruption scandal, an emotional Mr Collor said in an interview with
the Financial Times: 'I can no longer just sit back and let myself be led to
the firing range and watch my modernisation programme be destroyed.'
Immaculately dressed in a tropical suit with monogrammed shirt and gold tie
pin, the man now facing an impeachment trial and criminal corruption charges
cut a tragic figure.
The smart presidential offices of the world's ninth largest economy have
been replaced by a fly-ridden and un-airconditioned library next to his
house. He sat surrounded by memorabilia rescued from the presidency. Behind
was a photograph of his wife, who is also facing criminal charges.
Unable to keep his hand from shaking while lighting Cuban cigars, the strain
clearly showed on Mr Collor's face.
But despite the pinched cheeks, haunted eyes and occasional look of raw
despair, he has not lost the fighting spirit of the young man who came to
power in 1990 with a mission to modernise Brazil. He insists he will not
resign. 'To resign is to flee, and I don't flee, I fight. I was elected for
five years and have a project to carry out which I must finish,' he said.
Asked about the criminal charges recommended by the attorney general on
Thursday night, he laughed bitterly: 'What was my crime? Was it a crime to
modernise the country, to build up Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.50bn) in
reserves, to reinsert Brazil into the international community?
'Was it a crime to build up the largest food stocks in history, to remove
price controls, to open our market, to defend the rights of indigenous
people? Nobody ever did so much for the country.'
He added: 'In no way did I betray the Brazilian people. It was me that was
betrayed. The impeachment campaign was instigated by business and
corporative interests threatened by my programme and by politicians hungry
for power, all brought together under a false cloak of morality.'
Mr Collor said he felt no bitterness over how his world had been destroyed
through the allegations initially made by his brother.
But he hit out at Mr Itamar Franco, his vice-president and now acting
president. He said Mr Franco 'has no project, no command and no team' and
warned that 'the whole modernisation process is under threat by a return to
the nationalist effluents of the 1940 and 1950s'.
He added: 'He's talking about freezing tariffs, reducing interest rates and
getting Congress to approve each privatisation. The government leader is a
communist who always opposed modernisation. They're throwing 2 1/2 years of
sacrifice by Brazilian society into the rubbish bin.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / Brokering a peace in Bosnia's war: David White travels with
a British convoy under Serb shellfire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the British troops drove up to the Bosnian town of Maglaj yesterday
morning they were warned at a Moslem checkpoint that there had been mortar
attacks. In a valley further on, the thud of artillery every few seconds
could clearly be heard.
'We'll go in anyway,' Lt Col Bob Stewart told the convoy. 'I'm going to go
in really fast on the main road.'
Two vehicles waited behind. The other four Land Rovers, carrying 12 men and
four tonnes of oil, flour, baby food and medical supplies, drove on, trailed
by a BBC Radio Land Rover and an ITN film crew in an armoured Ford Granada.
We came to a stop at the end of a kilometre-long tunnel just before Maglaj.
A shell had landed on the railway tracks 150 metres ahead. Although a
British reconnaissance party had been attacked with small-arms and
machine-gun fire on a road to the town of Tuzla last week, this was the
first time British troops had faced shell-fire.
The mission showed the difficulties of trying to enforce a ceasefire in the
Bosnian war and of ensuring that aid supplies reach their destination.
After a short time, the vehicles dashed into the sunlight and down a rough
detour to meet a back road into town. The whoosh of incoming shells from
Serb forces continued sporadically.
Inside the town, Lt Col Stewart, commander of the UK battalion group
assigned to convoy protection, ordered his men into a cellar after a nearby
impact. He and Brig Roddy Cordy-Simpson, chief of staff of the UN Protection
Force's Bosnia command, were arranging to speak to the local Moslem and
Croat commanders, who work in close alliance.
'I don't think it's a minor violation that they're shelling Maglaj,' Lt Col
Stewart told his troops. 'This has got to be stopped. People live here.
They're people like you and I'
As a group of soldiers went to rush the aid supplies from the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees into a medical centre, another shell landed about
50m away.
Lt Col Stewart with Brig Cordy-Simpson, who brokered the ceasefire agreement
between Serb and Croat and Moslem forces earlier in the week, had been sent
to Maglaj by UN military headquarters in Bosnia to check on breaches of the
agreement, which should have taken effect on Thursday. Maglaj, in northern
Bosnia, was a town of 43,000 before the war. It is one of the main
destinations to which British troops are trying to get supplies. The UN says
14,000 displaced people are there.
The town has become accustomed to regular attack. In the smoky underground
room, commanders said it had been under fire from tanks, mortars and heavy
guns for several hours.
Brig Cordy-Simpson said he was 'obviously very disappointed' at the
fighting, the worst violation since the ceasefire deadline. However, some
regions had become quieter.
'Somehow we have got to find our way through these areas where the ceasefire
breaks down,' he said.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Ministers knew of arms 'front': Jordan used as conduit for
UK military supplies to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD DONKIN

   BRITISH government ministers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
up to and possibly including three secretaries of state - almost certainly
saw secret documents stating that Iraq had asked Jordan to 'front' for it on
a large military shipment in the last days of the Iran-Iraq war.
The documents, circulated to ministers in the Ministry of Defence,
Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign Office, relate to spare parts
for Chieftain armoured recovery vehicles made by Vickers of the UK.
This first clear indication that ministers knew about and acquiesced in
deals in which Jordan acted as a conduit for arms to Iraq came as Labour, in
a separate development, put more pressure on the government over
arms-related sales to Iraq.
The opposition stepped up its efforts to challenge Mr John Major by
releasing further documents and calling upon him to say how much he knew
about the issue of export licences when he was foreign secretary. Ministers
have consistently maintained that, before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990, Britain acted in compliance with the guidelines drawn up in
1985 during the Iran-Iraq war.
The documents bearing on Jordan relate to meetings of the Inter-Departmental
Committee, a body of high-level MoD, DTI and Foreign Office officials set up
to scrutinise export licence applications to Iraq and Iran.
The summary of one meeting on August 11 1988 refers to 'the question of
spares for the Chieftain armoured recovery vehicle for Iraq'. It continues:
'Iraq has asked Jordan to front for them.'
The summary of a second meeting on October 19 1988 notes that the supply to
Iraq of 'spare parts for armoured recovery vehicles' had been approved. It
notes: 'These parts were linked to the Jordan deal but would be supplied
direct to Iraq as they were automotive parts only, and not armour or lethal
equipment.'
What ties ministers to these documents is evidence submitted by senior
Foreign Office officials to the trade and industry select committee's
inquiry into the Iraqi 'supergun' affair in January 1992.
A note supplied to the committee by Mr John Goulden, then a Foreign Office
under-secretary, states that 'the minutes of each meeting of the
Interdepartmental Committee were submitted with brief summaries of details
of each case considered to FCO, MoD and DTI ministers for approval'.
Questioned by an MP whether 'it could be any minister from the secretary of
state downwards in those departments', Mr Patrick Nixon, then head of the
Foreign Office's Middle East department, said: 'It could indeed.'
Between August and October 1988, the secretaries of state for defence, trade
and industry and foreign affairs were Sir George Younger, Lord Young and
Lord Howe respectively.
A list of products licensed for export to Iraq in 1988, also submitted to
the committee, confirms that more than Pounds 900,000 worth of armoured
vehicle spares were cleared for shipment. The end user was listed as the
Iraqi armed forces.
The use of Jordan as a conduit for UK military supplies to Iraq was 'an open
secret' among defence experts. Mr John Wyatt, a bomb disposal specialist and
a former official at International Military Services, the government-owned
arms sales company, saw British-supplied munitions in Kuwait at the end of
the Gulf war.
He said: 'We had clear-cut evidence when I went in that ammunition, rockets,
mines, and all the rest of it had been supplied by Britain to Jordan which
had subsequently got into Iraqi hands.'
He added: 'I'm sure in 1988 there was definite knowledge of movement
backwards and forwards between Jordan and Iraq . . . because I think at that
stage there was a certain amount of support for Iraq against Iran.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The congestion at the retail end of the gilts market this week prompts a
comparison with what happened on Wall Street as US interest rates came down.
In a rush to obtain better returns private investors sold short-term money
market investments in favour of equities. The result was a rise in the
equity market which held despite a degree of scepticism among the
professionals about the outlook for both the economy and earnings.
Could it be that something similar is happening in the UK now that returns
on bank and building society accounts are crumbling? The beneficiary, of
course, would be the gilts market rather than equities where smaller
investors may see the risks as too great. Such a flow might help to explain
the relative resilience of the gilts market to the deteriorating news on
supply. Certainly, small investors can be under few illusions about the
chances of finding savings bargains in the high street after the abrupt
withdrawal of many National Savings products on Thursday night.
Whether retail demand for gilts will be enough to offset the supply problem
is another matter. Retail savers account for only about 10 per cent of the
total gilts market and have tended to concentrate on the short end. Their
appetite may also have been reduced by liquidity fears after the
well-publicised execution difficulties for small deals. At the margin retail
demand may help support the gilts market for a while. The danger is that the
market might be lulled even deeper into a false sense of security.

FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of Deutsche Bank cutting earnings forecasts is usually enough to
give German equities the shakes. Since the market took the news in its
stride this week, one might reasonably assume the 15 per cent fall in the
DAX index since May has gone far enough. With the index on a price/earnings
multiple around 13 times next year's forecast earnings - even on Deutsche's
gloomy predictions - the market looks cheap by historic standards. The
nagging worry, though, is that German companies have lost their competitive
edge.
The appreciation of the D-Mark against sterling, the lira and the peseta -
currencies whose countries account for about a quarter of German exports -
has certainly added to the cyclical pain in European-minded industries such
as engineering, steel and motor manufacture. The sight of a footloose
multinational like General Motors reopening manufacturing plant in the UK is
thought-provoking. Another concern is that German companies, blinded by the
promise of a reunification boom, did not foresee the extent of the slowdown.
This may mean overcapacity in industries from packaging to cement.
The question is whether these negatives are strong enough to outweigh the
interest factor. Once the Bundesbank does lower rates, German equities
should find domestic support as investors switch out of cash. With the
government and the Treuhand making huge demands on the long end of the bond
market, equities may look a better bet. Equally, international investors
have been net sellers of German equities since the end of 1990. This should
reverse at the first hint that the market has touched bottom. German
companies will have to take tough decisions on costs, though, if they expect
more than grudging support.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's inflation figures offer further evidence of just how subdued
price pressures now are in the service sectors of the economy. Services are
largely insulated from the effect of sterling's devaluation, so with their
benign influence the underlying rate of inflation should inch lower still
over the next few months. In the absence of any immediate pick-up in demand,
indeed, manufacturers will probably take the early hit of higher import
prices in the form of lower margins. The more dramatic fall, of course, will
come in the headline rate which, given another 1 point cut in mortgages,
could bottom out at 1 per cent by the second quarter of 1993.
The worry for the markets, though, is what happens in next year's second
half. History suggests that at the first whiff of renewed activity companies
seek to claw back some of the lost margin. It may be that the market is
underestimating the impact of increased food prices which will inevitably
flow from the proposed dismantlement of the Community's monetary regime for
agriculture on January 1. The devaluation of the green pound, after all,
will affect domestic food prices as well as imports. The calculation for the
markets is whether the chancellor starts to apply the monetary brakes again
if he sees the 4 per cent upper limit of his inflation target in danger of
being breached.

FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: The gilt rubs off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Black Wednesday the Footsie has risen by just 14 per cent - arguably
something of a disappointment given that base rates have more than halved,
sterling is 10-15 per cent lower against most European currencies, and Mr
Lamont has spelt out the details of his new growth strategy. The reality is,
however, that most of the excitement in the London share market may be over.
The chancellor's own forecast of a 1 per cent rise in real GDP next year,
for example, is not only at the optimistic end of the range. It looks
anaemic beside the 1.5-2 per cent which the US will probably achieve in
1992, but which was insufficient to re-elect Mr Bush. Nor should lower
short-term interest rates in the UK be exaggerated as a motor for equities.
What matters more are gilt yields, which are vulnerable to increased funding
pressures next spring and any signs of a resurgence in inflation. On the
assumption that overseas investors will be less interested in a UK outside
the ERM, that burden will fall on domestic institutions. Pension funds will
no doubt extract their price.
Judging by yesterday's reaction, the market appears to have more than
discounted any boost from the Autumn Statement. The building sector's 20-25
per cent advance over the last month, in particular, may have been overdone.
Joint ventures with the public sector may be exciting over time; the
proceeds of council house sales may not materialise without any asset price
inflation to tempt in buyers.

FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines despite good
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ENCOURAGING economic news was not enough to prevent US equities from
drifting lower for a second consecutive day, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.76 lower at 3,233.03. Big board
volume was less than 194m shares, and advancing shares led declining by 918
to 838. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 mirrored the Dow's slight decline, easing
0.44 to 422.43 but the American SE composite edged 0.46 higher to 389.69 and
the Nasdaq composite rose 2.79 to 637.16 in late trading.
Stocks prices had been expected to advance following the release of
better-than-expected retail sales and signs that inflation remained moderate
in October. Retail sales rose 0.9 per cent in October, above the 0.6 per
cent most analysts had expected. At the same time, the consumer price index
rose 0.4 per cent, or 0.5 per cent stripping out the volatile food and
energy elements. Although consumer prices were somewhat higher than
expected, the increase was not enough to provoke fears of inflation.
Humana tumbled Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 20 amid rumours that the hospital
group may be heading towards a leveraged buy-out following news that Humana
was eliminating its future dividend.
General Motors, in the midst of a massive restructuring of its loss-making
North American vehicle operations, was one of the most active NYSE stocks
for a second day, adding Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 . On Thursday, the
auto maker told analysts it is aiming to break even in 1993, before interest
and taxes. For the first nine months of this year, GM lost Dollars 3bn
before interest and taxes in North America compared with a Dollars 6.1bn
deficit a year earlier.
Among the other big US auto makers, shares in Chrysler slid Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 27 5/8 and Ford held steady at Dollars 39.
The Gap added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 , on top of its Dollars 2 3/8
gain on Thursday, although the highly-regarded specialty store group saw
third-quarter pre-tax earnings slide to Dollars 62m from Dollars 70.8m a
year earlier.
Shares in Tele-Communications led Nasdaq trading following the release of
third-quarter results late Thursday. The issue gained Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 19 1/8 after the company unveiled net income of 6 cents a share
compared with a deficit of 7 cents a year earlier.
Michael Foods was one of the biggest winners of morning trading following a
ruling that a competing egg product infringes patents licensed to Michael
Foods, although parts of the patent dispute remain unsettled. Shares in the
company soared Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 11 7/8 but remained well below their
52-week high of Dollars 20 1/2 .
In contrast, Holson Burnes plunged Dollars 5 1/2 to a 52-week low of Dollars
6 3/4 after the company, which makes and distributes photograph albums, said
its 1992 earnings from continuing operations would be substantially below
expectations. Canada
TORONTO share prices ended weaker, leaving the market with a loss of 41
points for the week. The TSE 300 fell 14.25 points, or 0.43 per cent, to
3,269.53, with declining issues edging out advances 290 to 287. Volume was
49.257m shares worth CDollars 467.5m.

FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Rate cuts help Paris to stage tentative
recovery - But the market will need further reductions to absorb planned
privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French stock market has shaken off its currency crisis nerves and has
staged a tentative recovery over the past few weeks, mainly thanks to
reductions in official interest rates.
The CAC-40 index touched 1,611.04, its low for the year early in October, as
the Banque de France fought to defend the franc from the heaviest
speculative selling in years. With the currency crisis over, the index has
since inched back, albeit in thin trading, to reach 1,796.80 yesterday. The
index now stands 1.8 per cent above its level at the start of the year, but
is still 13.5 per cent down on the May high of 2,077.49.
Turnover has been moderate, between FFr2bn (Dollars 377m) and FFr3bn per day
during the past week, as many investors have turned away from equities to
take refuge in safer and more profitable Sicav money market funds, yielding
at least 10 per cent, compared with the mere 3.9 per cent average dividend
yield on shares in the CAC-40.
The two cuts in official interest rates since the start of November will
continue to support the market in the month ahead, possibly pushing the
index up towards 1,950, analysts say.
Another helpful factor has been the launch on September 14 of the
government's popular equity savings plan, the Plan d'Epargne en Actions
(PEA). The plan, which offers tax breaks for private investors, has so far
generated FFr7bn of new equity purchases, much less than had been expected
because of the unfortunate timing of its arrival. But PEA savers are
expected to become a big new source of demand for equities, including
privatisation issues, in brighter times.
The dollar's recent recovery provided support for share prices of companies
with sizeable US earnings, Saint-Gobain or Pechiney, for example, and for
those which receive their income in dollars, such as the aerospace suppliers
and oil groups. But this week Saint-Gobain has fallen on poor nine-month
sales and comments by its chairman that trading conditions could continue to
be difficult in 1993.
Construction shares have been boosted over the past week by the announcement
by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, that Brussels is
planning to issue cheap loans for infrastructure projects in a bid to
stimulate economic activity. Strong gains have been registered in Spie
Batignolles, Bouygues, Poliet and SGE, on hopes that they could profit from
this.
However, analysts see little else to underpin the market's modest recovery,
on the grounds that the general outlook for earnings is gloomy. Few analysts
believe that the recent rate cuts are enough to kick life back into the
flagging economy, which Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, says is
heading for 2 per cent growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year,
easing to 1.7 per cent in 1993.
The Socialist government's budget forecast of 2.6 per cent growth in GDP
next year looks less tenable by the day, but neither it nor the right-wing
administration expected to take power after next March's legislative
elections, plan to ease France's tight monetary policy. 'There is a growing
consciousness that Europe is entering a recession,' says Mr Bruno le
Chevallier, head of equity strategy at James Capel's Paris office.
During the currency crisis, business confidence fell to its lowest since the
Gulf war, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. Now that the
crisis is over, the franc's strength against the UK, Spanish and Italian
currencies is expected to produce a decline in export orders to those
countries, which represent nearly 28 per cent of French exports, according
to Societe Generale.
The continuing stream of disappointing interim company results has prompted
many analysts to downgrade their earnings forecasts, in some cases for the
third time this year. Credit Suisse First Boston France (CSFB) highlights
the results from Elf Aquitaine and Total, representing 12 per cent of the
CAC-40's capitalisation, and from banks and insurance companies with heavy
investments in the declining Parisian property market, such as UAP, Suez,
Paribas and Compagnie Bancaire, which account for nearly 20 per cent of the
index.
CSFB now forecasts flat earnings for the CAC-40 companies in 1992, down from
the 6.3 per cent annual growth it was predicting at the start of October and
the 13.7 per cent it expected at the end of July. James Capel forecasts a 6
per cent earnings decline for the CAC-40 this year and warns that it might
have to revise down its forecast of a 15 per cent earnings recovery in 1993.
This is clearly not an ideal environment for the French government's latest
partial privatisation, the sale of up to FFr4bn worth of shares in
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, originally scheduled to take place by
year-end. That, however, is chicken feed compared with the right-wing
opposition's plans for privatisation sales of between FFr40bn and FFr70bn
per year, an important part of its strategy for curbing the budget deficit.
The amount of cash stored up in Sicav funds and the banks' aggressive
marketing of the new equity plans suggests that there should be enough
liquidity to support future privatisations. So far this year, the market has
only had to absorb FFr10bn from the partial sell-offs of Total and Elf
Aquitaine, plus FFr7.8bn of other equity issues. Yet analysts agree that the
earnings outlook is so poor that more cuts in interest rates will be needed
to ensure a good reception for further privatisation issues.

FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases on options
settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE settlement of November stock index options dominated activity, and share
prices finished slightly lower on index-related selling, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 46.14 to 16,330.79, down 3.2 per cent on the week,
after a low of 16,174.72 and a high of 16,457.17 just before the close. The
index gained ground on buying by investment trusts in the afternoon, but
lost steam in the last few minutes on arbitrage-unwinding and index-linked
selling.
Volume rose to 320m shares from 215m on option-related activity. Traders
said some 200m shares changed hands in the first hour of the morning on
activity related to the fixing of settlement prices of November option
contracts. 'The rest of the day was very, very lacklustre,' said Mr Brian
Tobin at SG Warburg Securities.
Declines led advances by 510 to 414 with 181 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.64 to 1,242.24 and in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to 1,001.48.
Institutional and foreign selling depressed high-technology blue chips. NEC
lost Y13 to Y627 and Fujitsu fell Y1 to Y510. Financials were lower on grim
earnings prospects. Sumitomo Bank fell Y10 to Y1,700 and Nomura Securities
lost Y10 to Y1,320.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker which announced a 83 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits, surged Y200 to Y9,350. Investors were encouraged by
the view of some analysts that the company's forecast of a 50 per cent rise
in annual pre-tax profits was too modest.
'Theme' shares were traded actively among speculators. Green Cross, the most
active issue of the day, rose Y20 to Y1,300 and Meiji Milk Products added
Y23 to Y890.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 44.36 to 17,681.56 in volume of 17.1m
shares. Bargain-hunting boosted pharmaceutical and machinery stocks, with
Ono Pharmaceutical up Y160 to Y5,220 and Mori Seiki up Y100 to Y1,650.
Nintendo, the video game maker lost Y50 to Y9,840 on profit-taking.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets had a mixed day at the end of an eventful week.
HONG KONG fell as fresh Chinese attacks on Hong Kong's moves to widen
democracy sparked profit-taking that all but erased the gains of this week's
record-setting rally. The Hang Seng index closed 80.55 lower at 6,366.56, up
only 0.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of HKDollars 3.24bn.
HSBC Holdings again led turnover at HKDollars 365m, falling HKDollars 1.50
to HKDollars 65.50 in the wake of its HKDollars 5bn placement on Wednesday.
But Hongkong Telecom gained 15 cents to HKDollars 9.80 on active turnover of
HKDollars 194m.
AUSTRALIA closed a bearish week 3.8 per cent lower as the All Ordinaries
index closed down 3.6 at 1,371.7, but off its early morning low of 1,368.9.
Turnover was reasonable at ADollars 244.9m.
SINGAPORE closed slightly higher after the government announced a healthy
5.6 per cent GDP growth in the third quarter. The Straits Times Industrial
index rose 5.77 to close at 1,446.80, up 2.4 per cent on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed after further buying alternated with bouts of
profit-taking. Falls in some major component stocks pushed the composite
index down 1.61 to 650.62, unchanged on the week.
SEOUL recouped early losses on a wave of institutional buying and the
composite index gained 15.98 to 652.97, for a rise of 1.2 per cent on the
week.
TAIWAN's weighted index ended 15.38 down at 3,555.51, but rose 0.6 per cent
on the week, as turnover fell to TDollars 5.18bn, a new three-year low.
MANILA edged higher on bargain-hunting but some investors remained cautious
because of the domestic electric power crisis. The composite index was 5.93
higher at 1,346.92, steady on the week.

FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt continues to rise as
sentiment improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING consensus that German equities had discounted a poor earnings
outlook for 1992-93 lifted Frankfurt yesterday, while lower interest rates
fuelled Milan's rise, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended off yesterday's highs but its strength this week was
interpreted as the start of a pre-Christmas rally. After a day's high of
1,557.77, the DAX index closed 13.15 better at 1,548.52, a rise of 4.1 per
cent on the week. Turnover rose slightly to DM6.7bn from DM6.5bn.
The market was led higher by car and engineering stocks which were seen as
oversold. Daimler rose DM11.20 to FFr554, BMW added DM3.50 to DM505 and
Volkswagen gained DM6.30 to DM282. Preussag added DM4 to DM344.50 and
Metallgesellschaft put on DM5 to DM338.
Siemens continued to be heavily traded after its annual results earlier this
week, gaining DM6.20 to DM578.70. Among smaller stocks, Bremer Vulkan added
DM3.20 or 4.6 per cent to DM73.30 on news that its aircraft technology unit
had won a DM250m order.
Veba dropped DM1.50 to DM343 on news of a 14.2 per cent fall in its
nine-month group net profit.
MILAN was boosted by the Bank of Italy's one-point cut in its discount rate
late on Thursday, and by speculative buying in Fiat and Fiat-controlled
companies. The Comit index rose 12.77 to 460.96 in turnover estimated at a
heavy L400bn after L287.2bn.
Traders said buying was dominated by mutual funds covering short positions
on the final day of the November account or increasing their portfolio's
equity.
Fiat advanced L393 or 8.8 per cent to L4,850 and Ifi, the Agnelli family
holding company, rose L745 or 8.2 per cent to L9,800 on continued
speculation, despite repeated denials from the company that the group would
soon announce the sale of one of its non-strategic subsidiaries.
STOCKHOLM advanced after a series of money market operations by the central
bank succeeded in bringing down domestic interest rates.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 6.3 to 720.8, little changed on the
week, in turnover of SKr527m after SKr573m.
Atlas Copco B unrestricted shares rose SKr9 to SKr227 after its nine-month
report came in line with expectations and the group forecast an improved
full-year pre-tax profit.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed as some blue-chips ran into profit-taking after
recent gains, and a lower dollar undermined currency-sensitive stocks.
The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 lower at 104.8, but was 1.4 per cent up on
the week.
Royal Dutch slipped Fl 1.40 to Fl 146.30 and Philips, which announced a
programme to save over Fl 200m a year in personnel costs, rose 30 cents to
Fl 19.40.
BRUSSELS closed mixed in moderate trading as a 3.1 per cent decline in
Petrofina pushed the Bel-20 index down by 4.30 to 1,138.53. It was 0.4 per
cent higher on the week. Petrofina fell BFr250 to BFr7,820.
HELSINKI fell on higher domestic interest rates and on uncertainty over the
outcome of labour market talks between union leaders and the government. The
HEX index fell 19.1 to 793.6, down 0.8 per cent on the week.
ZURICH ended a moderately active session lower as the market consolidated
its recent rise. The SMI index failed to break above the 1,960 level and
closed 19.4 down at 1,930.8, for a fall of 1.4 per cent on the week.
Bearers shares in the cement producer Holderbank topped the actives list,
losing SFr33 to SFr496. After the close, the company said it had placed
500,000 bearer shares with banks.
MADRID's general index rose 2.29 to 202.66, up 1.8 per cent on the week, as
lower-than-expected October inflation figures improved the general economic
outlook and raised hopes of interest rate cuts.

JOHANNESBURG was mixed in pre-weekend trading, as weakness in De Beers took
4 off the overall index to 3,041. But continued demand for selected
industrials lifted that index by 8 to 4,072. Golds rose 9 to 777 on firmer
bullion.

FT  14 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall as trading account closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER consideration of the UK government's autumn economic statement and
profit-taking ahead of the close of the equity trading account prompted a
sharp fall in government bonds and drove the FT-SE Index down through the
2,700 mark again yesterday.
Disquiet was expressed by many City analysts on the outlook for government
funding which, some suggested, might crowd out demand for equities next
year.
The latest inflation data, showing an unchanged annual rate of 3.6 per cent
in October, was a slight disappointment while a regional survey from the
Confederation of British Industry indicated that the UK economic recession
was widening to afflict new areas.
Losses in government bonds ranged to nearly a full point at the long end of
the range. Index-linked gilts, the market's favourite inflation-hedge
instruments, suffered similar losses.
In equities, the weight of profit-taking fell on the Footsie-listed stocks.
Many second-line issues, including motor industry stocks expected to benefit
from the abolition of car tax, stood up well.
The FT-SE Index, on the downward path from the opening, was additionally
weakened as the premium on the December futures contract melted away. The
Index closed 28.9 off at 2,697.5, near to the lowest level of the day.
This week has seen the Footsie lose 5.2 as the Autumn Statement proved to
have been well discounted. Traders moved in yesterday to take significant
profits in consumer and building stocks and dollar weakness took toll of the
international blue chips.
Equity strategists appeared uncertain as to their views on the near-term
outlook. While admitting that government funding problems could prove an
important factor, one leading analyst concluded by saying: 'We are not
worrying about gilts today.'
Another commented: 'We need another one-point cut in base rates,' adding
that Budget deficits could prove a problem 'down the road'.
Profit-taking was fairly widespread but took in most of the retail and
building stocks which had been regarded as the most obvious beneficiaries
from the chancellor's moves to cut interest rates and to encourage economic
activity.
Seaq-reported volume was high at 622.9m shares, underlining the weight of
the selling pressure. Thursday's 735.4m shares reflected retail business
worth a healthy Pounds 1.3bn.
Retail business recovered this week as investors anticipated the cut in base
rates and reflationary measures in the chancellor's statement.

FT  14 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Booker concerns increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD distributor Booker tumbled for a second day as brokers continued to
downgrade the group because of concern regarding Booker Fitch, its
distribution subsidiary. There were also growing worries over the safety of
Booker's dividend. Mr Carl Short at Nomura said: 'The shares would have
fallen further but for the safety net that the confidence in the dividend
provides. But any further disappointments will put it in jeopardy and with
it the level of the shares.' At Smith New Court, Mr Tim Potter agreed: 'The
Christmas trading period will be crucial for them in this respect.'
Two directors are said to have left the division as Booker management have
embarked on a rationalisation programme to combat the problems in its
distribution arm. Booker bought Fitch Lovell in 1990 but has had problems
integrating the two businesses. With yesterday's price fall of 27 to 345p,
the shares have lost 12.5 per cent in two days. Among a welter of profit
downgrades, Nomura moved from Pounds 103.5m to Pounds 90.5m, Smith New Court
from Pounds 98m to Pounds 90m and BZW Pounds 99m to Pounds 94m.
Royal in favour
Although the chancellor's Autumn Statement was broadly good news for the
insurance sector, Royal was the only stock to show an improvement on the day
as a number of analysts pointed out the relative value in the stock. The
group, which had previously reported a sharper cut than expected in its
pre-tax loss for the first nine months, consolidated Thursday's gains with a
rise of 12 to 259p.
Kleinwort Benson specialists pointed out that Royal was priced at a 25 per
cent discount to net assets while most others insurers were at a premium.
Royal is also one of the group most heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity
and the government's commitment to spend Pounds 750m on the housing market
to check falling prices helped sentiment. Of its rivals, Sun Alliance, the
most heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity, fell 3 to 328p, while Commercial
Union, at an estimated 30 per cent premium to assets lost 5 at 563p and
General Accident, at a 20 per cent premium, slipped 8 to 560p.
A fall in the price of Brent crude sent oil shares lower. Lasmo closed 5 off
at 160p, Shell eased 8 to 541p following a strong rally on Thursday and BP
eased 5 1/2 to 232 1/2 p.
A shortage of stock combined with buy recommendations helped lift BICC, the
shares adding 13 to 276p. County NatWest and BZW were said to be buyers as
the worries over the group's property exposure were felt to be in the
shares. Smith New Court moved its figures into line with the market
yesterday, lopping around Pounds 50m from this year's profit forecast to
Pounds 83 1/2 m. The house remains a keen buyer.
Positive consideration of BT's results lifted the shares 2 to 390p. Recovery
stocks in the engineering sector were in demand. TI Group rose 10 to 295p -
BZW said to be recommending it - and Glynwed jumped 8 to 210p. But GPA
concerns continued to overhang Rolls-Royce, off 3 1/2 to 114p, and Smiths
Industries, down 5 at 313p.
Pharmaceutical stocks responded cautiously to the Autumn Statement, which
hinted at restrictions on profits and sales. The return on capital employed
by drug companies is restricted to around 17 to 21 per cent and at least one
broker was hinting that that level of profitability might be lowered by a
percentage point.
Also, there is a possibility that a government 'black list' of drugs that
should be sold over the counter in generic form rather than prescribed could
be increased by 10 to 17. The restrictions are not expected to affect
forecasts materially but would hit sentiment. There was also pressure on the
international earners from a stronger pound. Glaxo fell 16 to 800p, Wellcome
11 to 973p and SmithKline Beecham 7 to 523p in the 'A's.
Medeva rose 11 to 211p with Strauss Turnbull said to be recommending the
stock.
Engineering group Wheway slumped 5 to 7p as the company issued a warning
that second-half profits will be below most forecasts.
Marketmakers knocked BOC back by 9 to 680p on bear rumours ahead of
full-year figures on Monday. The industrial gases and healthcare firm is
expected to illustrate its resilience to recession, reporting a 10 to 11 per
cent rise in profits to Pounds 340m to Pounds 345m, versus Pounds 310m last
time.
Widespread belief that company broker Cazenove had cut its forecast on Brent
Chemicals prompted the shares to close a net 9 lower at 124p. Cazenove never
comments on market speculation but was believed to have come down to Pounds
11.5m for this year from the top of the range figure of Pounds 12.7m.
Speciality materials group Courtaulds, expected to post interim profits on
Wednesday of Pounds 87m to Pounds 92m against Pounds 96.4m a year earlier,
fell 10 to 495p.
News that US food group ADM has raised its stake in Tate &amp; Lyle encouraged
the shares, although analysts dismissed any talk of stake building or an
imminent takeover.
ADM has a history of trading investments in competitor groups and its 7.4
per cent holding in Tate's left most observers unmoved. However, enough were
impressed to raise the shares 4 to 369p.
Publisher Reed International held up ahead of a shareholder vote on its
merger with Dutch publisher Elsevier on Tuesday. Reed was up 8 at one stage,
a 12-month high, and closed 2 firmer at 603p. The shares have risen steadily
since October 30 when Reed announced final terms of the planned merger.
Lehman Brothers expects Reed's profits to rise to Pounds 450m by the end of
1994 against a company forecast of Pounds 224m for 1992. Also, County
NatWest has moved Reed on to its list of top 30 recommended stocks.
United Newspapers firmed 4 to 457p as concerns that the government might
impose VAT on newspapers as part of the Autumn Statement proved unfounded.
Euromoney lost 22 at 868p as profit-takers moved in following good figures
on Thursday.'
Most banks were weak as institutions adjusted portfolios to buy HSBC
following the Pounds 480m placing of 80m new shares in HSBC Holdings on
Wednesday. NatWest was the principal target with the shares falling 10 to
378p. However, HSBC slipped 14 1/2 to 542 1/2 p reflecting a sharp fall in
the Hong Kong market.
Yield considerations brought buyers into selected electricity stocks in late
trading, among which, Eastern rose 6 1/2 to 412 1/2 p, Norweb 11 1/2 to 461
1/2 p and South West 9 to 460p.
Switching was said to be taking place out of Scottish and Newcastle as
nervous talk was heard ahead of its results. The shares fell 15 to 415p.
In more wide-ranging assessments of the autumn economic statement, market
strategists continued to express somewhat cautious views of the outlook for
equities. Peter Thorne at Nikko Securities advised selling building
contracter stocks should there be any sustained rally on the back of the
measures disclosed.
While Nikko believes that the potential value of the partially-privatised
work announced in the economic statement could be worth more thn Pounds
15bn, and involve a long list of industry beneficiaries, it could prove
impossible to predict the winners among the contractor companies.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Coffee
gets back into bullish mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD coffee market's bullish sentiment was re-emphasised this week as
the March arabica futures position in New York moved above the
psychologically-important 70 cents-a-lb mark and London's robusta futures
established fresh nine-month highs.
These rises justified the view expressed by most traders that last week's
fall, which took the January delivery price in London down Dollars 31 to
Dollars 910 a tonne, was a 'technical correction' following the sustained
upsurge that had lifted the January price by Dollars 120 since the beginning
of October.
The upward trend was resumed in New York on Monday, after FO Licht, the
German statistics agency, predicted that world coffee production would fall
by 8.67m bags (60 kg each) to 93.32m bags in the 1992-93 season. It was
quickly followed up in London, fuelled by covering purchases by operators
who had sold the market short last week.
The prospect of a small Brazilian coffee crop has been the main factor
driving the market higher; ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, recently
forecast that the country's 1992-93 crop would total 19.15m bags - at the
low end of recent predictions. And this gloomy view of the outlook for the
world's biggest coffee supplier was supported this week by news that it
exported only 1.36m bags in October, 810,000 less than in the same month
last year.
The market remained bullish yesterday morning, when London's January futures
position reached Dollars 980 a tonne, but it slipped back to Dollars 959 a
tonne up Dollars 49 on the week and Dollars 283 above the 20-year low
reached in the summer.
Traders thought further gains were possible, although modest producer
selling was likely to appear as prices rose. One sounded a note of caution,
however. 'Probably you've a little bit of resistance from these levels up to
the Dollars 1,000 level,' he told the Reuter news agency, 'and the Dollars
1,000 on January is always going to be a psychological barrier'.
London cocoa prices also touched fresh nine-month highs in mid-week, but the
gains were quickly surrendered, with traders arguing that the market was in
need of 'consolidation' following last week's sharp gains. The March cocoa
futures position ended at Pounds 758 a tonne, up Pounds 6 on the week.
The market impact of the two-week international cocoa agreement negotiations
in Geneva, which finished yesterday, was negligible. Nothing conclusive was
expected to emerge from the producer-consumer talks - and nothing did. There
was progress in narrowing the gaps between the two sides on the price range
to be defended by a new agreement and the amount of stocks to be withdrawn
from the market, but they remained wide. These questions, together with the
knotty problem of financing price support efforts, will be tackled again at
the next negotiating session between February 22 and March 5 next year. That
will be the last chance to agree a replacement pact before the present one,
which operates no price-support arrangements, expires next September.
At the London bullion market the gold price, battered in recent months by
central bank selling and 'panic' hedging sales by producers, came under
further pressure from Middle Eastern sales and slumped to a seven-year low
of Dollars 329.30 a troy ounce at one point. But with analysts arguing that
the market had become heavily oversold, trade and speculative buyers were
quick to come to the rescue and the price closed yesterday at Dollars 336.45
an ounce, up Dollars 2.40 on the week.
Platinum also rallied sharply after a heavy fall in the first half of the
week, but the price was still Dollars 12.85 down on balance at yesterday's
fixing level of Dollars 353.65 an ounce. The recovery from Wednesday's
Dollars 347.25 an ounce was encouraged, dealers said, by a mildly bullish
Interim Review from Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing
group. JM forecast that the metal's price would average Dollars 370 an ounce
in the final quarter of this year and Dollars 385 an ounce in the first
quarter of 1993.
Silver displayed a similar pattern to the other precious metals, ending 10
cents down on the week at 379.5 cents an ounce.
Base metals prices see-sawed at the London Metal Exchange. Early losses were
generally recovered in a mid-week rally but fresh falls yesterday left most
prices lower. The biggest loser was nickel, which ended Dollars 170 down on
the week in the three months position at a five-year low of Dollars 5,497.50
a tonne after another big rise in LME warehouse stocks was announced.

FT  14 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets had a very active session yesterday as professional
investors strove to come to terms with the UK autumn economic statement,
delivered on Thursday by the UK chancellor of the exchequer, writes Terry
Byland. It was also the last day of the two week trading account in the
equity market and profit-taking was reflected in arbitraging in stock index
futures.
Hefty turnover of around 10,000 contracts saw the FT-SE December futures
contract lose the real premium held over the week to close at 12 points
premium against cash; the fair value premium, allowing for impending
dividend flows and financing costs, was around 14 last night but will be
adjusted downwards to 9 points on Monday when the new equity account opens.
In traded options, business in individual share contracts receded sharply to
27,109 contracts from 40,377 in the previous session. But activity in the
FT-SE contract, at 12,208 against 10,275, reflected arbitraging between
futures and the cash market.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Revising views on the D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell nearly 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday as the market took the view that short-term German interest rates
will be reduced more slowly than had been anticipated, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks, the market has ben divided over whether the dollar can rise
above DM1.60 against the D-Mark this year.
At the start of this week, the US currency had risen nearly 22 pfennigs
since plummeting to its all-time low on September 2nd. A strong retraction
was inevitable in the wake of this move, as dealers took profits.
But, dealers are radically revising the belief that the Bundesbank is set to
ease monetary policy, in spite of the worst recession in a decade.
Last week, Bundesbank officials made strong warning noises on inflation. On
Wednesday, they carried out a net drain in the German market, firming
interest rates. And yesterday, a surprisingly strong figure for western
German retail sales, up 3.2 per cent in September, increased speculation
that the German central bank can postpone a rate cut until the new year.
This pushed the dollar down to a low of DM1.5625, nearly 3 pfennigs below
Thursday's closing level. The dollar later closed at DM1.5660, down DM2.20
on the day.
Ironically, the dollar weakened despite surprisingly good economic
indicators in the US. October retail sales, for example, rose 0.9 per cent
against forecasts of 0.6 per cent.
These figures were partly swamped by the D-Mark's indigenous strength, as
seen in the D-Mark's surge against the yen, to a close of Y79.08 from
Y78.10.
But signs of economic recovery in the US may actually be negative for the
dollar because they give President-elect Bill Clinton an excuse to reduce
the size of the promised fiscal stimulus. This, in turn, would give the
Federal Reserve less reason to tighten short-term interest rates next year.
As one UK-based fund manager put it: 'Mr Clinton is an 'option' that the
currency markets have bought, and signs of economic growth give dealers a
reason to sell it.'
In this environment, sterling's stronger performance against the D-Mark was
a puzzle.
The pound rallied on the back of Thursday's smaller-than-expected rate cut
of 1 percentage point. The market also remains short of sterling after the
intense selling of September.
The pound closed nearly 2 pfennigs above its opening level in London, at
DM2.4280, and more than 2 1/2 cents against its London opening against the
dollar at Dollars 1.5500.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Suffering hangovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT days have witnessed a significant easing in official monetary policy
in Europe, with the British, French and Italian authorities lowering
short-term interest rates, writes James Blitz.
But European markets appeared to be suffering a post-easing hangover
yesterday, and dealers were sceptical about the prospects for more cuts in
Britain, France and Germany this year.
In the sterling cash market, there was a strong feeling yesterday that the
latest 1 percentage point cut in base rates would be the last for 1992. UK
base rates are now at their lowest levels since 1978, and the government has
cut rates by 300 basis points since Black Wednesday.
According to one clearing bank dealer, the market had been expecting more
than a 1 percentage point cut in the Autumn Statement earlier in the week.
Although it tempered that view on the eve of the chancellor's statement,
there was residual disappointment afterwards with what had been offered.
The December short sterling contract closed 19 basis points down on the day
at 93.20, and 54 basis points down on the week. At this new level, the
market is assuming that 3-month money will be at 6.8 per cent by Christmas,
a level compatible with the current structure of rates.
Sterling cash rates reflected a more bearish tone, with 1 year money firming
from 6 1/2 per cent on the offered side to 6 5/8 per cent. One year money
could stay at this level even if base rates are cut to 6 per cent.
The recent caution in some of the German and French money markets over
easing has turned into outright bearishness this week.
Bundesbank officials have issued hawkish warnings on inflation recently, and
the November consumer price inflation figure, due out in the week after
next, may decide whether the Bundesbank takes another 50 basis points off
the Discount rate this year.
The December Euromark contract has fallen some 46 basis points in the last
two weeks, to a close of 91.25. At this level, it prices 3-month D-Marks by
the year's end at 8.75 percent, only 14 basis points below yesterday's
average level.
However, the call money price, at yesterday's 8.80 per cent, is only 5 basis
points above the Bundesbank's repo rate and reflects the view that market
rates could ease again.

FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Waste Management in reshape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management, the US international environmental services company, is to
consolidate portions of three of its engineering and waste handling
offshoots to form a new company, Rust International. If the deal goes ahead
the new concern would become one the US's largest waste handling and
consulting companies.
Included in the new company will be Wheelabrator Technologies' recently
formed international engineering unit based in London.
The move will streamline the company and form a single unit that can deliver
environmental consulting, clean-up, disposal, design and construction
services.
Analysts say Waste Management, with projected earnings of Dollars 956m for
1992, had found its maze of semi-independent subsidiary companies was
interfering with its ability to bid efficiently on contracts for government
and international work.
Mr. Dean Buntrock, Waste Management president, said there was a significant
market emerging for environmental project management and services in the US
and abroad. 'With Rust International, we create a strong financial and
operations group through which we can more effectively market and deliver
our services.'
The new company, to be headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., will absorb Waste
Management's subsidiary, The Brand Companies. Brand shareholders will have
the option to receive cash for their Brand shares or stock in the new
organisation.
Parts of Waste Management's Wheelabrator Technologies unit will be go into
Rust International, as will parts of Chemical Waste Management.
Chemical Waste, which earned Dollars 101m on sales of Dollars 1.34bn last
year, despite payouts for some costly environmental lawsuits, will
contribute its 12 per cent interest in Waste Management International Plc to
the deal, as well as its CWM Remedial Services Group.
Waste Management said it expected Rust to have 1993 revenues of about
Dollars 1.8bn.

MR JAN Timmer, president of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, reaffirmed
yesterday that he had no intention of selling off entire divisions in order
to bolster the company's financial performance, saying that Philips would
not choose the easy or quick option.
Earlier this month, some analysts called on Philips to sell off businesses
after the company posted a third-quarter loss of Fl 154m (Dollars 85m). They
cited telecommunications and medical systems as possible candidates for
divestment.
Speaking at an annual investment conference Mr Timmer acknowledged that
divesting entire divisions would help erase the company's debt, but he said
such a move would also mean selling off future profits.
Mr Timmer said the company was studying what measures were needed to lift
its key consumer electronics business out of the red.
Philips has already said it will be taking unspecified restructuring charges
later this year in the consumer electronics and components divisions.
Previously, Philips had expected to be able to return to the black in
consumer electronics by end-1994 without further retrenchment, but earlier
this month it indicated it would be taking 'tough measures' to cope with the
industry-wide malaise. These may include factory closures and narrowing the
products range.
"We have had an enormous setback with all the problems in the consumer
electronics industry - overcapacity, price wars and a decline in demand,' Mr
Timmer said.

FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japan's steel groups hard hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading steel makers yesterday confirmed the severity of the
downturn hitting the country's manufacturing industry by reporting declines
in first-half profits of up to 85 per cent.
All the leading steel makers warned that business conditions would not
improve in the second half of this financial year despite the government's
Y10.7bn emergency spending package announced in August.
Sumitomo Metal said its pre-tax profit fell by 85 per cent from the first
half of last year to Y3.32bn (Dollars 26.77m).
Sales fell nearly 10 per cent to Y513.6bn. It said it hoped its recent
stainless steel merger with Nippon Stainless Steel would lead to higher
profitability in the second half of the year.
Operating income fell by 52 per cent to Y27bn while net income was 73 per
cent down at Y4.3bn. Despite the sharp fall, it is maintaining its interim
dividend at Y3.
Crude steel production was 4.8m tonnes, down from 5.5m tonnes in last year's
first half.
Nippon Steel, the country's largest steel maker, reported a 74.3 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y14.1bn, on a 6.5 per cent fall in sales to
Y1,187bn.
Nippon Steel produced 12.4m tonnes in the first half of the year, down 2m
tonnes from the first half of 1991. It said the economy would be stagnant
until next spring, with steel production sharply down.
Kawasaki Steel's first-half pre-tax profits fell by 84 per cent.
It said: 'The Japanese economy showed increasing signs of stagnation with
private sector equipment investment continuing to decline and individual
consumption falling into recession.' Its steel output was 11.6 per cent down
at 4.9m tonnes, with sales down 5.5 per cent at Y559bn.
Operating income was 61 per cent down at Y17.8bn, while net income fell to
Y3bn from Y15bn last year.
Kobe Steel's first-half sales dropped by 12.5 per cent to Y578bn, with
pre-tax profits 75.4 per cent down at Y7bn. Operating income was 50.4 per
cent down at Y29.7bn.
NKK suffered a 55 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y6bn, largely due to a
Y17bn increase in income from financial transactions, such as the sale of
stocks and shares.
Overall sales inched up by 1.5 per cent to Y605bn, but costs also rose
sharply largely due to a change in accounting for construction projects.
Nisshin Steel reported a 61 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y6bn, on a
5.6 per cent fall in sales of ordinary steel products.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERNOD Ricard, the French drinks group, yesterday warned that it would miss
its earlier indications of a 6 per cent increase in 1992 net profits, so
triggering a run on its shares.
The group, producer of the aperitif which bears its name, plus a range of
wines, spirits and soft drinks, published an underlying 5.9 per cent rise in
turnover to FFr10.34bn (Dollars 1.91bn) for the first three quarters of the
year. Excluding adjustments for disposals, sales fell by 6.7 per cent,
within which turnover in the third quarter was down by 12 per cent to
FFr3.46bn.
Either way, the result was below market expectations, and a reflection of
weaker than expected consumer demand.
The shares fell by FFr 34.4 to FFr399.1 in Paris yesterday.
Pernod Ricard managed a 7.3 per cent rise in net profits last year, to
FFr956m excluding exceptional gains.

FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dasa faces sharp decline in new
orders

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa), German aircraft maker, faces a sharp decline in
new orders and the two most difficult years in its history, according to Mr
Jurgen Schrempp, chairman.
New contracts signed this year will be worth less than DM15bn, against the
DM22bn originally expected. The decline is all the more dramatic since
Dasa's parent, Daimler-Benz, said in its half-year report it still expected
1992 orders to increase.
In the first nine months new contracts had been signed to a value of
DM9.7bn, against DM11.5bn in the comparable part of 1991.
Even so, Mr Schrempp said in an interview with a German news agency, the
industry would see an improvement in the medium and long term. Dasa's recent
stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, laid the foundations for a
successful European regional aircraft maker.
He was also optimistic that the project for 'a version' of the
politically-smitten European Fighter Aircraft (Efa) would go ahead. He said
he was confident ministers and air force leaders, due to meet this month and
next would give the go-ahead.
In the meantime, Dasa has DM38bn of orders on hand, compared with DM40bn
last year. Despite difficulties, Dasa would have a positive operating result
and make a major contribution to Daimler's earnings this year, Mr Schrempp
claimed. It made DM50m profit on sales of DM12.3bn last year. But he also
spoke of hefty provisions to pay for capacity cuts.
The company recently announced the loss of 7,500 jobs over the next two
years, and warned that more will go if Efa is cancelled.

HONDA Motor, the Japanese automobile manufacture, yesterday unveiled its
first falls in sales and profits for 25 years while rival Mazda Motor
reported a 73 per cent drop to Y3bn (Dollars 24.2m) in pre-tax profits in
the first six months. The figures underline the impact which depressed world
car markets are having on Japanese car manufacturers.
The downturn is clearly separating the Japanese car industry into two broad
groups. It is taking its heaviest toll upon Nissan, which declared a first
half loss and Mazda, which is carrying a heavy burden of investment in a
modernised product range.
In contrast Toyota and Honda have managed to moderate the impact of falling
demand upon their finances, through tighter cost control.
This sharp divergence in the manufacturers' financial performance has
prompted some analysts to speculate that the Japanese industry, which has
nine major car producers, may be consolidated if the downturn proves to be
prolonged.
Both Mazda and Honda warned the downturn would last well into next year.
Mazda, which recently announced its was scrapping plans for a second luxury
car sales channel in the US, reported net profits down by 85.4 per cent to
Y621m, or Y0.57 per share.
Turnover rose by 2.4 per cent to Y1,129bn from the first half of last year,
largely because of the introduction of more sophisticated models has
increased the average price of Mazda' product line.
Factory unit sales were 6.1 per cent down at 646,676, with cars down by 1.9
per cent at 513,982 and commercial vehicle unit sales 19 per cent down at
132,694. Domestic unit sales registered a 10 per cent decline at 250,730,
while exports advanced by 3.4 per cent to 395,946.
Honda's pre-tax profits in the six months to September fell by 12.2 per to
Y29bn, on sales of Y1,343bn, a 7.2 per cent drop on the first half of last
year.
After-tax profits were 7 per cent down at Y15bn or Y15.5 a share.
Its motorcycle sales rose by 11.4 per cent to Y69bn in the Japanese market.
Sales of four wheel vehicles fell by 8.5 per cent to Y419bn in Japan and by
14 per cent to Y582bn in overseas markets, largely because of the downturn
in the US market.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Nestle in discussions for purchase of
Clarke Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE yesterday confirmed that it was in talks over the possible purchase
of Clarke Foods, Britain's second largest ice cream manufacturer which went
into receivership last month.
If Nestle managed to win Clarke, it would be the Swiss-owned company's first
foray into the UK ice cream market.
It is not the only bidder, however, with industry sources citing Mars and
Grand Metropolitan as possible candidates. The discussions could end as
early as next week.
Receivers Robson Rhodes were unavailable for comment but they are believed
to be considering several options which could affect the final sale price.
These could range from a creditors' voluntary agreement to a separate sale
of the assets and the brands, which include Lyons Maid.
Clarke paid Allied Lyons just Pounds 7.5m of the Pounds 12m agreed price for
Lyons Maid last year before it went into receivership with debts of about
Pounds 25m.
Industry observers said the deal would make sense for Nestle, which has ice
cream interests in the US and continental Europe. The highly acquisitive
group has invested an average of SFr2bn (Pounds 900m) annually on expansion
and restructuring over the past five years.
Clarke's state of the art manufacturing plant would be particularly
attractive to the likes of Nestle. Delays on the installation of this
equipment during the hottest summer months were behind Clarke's collapse.
Mr Henry D Clarke, its former chairman, has abandoned his attempts to buy
the business back from the receivers.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McLEOD Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor, has approached
Wheway, the battling Midlands clean air and design engineering group, with a
view to a possible merger.
Wheway's announcement yesterday of 'preliminary' merger discussions was
coupled with a warning that the engineering group's pre-tax loss in the year
to October would exceed last year's Pounds 720,000 deficit.
Wheway's shares fell 5p to 12p, down from a high this year of 34p, knocking
its market value to Pounds 9.8m.
A deal may see McLeod obtain the engineering arm it wants, while bringing
badly needed finance to Wheway to help it accelerate development of its main
businesses.
McLeod, which reported a 9 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profit on
Thursday, is in the hunt for a new business to add to its paints division
and textile machinery operation. It has a strong balance sheet with net cash
balance reserves of Pounds 10m.
Wheway has struggled to make profits in the past two years from its core
businesses to cover interest charges and costs from its shift out of heavy
engineering.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A Yorkshireman's idea of glasnost - 'If we
can't avoid it, let's . . . put all issues on the table'. Neil Buckley
reports on British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is more than a touch of Yorkshire bluntness to Mr Cedric Brown's
description of the management culture of British Gas.
'Bureaucratic, slow-moving, committee-ridden, resistant to change,' is what
can only be described as his no-nonsense assessment.
These criticisms are not new, but to hear them from the man responsible for
the day-to-day running of British Gas is new, and may presage more sweeping
change ahead. Indeed, Mr Brown uses the word 'change' almost as often as Mr
Bill Clinton.
British Gas reports its third-quarter results this week, and most analysts
are forecasting losses of between Pounds 90m and Pounds 200m for what is
traditionally a low-demand period. Net income for the year is still expected
to be about about Pounds 1bn; but beyond that British Gas faces great
uncertainty as the structure of the UK gas market changes.
In his first interview since taking over as chief executive in August, Mr
Brown told the Financial Times that his biggest challenge was to change the
culture of British Gas. The attack of glasnost that has broken out in the
company is the first stage of that process - something the 57-year-old
Yorkshireman, who began his career as a gas distribution engineer in 1953,
is happy to take personal credit for.
'If it had been a corporate desire, if it had been discussed, the British
Gas culture would have taken over and the words would have been different
words, and there would have been a lot of paddling around, and it would
never have emerged.'
The most significant changes that may be imposed on British Gas are outside
the company's control, but Mr Brown was largely responsible for the decision
to put the company in this position.
The day before he officially took over as chief executive, he announced that
British Gas had taken the unprecedented step of submitting itself, and the
whole of the UK gas market, to a wide-ranging inquiry by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The move, he says, was a reaction to 'piecemeal' regulatory changes imposed
by Sir James McKinnon, the industry regulator, and the Office of Fair
Trading, which left the company facing deep uncertainty over its future.
Although Sir James was already proposing a reference to the MMC on the issue
of the rate of return British Gas could earn on its pipeline and storage
business, Mr Brown feels he seized the initiative by seeking a comprehensive
inquiry.
'My feeling was, if we can't avoid it, let's have one reference that puts
all the issues on the table, and let's see where that gets us.
'At the end we might not like the answer, but at least we might then be out
of the uncertainty.'
Other than defending its record, Mr Brown is not prepared to say what
British Gas will be telling the MMC. But he accepts the possibility that the
commission could order a radical shake-up of the company, even its break-up.
'We view the inquiry positively. We will face up to whatever they say. By
nature I'm an optimist, so whatever comes out I will view it optimistically,
because I see opportunities whatever.'
While the future overall shape of British Gas may now hinge on the findings
of the MMC, however, Mr Brown is pressing ahead with his own programme of
change.
As managing director of regional operations he had already seen through a
reorganisation that resulted in the loss of 2,000 jobs. One of his first
moves as chief executive was to call in McKinsey, the management
consultants, to conduct a wide-ranging review of BG's 4,000-strong corporate
centre. Every function will be under scrutiny.
Job cuts are almost certain, and Mr Brown said his intention was to make
BG's central management 'lean and mean'.
'But not just lean and mean in the numerical sense - it will certainly be
that - but focused on what the corporate centre should be.'
Two weeks ago Mr Brown further stamped his identity on the company through a
reshuffle of the top jobs. The changes may look like a game of musical
chairs, but Mr Brown insisted they and the McKinsey review are part of the
same plan: to take a 'can-opener' to the management and 'get rid of the
spaghetti'.
This means cutting the bureaucracy, reducing the number of committees,
devolving more responsibility to the heads of British Gas's different
business units and at the same time making them more accountable, and
promoting more young blood.
Management may need an overhaul, but Mr Brown is proud of BG's record on
safety and service - reiterating one of British Gas's proudest boasts that
it is second in terms of customer approval ratings only to Marks and
Spencer, the retailing chain.
'My objective is to overtake Marks and Spencer,' he said. 'We are closing
the gap.'
That British Gas should be anxious to outperform a leading retailing chain
while at the same time trying to take on the oil majors at their own game is
a measure of the size and scope of British Gas now.
Whatever the MMC decides, BG is likely to face a fall in earnings from its
UK gas business, which has made the drive for international expansion all
the more urgent. Mr Brown says British Gas is on track to achieve the target
set by Mr Evans of increasing the share of group earnings from exploration
and production and Global Gas to 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.
Another Brown review is taking place of Global Gas, the international gas
supply and services division, to identify the best openings and strategies.
One important aim is to begin to tie together exploration and production and
Global Gas in some areas, making British Gas a company that explores for
gas, produces it, and supplies it right to the burner tip. On the
exploration side, BG's chief executive says the company has enough reserves
and exploration acreage to enable it to become a significant force in oil
and gas exploration. The jewel in the crown is Karachaganak, the 20,000bn
cubic feet gas field in Kazakhstan for which British Gas and Agip have
exclusive negotiating rights.
'I have always believed that as I am promoted into a different job, whatever
I am . . . it was good enough to get me into that job, so for Christ's sake
don't change. You've been lucky so far, so stay with it, and maybe you will
go a bit further.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Booker shares fall 27p on profit forecast
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Booker, the food group, fell 27p yesterday to 345p, adding to a
fall of 22p on Thursday, to cut the shares by 12.4 per cent over two days.
The share price fall was in response to cuts in profit forecasts for the
group following management changes in the group's Booker Fitch food services
subsidiary, a wholesaler serving the catering market.
Stockbrokers have reduced forecasts for pre-tax profits in the current year
to around Pounds 90m from earlier estimates of Pounds 98m to Pounds 100m,
compared with Pounds 103.9m reported for 1991.
Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive of Booker, said the strategy behind the
acquisition of Fitch Lovell in September 1990 was still valid. The catering
market, for example, should return to growth as the recession ended and the
trend to eating more meals outside the home resumed, he said.
He said that 'a good bit more' could be done to improve efficiency in the
Booker Fitch food services business, which could be 'better accomplished by
a new management team'. The subsidiary was in the process of renegotiating
contracts with some of its large customers which run chains of restaurants.
As well as difficult trading conditions, the profits are expected to be
depressed by an exceptional charge of around Pounds 5m covering
rationalisation costs in the subsidiary, part of Booker's food distribution
division. Analysts said they expected some depot closures and job losses.
Brokers said that on forecasts of Pounds 90m the dividend cover will be slim
if the final dividend is held at last year's level of 14.25p. However,
analysts expect the decision on the dividend, to be taken in March next
year, will reflect trading conditions at that time.
If the dividend is maintained the shares will yield 8.4 per cent.
In Booker Fitch food services, Mr John Black has been replaced as managing
director of the business by Mr Tony Noble, who has been one of the
divisional directors. Mr Black is currently on holiday.
Mr Tony Moss has been replaced as operations director by Mr Fred Barnes who
is moving across from another company within the division. Mr Moss has
resigned from Booker.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dan-Air doctor to explain failure to
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS who have lost their entire investment in Davies &amp; Newman,
parent company of Dan-Air, will this weekend receive a lengthy explanation
of what went wrong from Mr David James, the erstwhile company
doctor-chairman.
His story of how the UK's oldest independent airline lost that independence
to British Airways is told in a circular to shareholders, who will be asked
to approve the winding up of Davies &amp; Newman at an extraordinary meeting on
December 7.
The document ranges back to 1922, when Davies &amp; Newman was launched in
shipping, and to 1953 when Dan-Air started flying. It ended up as the
largest operator at Gatwick with more than a fifth of the slots, a mantle
that BA will assume via the Pounds 1 takeover.
Mr James was called in two years ago and the first refinancing involved
extending the bank borrowing limit to Pounds 80m. In October last year
another crisis was averted by a Pounds 49.3m rescue rights issue.
How it all unravelled is explained in the circular, which covers:
Talks with 20 airlines - including Virgin Atlantic, British Midland and Air
UK, plus ones from continental Europe, the US and the Far East;
How interim operating losses snowballed to Pounds 24m through lower than
expected passenger numbers and yields;
How escalating cancellations hit the charter operation. In June the
cancellation rate approached 10 per cent. By August it was running at more
than 25 per cent.
Balance sheet problems arising from the need to sell old-fashioned aircraft
for much less than book value. As the net worth of the company fell, so did
the borrowing limit. This autumn the banks, which had received Pounds 8.75m
in special fees, had virtually no exposure to the company;
The company's last business plan envisaged cutting net losses to a couple of
million next year. The devaluation of the pound led to another Pounds 10m
being added to that estimate.
In late September, Mr James tried to pull together a combination of new
money from institutions and Pounds 10m from the personal fortune of Mr
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways.
When Mr Branson pulled out, Mr James said he was desperate. Final calls and
faxes to the heads of other airlines received just one positive response,
from Lord King of BA, which earlier in the summer walked away from the idea
of chartering Dan-Air to run some scheduled services from Gatwick.
In return for taking on Pounds 35m of liabilities - including Pounds 13m of
ticket holders, BA has acquired 12 relatively new Boeing 737s and 14 of
Dan-Air's 29 scheduled services. The charter business has closed.
The letting down of shareholders has raised some questions about the
handling of the episode by Mr James, who has also been involved as company
doctor at Lep Group, the freight forwarding and security concern.
Was it wise to expand the scheduled side in a recession? Did he cut costs
quickly and deeply enough? Did he take on too much in heading both Davies &amp;
Newman and Lep? Did he act soon enough to try to bring in a trading partner?
Did he do more for the banks than the shareholders?
He admits that shareholders might feel the urge to take him by the scruff of
the neck. (Bankers, however, might want to shake his hand.) With Dan-Air
disposed of, he is once again under pressure from the City to take on
another company in intensive care.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hanson drops bid for RHM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, formally dropped its bid for Ranks
Hovis McDougall yesterday. The bid, of 220p a share in cash, had been
superseded by a higher offer from Tomkins, another industrial conglomerate.
A week ago Hanson said it would not increase its bid, effectively
withdrawing.
Hanson had received acceptances from holders of 93,691 RHM shares by late
yesterday.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: YRM share price dives 11p on dividend
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of architects YRM fell from 40p to 29p yesterday after the
company warned that it planned to cut its interim dividend following a loss
during the six months to the end of October.
The group said that it expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds
500,000 for the half year to October 31.
As a result, it expected to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p per share,
against 1.65p last time when the group announced profits of Pounds 534,000.
The company yesterday blamed redundancy costs and fierce competition in a
much reduced construction market for its latest set-back.
It said that redundancy costs of about Pounds 280,000 would result in
savings which would benefit the group in the second half.
YRM added that markets had continued to be very difficult and that it would
decide the level of the final dividend in the light of the results for the
full year.
The continuing slide in architects' workloads is worrying for the rest of
the construction industry, such as contractors and building material
suppliers which win contracts much later in the building cycle.
YRM has already cut is final dividend once, from 3.35p to 2.35p, making a
total of 4p (5p) for the year to April 30 1992 when pre-tax profits fell by
31 per cent to Pounds 1.37m.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help push Bimec Industries
Pounds 7.87m into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIMEC INDUSTRIES, the engineering and waste treatment company where there
was a boardroom shuffle in September, has tumbled from pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3m to losses of Pounds 7.87m in the six months to September 30.
There is no interim dividend: last time 0.67p was paid and the final for the
year to March 31 was cancelled shortly before the August annual meeting.
Mr Roy Barber, the company doctor brought in to replace Mr Sam Smith as
chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that the final dividend shock -
coupled at the time with a 20 per cent fall in production and growing
liquidity problems - meant that he had had to do 'a lot of hard talking' to
staunch the flow of business away from Bimec. He also negotiated a further
Pounds 4m facility with Lloyds Bank for general working capital
requirements.
He said that his job now was to reduce gearing from its current 269 per cent
level - at the March year-end it had been 60 per cent - and that meant
taking the group back five years through a divestment programme.
He said he was in discussions with 'three operations interested in the aero
and industrial technology division'. He said the recent devaluation of
sterling had made it more valuable. Much of its turnover is in US dollars or
is dollar-driven; users of the technology include airlines and off-shore oil
companies.
Mr Barber is talking to two parties interested in the environmental
engineering division but said that the cash price would be low. It is
essentially a mechanical and electrical contractor in large buildings hit by
the downturn in the building industry and a general building maintenance
concern built up by Mr Smith. This latter includes Pearl Holdings, acquired
for 3.25m shares then valued at 19 1/2 p each.
These disposals would leave the core water and waste treatment division rump
which 'has considerable experience' and operates in legislation-driven
markets with 'substantial medium- and long-term potential'.
The division recently won a Dollars 2.25m (Pounds 1.49m) plant order from
Coca Cola for a canning facility in Poland. Mr Barber said Bimec would
pursue the soft drinks maker for more orders.
Turnover shrank to Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 53.1m), partly because of the
decline in the mechanical and electrical contracting side, but also because
of the timing of contracts and their completion. Mr Barber said he expected
second-half turnover to return to the Pounds 50m mark if no disposals were
completed.
Operating losses of Pounds 3.43m (profits Pounds 3.52m) were compounded by
exceptional charges of Pounds 3.69m relating to closure, redundancy and
reorganisation as well as provisions for stock deficits and work in progress
valuations. 'There's not much else to come,' said Mr Barber. Losses per
share emerged at 7.1p (earnings 2.6p).
Since the departure of Mr Smith, Mr Bernard Wheeler, a non-executive
director, has resigned and Mr David Dare and Mr Frank Edwards, both
non-executives, have tendered their resignations.

FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: SE lifts suspension on GPG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment vehicle, is due to return to the stock
market on Monday after agreeing with the Stock Exchange that a suspension
lasting nearly two years should be lifted.
The Exchange suspended GPG in 1990 because it was regarded as a 'shell'
company without any real underlying businesses. GPG has since been
restructured. Although the company is still only a holding company, the
Exchange has withdrawn its reservations.
GPG's main asset is a 54.6 per cent stake in Tyndall Australia, a life
insurance and fund management company. GPG also owns 86.3 per cent of MEM, a
small Australian resources company, Eagle, a US investment manager, and
various other listed and unlisted investments.
GPG had proforma net assets per share of 16.2p at the end of October. Its
shares, which also trade in New Zealand, closed at 15.1p yesterday.
Mr Blake Nixon, director, said the company was looking to make small
investments in UK 'special situations' to balance its portfolio better. The
company generates no turnover in the UK at present. It does not plan to pay
dividends, partly because of advance corporation tax liability and partly
because it hopes for capital growth.
GPG was last month criticised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, which
oversees corporate reporting, for adopting newly drafted accounting
standards too hastily in order to flatter profits. The standards have now
come into force, so the results were allowed to stand.
The company is changing its year end and in the nine months to June 30
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.15m. This compared with Pounds 10.9m in
the year to September 30, since adjusted to a loss of Pounds 27.4m to
reflect goodwill previously written off.
Tyndall Australia reported a sharp decline in pre-tax profits in the six
months to June 30 of ADollars 3.59m (Pounds 1.63). This compared with
profits of Dollars 12.9m in the year to December 31. Mr Nixon said the
company witnessed a weak first quarter, but the second half is expected to
be better. The company has retained losses of Dollars 19.3m.
GPG will hold an extraordinary meeting next year and proposes to change its
name back to Guinness Peat Group, as it was known until 1987.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Accounts that yield anger: Britain's banks face rising
customer protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As befits a man with a shiny metal hook where his right hand used to be, Mr
Chris Joseph has a colourful tale to tell. It contains lurid accusations of
treachery and betrayal by a high-street bank, culminating in the alleged
plundering of the logo designed by his advertising agency.
Mr Joseph, a former Benedictine monk and nightclub bouncer who lost his hand
in a foundry accident, is unperturbed by bankers' private mutterings that he
is a crank. 'You talk to anyone, and they have a horror story about their
bank. We cranks are the ones they used to call customers,' he says.
This week saw the launch of his latest effort to embarrass Barclays Bank
over its treatment of himself and other small business people. The Struggle
Against Financial Exploitation (Safe) campaign group was unveiled at
Methodist Central Hall in Westminster in a meeting packed with disgruntled
bank customers.
The other founder of Safe is no less interesting. Mr Brian Jones is a
property developer embroiled in a row with Barclays over a Pounds 393,000
loan. He has protested by detonating 400 stink bombs in 87 Barclays
branches, and towing a mobile poster bearing his complaints past the bank's
head office in the City.
Messrs Jones and Joseph started their campaign by calling for all Barclays
customers to withdraw their money from the bank on a single day to test its
solvency. They also want to get shareholders of the high-street banks to
force inquiries into their management under the Companies Act.
Safe is not alone in trying to marshal the resentment of small businesses
against big banks. Lloyds Bank has been faced by the Bank Action Group
(Bag), formed by Mrs Patricia Griffiths, a small business owner from Preston
who was charged Pounds 14,000 too much interest on her loans.
The emergence of a nascent consumer movement in banking comes at a sensitive
time for the clearing banks. They are getting squeezed between their unhappy
customers and shareholders dissatisfied at falls in pre-tax profits as they
make large provisions for bad loans from the 1980s.
As they struggle to regain their standing in the eyes of investors by being
more conservative about lending, they are reducing overdraft facilities and
not fully passing on base rate cuts to the interest rates they charge on
loans. The result has been discontent.
There are signs that public protest is an effective weapon. Safe's tactics -
such as selling T-shirts with abusive slogans about banks - expose it to
accusations of eccentricity. But in some cases it has also encouraged banks
to offer to write off bad loans, providing such arrangements are secret.
The precedents are not good for the clearers. Similar grumblings by the
banks about the tactics of third-world countries which threatened to default
on loans in the 1980s proved ineffective. They were forced to reschedule
payments, and have continued to make large provisions against problem loans.
Nor is it easy to dismiss the small business protests as just loud noises
made by a few eccentrics. It is questionable how many customers Bag and Safe
represent. But it is hard to deny the broader growth of consumer resentment
that is increasingly pushing the banks on to the defensive.
The growth of dissatisfaction among personal customers is already clear. The
Consumers' Association last week published a survey of 3,700 members which
found one in 10 thought they had been incorrectly charged on personal
accounts, and one in five reported mistakes in standing orders and direct
debits.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, says rising
levels of discontent partly reflect the general growth of confidence among
consumers. But she thinks they also stem from banks adopting a harder line
as they try to raise income from fees.
Personal customers' gripes are proving hard to stem. A Code of Banking
Practice was introduced in March after two years of negotiations between
banks and consumer groups. However, complaints to the banking ombudsman,
which rose from 3,915 in 1990 to 6,327 in 1991, have increased further this
year.
Yet small business dissatisfaction is fast becoming an even trickier matter
for the banks. Both the code of practice and banking ombudsman scheme are
limited to personal customers. Small businesses have not been given an
independent forum for complaints, and have resorted more to public protest.
The banks have tried to counter the wave of unhappiness by producing their
own codes of conduct in dealing with small business. Lloyds Bank is mailing
copies of a revised 'small business charter' to 350,000 customers this
month, and has promised them advance notice of account charges.
The banks say they are paying the price of not telling customers clearly
enough about loans and overdrafts. 'We have learned that communication is
important, and we are trying to establish a much closer dialogue,' says Mr
Phil Nunnerley, assistant general manager for retail banking at Lloyds.
Talking more, and apologising for mistakes more promptly, may help. But no
matter how open they are now, the banks are stuck with many poor loans.
Barclays has been writing off loans from its Pounds 13bn portfolio with
small businesses at a rate of Pounds 1m a day for 18 months.
'There were clearly cases in the late 1980s where we were not conservative
enough about loans,' says Mr David Lavarack, Barclays' head of small
business services. The banks now have to balance caution with keeping a
healthy asset base. 'There is no question of us turning off the tap,' he
says.
One result of these woes is that banks may be more firm in asking small
businesses to take out fixed-term loans rather than the overdrafts they have
tended to prefer. The flexibility of an overdraft facility in the 1980s has
been painfully balanced by the abruptness with which some have been
curtailed in the 1990s.
A second result is that banks are being careful not to provoke the wrath of
small businesses where they can avoid it. National Westminster and Barclays
both reduced their minimum lending rates for small business loans this week
to allow them promptly to respond to Thursday's base rate cut.
But nerves are likely to stay tender for some time. Mr Joseph tells an
apocryphal story about the loss of his right hand. 'Some people think
Barclays have got my arm, and now they are after one of my legs.' It is not
the sort of joke that provokes much mirth among bankers these days.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Case for pension fund exposure to equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGERT C URWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current criticism of pension fund exposure to equities that Barry
Riley has raided ('Too many eggs in one basket', November 11) seems
perilously close to an outbreak of short-termism in a world in which
long-termism is vital for pension fund health. There is a danger that the
wrong funds will surge back into bonds, which the government will be only
too willing to supply. Is this sensible in the 'more familiar climate of
devaluation' referred to?
It seems vital to divide pension funds into two groups. The first covers the
majority of members of occupational pension funds, those which have time
horizons long enough to invest heavily in equities throughout the economic
cycle. Here, the 'balanced fund' system has worked exceptionally well. The
second group, which is growing, is where time horizons are shorter because
of the maturity of their liabilities or the precariousness of their
discontinuance solvency. Such funds often need more balance in their asset
strategies than the classic balanced fund provides them (with its current 85
per cent in equities).
The dangers in the situation are not so much to do with the economic climate
and today's equity values as with tomorrow's liability calls and more
relevant asset planning.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Pay clamp on public sector will depress economy in
short term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH FLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's article on the government's attempt to impose a 1.5
per cent pay ceiling ('Public pay feels the squeeze', November 13) focuses
on the possible longer-term impact of a restriction on public sector pay.
But a pay ceiling, which is likely to have as big, or as little, an impact
in the private as the public sector, also has immediate implications. First,
if what amounts to a wage cut is carried through, this will do little to
reflate the economy. Demand will be depressed further.
Second, if wages are reined in but prices and profits are left where they
are, this will do little to move Britain towards Mr Major's dream of a
classless society. For example, how can a rise of between 7 and 8 per cent
in British Rail and London Transport fares be justified against a maximum
1.5 per cent pay rise?
Since 1979, the government has put forward some very good arguments about
why government intervention in wage settlements does not work. These still
seem to have considerable validity, despite this latest U-turn.

Sir, Your graph ('Bank urges stable prices', November 12) showing the price
level over the last 700 years makes one point very clearly. Prices were
stable until King Henry VIII became Supreme Head of the Church in England.
Surely this demonstrates (at least as well as anything is demonstrated in
economics) that what we need for price stability is not an independent Bank
of England but an independent Church of England.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Better way of influencing UK wage expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GRENIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by Professors Layard and Bean ('Shut the stable door',
November 4) is right in highlighting the inability to keep wage growth under
control as the Achilles' heel of the UK economy. Disappointingly, the
framework of their analysis appears inadequate and their proposed solution
deeply flawed.
It is facile to blame current problems on the wage inflation of the late
1980s. The real problems are longer term and cultural and need longer-term
solutions. I use the word cultural because UK labour and management have
consistently pursued the objective of achieving and maintaining real income
growth both in times of recovery and recession. Evidence of this goes back
at least to the inter-war years.
Also disappointing is the view that the current recession was intended to
bring wage inflation down from an annual rate of increase of about 9 per
cent to 5 per cent. This rate of wage increase is in excess of both
long-term and short-term productivity trends. The implications for
international competitiveness are, as usual, negative.
Equally wanting is the Layard and Bean solution: another committee to
monitor wage relativities in the public and private sectors. The UK problem
is not primarily one of relativities but one of an overall level of wage
increase.
The lead must come from government and from appropriate long-term policies.
The government's current approach is not encouraging: declaring a victory as
a prelude to withdrawing from the battlefield inspires no confidence.
The acceptance of a 5 per cent annual increase in UK wages under
recessionary conditions is out of line with thinking in most EC countries.
And if the government wants to see how to deal with a long-term cultural
problem on wage growth, it could consider the French experience over the
past decade.
How could the government help to influence wage expectations? First, by
controlling the rate of wage increases in the public sector. Second, by
setting tighter inflation targets expressed in terms of core rather than
headline inflation. Third, by making a specific commitment to apply to
return to the European exchange rate mechanism as soon as sufficient
convergence has taken place and defining what is meant by sufficient
convergence. Fourth, by targeting the reduction of PSBR as a proportion of
GDP, if necessary through income tax surcharges related to the extent by
which wages run ahead of inflation and productivity.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Into the valley of dearth: The British army in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welcome to the Wild West. This comes from Sinisha, interpreter and guide.
Then his grin widens. He has a better thought. Welcome to Disneyland.
The road north into the mountains of Bosnia goes through some of the wildest
country in Europe. But it also takes you far into the realm of the surreal.
Anybody unaware that they were skirting a war zone would find out at
Tomislavgrad, which lies in a bowl of farm country. In Tito's Yugoslavia it
was called Duvno, but now has its old Croat name back. It is crawling with
the HVO, the Bosnian Croat army holding this front against the Bosnian
Serbs. The patrol station is barricaded with sandbags. There is no diesel.
The town is a staging post and logistics base for the British army, now
moving armoured vehicles up north to protect aid convoys on behalf of the
United Nations. The operation involves more logistics personnel - about
1,000, plus 400 engineers on temporary assignment - than fighting soldiers.
'The locals are amazed by this stuff. They ask why we need all this kit. And
we're not here to fight a war,' an officer says. The Brits have rechristened
the town Tommygrad. Carefully laid plans of the British Army of the Rhine
have been transplanted here. So has the menu outside the cookhouse tent:
Pork snitzels mit sauce.
They are still waiting for beds and wardrobes to arrive from Split on the
Croatian coast. They have ironing boards, but no irons yet.
The warning sirens went off in town the other day. It is within artillery
range of Serb positions. The British rely on the HVO to keep them up to
date. One HVO battalion here is commanded by an Australian, the other by a
German-Canadian. From recent movements it is assumed 'they're up to
something'.
Further up the road is a village, Rascane, where several hundred local Serbs
were installed, under guard, after being collected from the town and
surrounding area some months ago.
Steering away from the battle lines, which make it impossible to join the
main road, the route soon breaks off into a wet muddy track. The Land Rover,
courtesy of BBC Radio, comes into its own. This has become known as the Ho
Chi Minh Trail. It is pegged all along the way with the arcane symbols used
on British army route markings.
The road winds up into pine forests, over barren stony heathland and back
into wooded mountains broken by cliffs. Royal Engineers have been working
fast to create passing places and much of the track has been widened. But
the traffic is heavy: old lorries carrying timber or livestock, improvised
petrol tankers, consignments from Islamic aid organisations, coaches. Above
a glorious valley we hit a stupendous traffic jam. After 40 minutes another
convoy suddenly appears in the distance, a sight as chilling as a line of
Apache braves appearing on the ridge.
Back on a brief stretch of tarmac we pass through the gutted town of Prozor,
scene of a flare-up two weeks ago between Croats and Moslems. House-fronts
have been smashed or shot up, some houses burnt. A jeep is marked with the
initials of the Croat neo-fascist HOS organisation.
After Gornji Vakuf, the checkpoint is for the first time manned by Moslem
rather than Croat soldiers, smoking and dangling their Kalashnikov
look-alike rifles. Checkpoints are mostly less of a hazard on the route than
bulldozers, sheep and pack donkeys. But one encountered later on in the dark
requires driving around the land mines.
'Vitez? I wouldn't go there. Kate Adie's there,' a sergeant-major had said
at Tomislavgrad. The presence of the high-profile BBC television reporter is
to the army something like a royal visit. It is also another major logistics
exercise.
After more rough track through a ravine, the approach to Vitez, which lies
on an arterial road west of Sarajevo, appears tame and civilised, strung
with respectable family homes. From Split we are 75 miles away as the crow
flies. The journey has taken 7 1/2 hours.
The British have rented a 1970s-style school here as battalion headquarters.
The bulk of the 800 troops to be stationed here is arriving over the next
few days. Most will have to live at the start in tents. A few tents have
just blown down in a rain squall.
A big bang shakes the school windows. It turns out to have been an HVO 205mm
howitzer fired from near the church. Later on, in the early morning, bursts
of automatic weapon fire can be heard in the distance.
The Cheshire Regiment has brought with it a small selection of regimental
silver to brighten up the room used as the officers' mess. There are also
framed copies of some of its pictures. One in the corridor commemorates the
Sind campaign of 1843.
In some respects, for all the high technology of modern soldiering, Vitez is
no less remote. They have just managed to get proper cups for tea. But
British newspapers arrive three days late.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Use of food additives essential to urban living
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL MACKENZIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Prawn crisps and politics' (November 10), starts from
the unfortunate assumption that foods which contain additives cannot be
"full of taste and goodness".
It is worth pointing out that even so-called "natural" food materials are
not all attractive or even safe to eat in their natural state. If untreated,
they will deteriorate. The use of additives to preserve foods is therefore
crucial.
Without additives it would be impossible to feed our modern urban
population. There would be a dramatic reduction in the number and variety of
foods available, and a significant increase in food poisoning and food-borne
diseases.
The increase in the approved additives when the Single European Act comes
into force does not mean a lowering of standards, because every additive
must still undergo stringent safety checks by independent scientists at EC
level. An "E" initial signifies that an additive has passed those tests.
Your readers may be interested to know that the standards are so high that
many so-called "natural" foods, including the potato, would fail because of
their minute quantities of toxin.
A small proportion of people may be intolerant to some additives. However,
while between 0.01 per cent and 0.2 per cent of the population may be
intolerant to food additives such as tartrazine, between one and two people
in every 100 are intolerant to certain constituents of milk.
The food industry recognises that labelling information is important to help
people avoid the ingredients to which they may be intolerant and, in
association with the Royal College of Physicians and the British Dietetic
Association, the Food and Drink Federation has set up a databank listing
more than 4,000 branded food products free of ingredients that may cause
adverse reactions. Michael Mackenzie

FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: . . . and trouble with Elizabeth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J WITHERS GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Norman's article, 'Bank urges stable prices' (November 12),
included a fascinating chart plotting 700 years of British inflation. Since
1300, it seems that there have been two 50-year periods that have suffered
from rampant inflation: the second halves of the 16th and 20th centuries.
Perhaps the various anti-inflation policies of the last 20 years have missed
the point; the simple answer being not to have a queen called Elizabeth.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The gamble on UK pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAY POLICY by any other name would smell as foul. So, certainly, employees
in the public sector are likely to feel. The government is gambling on the
docility of the public sector and the common sense of the private sector.
But this government likes gambling. The question is whether the government
manages at last to win a bet against what look like long odds.
The Pounds 1.5bn saved by the government's limit of 1 1/2 per cent on public
sector pay increases is the most significant covert tax measure in the
chancellor's autumn mini-budget, equivalent to a little less than 1p on the
basic rate of income tax. But it is also a potentially highly unpopular,
selective control on the pay of about 30 per cent of those in employment.
Any selective pay policy is open to objection as distorting and unfair. In
his Autumn Statement, Mr Lamont argued in justification that the earnings of
public sector employees had risen 20 per cent over the past two years, as
against 13 per cent in the private sector. But this represents catching up,
since average weekly earnings in the private sector had risen by 14 per cent
relative to those in the public sector between 1981 and 1990.
What the chancellor could have also said is that the government is
inescapably responsible for pay in the public sector and that attempts to
impose an economy-wide pay ceiling would have created far bigger problems.
While the latter point is true, it makes it no less necessary for the
private sector to follow suit if the dangerous combination of increasing
resentment and decreasing competitiveness is to be avoided.
The chancellor did not, in fact, make much of the role of wages in the
hoped-for recovery. He remarked only that 'if the gains in competitiveness
from the recent fall in the exchange rate are not to be lost it is vital
that all employers keep tight control over their pay bills. The public
sector cannot be sheltered from the difficulties faced by the private
sector, where pay awards are now the lowest in a generation.'
Large increase
While the last point is true, the underlying increase in earnings in
manufacturing was still as high as 6 per cent over the 12 months to
September. Deflated by the retail price index (less mortgage interest), this
is a real increase of 2 per cent. So large an increase in real wages after
more than two years of recession seems extraordinary and depressing. More
encouragingly, earnings increases have ceased over the last six months,
after a 3 per cent surge in March. Should that performance be maintained,
the chancellor will have won his gamble.
Is this likely and why does it matter? It is not likely because pay
settlements continue to hover at around 4 per cent, where they have been for
much of the past year. This suggests earnings growth will remain quite high.
It matters because reductions in the real cost of labour are needed if the
UK is to sustain strong recovery, especially after a devaluation.
Early recovery
The slight decline in output of manufacturing over the three months to
September, reported yesterday, underlines the importance of early recovery.
But where is it to come from? The answer is that it must come, in part, from
exports. The Treasury forecasts the real growth of exports of goods and
services at 5 1/2 per cent between 1992 and 1993. But this will be
particularly difficult when, as it notes, economic growth in the Group of
Seven industrial countries is expected to remain sluggish next year.
The point can be put in another way. The UK is in recession. This means, as
Keynes taught, that the desire of UK residents to accumulate savings is
leading to reduced output. But the UK also has a current account deficit,
which is forecast by the Treasury at 2 1/2 per cent of GDP next year. So,
despite their desire to save more, UK residents are still spending more than
they are earning and borrowing the difference from abroad. This combination
seems absurd.
What is needed, instead, is for the currently fruitless desire for more
savings to be turned into an actual reduction in the need to borrow from
abroad. This can only be done if it becomes much easier for slack domestic
resources to be turned both into exports and import substitutes. That, in
turn, demands improved competitiveness and greater profitability in the
production of tradeable goods and services. But if profitability is to grow
strongly in the production of tradeable goods and services after a
devaluation which will certainly raise the prices of inputs, wages need to
rise more slowly than the growth of productivity in these sectors.
Further decline in the rate of increase in nominal wages, combined with
restraint on the growth of domestic demand, is what the UK needs for
sustained recovery. Continued monetary control and tighter fiscal restraint
will be needed to restrain demand. The government must show it can provide
them. But determination is also needed on wages. It is now up to management
in the private sector to show it possesses this quality. Only if it does so
will the government win its bet.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Man in the News: Street-fighter's tough stance - Ray
MacSharry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray MacSharry has caused something of a commotion in Brussels during the
past 10 days. The Irish agriculture commissioner has won his trial of
strength with Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the European
Commission. The question now is whether the same ruthlessness will bring
back a world trade reform deal from next week's EC-US negotiations in
Washington.
The MacSharry-Delors row is unique. Although Mr Delors has been outvoted
before in the 17-member college of commissioners, nobody had publicly taken
on probably the most powerful chief the Commission has had. Mr Delors should
have had ample warning the confrontation was coming. But, perhaps
overprotected by his staff, he seems to have misjudged his man.
Mr MacSharry believes his boss was systematically undermining him - the
words 'sabotage' and 'betrayal of trust' were used - in his efforts to
settle long-standing rows with the US about subsidised food exports which
are delaying conclusion of the Uruguay Round world trade package. Mr Delors
believed the Irishman was going beyond what was compatible with this year's
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and was on the point of
clinching a deal which would be lopsided in America's favour. The Commission
president vigorously denies allegations that he was defending the interests
of France, where the unpopular government is desperate to placate farmers
ahead of next March's legislative elections.
Mr MacSharry took a gamble. On November 4 he wrote to Mr Delors, explaining
bluntly why he was resigning his negotiating responsibilities and turning
them over to the president. 'Delors in this sort of situation normally turns
it into a crisis of confidence and the commisioners back off,' one senior EC
official said. 'This will be a one-day wonder,' predicted another, after the
resignation became public.
Yet by last Tuesday night, after the two men confronted each other in the
presence of two senior colleagues, Mr MacSharry was back on the team, with a
free hand to deliver a farm trade package if he can. Mr Delors, by contrast,
if the attitude of his staff is any indication, is bitter and defensive. 'He
has been damaged,' says one commissioner.
Mr MacSharry, 54, once described as having 'dark, Transylvanian good looks',
is undemonstrative and canny. Though he left school early, he has renowned
mastery of the complex briefs which have fallen to him during his career.
And he defends them with unshakeable nerve and obstinacy.
As Irish finance minister in the short-lived administration of Charles
Haughey in 1982, his plans to cut a spiralling budget deficit are widely
judged to have lost his Fianna Fail party that year's election. One Irish
politician said it was then that 'MacSharry showed his nerve, and (he) has
never lost it since.' When he returned to the finance ministry in 1987, 'Mac
the Knife', as he became known, took up where he left off and cut 2.6 per
cent of gross domestic product off government borrowing in nine months,
saving Ireland from a debt crisis.
As agriculture commissioner, two years ago he was facing the unanimous
opposition of EC farm ministers to his plans for the most radical overhaul
in the CAP in its 30-year history. He glowered through more than a year of
abuse. Yet by May, the reform had been almost bludgeoned through.
His normal negotiating tactics, however, are a mixture of poker and
horse-trading. His move against Mr Delors looked more like a chess gambit;
the first move was clear, but the subsequent moves were far from obvious.
The French daily Le Monde, said Mr Delors dismissed Mr MacSharry's
resignation as a mouvement d'humeur. Some movement.
It solidified majorities in the Commission and among the 12 member states in
favour of a deal, flushing out - at least temporarily - an Anglo-German
alliance against the French. Mr Delors and Paris were on the spot, as Europe
in recession contemplated the prospect of trade war and decided to try
again.
Brought up in one of the toughest schools of politics, the Fianna Fail party
which has dominated Ireland since independence, Mr MacSharry is no stranger
to the black arts of political street-fighting. One of his favourite films
is The Sting. There was a time in the build-up to the crisis when it was not
entirely clear whether Mr MacSharry was after a Uruguay Round deal or Mr
Delors' head.
One long-time MacSharry-watcher who heard the early rumblings was always
clear what the farm commissioner was after. 'MacSharry deals in substance.
He doesn't care about Delors; what he won't abide is people who get in his
way on substance.'
Throughout the clash, the Delors camp took refuge in form, rather than
substance. Several of their colleagues found Mr MacSharry's tactics unseemly
and distressing for the Commission's reputation, but on the substance of the
matter - even Mr Delors' aides concede - most were behind the Irishman.
The substance in question has several parts. Mr MacSharry deeply resents
suggestions he has caved in to American pressure. In his view, he was
negotiating within the framework of the CAP reform; Mr Delors never sought
to disprove this. Mr MacSharry further believes that the farm chapter of the
Uruguay Round 'can be settled in five minutes' with the US, provided they
can settle the oilseeds dispute, on which they are close to a solution.
Deeper into the substance, almost certainly, is MacSharry's fear that
failure to settle would prompt a host of challenges to the new CAP from the
EC's trading partners, which would unravel his achievement in farm reform.
For all the furore, it is also part of the substance that Mr MacSharry left
negotiations in Chicago on November 3 because the US refused to accept his
bottom line - not because of Mr Delors.
If the US does levy its punitive tariffs on EC goods in three weeks, Mr
MacSharry would certainly back EC trade reprisals. And while hopes are high
for next week's talks, Mr MacSharry has again demonstrated that he does not
budge easily.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Mr Lamont's three Rs: FT writers ask whether the chancellor
has restored political confidence, revived the economy and reassured the
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY, PETER NORMAN and BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTORE
As Mr John Major shovelled compost around a newly planted tree yesterday, he
remarked: 'It's just occurred to me, I've been up to my neck in this stuff
all month.' So the Press Association reports. In fact it's been two months,
but the period of torment may be coming to an end, writes Joe Rogaly.
Happily for the prime minister, his government has had a better half-week
than any since September 16, Black Wednesday. His newly cheerful mood,
brought about by the initial political response to the chancellor's Autumn
Statement, may well last out the weekend and could signal the beginning of a
little run of confidence in both Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont.
If so, Mr Lamont will take the credit. Thursday's statement has been widely
praised as politically astute. Never mind the details. It is the package
that counts. This gave Conservative MPs what they most wanted: a sense that
the government may be recovering from the shock it suffered eight weeks ago.
It has shown itself to be willing to try for an end to the recession. It may
know what it is doing, and, more to the point, it may have found the nerve
to get on with it. The anguished faces behind the front bench, so familiar
to TV watchers, became relaxed as the chancellor spoke. When Mr Lamont sat
down the Tories were radiant.
The creation of this strangely optimistic political atmosphere was no
accident. Badly shaken by the experience of rejection by the House when the
closure of 31 coal mines was abruptly announced, the government took no
chances. The economic package was debated in a series of long special
sessions of the cabinet. Every minister's assent was demanded. The agreed
story was told, over and over, to groups of MPs. They were well prepared for
the details announced on Thursday. The fact that the main groups to be
clobbered were low-paid public sector workers came as a relief to MPs who
had been misled to expect deep cuts in social security, health and
education. No wonder there were cheers.
The obvious question is: 'Does this mean that Mr Major and Mr Lamont are now
secure?' The short answer is no. They are, however, less insecure this
morning than three days ago. Then, the prime minister's hold on his
authority and the chancellor's on his job seemed precarious. Both
demonstrated over the past two days that careful use of traditional
political skills can pay off. The prospect that they could be hanged any
morning has concentrated their minds wonderfully.
It is hard to believe that the euphoria will last. Fresh accusations of
ministerial duplicity could arise from studies of the breach of the embargo
on arms sales to Iraq after 1988. The markets could deteriorate. The
Edinburgh summit of European Community heads of government next month could
easily go wrong.
Even if the government navigates itself safely through to Christmas it must
still win a parliamentary vote on financing the council tax. If local
government spending is capped, services will deterioriate; if it is not,
council tax will come to seem at least as onerous to households as the poll
tax. Many homeowners in the south-east will pay more than under the
community charge, since their houses are likely to be in the higher bands.
Mr Major may soon find himself up to his neck in it again.
REVIVE
If the Treasury is to believed, Mr Norman Lamont's package will not cause
much of a recovery over the next 12 months.
The 0.75 per cent average growth expected for the non-oil economy next year
will feel just like the recession to most people in Britain. Unemployment
looks certain to rise above 3m from the present 2.87m in coming months,
writes Peter Norman.
But to focus on forecasts is to ignore the very considerable easing of the
government's economic policy in recent weeks. Interest rates have fallen
three percentage points and sterling's average value more than 13 per cent
since the pound was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism.
These numbers are more important for the future welfare of industry,
homeowners and job seekers than the individual measures announced by Mr
Lamont in the Autumn Statement. But the package will certainly do no harm
because it is targeted on specific areas of weakness in the economy that
have made the recession the longest since the second world war.
Perhaps the most imaginative move is the plan to spend Pounds 750m between
now and the end of March largely on buying 20,000 empty homes for social
housing in a bid to stem the fall in house prices. There is a strong element
of chance in the project, which, ministers say, will reduce the overhang of
unsold houses by about a fifth. Nobody can tell how far the new source of
demand for housing will encourage people considering buying a home to firm
up their plans and so get the housing market moving again.
But economists at Greenwell Montagu, the City brokers, believe this de facto
nationalisation of part of the nation's housing stock will be positive. The
programme should slow the fall in house prices by reducing the negative
impact of auctioning repossessed homes. It should also produce business for
local contractors who 'do up' houses and help building society balance
sheets, encouraging them to cut mortgage rates.
On the other hand, it is unclear how far house prices can recover so long as
unemployment keeps growing - especially in the south-east. The direct
effects of Thursday's measures on employment may be quite small. Many
projects due for government support are capital- rather than
labour-intensive while the increased investment allowances are unlikely to
have a rapid impact on jobs.
One exception could be the scheme allowing local authorities to spend
capital receipts from asset sales. Ministers intend that the funds should be
used to finance activities such as maintaining and refurbishing council
houses which will provide contracts for small businesses.
Industry and commerce took a generally positive view of the government's
package. Mr Richard Brown, policy director at the British Chambers of
Commerce, especially welcomed the Pounds 700m of extra export credit cover,
which he said would encourage small companies to break into new markets. Mr
Brown, a strong critic of government policy drift following Black Wednesday,
said he was 'very pleased' with Mr Lamont's package.
That reaction will be music to the chancellor's ears. He insisted yesterday
that the government cannot 'press a button' to make the economy grow. If the
latest measures boost confidence, they may at last create the conditions for
recovery - even though they were born of political desperation and economic
policy failure.
REASSURE
That the equity and bond markets should have all their fun in the
anticipation rather than the event is quite normal, writes Barry Riley.
Yesterday's markets looked dull in comparison to their behaviour earlier in
the week, but that did not mean that the City's investment professionals
were disappointed - just a little confused.
The markets are being pulled in different directions. Many investors want
economic growth, but on the other hand some are scared of the high levels of
public borrowing. Fears about inflation are abating but opinion remains
divided and the Treasury's forecast of a 3 3/4 per cent underlying inflation
rate in a year probably splits the field.
Pretty well everybody is in favour of lower short-term interest rates which
tend to stoke up the longer-term markets in equities and gilts. Thursday's
one-point cut in base rates was welcomed, but is widely seen as just a step
on the road to 6 per cent by the end of the year and perhaps 5 per cent next
spring.
This year the Treasury, battered and bruised by its mistakes over the past
12 months, has carefully pitched its autumn economic forecast in line with
the City consensus, which leaves the Square Mile little the wiser.
As the Treasury pointed out, the personal sector's excessively high debt
ratio, which is at the root of Britain's recessionary problems, has only
declined fractionally so far. So although the Treasury is forecasting a
slight rise in consumer spending, others disagree.
Among the big City securities firms, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew appears to be one
of the more bearish, suggesting that the upturn will disappoint even the
modest hopes of the Treasury, and that next year's public sector borrowing
requirement will be more like Pounds 54bn than the suggested Pounds 44bn.
Greenwell Montagu is also pitching its growth estimates lower than those of
Mr Lamont.
On the other hand S G Warburg thinks the caution is being overdone and
economic growth in 1993 will be 1 1/2 rather than 1 per cent.
In fact the City's forecasters - who in aiming much too high have mostly got
this year's gross domestic product wrong by a massive three percentage
points - do not appear to have much of a clue about how to predict the
recovery, but they have prejudices which greatly affect their investment
judgments.
Those who believe in growth are naturally apprehensive about the scale of
projected government borrowing. Even those doubtful about the speed of the
recovery are worried that the gilts market will be buried in new issues and
long-term interest rates will be forced up some time later next year or in
1994.
In the equity market the question is how strongly earnings will recover in
1993. Expectations are in fact quite high, on the basis of cost-cutting and
a devaluation boost to overseas and export earnings. But overall economic
growth of 1 per cent is not really an exciting foundation for a decent bull
market, and expectations are muted.
As for inflation, the monetarists are generally quite optimistic because the
money supply has been growing only very slowly. Some non-monetarists are
still worried that imported inflation will feed through and that the
government may be forced to accept further depreciation of the currency in
1993.
Perhaps it was all best summed up by the economists at NatWest Treasury and
Capital Markets: 'Cut now, pay later.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / Why 1,000 Revenue staff may lose jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 1,000 staff may lose their jobs at the Inland Revenue in the next few
months because public demand for two methods of reclaiming tax has been
lower than expected. Advertising of the services available at claims offices
has cost the Revenue Pounds 11m in the past two years.
The Revenue announced on Thursday that the operations would be reorganised
with a reduction in staff and a 'rationalisation' of offices. The plan
should save about Pounds 10m a year in salaries.
By the end of the financial year in April 1,000 jobs will go, resulting in
the closure of four offices and reallocation of space, since a further 15
offices will no longer carry out repayment work.
Up to 400 jobs will be created in the five remaining offices - Belfast,
Bootle, Glenrothes, Leicester and St Austell. But unions expect that about
600 jobs will go from the Revenue in spite of attempts to avoid compulsory
redundancies.
The Revenue's claims offices have been facing two types of repayment demand.
The first is for tax credits on share dividends from up to 2.5m married
women below the tax threshold. Such claims have been possible since the
introduction of independent taxation in 1990.
The second type of demand is from an estimated 15m non-taxpayers claiming
back tax on bank and building society interest, which since last year has
been paid net of basic rate tax to all but those who specially register to
receive interest gross.
More than 7m people have now registered to receive interest gross, although
according to a recent Revenue survey about 1m of these were not eligible.
The Revenue estimated that there would be about 8m claims - covering all of
the remaining 15m non-taxpayers who were eligible for claims. But it now
expects no more than 2m claims this year.
Officials concede that the level of response has been disappointing.
Suggested explanations include ignorance of the programmes, apathy, a belief
that repayments amount to charity or a desire not to attract attention.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Cork Gully drops appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORK GULLY, the insolvency arm of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will not
appeal against a disciplinary judgment on two of its partners in connection
with their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International, the
collapsed fruit and electronics group.
Mr Michael Jordan, head of Cork Gully, and Mr Richard Stone, head of
corporate finance, were last month fined the maximum Pounds 1,000 by the
professional conduct committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales.
The two were deemed to have breached ethical rules for taking the
appointment after Coopers &amp; Lybrand had a continuing professional
relationship with Polly Peck and Mr Asil Nadir, its chairman, during the
three years before the company was placed in administration in October 1990.
They had 28 days to appeal, but have decided not to take action.
However, they still face a hearing before the institute's insolvency
licensing committee in December.
A key part of their defence was that Coopers' internal systems did not pick
up the fact that the firm was already conducting work for Polly Peck.
Mr Chris Hughes of Cork Gully said yesterday that problems had been caused
by the difficulty of operating two different systems in Cork Gully and
Coopers when the firms merged in 1989.
He said there had been substantial improvements in the past 12 months,
including the merger of the two computer systems and rewriting of software.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Company car tax proposal attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSULTATION period for the Inland Revenue's proposed new regime for
taxing company cars closed yesterday amid a chorus of criticism, with at
least one accountancy group warning that 'there will be considerably more
losers than winners' if it is adopted unchanged.
The Revenue proposes 12 price bands with each higher band covering a
successively wider range of car prices. The advantage seen in such a
structure is that it would be particularly sensitive in the Pounds 10,000 to
Pounds 19,500 region in which company cars are concentrated.
The Revenue claims that about 1.2m company car drivers would gain. It also
acknowledges that there would be 700,000 losers, some of whose tax bills
could rise by up to 40 per cent.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders voiced 'profound' opposition
to the proposed retention of price 'banding' to assess the tax benefit
payable on the personal use of company cars. The SMMT argued that any new
regime should be based solely on a fixed percentage of list prices, with the
exception of very expensive makes such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin.
The Revenue's proposals aim to make what is in effect a crude banding system
 -unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced 16 years ago - fairer
to company car users. The proposals are also intended to meet criticisms
from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission says the current
system distorts the market by obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax-break
specials' - which cause market bunching - and may disadvantage specialist
manufacturers such as Jaguar. The system uses a combination of price bands
and engine sizes to determine tax liability.

FT  14 NOV 92 / FO drops plan for contracting-out: European rules on pay
lead to confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOREIGN Office announced last night that it had suspended preparations
to contract out services because of new regulations protecting workers' pay
and conditions when they transfer to the private sector.
The Foreign Office lead is likely to be followed by other departments and
underlines the extent to which the government's Pounds 1bn programme of
contracting out has been thrown into confusion by the regulations.
These regulations, which stem from a European Community directive, mean
companies may not normally cut the pay and conditions of staff who transfer
to the private sector. Private contractors would also be liable for high
redundancy payments if they shed jobs. About 80 per cent of the costs of
providing government services are labour.
The government agreed to adopt the regulations only after a threat of court
action from the European Commission.
At a meeting earlier this week senior civil servants from government
departments criticised the Treasury, the environment department, and the
Cabinet Office for failing to clarify the legal position.
Foreign Office officials warned they would halt the department's programme
to test the feasibility of contracting out services such as information
technology and some training because of the confusion.
The Confederation of British Industry has warned that companies will refuse
to bid for contracts to provide local authority services because of the new
regulations.
Mr John Hall, chairman of the CBI's competing for quality committee, said:
'On the face of it there is no longer any point in companies taking part in
tenders for public services. We will fight the government and the unions
tooth and nail.'
The regulations were included in the recently published employment bill to
harmonise UK legislation - the Transfer of Undertakings (Employment
Protection) Regulations - with the European Community's acquired rights
directive.
Mr Hall said contractors might find it hard to take on existing workforces
profitably.

FT  14 NOV 92 / South African President de Klerk arrives in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African President FW de Klerk (centre) arriving at the South African
Embassy in London yesterday.
Mr de Klerk met his country's rugby team at the embassy but refused to
become embroiled in the row over national anthems at the South Africa v
England match.
Anti-apartheid campaigners had threatened a series of protests during the
visit, but were notable by their absence.
Last night at a dinner of the South Africa Club at the Savoy Hotel he said
South Africa was well on the way to a negotiated settlement, but warned that
the process was 'lengthy, delicate and difficult' and did not lend itself to
'simplistic analyses or rigid timetables'.
Mr de Klerk said the African National Congress and other parties had
accepted the necessity for power-sharing during a transitional period, but
serious consideration was being given to 'a much longer-term acceptance of
this principle'.
Earlier Mr de Klerk had a meeting in the Commons with Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader. This morning he is meeting Mr Major in Downing Street before
going on to the Twickenham match.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Insurers challenge proposed regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSOCIATION of British Insurers, the main trade body for the insurance
industry, yesterday advised its members to steer clear of the Personal
Investments Authority, a proposed self-regulatory body for financial
services.
It said it wanted to wait until 95 per cent of potential members of the new
body had joined it.
The ABI said yesterday that, if the industry did not give full support to
the new authority on a voluntary basis, 'there is a strong case for
legislation to remove the Securities and Investments Board's powers of
direct regulation'.
That statement further undermines the prospects of the proposed body, which
is intended to include not only life insurers and independent financial
advisers, but also banks and building societies which sell financial
services.
Most UK banks and building societies are members of SIB's own direct
self-regulatory body, known as Sibro, and of Imro, the self-regulatory body
for the financial services industry.
The life insurers and independent financial advisers are members of Lautro
and Fimbra. The association said that SIB's announced intention to treat the
Personal Investments Authority as the 'lead regulator' for firms which were
members of Sibro did not go far enough.
Banks and building societies and several of the larger independent financial
adviser networks have expressed great reluctance to join the new authority
and say that retail regulation should be best accomplished by merging Lautro
and Fimbra.
Meanwhile, the association has spelled out a number of changes it wishes to
see to the charter of the new authority, which is intended to be produced in
final form in January.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Tourist board opposes sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM DAVIS, chairman of the English Tourist Board, reacted angrily
yesterday to government suggestions that it should divest part of its
business in the face of a 40 per cent cut in its grant over the next three
years.
'We will not have civil servants telling us how to run our business,' Mr
Davis said.
Government officials earlier indicated the sale would take place amid the
tight control of public expenditure outlined in Thursday's Autumn Statement.
Government funding for the board will fall from Pounds 15.4m this year to
Pounds 9m by 1995, with 70 per cent of that total being diverted to regional
tourist boards.
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, told MPs yesterday: 'The case is now
much less strong for central government funding of the promotion of tourism
in England.
'As the industry matures, and the regional tourist boards develop, it is
appropriate for other bodies to carry on many of the ETB's central
activities.'
Heritage department sources suggested that guides for hotels, guest houses
and caravan sites would be high on the list for privatisation.
However, with many of the board's initiatives undertaken with private-sector
participation, tourist industry analysts question how much would be saved by
such a move.
Mr Mark Phillips, a senior consultant with Howarth Consultancy, which
operates the boards's hotel occupancy survey, said: 'There is already a very
successful partnership between the private sector and the ETB. I cannot see
how the government can privatise it further without serious ramifications on
the ETB's position.'
Howarth won the contract to operate the board scheme by tender three years
ago and pays all the administrative costs.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Revenue flop may cost 1,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 1,000 staff may lose their jobs at the Inland Revenue in the next few
months because demand by the public for two tax initiatives has been lower
than expected.
In spite of the Revenue's first and highly-ambitious advertising campaign,
which has cost it nearly Pounds 11m over the last two years, demand for the
services of its claims offices around the country has failed to reach
anticipated levels.
On Thursday evening the Revenue issued a statement that the operations would
be reorganised, with a reduction in staff and a 'rationalisation' of
offices. The plan should save about Pounds 10m a year in salaries.
By the end of the financial year in April 1,000 jobs will go, resulting in
the closure of four offices and reallocation of space, since a further 15
offfices will no longer carry out repayment work.
Up to 400 jobs will be created in the five remaining offices - Belfast,
Bootle, Glenrothes, Leicester and St Austell. But unions expect that about
600 jobs will go from the Revenue, in spite of attempts to avoid compulsory
redundancies.
The Revenue's claims offices have dealt with two types of repayment demands
created by programmes in the last two years. The first is for tax credits on
share dividends from up to 2.5m married women below the tax threshold -
claims which have been possible since the introduction of independent
taxation in 1990.
The second is for an estimated 15m non-taxpayers claiming back tax on bank
and building society interest, which since last year has been paid net of
basic rate tax to all but those who specially register to receive interest
gross.
More than 7m people have now registered to receive interest gross, although
according to a recent Revenue survey about 1m of these were not eligible.
The Revenue estimated that there would be about 8m claims - covering all of
the remaining 15m non-taxpayers who were not registered and eligible for
claims. In the event it now expects no more 2m claims this year.
Officials concede that the level of response has been disappointing. They
spent Pounds 7m on a television campaign early last year to highlight the
interest repayment programme and Pounds 3m on leaflets. They spent almost
Pounds 1m on newspaper advertisements early this year, and plan another
campaign early next year.
No one knows exactly what went wrong, although among the suggestions are
ignorance of the programmes, apathy, a belief that repayments amount to
charity, or a desire not to draw attention.
The Revenue says it has never before undertaken such a significant campaign,
and so it had no comparisons against which to measure the response. One
official said: 'We have to plan on the basis that everyone will claim.'
That is little consolation for those losing their jobs. Mr Clive Brooke,
general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, said: 'We're sorry
to see offices being closed and even more sorry to see jobs being lost. But
these are just the first of many. The government is embarking on a major
reorganisation which will reduce the services available to taxpayers.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / Policies may cut terrorism cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS are likely to exclude cover for terrorism from commercial insurance
policies following action by the Association of British Insurers, the
industry's main trade body.
The ABI has made available to its members the wording for a clause to
exclude risk of damage due to terrorist action from commercial insurance
policies. Most insurers are expected to include it in their policies because
they are otherwise unlikely to be able to obtain reinsurance cover. Domestic
policyholders are not affected by the change.
The ABI also said it has prepared a separate wording that would allow
companies to buy separate cover for terrorism up to a limit of about Pounds
100,000. This facility is designed to meet the needs of small businesses.
However Mr Mike Jones, ABI chief executive, said: 'Commercial policyholders
may unfortunately be left uncovered.'
Mrs Ruth Rooley, director-general of the British Insurance and Investment
Brokers' Association, said that some companies would be placed in an
'impossible situation'.
The ABI said that the change had been forced on the UK market by 'worldwide
reinsurers' in the light of considerable losses earlier this year in serious
bombing incidents and the continuation of terrorist action in the UK.
Reinsurers are expected to meet a substantial part of the Pounds 800m claims
bill stemming from two IRA bombs in London in April and have pressed UK
insurers to come into line with practice elsewhere in Europe.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Councils' scope for spending is curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to ensure that local authorities do not squander their freedom to
spend proceeds from council house and other sales were announced yesterday
by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.
A Capital Partnership programme announced yesterday by Mr Howard seeks to
encourage councils to spend receipts on 'worthwhile projects' by tying the
award of grants and credit approvals to the amount of receipts local
authorities are prepared to invest in housing, urban, environmental and
rural developments.
Mr Howard yesterday said grant and credit approvals for schemes such as the
Estate Action programme will depend on the willingness to provide part of
the finance from its capital receipts. There will be a separate scheme to
award funds to local authorities with few or no capital receipts.
He said: 'Altogether there will be Pounds 200m of government grant and
approvals available. In addition, the Housing Corporation will have Pounds
400m available for new schemes in 1993/94.'
Councils were freed in Thursday's Autumn Statement to spend all receipts
from council-house and other sales raised to the end of next year. Local
authorities previously were allowed to spend only 25 per cent of proceeds.
The environment department said its projections - of Pounds 2.29bn in usable
capital receipts this year and Pounds 2.62bn in 1993/4 - were based on
estimates of 'previous sales and what we know councils have authorities left
to sell.'
Most treasurers - with the collapse of the property market - are revising
sharply downwards their estimates of likely receipts, and are not optimistic
about an upturn next year. They say that council house sales, a main source
of receipts, have slowed dramatically.
Local authority treasurers, however, said government forecasts of Pounds
1.75bn extra receipts over the next two years were highly optimistic.
Liverpool City Council, which realised Pounds 60m in receipts in 1989-90 and
about Pounds 20m last year, said it expected to raise only Pounds 10m this
year.
Birmingham City Council has reduced its estimate of proceeds from
council-house and other sales from about Pounds 41m to Pounds 33m since the
spring.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, accused the government of
presenting an 'illusion', intended to disguise the real level of resources
for housing agreed in the Autumn Statement.
The Tories see it as a significant advance that the programme will give the
government a way of encouraging the direction of the new capital spending.
It will also help conservative councils which have few assets left to sell,
because of earlier sales of council houses.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Airlines to replace engine fuse pins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the two UK operators of Boeing 747
aircraft, have decided to replace the fuse pins securing the engines of
their 747 fleets after each jumbo has made 3,000 landings, Paul Betts
writes.
The move follows a recommendation from Boeing yesterday to all 747 operators
to conduct additional inspections of fuse pins and engine struts.
The failure of fuse pins caused by metal fatigue and corrosion is regarded
by accident investigators as probably the main cause of the Amsterdam
disaster last month, when an El Al 747 cargo aircraft crashed into a a block
of flats after losing two engines shortly after take-off.
After an initial inspection Boeing said it found very few cases of cracked
fuse pins.

FT  14 NOV 92 / The cuts run deep for London Underground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR of gloom pervaded the headquarters of London Transport yesterday as
managers applied themselves to the task of cutting Pounds 600m-worth of
investment in the Underground over the next three years.
Nothing in the speculation that preceded the chancellor's Autumn Statement
had prepared London Transport for the shock that hit it on Thursday
afternoon, when it learned of swingeing cuts to its budget.
Government funding next year will fall from Pounds 1.39bn to Pounds 1.01bn,
and in the year after from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 960m. The new figure set
for 1995-96 is a lower-than-expected Pounds 950m. The reductions hurt all
the more because London Transport was the only transport operator to suffer
an attack on its budget. The roads programme survived unscathed, while
British Rail won a modest increase in its funding.
Mr Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's chairman, made no attempt to disguise
his anger. 'I am hard put to understand, even in these tough economic times,
why the pain of these cuts should be uniquely visited upon London,' he said.
The London Regional Passengers Committee, the statutory watchdog for the
capital's public transport users, said the cuts were all the worse for
coming on top of a fare increase of twice the rate of inflation.
One positive element of the London Transport settlement was that the budget
for the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line extension to Docklands escaped the cuts.
This means that if Canary Wharf's administrators and their banks can come up
with Pounds 400m towards the line's construction costs, the project might
yet go ahead.
But good news for Docklands means bad news for the rest of London, since the
Jubilee Line funding appears to have survived largely at the expense of the
rest of London Transport's budget - most of which is consumed by the
existing Underground railway.
The result is that the budget for Underground investment will fall from
Pounds 700m-Pounds 750m a year to Pounds 500m-Pounds 550 a year. A range of
planned improvements for passengers will be lost along the way. For example:
The badly needed modernisation of the Northern Line, due for the second half
of the 1990s, will be postponed to the next century.
Modernisation of stations on the Central Line to accompany the replacement
of track and trains will no longer take place.
The Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly Line will close because there is not
enough money to replace the lifts at Aldwych station.
The planned East London Line extensions to Highbury and Islington in the
north and East Dulwich in the south will be indefinitely postponed.
Plans to build an interchange at King's Cross linking the deep-level
Victoria and Piccadilly lines with the surface-level Metropolitan and Circle
lines will be abandoned.
The replacement of the escalator link between Bank and Monument stations in
the heart of the City is unlikely to go ahead.
The cut in London Transport's budget comes less than 18 months after a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report criticised the government for
starving the Underground of investment. That resulted in a big - and, as it
turns out, short-lived - increase in funds last autumn.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said London Transport would
still receive much more money for the next three years than it had for the
past three. Besides, he noted, more was being spent on the Underground than
all the nation's schools put together.
Mr David Bayliss, London Transport's director of planning, observed that
this was a fairly meaningless comparison.
'Personally, I think the government should be spending a lot more on
schools,' he added. 'But not at our expense.'

FT  14 NOV 92 / Underlying inflation at 4-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY'S preferred measure of underlying inflation fell to 3.8 per
cent last month, the lowest figure for more than four years, the Central
Statistical Office said yesterday.
The year-on-year change in this measure - the retail prices index less
mortgage interest payments - fell from 4 per cent in September and 4.2 per
cent in August.
The year-on-year increase in the RPI was 3.6 per cent last month, the same
as in September. Both figures underline the weak state of demand and lack of
recovery.
The Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation has fallen in every
month since April, when it stood at 5.7 per cent. Government policy is to
keep this figure at 4.0 per cent or less.
One warning sign on the inflation front was that petrol prices increased
last month because of the devaluation of sterling after Britain left the
European exchange rate mechanism on September 16.
The increase in petrol prices - which pushed up the cost of a gallon of
4-star petrol from Pounds 2.25 to Pounds 2.31 - contributed to a 0.7 per
cent increase in motoring expenditure for the month. In the year to October,
the element of the RPI accounted for by these costs increased by 4.3 per
cent.
The CSO said that apart from petrol and fuel oil, few other retail items had
shown higher prices as a result of the devaluation. However, such increases
arising from the higher prices of imports may work their way into the
economy in the coming months, especially if demand rises.
Upward pressure on the RPI - in October this stood at 139.9 compared with
September's 139.4 - was reduced by food prices showing only a 0.2 per cent
increase between September and October. Measured over the year to last month
this pushed up by 1.4 per cent the element of the index accounted for by
prices of these items.
In the 12 months to last month the price of seasonal foods fell by 8.3 per
cent, largely because of a glut of fresh fruit and vegetables on world
markets. Some types of fruit, including apples, seen fell by up to 20 per
cent over the year.
Clothing and footwear experienced a price rise of 1.3 per cent between
September and October, thanks mainly to new stock entering the shops. The
year-on-year increase in the prices of these goods remained low in October
at 0.1 per cent last month.
Among the areas of retail goods and services which still appear to be
subject to relatively high inflationary pressures are fares and travel
costs, which in October rose by 5.7 per cent compared with a year earlier.
The prices of leisure services saw a comparable rise of 6.1 per cent.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Manufacturing output falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output fell in September to its lowest level since January,
according to government figures released yesterday that showed few prospects
of an early upturn.
The Central Statistical Office said seasonally adjusted output fell 0.4 per
cent between August and September. The fall would have been greater except
for a large increase in car production in September, mainly for export
markets.
CSO officials believe manufacturing output is essentially flat, a slightly
more pessimistic view than a month ago when they said production appeared to
be rising by a year-on-year 0.5 per cent.
The weak September figure contributed to manufacturing production in the
third quarter of the year being 0.1 per cent down on the second quarter.
That bore out fears that the improvement in the sector's output in the first
six months would probably not be sustained.
Manufacturing output in the third quarter was down 0.8 per cent on the
corresponding period last year. It is now 7.5 per cent below the peak for
the sector recorded in early 1990, just before the recession.
The low production by manufacturing in September was offset by higher output
of oil and gas, which rose 2 per cent during the month, mainly due to the
effects of weak output in August on account of maintenance work.
Production industries as a whole - manufacturing, energy (including oil and
gas) and water supply - rose thanks to the good performance of the energy
sector, with a 0.3 per cent increase in output in September on the previous
month.
In the third quarter, output for these industries was up 0.6 per cent on the
previous quarter, but down 0.6 per cent compared with the same period a year
ago.
In manufacturing, output of motor vehicles and components increased 10 per
cent in September compared with the previous month, when production was
unusually low. Production for export during September rose by 50 per cent.
Productivity in manufacturing continued its recent rise, with output per
head showing a rise in the third quarter of 4.4 per cent compared with the
same period last year.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Drug reforms cause split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRUGS industry and the medical world split yesterday over reforms in
drug-prescribing set out by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary,
after the Autumn Statement.
The number of drugs from which doctors can choose is to be cut, with cheaper
treatments being given priority.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry attacked the changes
as limiting doctors' choice in treating patients. Dr John Griffin, director
of the association, said: 'Cheapest medicines are not necessarily the best
medicines.'
But the move received qualified approval from the British Medical
Association. It said: 'This is the least unpalatable way of getting drug
prices down.'
Ten categories of drugs are affected, including oral contraceptives, allergy
drugs and some skin treatments. Most of the manufacturers concerned are
non-UK companies.
Swiss-owned Ciba-Geigy has 13 per cent of the market for anti-rheumatic skin
treatments with Emulgel. Two other Ciba-Geigy products take 2 per cent of
the Pounds 5.4m anaemia market.
Germany's Schering has 40 per cent of the Pounds 54m UK market for oral
contraceptives.
ICI Pharmaceuticals and Wellcome said that they did not make drugs in any of
the 10 categories.
Glaxo, the world's biggest drug company, might lose revenue from a hayfever
treatment and some steroid skin creams, but the loss would be small compared
with total revenues.
Many of the drugs in the categories listed are also available without a
prescription.
Boots, Britain's biggest seller of over-the-counter drugs, said that some
patients might be encouraged to buy from pharmacies rather than go to their
doctors.
The proposals extend a scheme introduced in 1985 which now lists 154
approved products in seven categories, including laxatives and cough and
cold remedies.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that since the
1985 scheme was introduced no research work had been conducted in these
areas in the UK. It said past experience had shown that introducing limited
lists reduces investment by industry into new treatments.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Recession catches up with less-hit areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has caught up with parts of the UK which had previously
escaped the worst of the country's economic woes.
A regional breakdown of the latest Confederation of British Industry survey
of manufacturing trends, carried out with Business Strategies Limited, the
economics consultancy, shows that Scotland and Wales are being affected by
the economic gloom prevailing elsewhere.
The survey found that overall business confidence has weakened with total
output expected to fall in every region except the north-west and the
Yorkshire and Humberside area over the next four months.
Mr Richard Holt, associate director of Business Strategies, cautioned that
the survey - held between September 23 and October 14 - was conducted too
soon after the pound had been devalued for the implications for the economy
to be assessed fully.
Sterling's devaluation, however, has improved the sentiment about exports
across the country, while some regions will do well out of measures
announced in the Autumn Statement.
The west Midlands should benefit from the abolition of car tax, while
Scotland and south-west England, where many investment goods are produced,
are expected to benefit from improved capital allowances.
The north: export orders have increased for the first time for a year,
although home market orders continue to fall. After a brief revival over the
past two quarters, optimism about the general business situation has
dropped. Yorkshire and Humberside: optimism about export performance has
surged, suggesting an export-led recovery in output over the next four
months. But job losses will continue to rise rapidly and general business
confidence remains low. East Midlands: a rise in export demand is expected
over the next four months, but orders have continued falling. Unit costs and
prices are expected to increase in the months ahead following the
devaluation of sterling.
East Anglia: business optimism deteriorated as companies reported a sharp
fall in demand. Average home and export prices have decreased since the
summer and more companies than not have cut their unit costs. London and the
south-east: the fall in orders has accelerated for the second consecutive
survey. South-west: demand has continued to fall but at its slowest rate for
two years. A rise in export orders is now expected to offset weak home
demand. West Midlands: the fall in orders was less sharp than in the rest of
the country. Total orders are expected to stabilise over the next four
months and rapid growth in export orders is forecast. North-west: output has
fallen more quickly since the summer than at any time for three years. A
slight increase is now expected. Optimism about exports has improved.
Wales: demand and output fell sharply over the past four months. Earlier
indications that the recession was ending have disappeared. Pressure on
profit margins remains strong. Investment in plant and machinery is expected
to fall.
Scotland: total orders continued to fall and export demand looks set to
remain weak in spite of sterling's devaluation. With widespread excess
capacity, investment intentions remain weak.
Northern Ireland: another increase in new orders is reported, against the
national trend. Export orders have grown strongly. Employment has risen
slightly.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Figures offer little hope of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRD QUARTER figures on bankruptcy and corporate liquidation offer little
prospect for economic recovery, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm,
warned yesterday.
The number of personal bankruptcies fell 3.7 per cent for the period July to
September over the previous quarter to 7,506, but growth in the first three
quarters was up 51.5 per cent on the same period last year.
The number of company liquidations dropped 7 per cent to 5,562 between the
second and third quarter, compared with 4,670 for the third quarter last
year.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG, warned: 'I cannot see
any significant downward trend in liquidations for the remainder of the
year.'
He said increased competition in response to the worldwide economic slowdown
was likely to force even more companies into liquidation.
His comments contrast with figures showing a reduction in the number of
company receiverships and administration appointments, analysed by
accountants Touche Ross from the official London and Edinburgh gazettes.
Mr Hayward said there was a time lapse before any turndown in receivership
appointments is followed by a reduction in the number of liquidations.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Airlines replace engine fuse pins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the two UK operators of Boeing 747
aircraft, have decided to replace the fuse pins securing the engines of
their 747 fleets after each jumbo has made 3,000 landings, Paul Betts
writes.
The move follows a recommendation from Boeing yesterday to all 747 operators
to conduct additional inspections of fuse pins and engine struts.
The failure of fuse pins caused by metal fatigue and corrosion is regarded
by accident investigators as probably the main cause of the Amsterdam
disaster last month, when an El Al 747 cargo aircraft crashed into a housing
complex after losing two engines shortly after take-off.
After an initial inspection Boeing said it found very few cases of cracked
fuse pins.
Mr Jim Johnson, vice president of Boeing's 747 division said: 'All these
have been replaced.'
He added that about 20 per cent of pins inspected had enough corrosion to
warrant replacement.
The US Federal Aviation Authority is expected to issue a directive soon
requiring mandatory inspections and replacement of pins on 747 aircraft.
Boeing recommended yesterday that 747 operators perform visual and
ultra-sonic inspections of fuse pins after 3,000 landings or after more than
three years of service.
But both BA and Virgin have decided to act immediately before a mandatory
directive is issued.

<TEXT>
SANCTIONS against former Yugoslavia have failed to halt imports of oil,
which is now so abundant in Belgrade that new petrol stations are opening
and the price of fuel has dropped, the UN Security Council was told
yesterday.
Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairman of the international conference on former
Yugoslavia, said it was common knowledge that transit documents were being
misused and oil was getting through in ever larger quantities.
He and Lord Owen, the other co-chairman, called for urgent UN action to
close gaping holes in sanctions by tightening procedures to halt oil
supplies particularly on the Danube route.
Both co-chairmen opposed lifting the arms embargo against
Bosnia-Hercegovina, as has been suggested. Mr Vance argued that a relaxation
would not only increase hostilities but spread the conflict throughout the
region.
The Security Council is considering imposing a naval blockade.

Spain's headline inflation rate fell sharply in October but underlying
inflation remained high and offered little prospect of a significant easing
in interest rates, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The rise in the consumer price index of just 0.1 per cent brought
year-on-year inflation down by 0.6 points to 5.2 per cent.
Underlying inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and non-processed
food prices, rose by 0.5 per cent in October to post a year-on-year figure
of 7.1 per cent.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Europe tries again on single stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK exchanges in the European Community have agreed to look again at ways
of creating a single European stock market, 18 months after their last
initiative collapsed in disarray.
Co-operation between the exchanges would make it easier for investors to
trade in European stocks outside their domestic market, relieving them of
the need to trade on each domestic exchange.
The Federation of Stock Exchanges in the EC said yesterday it had set up a
working group to 'consider the options for the evolution of an efficient
European securities market'. This was taken as a sign that the exchanges
have overcome much of the disagreement, which led to the scrapping of their
last initiative, known as Euroquote, in July last year.
Disagreement at that stage centred on the type of market that should be
built. Some countries, such as the UK, wanted a wholesale market for large
investors while others, led by France, believed the market should be for
retail investors who want to trade small volumes of shares. The exchanges
are understood to have agreed now to focus on a wholesale market.
A blueprint for the market already exists in London, but other European
exchanges have balked at the idea of granting the London market official
recognition as the European wholesale market.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Bankers foresee Germany at centre of new grouping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'fast-track reformers' of central Europe, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland, have been much more successful than expected in reorganising their
economies along western market lines. They should be seen as prime
candidates for inclusion in a new 'core Europe' centred on Germany,
according to this year's Global Strategy Survey by Morgan Stanley, the
US-based investment bankers.
The development of such a grouping, including the Benelux countries,
Switzerland, Austria, Sweden - but only 'possibly' France and Ireland -
would signify that the Maastricht integration process is dead, and would
'strain to the breaking point' the Franco-German axis which was the basis of
postwar west European integration, according to Mr David Roche, the bank's
senior analyst.
Germany's fate is closely linked to the issue of central Europe's
integration into the disciplined, hard-currency European core region. 'If
the process works Germany will be the regional headquarters of a vast area
of economic dynamism and prosperity.' But if the economics of integration
fail, Germany will relapse into 'a dark, gloomy and troubled giant,' the
report warns.
A new Europe is about to be forged which, unlike the doomed Maastricht
process, takes into account the realities created by the collapse of Soviet
power. Some EC members - such as the UK, Italy, Spain and possibly France -
will circulate on the periphery of the D-Mark-dominated core. Some non-EC
members like Austria and Switzerland will be part of the core while some of
the new core candidates, like the three central European states are not even
members of the EC and have been considered until now as economically weak.
What has changed the bank's perspective is the speed with which the
'fast-track' central Europeans have re-orientated their trade to EC markets,
especially Germany, reduced inflation and managed to run substantial current
account surpluses in spite of the collapse in Comecon trade.
The secret of their success lies in the acceptance of a substantial cut in
living standards by many of their 69m citizens, and a sharp rise in savings
in spite of wage rates less than 10 per cent of the German level.
'Workers in these countries receive in a month what the average skilled
German worker receives in five hours. Little wonder that Mercedes Benz has
indefinitely postponed its planned DM1bn truck plant in eastern Germany.
German companies will increasingly shift their manufacturing investment
eastward, and German unemployment could rise to 4m during the difficult
adjustment to a more service-orientated, post-industrial society,' Mr Roche
predicted.

Industry has been pressing the banks to lower the punitively high cost of

Mr Luigi Abete, head of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation,
said he wanted banks to lower their rates by a further 3.5 percentage points
to ease the burden on industry. The banks have been criticised for holding
interest rates high with large spreads in order to recoup losses sustained
through the falling value of Italian state paper in their portfolios.
The prospect of falling interest rates also boosted share prices. The Milan
bourse yesterday rose 2.3 per cent, with a heavy volume of trading compared
to recent weeks.
This was the second interest rate adjustment since the turbulence on
currency markets in September which forced the Bank of Italy to raise the
discount rate to 15 per cent, the highest level since 1985. Thursday's move
followed Senate approval of new taxes and spending cuts in the 1993 budget.
The latter included the controversial minimum tax on Italy's 6.1m
self-employed, effectively doubling the base of their taxable income.
Deputies in the four-party ruling coalition backed the minimum tax, which
has provoked countrywide protests, on the understanding it is replaced in
1994.
Parliament has now approved measures to raise L66,000bn (Pounds 32bn) of the
L93,000 projected in new taxes and spending cuts in the 1993 budget. The
Bank of Italy's previous cut in the discount rate on October 26 followed
parliamentary approval for reforms of pensions, health, the civil service
and local government.

<TEXT>
THE German Defence Ministry said yesterday it was confident that a
compromise would be found between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain on
building a joint fighter aircraft to replace the European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA).
At the same time, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa), the German partner in the four-nation EFA project, expressed
optimism that 'a version' of the aircraft would be built.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary added yesterday that he
was considerably more optimistic than a few weeks ago. 'The indications we
are getting now are that the Germans wish to remain in the development phase
of the project. It is clear that the overwhelming probability is that it is
to remain a collaborative project of almost certainly four countries.'
The three statements are the most positive indication yet that Germany may
agree to go ahead with a cheaper version of the EFA, presenting it as a new,
re-designed aircraft.
However, the German government may still insist on an extension of the
current development period, and a later production date for the new version,
in order to delay the full effect on its overstretched budget.
British officials believe that Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister,
who has insisted he will not go ahead with production of the EFA, will no
longer carry out his tacit threat to pull out of the development programme,
and risk heavy compensation payments.
If he can present a much cheaper version of the EFA as a new aircraft,
observers believe, then he may yet be prepared to go ahead with it.
The Bonn defence ministry said yesterday that all reports of a rapprochement
between the EFA partners remained 'pure speculation' until the defence
ministers meet to discuss the project in December.
They have been told by the EFA consortium that the DM133m cost of the
aircraft can be cut by 30 per cent.
But they are awaiting a report from the four chiefs of defence staff,
expected to be finalised in the coming days, on the changed 'defence
requirements' of their respective air forces beyond the year 2000.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Russia offers deal to Volsky
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government will today try to secure its survival and the thrust
of its radical market reforms by offering industrialists a chance for their
leader, Mr Arkady Volsky, to help draft a new economic strategy.
Under a deal to be submitted to industrialists in Moscow today, Mr Anatoly
Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation and
co-ordinating economic reforms, would work directly with Mr Volsky on a
compromise economic plan.
In return, Mr Volsky, the powerful head of the Russian Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a leading figure in the main Civic
Union opposition group, would work for the survival of the government at a
critical session of the Russian super-parliament on December 1.
But despite the fact that the deal represents a major coup for Mr Volsky, Mr
Chubais named three crucial areas in which the government would refuse to
compromise. He said it would reject any increase in money supply to support
industry, any slowing down of mass privatisation, and any attempt to abandon
a single exchange rate.
It is not clear what this will mean for policies which are already being
eroded in practice: the government has lost control for instance over much
monetary and credit policy because Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank
chairman, believes in supporting industry.
A bankruptcy law, which will be approved in a final reading by parliament
next week and which is supported by Mr Volsky, is unlikely to bite for some
time because the country does not have commercial courts to enforce it.
But the government must at least hope it will fend off the worst of the
demands being made by Civic Union, which include: a return to price controls
and centrally-planned state procurement, an indexation of all savings to
inflation which could be 2,000 per cent this year, and apparently limitless
increases in working capital for inefficient enterprises.
It is in the industrialists' interests to support a government which depends
on them for survival, rather than a new one which could bring in genuine
anti-market moves.
In talks in Kiev on Thursday, Russia reached a tentative agreement with
Ukraine, persuading it to give up most of its claims on former Soviet assets
so that Moscow can take sole charge of the former Soviet Union's main
liability, a foreign debt of Dollars 80bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration could move a step closer on Monday towards
appointing a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of criminal
wrongdoing by senior US government officials in the spreading Iraqgate
affair.
Mr Frederick Lacey, the retired New Jersey judge who has been investigating
the issue for the US Department of Justice, has told the Bush administration
that he found 'sufficiently specific and credible' allegations to extend his
inquiry.
Mr Lacey, who was appointed on October 16, made this known to Mr William
Barr, the US attorney general, on October 26, a week before the presidential
election. But he only disclosed yesterday his desire to extend the inquiry.
Mr Barr, who last summer rejected a demand from the US House of
Representatives' judiciary committee to appoint a special prosecutor, has
been facing uproar in Congress since it emerged last month that officials at
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Department of Justice deliberately
concealed intelligence reports from federal prosecutors in Atlanta.
The prosecutors were investigating the illegal loans of more than Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) to Iraq from the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro, which helped Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's weapons
projects.
Mr Barr will report to the judiciary committee on Monday and announce that
he has given Mr Lacey until December 8 to make a final recommendation on
whether a special prosecutor should be appointed. . Officials said the
deadline would come just a week before the statute that authorises such
special prosecutors is due to expire, a law that dates back to the Watergate
era. .
The US Justice Department has cleared FBI director William Sessions of
allegations that he may have broken the law by trying to evade local taxes
and making personal long-distance telephone calls from his office, and
decided against the appointment of an independent special counsel, the FBI
said yesterday.

FT  14 NOV 92 / N-ship anger startles Tokyo: French plutonium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday admitted it had underestimated the scale of the
international outcry provoked by its controversial shipment of plutonium
from France last weekend.
The specially equipped Akatsuki Maru set sail from Cherbourg last Saturday,
carrying one ton of plutonium to be used for Japan's fast-breeder nuclear
reactor.
The criticism has become a serious embarrassment, as governments from 10
countries, including Chile and South Africa, have forbidden the entry of the
ship into their territorial waters.
Mr Hiroyuki Kishino, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' nuclear
energy division, said: 'We didn't expect such high international attention.'
The route of the Akatsuki Maru, thought to be now sailing around the Canary
Islands, has not been disclosed: it could head for the southern tip of
Africa, or the tip of South America, or the Panama Canal.
Environmental activists argue that an accident at sea could cause an
environmental disaster, and Greenpeace, the international environmental
pressure group, has vowed to follow the ship, meeting it at every port.
Greenpeace maintains that one millionth of a gram of plutonium is enough to
cause lung cancer and that eight kilograms can easily be turned into a
nuclear bomb.
Japanese officials claim that they have taken all necessary precautions,
including protection against a terrorist attack. They also say that, even if
the plutonium was discharged into the ocean, the environmental impact would
be minimal.
Japan is unlikely to change its plans for shipping a total of 30 tonnes of
plutonium from Britain and France over the next 10-15 years. Mr Reiji
Nagashi, director of the nuclear energy industry division at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti), stressed the importance of energy
self-sufficiency for a nation with few natural resources.
Japan has long tried to develop plutonium-based fast-breeder reactors, which
create plutonium as the fuel emits energy. It has 41 conventional nuclear
reactors operating on imported uranium, which can only be used once, and
needs to send its uranium waste abroad for reprocessing.
However, the economic viability of using plutonium is still under scrutiny,
since the price of uranium has plunged in recent years. Moreover, Japanhas
only one fast-breeder reactor, which is used experimentally. Technology for
commercial fast-breeder reactors will not be ready until 2030, and
full-scale use of plutonium may not happen till the middle of the next
century.
The Maritime Safety Agency has blamed Greenpeace for last week's collision
between the Shikishima, a Japanese escort vessel, and the Solo, the
Greenpeace protest boat shadowing the Akatsuki Maru. The agency warned that
it would not refrain from warning shots in future such incidents.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE bankruptcies in Japan will continue to mount until at least next
spring, according to a report published yesterday by Teikoku Data Bank, the
credit rating agency, which said there were 1,294 bankruptcies in September,
20 per cent up on the same month last year.
Teikoku Data Bank underlined the severity of the downturn in the Japanese
economy by predicting that bankruptcies would reach 14,000 for the year as a
whole. In the 10 months to the end of October there were 11,385
bankruptcies.
This is still well short of the 20,841 bankruptcies reported in 1984, when
Japanese export industries were hit by a sharp appreciation of the yen.
However the projected rate of growth in bankruptcies, a 30.5 per cent rise
from the 10,723 reported in 1991, is far greater than at any time during the
1980s.
The report confirms that the economic slowdown has become the main reason
for bankruptcies. In 1990 and 1991 the main factor was the collapse in the
stock and real estate markets.
About 51 per cent of the September bankruptcies were attributed to the
gathering downturn. Fewer than 10 per cent were attributed to the burst of
Japan's real estate bubble.
The 1,294 September bankruptcies had a value of Y760bn (Pounds 4bn),
slightly down from the Y784bn in September 1991.

THE European Commission is preparing to offer more than Ecu240m (Pounds

Senior Commission officials were meeting last night to consider Brussels'
response to last month's plea for help from Community steelmakers, which
have been hit by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC imports.
The Commission's industrial directorate is recommending Ecu240m of
assistance between 1993 and 1995 to help cover the cost of laying off or
retraining as many as 50,000 workers.
The proposals fall short of what the steel industry has been demanding.
Steel-makers believe a redundancy programme over the next three or four
years could cost at least Ecu2bn, while the related cost of closures could
double that figure. They are prepared to contribute to that cost, but expect
the Commission to provide political, commercial and financial support.
Commission officials said yesterday that Brussels was reluctant to get
involved in centralised regulation of the steel market, as implied in the
industry's request. Nor does it want to decide where radical capacity cuts
should be made. Instead, the Commission may employ a consultancy to advise
the companies on the best way to proceed with the proposed restructuring.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, wants the 16 EC
commissioners to approve an aid package at their meeting on the same day,
for presentation to EC industry ministers on November 24.
Commissioners will have to decide the sensitive question of where to find
funding for the aid plan.
In particular, they will discuss whether the EC should draw on reserves in
the European coal and steel treaty - Ecu750m built up from levies on the two
industries - to fund closures.
The industrial directorate is recommending that support for redundancies
should come from the existing budget of the treaty, but the separate
reserves are considered by some Commission departments to be sacrosanct
because they underpin a series of coal- and steel-related loans.

A SMALL group of retired officers, one of whom is linked to drug
trafficking, attempted to take over Peru's Government Palace and army
headquarters and assassinate President Alberto Fujimori early yesterday, the
palace said, Reuter reports from Lima.
The coup attempt, aimed at impeding upcoming congressional elections, was
put down and the officers have been detained, the palace said.
Mr Fujimori, who suspended constitutional rule in April with the backing of
the military, had to abandon Government Palace early yesterday after about
200 troops and several tanks took up positions outside the palace,
government sources said.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Australia boosts job creation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday reshuffled spending plans for the next
18 months to add ADollars 182m (Pounds 83m) to job creation schemes.
However, delays in other planned spending will reduce the net impact to
ADollars 8m this year and ADollars 31m in 1993-94.
The announcement follows an increase of 0.5 percentage points in the number
of registered unemployed, to a post-war record of 11.3 per cent, equivalent
to just under 1m workers.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), said the extra
spending was expected to produce about 20,000 jobs in the financial year to
the end of June.
The effect of the revision is to increase spending on job subsidies this
year, at the expense of investment in transport and energy infrastructure
announced in the government's One Nation economic statement in February.
A number of One Nation projects have progressed slowly, mainly because of
disagreements between the federal and state governments and drawn-out
staffing negotiations with trade unions.
Mr Dawkins said ADollars 150m earmarked for a proposed National Rail
Corporation and ADollars 24m for electricity grid projects would be deferred
until 1993/94 because it was unlikely to be spent by the end of June. The
savings will help to finance an extra ADollars 77m for job subsidy
programmes, ADollars 20m for sporting, heritage, community and cultural
projects, ADollars 55m for local capital works and ADollars 30m for
small-scale road improvements.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the government was 'on track' to
achieve its target budget deficit of ADollars 13.4bn, but was 'probably
under' its target for job creation.
The government forecast in the August budget that unemployment would fall to
10 per cent by June, the last date for the next federal election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENG XIAOPING, China's senior leader, has told the Chinese leadership not to
compromise in its opposition to the proposals of Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, for greater democracy in the territory.
According to Chinese officials, the 88-year-old Deng has given instructions
that any measures introduced without Beijing's consent should be repudiated
after China assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
The disclosure that implacable hostility to Mr Patten's plans stems from the
highest level in Beijing clouds the prospects for a visit to Britain by Zhu
Rongji, a Chinese vice premier recently promoted to the Communist party
politburo.
Zhu arrives tomorrow for five days of meetings with British politicians and
companies. He will meet Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Patten will be in London to consult Mr Major and Mr Hurd, and is likely
to have informal contact with Zhu.
Zhu, whose main role is in economic reform, will visit London's stock,
futures and insurance exchanges and will see companies which have done
significant business with China. He is expected to receive advice from
merchant banks on how to privatise China's bloated and loss-making state
industries. Beijing is anxious to take a 'business as usual' approach to
relations with London, separating Hong Kong from other issues.
However, Mr Patten's proposals have caused a rift in Sino-British relations
and British officials expect Hong Kong to be raised. London and Hong Kong
have urged Beijing to discuss the 1995 election plan suggested by Mr Patten,
but it has responded with threats of turmoil after 1997.
Chinese officials said that before Mr Patten visited Beijing last month,
Deng met Li Peng, prime minister, Lu Ping, head of Hong Kong policy, and
Zhou Nan, China's representative in Hong Kong, to decide how to deal with
the governor's plans.

   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING anxiety over the evolution of a Kurdish state is set to dominate the
meeting in Ankara today between Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister,
and his Syrian and Iranian counterparts.
The talks are the first attempt by the regional powers to find a solution to
the instability in north Iraq, where Kurds have set up a de facto
administration since allied forces left the area at the end of the Gulf war.
The US, as well as the UK and France, who have provided the air deterrent
for the Kurdish-held areas, is concerned lest Ankara and the other capitals
should use the fear of a Kurdish state as an argument to negotiate again
with Baghdad.
Turkey, Syria and Iran - with Kurdish minorities of their own, like Iraq -
have deep misgivings about recent moves to establish an elected Kurdish
assembly which has already declared its intention to set up a federal state.
Today's meeting will also give the Turks an opportunity to reassure their
neighbours, after 20,000 Turkish troops went into north Iraq last month to
flush out bases of the separatist Kurdish Workers party who had used the
power vacuum in the area to mount attacks on Turkish positions. The Iranian
parliament urged the Turks to withdraw.
Turkey is in a strong position to shape regional developments. The Turkish
parliament has still to decide whether to extend the allied security
umbrella for the Kurds beyond the new year. Equally vital, Turkey controls
the cross-border trade which provides the lifeline for the Kurdish-held
areas in the face of the Iraqi embargo on supplies.
Turkish officials are keen that the current UN embargo against Iraq should
not prejudice Turkey's long-term relations with Baghdad.

<TEXT>
Mr Harry Blair Cunningham, former chairman of Kmart, the large US retail
group, and one of the best-known figures in US retailing since the war, has
died, Nikki Tait reports from New York. Mr Cunningham was 85.
Mr Cunningham is widely credited with first introducing discount retailing
to American shoppers on a big scale and effectively creating today's Kmart
store chain in the process.
He became manager of a Kresge store, one of the hundred of outlets built up
by Mr Sebastian Kresge after the first world war. By 1959 he had risen to
become president of the SS Kresge group.
It was three years later, in 1962, that the Kresge company opened its first
Kmart discount store in a Detroit suburb, a retail formula which proved
immensely successful. In an expansion blitz, it exploded to 1,200 outlets by
the mid-1970s. Recognising that discount stores had become the mainstay of
the group, shareholders approved a change in the company's name to Kmart in
1977.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail sales rose faster than expected last month, prompting hopes that
domestic demand might at last spur the sluggish US economy into recovery,
George Graham writes in Washington.
The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased by 0.9 per cent
in October to reach a level 5.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Some of the
increase appears to have been stimulated by sales of furniture and building
materials in the wake of the hurricane that hit Florida and Louisiana, but
economists noted solid gains in car and clothing sales.
Consumer prices also rose faster than expected in October, climbing 0.4 per
cent to yield a year on year inflation rate of 3.2 per cent - up from 3.0
per cent in September.
Most economists, however, regarded the rise as a blip unlikely to signal any
break in the general disinflationary trend seen not only in the US but
around the world. The increase stemmed partly from a sharp rise in air
fares, after months of price wars in the airline industry, but also from
costlier housing and fuel costs.

FT  14 NOV 92 / All change for Clinton - slowly: George Graham explains the
three-month transitional administration period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST 10 days after Governor Bill Clinton's victory in the US presidential
election, journalists are waiting impatiently for something to happen and
Democrats are waiting just as impatiently for their job applications to be
answered.
They will have to wait a while longer. Not until January 20 will President
George Bush move out of the White House and Mr Clinton take his oath of
office as the US's 42nd president.
The US's drawn-out transition is the object of some puzzlement to many
foreign observers, who are used to new governments moving in within days or
even hours of victory. Some wonder if it is really necessary to wait almost
three months after the election before handing over power, now that it no
longer takes so long for delegates to the electoral college to make their
way by mule from the further quarters of Kentucky and Tennessee.
But US political scientists argue that it still serves a useful purpose
because of the length and intensity of the presidential campaign, the
absence of a shadow government ready to assume office, and the extent of the
turnover in US government officials that follows the election of a new
president.
Candidates have often spent over a year on the campaign trail making
promises and proposals of all kinds; once elected, they have to work out
which of these have priority, and who can best implement them. A transition
team can determine the ultimate success of an administration by its creation
of a government which knows what it wants to do and which can work together
to accomplish it.
'It is a hangover from the 18th century, but it has also turned out to be
reasonably functional,' comments Professor Bert Rockman of the University of
Pittsburgh.
Professor Stephen Wayne of Georgetown University argues that a long
transition period has become more necessary since the 1960s because of an
increased politicisation of the bureaucracy: the civil servants who provide
the institutional memory of government have been pushed further down the
decision-making tree.
In addition, he says, the appointment process now takes longer because of
more rigorous background checks and financial disclosure requirements for
potential appointees.
Overall, a total of 9,100 jobs in the federal government are listed in a
volume known as the Plum Book as non-competitive, or political,
appointments. Many of these, however, are filled by career civil servants;
many more are part-time positions or require specialised, non-political
skills such as medicine or engraving.
In practice, only some 3,000 jobs are really open for political appointees -
still a huge number in comparison with most other countries - and Prof
Rockman cautions that only 600 to 800 are important policy-making positions.
Meanwhile, 75 journalists lie in wait in Little Rock, the Arkansas state
capital, begging for something to write about. That mostly means detailed
accounts of Mr Clinton's jogging routes or of the intrusion of Secret
Service agents into his daughter's school.
It also means intense focus on the appointment of the transition team - many
of whose members will in fact have only a brief spurt of flame, and have
little importance in the actual Clinton administration.
Probing analysis is brought to bear on Mr Clinton's every utterance, as
though his one-liners today provide more insight into his administration's
policies than the detailed position papers he issued during the campaign.
Indeed, Mr Clinton had to devote a considerable portion of his first news
conference on Thursday to explaining that he had not, 10 days after his
election and two months before his inauguration, yet seen fit to perform any
U-turns on policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's ozone layer dropped to its lowest levels in decades during 1992,
the World Metereological Organisation (WMO) said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox,
Environment Correspondent, writes in London.
The evidence that ozone depletion was worse than predicted comes days before
the start of a two week international convention in Copenhagen which intends
to bring forward deadlines for phasing out ozone-damaging chemicals.
The WMO, a United Nations agency, said that between January and March,
average levels of ozone in the atmosphere above Moscow, Scandinavian
capitals, cities in northern Germany and most of Britain were between 15 and
20 per cent below normal.
It is feared that thinning of the protective layer could lead to an increase
in human skin cancer and lower yields from farm crops.
The WMO attributes this year's unusual thinness to continued use of man-made
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigerators, aerosols and cleaning fluids,
and to natural chemicals thrown into the atmosphere by the volcanic
eruptions last year.
The Copenhagen conference, which starts on Tuesday, is expected to back
phasing out CFCs by 1996, with provision for some exemptions, compared to
the original deadline of 2000 set in the 1987 Montreal Protocol.
Ozone thinning is a seasonal phenomenon which is affected by weather
conditions, and the report says that during the past three weeks the
Antarctic ozone 'hole' has been slowly shrinking.
This week's meeting of signatories to the London Dumping Convention, a
worldwide treaty governing dumping waste at sea, looked set to end last
night with no resolution to the controversy over radioactive waste dumping.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Senior civil servants asked to consider pay curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR civil servants have been asked to consider forgoing part of a pay
rise announced in July as part of the government's squeeze on pay.
The government also an-nounced yesterday that top civil servants, judges and
members of the armed forces will join MPs in getting no salary rises next
year.
Meanwhile Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, urged the private sector
to observe the 1.5 per cent pay ceiling being imposed on the public sector.
He said yesterday: 'What happened in the past when the pound has been
devalued is that some of the benefits have been thrown away in higher wages
and it would be very good to avoid that this time.'
The idea of a voluntary pay curb for senior civil servants comes from Sir
Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, in a letter to colleagues. He
says many permanent secretaries 'will choose either not to draw some or all
of the 3 per cent increase due . . . until April 1 1994 or will contribute
it to good causes'.
He says he is 'not asking colleagues to act similarly', and 'any decision is
up to them' but the letter's tone suggests Sir Robin wants high-ranking
officials to consider self-imposed restraint.
The 3 per cent is due from April 1993 as part of a government decision to
phase in this year's pay award for the top three grades of civil servants.
The effect of the pay freeze announced yesterday for workers covered by the
Top Salaries' Review Body, including senior civil servants, is that there
will be no additional sum representing a pay award for 1993.
Sir Robin's comments came as Labour challenged Mr John Major, the prime
minister, over the effect of the pay restraints announced in the Autumn
Statement on Thursday.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'While everyone else in the public
sector receives less than 1.5 per cent in the coming year, judges, admirals,
generals and top civil servants will actually receive a rise of almost 3 per
cent on April 1 1993.'
He said the government had to explain why the pay restraint, caused by the
recession, 'should apply in its entirety to the lowest paid in the land but
not the highest paid in the land'.
Sir Robin acknowledges there would be 'a particular problem for those in
charge of departments who will be asking their staff to accept a policy
which will inevitably bear heavily on them'.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Ministers launch drive to boost confidence in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR ministers yesterday launched a concerted drive to strengthen optimism
in government ranks and confidence among businesses and consumers after
Thursday's announcement of measures to spur economic recovery.
But as cabinet ministers sought to reap the political benefit of a new
cheerfulness among Tory MPs, the plans were given a cooler reception in the
City, where several analysts complained that they would be insufficient to
ensure growth.
Leading UK equities lost virtually all Thursday's gains, with the FT-SE 100
index closing at 2,697.5, down 28.9 points. UK gilts fell sharply, with long
dated issues down nearly a full percentage point.
However, sterling, which declined sharply against the D-Mark in overnight
trading after the Autumn Statement, more than recovered its losses. It
closed in London at DM2.4275, up  3/4 pfennigs on the day, and gained just
over 2 1/2 cents against a generally weaker dollar to close at Dollars
1.5495. In New York, sterling closed at Dollars 1.5505, and was quoted in
late trading at DM2.4374.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the Autumn Statement improved
Britain's economic outlook 'immeasurably'. The three percentage point drop
in interest rates over the past two months was a 'huge potential injection
of liquidity into the economy', he told BBC radio's Today programme.
Consumers should be more confident in spite of their large stock of debt
because of a 'dramatic' lowering of debt servicing costs.
As Mr Lamont urged industry to make the most of low interest rates, a
competitive pound and the government's moves to boost confidence, senior
party managers emphasised that the Autumn Statement would enable the Tories
to put their recent divisions behind them. Initial signs of a more united
approach appeared as Tory MPs across a range of opinion, both for and
against the UK rejoining the exchange rate mechanism, expressed approval for
Thursday's decisions.
Mr John Major sought to play down the Tories' recent difficulties,
contrasting 'the very strong support for the strategy for growth we
produced' with disaffection among a 'small number of backbenchers'.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said that 'the Autumn Statement
enables us to draw a line under those past difficulties', while Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, said: 'Today, for the first time in many weeks,
the load of anxiety is lifting'.
The encouragement to business from Mr Lamont to 'go for it', was repeated by
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary. Both Mr Major and Mr Lamont,
however, warned that there was no magic solution to bring about instant
recovery.
The Conservatives' immediate euphoria will be tested next week when the
spending plans and measures for growth will come under sustained scrutiny.
Both Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, face questions
from the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs early next week. The Commons
will also hold a two-day debate on Thursday's statement.
The significance of the Autumn Statement for the government's political
fortunes will be underlined when the prime minister makes the annual speech
at the Lord Mayor's Banquet on Monday. Traditionally an occasion for dealing
primarily with foreign policy, the signal from Downing Street is that his
theme is likely to be the domestic economy.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Anger as PM opts to miss S African rugby game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S historic rugby match between England and South Africa continued to
be dogged by controversy when it emerged last night that Mr John Major had
cancelled plans to attend the game.
Mr Major had been expected to accompany South African president F W de
Klerk, who arrived in London yesterday, after talks with him in the morning.
Yesterday, rugby authorities tried to defuse a row over national anthems.
They said only God Save the Queen would be played today and not Die Stem
(The Voice). The decision was taken after objections by the African National
Congress that Die Stem was too closely associated with the ruling National
party and the policy of apartheid. A decision to play neither anthem was
revoked in the face of protest by English fans.
Downing Street officials said last night no announcement about Mr Major's
attendance had been made. The prime minister had a heavy official and
private programme over the weekend, including his daughter's 21st birthday
party, and that was the only reason he was not going to the match.
However, angry South African rugby officials made clear they had been
expecting Mr Major to be Mr de Klerk's host. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage
secretary, is expected to take his place.
Mr Major's decision is likely to be seen by Pretoria as a snub, though
Downing Street stressed that any such interpretation would be 'ludicrous'.
An official pointed out that Mr Major would be driving from his Huntingdon
constituency for today's meeting.
The importance of the occasion for South Africa was highlighted in a speech
last night by Mr de Klerk who hailed it as a symbol, 'perhaps more than any
other . . . (of) the restoration of normal relations between South Africa
and the United Kingdom'.
The game is the first between the two sides at Twickenham since 1969.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Japan's motor part groups 'outperform'rival UK suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALARMING productivity and quality gap exists between UK and Japanese
automotive components suppliers, according to a pioneering study to be
disclosed next week.
It claims that 'world-class Japanese manufacturing plants outperform their
UK equivalents by at least two to one in productivity, quality, throughput
time and space utilisation'.
The study, by Cardiff Business School, Cambridge University and Andersen
Consulting, examines the manufacturing performance and management practices
of 18 component makers, nine each in the UK and Japan. They produce brakes,
exhaust systems, seats and wiring harnesses for many leading vehicle makers
in Japan and Europe.
A third of the companies studied showed outstanding performance in both
quality and productivity. All these companies were Japanese and most were
suppliers to Toyota, the leading Japanese vehicle maker.
Some of the other Japanese plants lagged behind this group of 'world-class'
producers and 'many still have a way to go to achieve this status', says the
report. The five worst performers in the study all came from the UK,
however.
The study claims the UK plants had an average of 2.5 defects per 100 parts
coming off the assembly line, while the best Japanese plants had only 2.5
defects per 10,000 parts. Many of the UK plants produce only half as many
parts as the best Japanese suppliers but with the same number of employees.
The group of 'world-class' Japanese companies holds only a seventh of the
inventory held by the other plants, and the best Japanese companies turn
over their stock three times more quickly than the average of the other
component makers.
The 'world-class' plants do not use pay based on job classifications, says
the report, and their employment practices are 'noticeably more progressive
than those of the non-world class plants'. The study claims to be the 'most
comprehensive benchmarking study of its kind'.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Fresh setback for industry: Manufacturing output down CBI
forecasts regional declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weakened state of Britain's manufacturers, shown in official figures
yesterday, gave a fresh warning to the government that it faces an uphill
struggle to revive the economy through the package of measures unveiled in
the Autumn Statement.
Manufacturing output fell by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter compared with
the second quarter, reversing the modest improvement in the sector's
fortunes in the first six months of the year.
More gloom came from a survey by the Confederation of British Industry which
said manufacturing output was expected to fall in every UK region over the
next four months, except for the north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside.
The news came as figures released by the Central Statistical Office (CSO)
showed the Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation - the retail
prices index less mortgage interest payments - fell to a year-on-year level
of 3.8 per cent in October, the lowest figure since March 1988.
This gave the government fresh evidence that inflationary pressures are
extremely slight, providing the basis for what it hopes will be a slow
recovery next year.
Yesterday's indications about economic weakness appear to justify the growth
package unveiled by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as part of Thursday's
Autumn Statement. The package included 1 percentage point off interest rates
from yesterday and other measures to inject Pounds 1bn into the economy by
next April.
The officially inspired reduction in bank base rates to 7 per cent led to a
fresh spate of cuts in mortgage interest rates. Woolwich, the third biggest
building society, cut its basic mortgage rate by 0.75 percentage points to
8.55 per cent, while two other societies - Northern Rock and Alliance &amp;
Leicester - also shaved their borrowing rates.
Together with other economic data released in recent weeks, the
manufacturing figures from the CSO suggest that total UK output, excluding
oil and gas, may have dropped slightly between the second and third
quarters, after an 0.1 per cent increase between the second and third
three-month periods.
The CSO is releasing a provisional estimate for third quarter GDP next week.
According to government statisticians, the best estimate of the year-on-year
growth rate of manufacturing output is that it is flat. A month ago, the CSO
was slightly more confident, saying manufacturers appeared to be increasing
production by a modest 0.5 per cent per year.
Manufacturing output - which accounts for just over a fifth of the economy
but strongly influences other sectors such as services - has so far dropped
by 7.5 per cent since the start of the recession around the second quarter
of 1990.
The Treasury said the fall in factory output was 'disappointing'. However,
it was cheered by the news on inflation, which brought the underlying
measure comfortably within Mr Lamont's 1-4 per cent target range.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Police examine Pounds 1.1m DTI fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO SENIOR Department of Trade and Industry officials will be interviewed
next month over an investigation into a possible Pounds 1.1m fraud on the
DTI involving a Liverpool ice cream company, according to Merseyside Police.
GS Gumbuir, which has operated an ice cream wholesaling business in
Liverpool city centre for about 30 years, received development area grants
during the late 1980s.
Customs and Excise officers are understood to have contacted Merseyside
Fraud Squad following VAT inquiries.
The two officials who approved the grants - Mr Bob Anderson, now the DTI's
East Midlands regional director, and Mr John McCann, a Liverpool-based
executive - were suspended from duty on police bail after being arrested.
Police said they also want to interview Mr Parjamit Singh Gumbuir, a senior
executive of the company and a member of the family which owns it. He is in
India but is expected back in Britain soon.
Mr Anderson played a central role with the DTI in Liverpool for several
years, working closely with the Merseyside Task Force, a group of senior
civil servants led by the Department of the Environment.
Mr McCann is the executive officer who, until his suspension, administered
the government's regional selective assistance programme in the area.
The task force, set up by Mr Michael Heseltine after the 1981 Toxteth riots,
is the government's main link with industry, commerce, local authorities and
development agencies.

in front of the EJ200 engine for the European Fighter Aircraft.
Mr Rifkind yesterday visited Rolls-Royce's Bristol factory, where the engine
is being built. He said he was 'considerably more optimistic' over the
future of the project following talks with Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence
minister. Mr Ruhe indicated his country's wish to remain in the EFA
development phase which has so far cost Pounds 5bn.
Germany had been threatening to pull out of the multi-billion pound joint
project with Britain, Italy and Spain, saying costs were too high.
Mr Rifkind pointed out that a recent review of production costs had
indicated possible savings of up to 30 per cent - the figure sought by the
Germans.
The first flight engine is being tested and is due to make its debut in the
third prototype EFA next summer.
The first two prototypes will fly soon, powered by RB199 engines, the power
packs for Britain's Tornado aircraft.
The EJ200 project employs about 2,000 peopleat Patchway, near Bristol.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Late consent on Iraq sales disclosed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government was clearing export licences for the last batch of Matrix
Churchill machine tools for Iraq on the day before the invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
The clearances strongly suggest that a meeting of ministers two weeks
previously, chaired by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, led to
significant relaxation of restrictions that had been holding up machine tool
exports for months previously.
Mr Paul Henderson, former managing director of Matrix Churchill, has
confirmed that he was given clearance for exports by the Department of Trade
and Industry on August 1 1990. The clearances came after earlier hold-ups
caused by the refusal of the Foreign Office to let the exports go through.
Stonewalling by Mr William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister
concerned about the implications of the exports, was overcome after Lord
Ridley, then trade and industry secretary contacted Baroness Thatcher, who
was then prime minister.
With her agreement Mr Hurd was asked to convene a meeting of ministers on
July 19, less than two weeks before the invasion, to discuss the guidelines
on supplying defence-related equipment to Iraq.
A number of options were on the table, ranging from a Ministry of Defence
proposal to dispense with the guidelines to the Foreign Office preference
for keeping them.
The government has not revealed the outcome of the meeting, but the DTI's
intervention to clear the machine tool export applications suggest that the
government had given the green light to hitherto controversial licence
applications.
The revelations show that the Ministry of Defence and the DTI, which had
been pushing hard for relaxation of controls, had succeeded in winning the
approval of senior cabinet ministers. According to documents released to
defence counsel in the Matrix Churchill trial, the outcome of the meeting
would have been reported to the prime minister.
Mr Henderson said there was no question in his mind that the government had
relaxed the guidelines. 'Because they were relaxing Cocom regulations it was
applying to Iraq as well.'
Mr John Nosworthy, the former director of the Machine Tools Technologies
Association, confirmed that he was passed documents from the DTI at the time
revealing details of the relaxation of regulations under Cocom (the
organisation which controlled sale of western high technology to Communist
countries) that had a direct bearing on exports to Iraq.
Labour has stepped up its efforts to challenge Mr John Major over
arms-related sales to Iraq, by releasing further documents and calling on
him to say how much he knew about the issue of export licences when he was
foreign secretary.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday published
three papers from the few months in 1989 in which Mr Major was at the
Foreign Office. He described them as a 'smoking Howitzer' which showed that
Mr Major 'knew the machine tools were going to arm Saddam in contravention
of the guidelines'.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAD YOU been able to track down Michael Foxen 20 years ago to his bicycle
mending shop in north Africa and told him that today he would be chairman of
The Real Food Group with a turnover of Pounds 6m and a staff of 100 he would
not have believed you.
He would also have had considerable trouble hearing you. Scarlet fever as a
child left Foxen with impaired hearing. At 18 he was told that he would
almost certainly be deaf by the time he was 25. Foxen had won a scholarship
to London University, but he decided to see the world instead.
Thanks to warmer climates and a changed diet his hearing did not deteriorate
and in 1975 Foxen returned to the cleaner airs of Edinburgh. With his wife,
Charlotte Mitchell, Foxen now sits atop an extremely healthy organic and
natural health food empire.
The empire includes two bustling retail shops in the centre of Edinburgh; a
40,000 sq ft warehouse on the outskirts full to the gunnels with the 5,000
different lines they carry for the shops, national wholesaling; and mail
order business and a franchised supermarket chain, specialising in health
food, which has 12 outlets in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Foxen opened Real Foods, Natural and Organic Victuallers in a shop so small
that no more than three customers were allowed in at one time. But he opened
with strong convictions and a customer-friendly approach. He believes
passionately that food does not have to be expensive to be good for you and
that packaging adds little value but great expense for the consumer. He
bought directly and displayed his wares in bulk which meant that the more
customers bought, the lower the price. Queues soon formed outside the shop.
His timing was excellent. hippies, communes and Old Aged Pensioners formed
faithful customers and the mail order side was soon turning over Pounds
1,000 a week including regular despatches to central London (today Real
Foods exports to the Falkland Islands, Iceland and Hong Kong). In 1976 Foxen
found a second retail site in Broughton Street above which lived Charlotte
Mitchell, then at the Scottish Craft Centre. Mitchell had contracted
multiple sclerosis and was trying to explore the possibilities of a
gluten-free diet. Foxen first advised her on how to expand her diet, then
gave her a job. Eventually they married.
As the business grew they imported more and more produce directly: black
mission figs from California, red lentils from Turkey, pumpkin seeds from
China, brown rice from Italy and pasta from Greece and Italy. Their range of
mueslis has been consistently the biggest seller and in their Edinburgh
warehouse is a mix machine which blends a staggering one tonne of muesli an
hour.
There have been failures. The very mention of apricot kernel butter from
China - considered in the late 1970s to be a cure for cancer - still makes
Foxen and Mitchell wince. Their biggest organisational mistake also stemmed
from over-enthusiasm. As the business grew they found that it attracted
like-minded individuals who were not necessarily the most suitably qualified
for the specialised jobs the organisation demanded. Their most effective
management decision showed no such weakness: at the very beginning they
employed a chartered accountant who, after nine years with Real Foods, has
turned restaurateur.
For the first ten years profits were consistently ploughed back to allow the
business to grow. By the mid-1980s the business had not only established
Foxen and Mitchell's livelihoods but had given them different avenues down
which to pursue their own particular interests.
As a food buyer Mitchell would visit the huge annual French organic food and
wine fair, Rouffach, in Alsace. She became fascinated by organic wines, then
almost unobtainable in the UK, and with her own staff as a loyal customer
base, began to import her own range of organic wines. A throwaway line to a
publisher friend over dinner one night led in 1987 to her writing The
Organic Wine Guide (Mainstream Publishing).
Moving on from wine she approached the Caledonian Brewing Company in
Edinburgh to see if they would be interested in producing an organic beer.
Originally rebuffed, she was invited back when a new management team took
over. The resulting brew, Golden Promise, has transformed the fortunes of
the brewery out of the red and into profit. Mitchell is now chairman of the
Soil Association, the charity founded in 1946 by Lady Balfour to promote the
health of the soil, and consequently, the health of those who live on its
produce.
Foxen has pursued his own philosophy but operates more in a manner befitting
a company chairman. By 1984 he had realised that the large supermarket
chains, in taking their produce more and more up market, were losing sight
of their original customers - those in the C2, D and E socio-economic
classes. Combining his commitment to natural foods with the realisation that
it was now much easier to find equally committed individuals to act as
franchisees, Foxen launched Scoop-A-Market as a no-frills supermarket
operation aimed at supplying good quality foodstuffs at low prices. The
concept has been successful for franchisees and for the Real Foods group.
The franchise system saved the company from the nightmare of heavy bank
borrowings.
Having progressed in so many directions the company could evolve in any
number of different ways. Foxen believes that the future lies in niche
marketing and talks enthusiastically of new opportunities for selling
natural and organic foods which he personally would like to pursue.
Mitchell, on the other hand, prefers the pleasures of a well-stocked, well
managed shop, and would like to find more retail sites and continue to
educate the public to the pleasures of food that is good for the body and
the soil which produces it.

FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nippon Credit Bank downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOUNTING bad debts of the Japanese banking system yesterday led Moody's
Investor Services, the US credit rating agency, to downgrade the rating of
the Nippon Credit Bank, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks.
Moody's also said it was considering downgrading three Japanese trust banks
 -Mitsui Trust and Banking, Yasuda Trust and Banking and Toyo Trust and
Banking.
Nippon Credit Bank's rating for short-term deposits was lowered to Prime-3,
from Prime-2. The three trust banks' long-term and short-term deposits as
well as their senior debt is under review.
The reviews reflect the banks' high direct lending to real estate companies
and to the non-bank sector, which expanded real estate lending in the late
1980s.
The Japanese banking industry has been badly hit by a sharp rise in
non-performing loans, largely due to a steep fall in real estate prices. The
Ministry of Finance last month announced that non-performing loans for the
top 21 banks had risen from about Y8,000bn in March to more than Y12,000bn
(Dollars 96.77bn) by the end of September.
Moody's move focuses attention on the long-term credit and trust banks as
the most seriously affected sectors of the industry. It confirms the private
view of many bankers that Nippon Credit may prove to be one of the worst
affected banks.
Moody's said the four banks' exposures to the real estate market and to the
non-bank sector were very high in relation to their assets and earnings.
Non-banks lend but do not take deposits and are far less tightly regulated
than banks.
Its assessment of the four banks concluded: 'Their weak core earnings are
likely to continue to be burdened by unrealised losses embedded in their
large exposures to problematic sectors. Some of these banks may be required
to assist their non-bank affiliates. The scale of the assistance that may be
required to recapitalise some of these affiliates may prove to be quite
large.'
Moody's said it expected the resolution of the banking system's bad debt
problems would prove difficult because it would be hard for the banks to
reach a consensus over how the losses should be allocated.

JOINT venture talks between Siemens and Skoda Pilsen, the biggest
engineering group in Czechoslovakia, were suspended in mid-session yesterday
after Skoda's new chief pressed new demands which went 'far beyond' the
terms discussed so far, the German electro-engineering group said.
No date was set for resumption of negotiations through which Siemens hopes
to take majority stakes in Skoda's transport and power plant businesses.
Siemens said it was still prepared to go ahead with both deals, but stressed
the contracts must be signed by the end of this month 'if the joint ventures
were to get off to a successful start'.
It gave no details of Skoda's fresh demands.
Negotiations, which have been going on since the turn of the year, developed
into a game of cat and mouse earlier this month when Mr Lubomir Soudek,
backed by two Czech banks, bought a 38 per cent stake in Skoda.
Mr Soudek was appointed chief executive and immediately declared Skoda
should retain a majority stake in the locomotive-making business.
He said he was considering the second deal under which KWU, the Siemens
power plant subsidiary, was to buy two-thirds of Skoda-Energo.
Siemens, which wants both deals signed quickly and simultaneously, has said
that an early settlement will allow it to pass on to Skoda of a share in a
DM56m (Dollars 35m) rolling stock contract for Singapore.

FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Veba down 19.6% after 9 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Frankfurt Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, slumped 19.6
per cent to DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m) in the first nine months of this year,
our Frankfurt correspondent writes.
Improvements in the electricity division, which accounts for almost 20 per
cent of group sales, were obliterated by poor performances from basic
chemicals and plastics and restructuring costs - all attributable to the
international recession.
Oil, the second biggest single business sector after trading, also failed to
match 'extraordinarily good' results achieved last year thanks to the
effects of the Gulf war.
Although volume sales increased, turnover at the Veba Oel unit fell 8 per
cent, according to an interim report.
No improvement is expected in the closing months of the year in either
plastics or oil, but 'we are expecting an annual result which, though down,
will nevertheless be relatively satisfactory'.
Almost three-quarters of the 12.3 per cent rise in group sales to DM49.8bn
was accounted for by the first-time inclusion of results from the
Schenker-Rhenus forwarding business.
Meanwhile, trading turnover increased by less than 2 per cent, to DM15bn.
Siemens-Nixdorf, the computer division of Germany's Siemens group, expects
to reduce its losses further in the current year after cutting its net
deficit 34 per cent to DM513m in the year to end-September.
Turnover rose 7 per cent to DM13bn.

FT  14 NOV 92 / TUC says pay squeeze will cut real wages by up to 3.75%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE real wages of nearly 6m workers will be cut by between 2.25 per cent and
3.75 per cent as a result of the government's plan to limit public-sector
pay increases to a ceiling of 1.5 per cent over the next year, according to
an analysis of the Autumn Statement by the Trades Union Congress.
The TUC also estimates that the cut in earnings power for 25 per cent of the
workforce will further reduce consumer confidence and cost 90,000 jobs.
Overall, the TUC says, the package will do nothing to reduce unemployment
which the Treasury's own forecast suggests will remain at almost 3m until
1995-96.
Meanwhile pay analysts are speculating about a radical long-term overhaul of
the pay review bodies which have in effect been bypassed for 1993-94. The
review bodies normally make recommendations on pay for about 1.5m employees
including doctors, nurses, teachers and the armed forces.
Although the government stressed in the statement that the review bodies
would take up their duties again in the 1994-95 pay round, the Treasury also
said that the bodies must accept 'changes from time to time to reflect
developments in their remit groups'.
The government may seek changes in the review bodies' terms of reference,
such as encouraging more regional variations in pay, which would lead to
less generous recommendations.
Other public-sector groups whose pay is determined primarily by formulas
which link their pay to the private sector - civil servants, police and
firefighters - also fear government pressure to weaken their formulas once
the current pay squeeze is past.
The police formula, which links police pay to national average earnings, is
already under scrutiny from the Sheehy committee, which is due to report
next year. The firefighters' formula which links their pay to the upper
quartile of male manual earnings is more likely to survive as it is operated
by the unions and local-authority employers and not by the government.
Other pay analysts speculate that the government's pay squeeze will not
stick and will not even be rigorously applied in organisations such as local
authorities, in which the government is not the direct employer. If the pay
limit is not applied in local authorities or in the newly independent parts
of the public sector such as trust hospitals, managers will have to find
savings elsewhere.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, has written to councils saying
'it is absolutely vital' that local government plays its part in delivering
pay restraint. He warns that higher awards will be achieved 'at the cost of
job losses or a reduction in services'.
But Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, has pointed out that
in the early and mid 1980's the government's public sector pay 'factor' was
broken almost every year.
The TUC's analysis also warns that the suspension of the various pay-setting
arrangements which have superseded collective bargaining for most public
sector employees could create enormous pressure for catch-up rises.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Mobile 'Measure' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURE for Measure has increased its popularity since it opened in 1604.
Coleridge was first to recognise its strengths, finding here 'the permanent
politics of human nature.' Twentieth-century theatre has called it a problem
play and set about finding solutions. Ian Forrest's production of Measure
for Measure at the Chester Gateway succeeds in making it new, adding
portable phones and personal stereos. He delivers an inventive rendering of
an intractable play: illuminating, instructive, but rarely fascinating.
The production's greatest asset is the set (Juliet Watkinson), a compact
between Dante and Hieronymus Bosch, all stairs and levels in brutal grey.
Below, institutional fluorescent light shines up from Claudio's prison;
above, soft stained glass represents Isabella cloistered world. Angelo's
court slides between them.
Each scene moves towards a debate: justice against law, loyalty against
virtue, reason against emotion. The difficulty with Forrest's direction lies
in leaving the actors to reinvent themselves with every speech: within them,
the scenes lack momentum, and between them, cohesion.
The action turns on two encounters. Isabella's pleadings to Angelo for her
brother's life, and then her forgiveness of him in the final scene. Peter
Brook used to make Isabella pause before kneeling for Angelo, stopping the
play for as long as two minutes. This production finds no hesitation.
Angelo (Mark Spalding) starts out buttoned-up and brilliantined, hiding
behind his desk, pretending to work. Opposite him, Isabella (Ruth Gemmell)
is uncertain in her petition but resolute against compromise: 'Isabel, live
chaste, and brother, die: More than our brother is our chastity.' But
Gemmell finds frailty in a gesture, making her excess understandable.
Around them, the Duke (Stephen Ley) has all the authority of a man running
late to a meeting; he makes an improbable lunge to reveal Isabella's
brother, and bound across the stage to propose marriage. His second, Escalus
(Geoffrey Banks) has all the authority of Ross Perot's running mate.
Old-style liberality cedes to new-style rigour tempered with clemency.
The low lifers gain most from being transplanted forward 400 years. Pompey
(Nicholas Murche) uses his mobile to call out from prison, making a dull
monologue come alive as a telephone conversation. His friend Lucio (James
Duke) is a delight. Their adversary, Constable Elbow (Peter Rylands) is the
1990s' model stage police officer: a violent, shiftless, opportunist.
Measure too often presents itself as a war between liberty and restraint -
lust on the one hand and anti-sex legislation on the other. Here, Forrest
hints at a discussion about two kinds of government; one has 'dark deeds
darkly answered'; the other operates in the light of legal process and open
information. Both have drawbacks. The US election last week was a step from
one to the other.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: No reserves - Paris saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a drab start to the season Paris's salerooms are waking up this month
with a flurry of top quality modern art sales with low estimates and, in one
case, no reserve prices.
Meanwhile abroad, Paris auctioneers Drouot stands poised to hold its first
sale of icons and jewellery in Moscow. Joel-Marie Millon, the company's
chairman, spent a week in Russia last July negotiating a sale with the
minister of culture and Art 2000. Millon is waiting for a final ministerial
go-ahead.
Drouot failed, however, to seize extensive premises across the street from
its own overcrowded salerooms. Auctioneer Guy Loudmer opened there this
month. His 72 lot sale of 19th-century and modern paintings on November 23
features works by Gericault - seven drawings, including a study for 'Le
Radeau de la Meduse' and nine oils, ranging from small seascape to a fine
portrait of Alfred de Dreux as a child estimated at FFrs4-6m (Pounds
413,500-Pounds 620,300).
Jacques Tajan, meanwhile, of France's largest auction company Ader-Tajan is
experiencing financial problems largely because a recalcitrant Japanese
businessman owes him FFrs30m an art nouveau glass sale in November 1990.
Tajan's plans to re-auction them in Japan last July were vetoed by his
bankers, and sellers are still waiting for their money. Meanwhile the goods
have lost 70 per cent of their value.
Tajan's former partner Jean-Louis Picard holds his big modern art sale of
the season on November 25. It includes drawings by Degas and Bonnard, two
fine works on paper by Vuillard plus a remarkably atmospheric view of Paris
by Marquet of 1904 (estimate FFrs1.7-2m, Pounds 200,000-Pounds 206,000) and
a 1906 view of Rotterdam by Signac (estimate FFrs2-2.5m, Pounds
206,000-Pounds 257,500).
The star sale, however, is Alain Lesieutre's collection of modern paintings
by auctioneer Francis Briest on November 24. Paris art dealer Lesieutre,
already forced to sell off his substantial Art Deco collection in December
1989, is obeying a court order to auction his paintings. There are no
reserve prices and the 54 lots confirm that, whatever his business
shortcomings, Lesieutre had great taste. The works include an ink drawing by
Gericault and a a fishing boat painted in 1880 by Toulouse-Lautrec at the
age of 16. There are also paintings and drawings by the French cubist Roger
de La Fresnaye, three oils by Nicolas de Stael, three Degas bronze
sculptures, a Sisley, a Pissarro and a fiery fauve Vlaminck of 1906.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: No fear of flying - William Packer is intrigued by
Peter Greenaway's choice at the Louvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Greenaway is that most perplexing of types to a fellow Englishman: a
film-maker who would sooner be known as artist and intellectual - a man more
interested in ideas, and the exploration and extension of the possibilities
of his craft, than in any mere pleasuring of his audience. His films, with
their pretentious titles (Drowning by numbers, A Zed and two noughts) their
affected music, their obscure jokes and art-historical references, tease
when they do not shock, shock when they do not bore, and bore when they do
not infuriate. He is, in short taken more seriously abroad than at home.
Two major European institutions have lately had the bright idea of inviting
his collaboration, not in the making of a film, but in the preparation of
exhibitions intended to test the idea of what an exhibition may be, or do.
Understanding his predeliction for lists and categories, and to mark its own
tercentenary, the Academy of Fine Arts at Vienna recently asked him to
nominate, as the title puts it, 100 Objects to represent the World, which
ended last week.
I did not see this exhibition, but I have the catalogue, with its inventory
of objects and images, and its instructions for their display  - a shadow, a
fallen tree, a gate, a wheelchair, fire, ink, a gibbet, a pig, a kiss, Adam
&amp; Eve. 'Exhibit 100 will be the catalogue of the exhibition . . . open at
the page that comments on Exhibit 100 that shows the Exhibition Catalogue
open at the page that comments on Exhibit 100 that . . .' Pretentious?
Perhaps, but intriguing too, and an exhibition I wish I had been able to see
for myself.
His current exhibition at the Louvre in Paris, is, on the surface, rather
more orthodox, yet here, too, the glossing and testing of ideas, the
personal ruminations, the propositions and self-justifications, the striking
of attitudes - these lists are habit-forming - soon declare themselves.
Greenaway was given the freedom of the Department of Drawings at the Louvre,
to make a choice on any theme. He took as his subject man's earth-bound envy
of the birds and the dream of personal flight. Le bruit des nuages of the
exhibition's title - the sound of the clouds - is, he says, 'what I
eventually wish to hear when I am truly airborne.'
It is not a large show, 93 works in all, from the 15th to the 19th centuries
and passing from the humane classical fantasies of Mantegna to the dark
psychological symbolism of Odilon Redon. To break off at more or less the
moment of man's mastery of powered flight was quite deliberate. But the
arrangement is not chronological: rather it brings appropriate images from
all periods together in nine sections, under headings subsidiary to the main
theme. The first of them, indeed, deals not with flight at all, but with
man's earth-bound condition, borne down by gravity, against which he
struggles to lift himself.
so the dream of flight begins. Turn by turn we consider the angels, and the
imaginative release of a spiritual ecstasy. We explore the clouds and skies
and the upper reaches of the air. And as sure as we approach unto heaven
itself, so as surely are we damned by our presumption, and the great fall
begins. Down we go, with Phaeton and Icarus, down into hell or, at the very
least, down to earth, that the whole cycle may begin again.
The quality of the work, it need hardly be said, is wonderfully high but it
is the variety within the common theme that is the point. From Van Dyck's St
Francis receiving the stigmata to studies of cloud effects by Delacroix,
Constable and Whistler, it brings together, in this stimulating melange of
fantasy and objectivity, spirituality and the mundane, works that more
orthodox scholarship would never think of seeing by the same light. And by
doing so, Greenaway says much that is useful, unexpected and intriguing of
our common human aspirations and spiritual longings, that speak to us still,
through all the differences of time and culture.
We have such collections in the UK that might readily be plundered and
illuminated in just this way, by any suitably educated, free and radical
eye. The Artist's Eye exhibitions at the National Gallery have long offered
an admirable example, within their necessarily limited scope. Would that
others would only follow.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Out go new initiatives - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD, BUT it could have been worse, is the fairly predictable reaction to the
real cuts in funding for the arts, the museums, and the heritage generally,
announced in the autumn statement. The new Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke,
is reported to be well pleased with the outcome.
The sad thing is that as theatres go dark; museums sack staff; and dance
companies close, fingers can be pointed at innocent scapegoats. The obvious
one is the British Library. In a desperate attempt to finish off the job the
Government is pumping an extra Pounds 30m over the next three years into
this benighted project. If things had gone according to plan British Library
expenditure would be an historical blip by now. As things stand it is
absorbing the resources which could have saved the performing arts, eating
up Pounds 136m in 1995-96.
Also in the firing line must be the costs of setting up the new Department
of Heritage. The move to the new building, and additional staff, means that
250 civil servants will consume Pounds 26m next year from a Pounds 991m
total budget.
For the Arts Council there is a brief reprieve. Next year it will receive
almost 2 per cent more, at Pounds 225.63m, and chairman Lord Palumbo has
pledged that existing clients will be taken care of. But out go new
initiatives; new inspirations; new artists. Then the Government starts axing
like a lumber jack, and four years from now the Council is set to receive
marginally less than its current year's grant, a massive cut in real terms.
It will mean a choice between withdrawing subsidy from many smaller arts
groups, or chopping one or two major arts flagships - or doing away with the
Arts Council as we know it.
Of course there are alternative scenarios. Lottery money should be trickling
through by late 1994, which will be a Pounds 100m plus annual lifeline for
the arts. And this week's planned expenditures may be fattened up in
subsequent years. It is an interesting footnote that since Arts Minister
Richard Luce introduced three year funding for the arts in 1989 in an
attempt to enable companies to plan with confidence, not once has a planned
budget become a reality.
For the museums the misery is now. They are invariably getting cuts in real
terms. To distract them Brooke has changed their funding so that instead of
special allocations for maintenance, running costs and purchase grants, the
museums will receive a lump sum to spend at their discretion. At a stroke he
has eliminated the plaintive and embarrassing criticism that the Government
has frozen purchase grants since 1985.
But few directors will be buying another Picasso at the expense of
redundancies, or patching up the roof. The expectation is that the museums
will survive because around 90 per cent of their running costs are absorbed
in wages and the 1.5 per cent freeze in public sector pay will reduce this
burden to less than the sums budgeted. The staff will be paying for the new
Stubbs or the new gallery. The grand plans to shore up the museums by 2000
and make them a national glory look tarnished.
The heritage is the biggest loser from the cuts. English Heritage is
actually getting less money next year, while the National Heritage Fund, the
last bulkwark against losing arts treasures overseas, sees its grant cut
from Pounds 12m to Pounds 8.2m in 1994-95 and even less in the next year. Or
is it Lottery money again? After three fat years the arts are to be skinned.
Lets hope they stored away some provisions.
The sigh of relief at Christie's' Park Avenue saleroom on Wednesday night
reverberated around the art world. At last there were buyers again for
expensive pictures. The most important auction of Impressionist and modern
pictures for over two years went well, with 59 out of the 76 lots finding
buyers and the total of Dollars 70.6m (Pounds 46.7m) safely within
Christie's pre-sale estimate.
There was even an important record when Matisse's colourful interior of his
model asleep sold for Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m). The decline of the art
market has been built around a lack of confidence and an unwillingness of
owners to sell. This week death forced on to the rostrum major pictures, and
American private buyers, obviously confident that the recession is ending,
were buying again.
Not all are confident. Dealers are not around to underpin the bidding and no
Japanese were visible in New York. Christie's did much better than Sotheby's
 -whose sale totalled Dollars 35.6m. and was over 30 per cent unsold -
mainly because it attracted better pictures but also because it persuaded
sellers to place lower reserves. Only the good pictures are moving, like a
rare complete version of Monet's waterlilies which made Dollars 12.1m at
Christie's, but the folk wisdom is that the fall out from a good
Impressionist sale in Manhattan trickles quickly down to Portobello Road.
Meanwhile back in London Christie's best Victorian picture sales for some
time saw disappointment after disappointment yesterday. Lord Leighton's
'Moorish garden', a young girl leading two peacocks, was unsold at Pounds
340,000; so was 'The Bracelet', also by Leighton; and Alma-Tadema's cheeky
nude, 'The Sculptor's Model'. Even Watts famous portrait of Tennyson failed
to sell. Perhaps the potential buyers do not quite believe in Mr Lamont's
economic miracle.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Oppression as the muse - Poetry in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POETRY seldom impinges upon politics in the western world. This is not so,
however, in many other parts of the world; and if there was one theme that
recurred over and over again during this year's 10-day Poetry International
festival at London's South Bank, it was that of the importance of poetry to
writers who have lived and suffered under oppressive regimes and the threat
that those in authority believed the writing of poetry to represent. And,
related to the problem of writing under duress, was a second theme: what
happens to poetry when regimes of that kind disappear. Does it continue to
flourish?
But first, a few of the harrowing details. Jack Mapanje was imprisoned
without trial in Malawi's notorious Mikuyu prison for four years. No charges
were laid, though the authorities had, it seems, taken exception to a poem
conceived on the day that Sergeant Doe took power in Liberia, and therefore
written in criticism of a different regime. No reading or writing was
allowed in the prison, though there were three bibles to be shared amongst
the 90 detainees. In order to stimulate the mind, Mapanje and his fellow
inmates devised indexes - on how many occasions, for example, did a raven
manifest itself between the beginning of the book of Genesis and the end of
Revelations? This exercise in survival later developed into a remarkable
poem entitled 'The Famished Stubborn Ravens of Mikuyu Prison', in which the
biblical ravens meld with the crows that used to hammer on the rooftops of
the prison each dawn. Mapanje's sombre and dignified reading manner
occasionally rose to a pitch of ferocious denunciation - understandably
enough.
Irina Ratushinskaya, imprisoned without trial in Russia in 1983 for
'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda' (which meant the writing of poems)
resorted to writing on soap with matchsticks. She was released on the eve of
the Reyjkavik summit as a gesture of appeasement. Her reading of the poems
written during her captivity was remarkable for its lack of querulousness.
Delivered without the incantatory ferocity or any of the histrionic gestures
that one usually associates with Russian poets, the poems seemed to testify
to a new serenity. Had she transcended all that suffering? Or was this
merely a remarkable act of emotional containment? The only evidence of pain
appeared when she spoke of the difficulty of emigrating from the Motherland.
Later that same evening, the short, ebullient Irish poet Brendan Kennelly
whipped up a storm by reading from The Book of Judas, a ferocious and often
blasphemous denunciation of the backwardness of the Church, the ridiculous,
self-serving behaviour of politicians, and of the way that society maltreats
its children. Speaking with a gloriously manic, almost hysterical fervour,
Kennelly managed to give a good deal of offence to those in the audience who
had come to bask in the reflected glory of Ratushinskaya's heroism. And yet
who but a fool would not delight in a playful account of James Joyce's
dinner with the Holy Family?
Miroslav Holub, the leading poet of post-war Czechoslovakia, is also one of
the world's most eminent immunologists, and much of the subject matter of
his poetry is derived from the practice of science. His poems are sly
parables, written in spare language which is almost entirely stripped of
adjectives or even metaphors. His speaking manner, too, has a clinical
exactitude that helps to point up the humour. His heavily accented English
is a marvel to listen to. A sceptical man, he had this to say of life after
the 'velvet revolution' of 1989 (embedded in a poem entitled 'The Moth'):
'Freedom makes the moth tremble for ever. That is, 22-hours.'
Freedom after communism is a difficult matter - as we were reminded by the
four Slovenian poets. The Slovenes are a small nation of two million people,
and their language and its literature have lived in the shadow of more
powerful neighbours. According to the young poet Ales Debeljak, it is
precisely this sense of having been overlooked that has caused the pervasive
mood of loneliness and existential anxiety in Slovenian poetry, traits
shared by Debeljak himself, whose reading style was emotionless and
strangely abstracted. But the poems themselves make a powerful impact when
read on the page.
English is a multiplicity of tongues, spoken by not a few but a diaspora of
peoples. But can it become a universal language for poetry? Not without
obliterating the traditional cultures of the people who are often yearning
to learn it, according to the English poet James Fenton, who delivered this
year's Poetry Book Society lecture.
Seldom can a festival of poetry have thrown up such difficult and
challenging themes, and that is a measure of its success, leaving aside the
fact that approximately 5,000 people listened to almost 50 poets in the
space of 10 days. Perhaps poetry is after all beginning its long trek back
from the margins of our culture.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Betty Carter - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S Not About The Melody, according to the title of jazz singer Betty
Carter's new album on Verve (513870). Listening to Ms Carter's vocal
technique, most people would surely agree that it is her distorting
treatment of the melody which picks her out from the crowd.
It was not always so. Carter came to notice in the 1950s with Lionel Hampton
and later with Ray Charles in the the 1960s. Hampton nicknamed her Betty
Bebop for her fragmented scatting style which, however, was considered too
strong for a wider audience. Her own enterprise and arranging skills saw her
through the leaner times which followed with the formation of Bet-Car
Records and live work with classy piano trios. But tastes change and
sticking to the formula of attentive accompaniment and an almost
instrumental vocal delivery has paid off.
Appearing at Ronnie's in London for two weeks, followed by a week at the
Birmingham club, Betty Bebop is on song, if not entirely on the prescribed
melody. A well meshed trio is in attendance, dominated by the large figure
and vigorous runs of pianist Cyrus Chestnut and driven by Clarence Penn
(drums) with Christopher Thomas (upright bass). What a difference attentive
accompaniment makes to a singer.
With hooded eyes and a velvet timbre which can resonate like a tenor sax,
Carter slipped through a selection of originals and Cole Porter standards,
her rubbery vocalese forcing melody and lyric out of shape. She walked the
front of the stand and made pleading eye contact during emotional numbers
like 'You're Mine, You'; she stretched and kneaded the otherwise familiar
melody of 'Every Time We Say Goodbye", leaving the lyric wholly intact.
This matured but mannered vocal style may yet be too rich for some
mainstreamers, but set against the overdone facial contortions of new
singers such as Rachelle Ferrell or the blandness of Sade say, it is a
joyful thing.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Drug industry reacts angrily
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK drug industry reacted angrily last night to the government's
extension of the so-called 'limited list' of drugs which cannot be
prescribed under the NHS.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said steps had to be taken to
limit growth of the NHS drug bill, which is set to rise by 11.5 per cent
this year.
The list is being extended from seven categories to 17, including diarrhoea,
allergies and appetite suppressants.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Little joy for north-west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were only small cheers for Mr Norman Lamont in north-west England,
where much manufacturing industry depends on defence contracts.
The rate of decline in defence spending is set to increase. About Pounds 1bn
a year is to be cut from spending on equipment, leaving the total at 'over
Pounds 8bn a year', said the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Ray Sharpe, managing director of Pendle Aeroform, a Lancashire airframe
components manufacturer, said: 'Whitehall has failed to realise the
magnitude of the problems guys like us are facing. A few tweaks won't be
enough to get the economy going again.'
Mr Mike Hynes, managing director of Lancashire Enterprises, a private-sector
economic development company, said: 'Better capital allowances and reduction
in interest rates must help, but we are so dependent on military aircraft in
this area. It's not very good news unless they are going to spend the whole
defence budget on EFA.'
There was a more enthusiastic response from Mr Ted Stanworth, who runs the
40-employee Stanworth Engineers in Burnley. 'Like many other similar
companies, we have not been buying machine tools for the last two or three
years,' he said.
'We shall certainly be investing again now we can get 40 per cent capital
allowances.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Revenue to shed more than 600 staff

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue is to shed more than 600 staff and close 19 offices in
its repayment department because of unexpectedly low demand, Andrew Jack
writes.
The action has been caused by far lower demand for repayments than it
estimated would be needed when the facilities were planned by the Revenue in
response to new taxation measures introduced in the past two years.
It also follows the 'Next Steps' restructuring programme for the Inland
Revenue announced by the chancellor in March this year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Embassy faces questions over Matrix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH embassy officials in Washington are facing demands for an
explanation for their intervention in 1989 to stop a US senator adding the
name of Matrix Churchill to a list of companies that had exported items
listed under the British Missile Technology Control Regime.
The demands have been made after a document recording the UK government's
response at the time was released to defence counsel at the Matrix Churchill
trial which collapsed this week.
The document, dated October 19 1989, is a note between two UK embassy
officials discussing their response to a request for assistance from Mr Bill
Triplett, the chief Republican counsel to the Senate foreign relations
committee. At the time he had read a report in the Financial Times about
Matrix Churchill's arms-related exports to Iraq and he warned that the
company's name would be included on his list of offending companies unless
the embassy could convince him otherwise.
The note from Mr John Neve, an embassy official, said that he had assured Mr
Triplett that 'the company had not breached UK export control regulations
and the equipment which they had legally sold had not been destined for
end-users which raised missile proliferation concerns'.
Last night Mr Triplett said he was concerned about the implications of the
communique on the British-US special relationship. He said: 'We took his
word for it. I would not have taken the word of somebody else, probably.'
He appeared particularly angry about the tone of one comment in the note
which states: 'I made it clear to him (Mr Triplett) that, if Matrix
Churchill or any other British company appeared on his list he could expect
a sharp reaction from HMG.'
Mr Triplett said: 'The bottom line is we accepted the assurances of Her
Majesty's government based on the special relationship. Frankly I wouldn't
have taken the word of another embassy.
'The problem we have now is that we have that document and there are other
documents that have shown up in the Matrix Churchill case that indicate
other knowledge they (the Department of Trade and Industry) had.'
He had been passed a second, previously secret document, dated February 1
1989, also released at the trial. The earlier note clearly states it was
seen by Mr Eric Beston, a senior Department of Trade and Industry official.
The earlier document, signed by Mr Stephen Lillie, an official on the Middle
East desk at the Foreign Office, discusses intelligence information that
linked Matrix lathe exports to Iraqi munitions establishments.
It also makes clear that the UK government was aware of Iraqi attempts to
develop technology for uranium enrichment using a procurement network under
Dr Safa Habobi, the Matrix chairman.
Another internal government memo prepared by the DTI to discuss the FT
report, on the same day that the article appeared, and also seen by Mr
Beston, makes further refernces to the military uses of Matrix Churchill
lathes in Iraq.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Diplomatic posts face heavy cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG CUTS in diplomatic activities will be needed over the next four years as
a result of the biggest-ever budget reductions for the Foreign Office, which
were announced yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
While the total reduction of Pounds 70m for the years 1993 to 1996 is lower
by some Pounds 20m than was feared a week ago, it still means that far fewer
resources than originally planned will be available for overseas posts,
capital spending and diplomatic activity in general. The cuts will be
unevenly distributed over the period, with the bulk of the reductions in
projected expenditure, Pounds 30m, coming in 1995-96 after cuts of Pounds
12m in 1993-94 and Pounds 28m in 1994-95.
Although the 1993-94 total expenditure figure of Pounds 1.22bn represents an
increase of 2.4 per cent in real terms on the provisions for 1992-93, the
Foreign Office stresses that this is more than offset by the cost of new
posts in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe and the 'increased pace'
of diplomatic activity.
Officials said implementation of the Foreign Office's planned activities
would be made 'just manageable' during the first year of the public
expenditure survey by slowing down the capital expenditure programme and by
making cuts in scholarships and military training. However, in 1994-95 and
1995-96, for which funds have been reduced in real terms by 3.7 per cent and
2.2 per cent respectively, it would not be possible to carry out all the
Foreign Office's activities, even at a reduced level.
Officials declined to spell out which foreign posts and activities would be
affected by the cuts, emphasising that this would be discussed internally
over the next few months. 'Work on these decisions is genuinely not far
advanced,' they claimed.
Nevertheless, it is known that the eventual abolition and concentration of
numerous foreign missions in Africa and Latin America are under
consideration and that at least 25 overseas units might disappear. While
important missions in Africa, such as those in Nigeria, Kenya and South
Africa will be spared, other posts in smaller centres will probably be
sacrificed. Some consulates are expected to close in western Europe.
The Foreign Office said that, while it would respect its commitment to open
8 diplomatic posts in countries including Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan,
the chances of opening any other new posts were extremely slim. It
emphasised that the number of British diplomatic service posts now numbered
212, fewer than France's 260 and Germany's total of more than 220.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Ownership of videos up despite recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIDEO recorders were the fastest-growing category of consumer durables last
year, and their ownership continued to rise in spite of the deepening
recession.
Ownership of video recorders increased from 61 per cent to 64.6 per cent of
households over the previous year. That compares with 36 per cent five years
ago. More than four out of five families with children now own a video
recorder.
In contrast, the expected boom in home computers has failed to materialise.
Only 18 per cent of homes had one compared with 17 per cent the previous
year and 15 per cent in 1986.
The high proportion of homes with consumer durables such as refrigerators,
washing machines and telephones - and the impact of the recession - made the
further increase in ownership surprising.
Households owning refrigerators or fridge/freezers, the most popular of all
consumer durables, rose from 98.1 to 98.2 per cent.
Washing machines have become universally popular, with average ownership
around 87 per cent, although Greater London was the exception, with only 77
per cent of homes having one.
The only year-on-year fall in ownership was for television sets, which
slipped from 98.1 per cent to 97.9 per cent of households.
In general, the lower a household's income the greater the percentage spent
on housing and fuel and the less on leisure goods and motoring.
In the higher income groups, motoring and fares accounted for more than 15
per cent of total expenditure, but in the poorest groups their share was
below 5 per cent.

Brazil's suspended President Fernando Collor de Mello was charged yesterday
with corruption in the kickback scandal that forced him out of office, AP
reports from Rio de Janeiro.
Mr Aristides Junqueira, the attorney general, charged Mr Collor and eight
others in connection with an influence-peddling ring that allegedly extorted
Dollars 55m (Pounds 36.4m) from businessmen in exchange for government
contracts. If convicted, they could face eight years in prison. Mr Junqueira
also charged Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's long-time friend and 1989
campaign treasurer, with running the influence-peddling ring. The 55-page
indictment alleges that Mr Collor accepted Dollars 6.5m from the ring.
The lower house of congress voted to remove Mr Collor from office on
September 29, charging him with 'lack of decorum.' He was ousted on October
2 for 180 days while the Senate holds an impeachment trial. If the Senate
votes to impeach him, he would be barred from holding office for eight
years.

SOUTH AFRICA will propose a co-operation agreement to the European Community
within the next seven months, South Africa's new ambassador to the EC, Mr
Neil Van Heerden, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Mr Van Heerden said South Africa hoped there would be 'clarity' on an accord
by the middle of next year. About half of South Africa's trade is with EC
states, with Germany and Britain the dominant trading partners.
He said the time had come to forge a formal agreement with the EC, which
dropped all sanctions against South Africa, except for arms sales, following
Pretoria's moves to scrap apartheid.
'Previously there were political obstacles in coming up with a special EC
accord. Now we are in the post-sanctions period and many of the political
disabilities are gone,' he said.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Britain protests over Rushdie death call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday made a strong protest to Iran over the the renewed call by
a senior Iranian legal official for the killing of Mr Salman Rushdie, the
British writer.
Mr Douglas Hogg, a Foreign Office minister, summoned Iran's charge
d'affaires in London, Mr Gholamreza Ansari, to demand that Iran should
urgently reaffirm its earlier commitment not to interfere in Britain's
internal affairs.
In a 20-minute meeting with the Iranian diplomat, Mr Hogg protested 'in the
strongest possible terms' about a statement made on Tuesday by the Iranian
chief justice, Mr Morteza Moqtadaei, that Moslems were obliged to kill Mr
Rushdie for his alleged blasphemies against Islam in his book, The Satanic
Verses.
The British government 'took a very serious view of the statement and all
other statements reiterating the fatwa (death call) and calling on Moslems
to implement it,' the Foreign Office said.
'It appeared to call into question Iran's commitment to honouring its
obligations not to interfere in our internal affairs.'
The fatwa was originally issued by Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989.
Mr Rushdie has since lived in hiding in Britain, but has lately made
appearances in Germany and France to appeal for international pressure on
Iran to lift the death edict.
Diplomatic relations between Britain and Iran were broken off by London over
the issuing of the fatwa, but were restored in September 1990.
However, a round of tit-for-tat expulsions last summer resulted in a renewed
deterioration in relations and put a stop to possible moves to exchange
ambassadors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN's King Hussein yesterday freed two parliamentarians sentenced this
week to 20 years' hard labour for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the
government, as part of a general amnesty for 140 political and criminal
prisoners.
Mr Lieth Shbeilat and Mr Ya'aqub Qarrash, along with two merchants from
Amman, were found guilty by the State Security Court on Tuesday after one of
Jordan's most controversial political trials.
The amnesty also includes several members of Hamas, a militant Islamic
group, imprisoned last year for possession of weapons, along with a number
of Palestinians belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine held recently on similar charges.
In a public announcement on television King Hussein explained that he was
willing to give the prisoners a chance to go back to the 'path of
righteousness,' saying he believed they had repented the harm they had
caused the country.
Dr Abdul Latif Arabiyat, speaker of the elected lower house of parliament,
welcomed the pardon, saying: 'We are in a transitional stage between the law
of this military court and the King's way. . . this act shows that our
democratic march is very strong. . . the (MPs') slate has been wiped clean.'
Sources close to the king explained that the pardon was a humanitarian
gesture in advance of his 57th birthday on Saturday, rather than a rejection
of the military court proceedings which had aroused some concern in Jordan
both for the manner of its conduct and the verdict against the MPs.
Several hundred demonstrators urged King Hussein to intervene personally
during the trial, and Jordan's monarch told the FT last month that he had
been keeping a 'close eye' on the affair.
The pardon is likely to help calm fears that the government was faltering in
its moves towards broadening democracy and should forestall any potential
backlash against the court's initial sentence.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM sets break-even target for
1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, which is in the throes of a wholesale restructuring of its
loss-making North American vehicle operations, said yesterday that its
target was for them to break even, before interest and taxes, in 1993.
The target, given to a meeting of Wall Street analysts by GM's new
management team, represents a great improvement on the company's performance
over the past two years.
Mr William Hoglund, GM's new executive vice-president for corporate affairs,
said that in the first nine months of 1992 North America had lost Dollars
3bn before interest and taxes and did not expect to break even in the fourth
quarter, though he would not be more specific.
However, this year's losses represented a big improvement on the Dollars
6.1bn North America loss in the first nine months of last year.
Mr Hoglund attributed about one third of this year's improvement to the
volume and mix of GM's sales, about one third to better pricing and one
third to cost improvements.
Mr Jack Smith, who was appointed GM's chief executive last week after the
forced resignation of Mr Robert Stempel, the company's former chairman and
chief executive, told the analysts that GM was not depending on an economic
upturn to return the group to profitability.
'We're implementing fundamental changes and a restructuring that will allow
us to be profitable even in economic down-cycles.'
Officials said the company was committed to reducing its vehicle production
capacity in North American to 5.4m units a year in 1995 through the closure
of 21 plants, of which only 14 have so far been identified. The remaining
seven will be named before the end of the year, probably in early December,
when GM has decided which products to concentrate on in the important
mid-sized car market.
The company said it should significantly exceed its target of cutting annual
costs by Dollars 5bn by 1995.
Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who took over earlier this year as head of
GM worldwide purchasing, said he had already achieved the Dollars 2bn of
parts cost savings which GM said last April that it wanted to achieve by
1994. He aimed to double this figure by 1994.
Mr Lopez, whose price-cutting demands have provoked controversy among GM's
outside suppliers, also announced that the company would be establishing a
15-member council in January to get ideas from suppliers.
The company said that based on modest US economic growth of around 2.8 per
cent in 1993 it expected to sell 4.7m vehicles next year, 3m cars and 1.7m
trucks. This would give it a roughly 34.5 per cent share of an overall
market of 13.7m vehicles, which is broadly the same as now.
The company's automotive components group said it was targetting
double-digit productivity improvements in 1993, on top of a 12 per cent
increase this year, and would move from 'a modest positive cash flow in 1992
to a significantly more positive cash flow in 1993'.

<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computer group, yesterday announced
another corporate restructuring aimed at cutting costs and streamlining
production, AP-DJ reports from Milan.
Olivetti, controlled by financier Mr Carlo De Benedetti, said it had created
three new central divisions and eight new commercial areas in what it
claimed was the second phase of a previous restructuring announced one year
ago.
'Our group today is the algebraic sum of areas where it earns and grows well
and areas where it continues to lose . . . The objective is to develop to
the maximum the first and intervene drastically in the second in a very
brief time,' Mr De Benedetti said in a statement.
Yesterday's statement reversed a previous restructuring announced last
November, which, in turn, had rolled back another reorganisation in 1989.
The three new divisions are products, systems and professional services.
These will replace Olivetti's present three divisions, called diversified
activities, planning and development; public administration; and operations.
Olivetti's commercial areas will grow to eight from five and will be
geographically rearranged 'with the scope of allowing the company to
concentrate in an articulated way its commercial efforts in function of
different geographic opportunities,' the statement said.
Mr De Benedetti said the restructuring will start to pay off in 1994. '1993
will be a transition year, but in 1992 we will reap the fruit of all this
work in an industry that, although experiencing worldwide the worst years of
its history, is due for extraordinary growth over the next 10 years.'
The chairman made no predictions for Olivetti's full-year results this year.
The group's first-half consolidated net loss widened to L93.4bn (Dollars
68.92m) from  73.7bn in 1991.

FAIREY GROUP, the specialist electronics and engineering company, has agreed
to pay Dollars 21m (Pounds 13.9m) for Ircon, the infrared measurement
division of Square D, the US-based electrical equipment group owned by
Schneider of France.
Ircon makes infrared non-contact temperature measuring equipment used in
process industries such as steel, glass, rubber and plastics. Fairey said
Ircon led the US market and occupied the number two position in Europe.
The UK company is also acquiring Ircon's marketing and technical support
subsidiaries in France, Germany and England. Completion of the deal is
subject to US and French regulatory approval.
Ircon made pre-tax profits of Dollars 1.8m on sales of Dollars 16.6m in
1991, and has net assets of Dollars 10.25m, including Dollars 1.5m in cash.
The assets include Ircon's freehold headquarters in the northern suburbs of
Chicago, where all the manufacturing takes place.
In July Fairey paid Pounds 11.5m for Essex-based Infrared Engineering and
its marketing and technical support subsidiaries in Boston and Stuttgart.
Infrared makes specialist gauges used to measure moisture, fat and protein
for the food, paper and tobacco industries and the thickness of plastic
films and coatings.
Mr John Poulter, Fairey's chief executive, said 'Ircon represents a logical
step forward in our strategic development. The existing group subsidiaries,
LasterMike and Infrared Engineering, are involved in very similar
technologies and markets and all three trade internationally and are market
leaders.'

Pay increases for all the public sector groups for which I am responsible

FT  13 NOV 92 / Cartels blamed for high prices: Competition practices in
Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY visitor to Switzerland winces at its extraordinarily high prices for
everything from a cup of coffee to a hotel room to a train ride.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has confirmed
that prices of goods and services for private consumption in Switzerland are
40 per cent higher than the OECD average, on a purchasing power parity
basis. Prices of goods and services for capital investment are 30 per cent
higher.
In a special study in its annual examination of the Swiss economy, the OECD
attributes these huge discrepancies to the pervasive presence of cartels and
other curbs on free competition in Swiss markets.
Cartels are said to exist in 90 per cent of 72 industrial activities,
usually involving price-fixing and/or market sharing agreements.
Concentration is also high in several segments of the wholesale trade, and
the market share of the five largest retail traders is nearly 80 per cent,
'more than in any other European country'.
The study suggests that high prices cause 'high economy-wide static welfare
losses' as well as 'significant dynamic efficiency losses'. The rigidity of
prices may contribute to the persistence of inflation over a long period.
Although most Swiss companies tend to be small to medium-sized,
concentration is high in most business sectors. 'Oligopolistic structures
have been established in several industries, like tobacco, leather and
footwear, chemicals, electrical and electronic equipment, food processing,
textile, paper, machines and vehicles.'
The strength and persistence of collusive practices may seem paradoxical,
given the openness of the country's trade. By 1985, the share of
manufactured imports in the domestic market was 42 per cent, well above the
OECD average. But the role of imports in enforcing competitive discipline is
undermined because most importers participate in the highly lucrative
domestic distribution cartels.
Other factors are the highly protected status of food products and the fact
that non-tradeable services represent a predominant share in the Swiss
economy, 48 per cent of private sector GDP, if construction is included.
Many Swiss laws and regulations contribute to restraint of trade. Laws
permit Swiss companies to protect themselves from takeovers by hostile or
foreign interests, and the report shows that Swiss firms tend to maintain
their market positions for an extraordinarily long time.
Arcane norms and technical standards, business regulations and blatantly
protectionist procurement policies, especially by cantonal governments, all
keep out competitors. Swiss authorities charge twice as much as those in
neighbouring countries to approve imported telephone sets. Swiss retailers
are prohibited from using many sales promotion tactics that are common
elsewhere.
As a result, the OECD estimates that the prices of goods and services
accounting for nearly 45 per cent of the weighting in the consumer price
index are 'administered or more or less strongly regulated at at least one
stage of the way to the consumer'.
It also observes that while Swiss inflation is not high, it is relatively
persistent.
Swiss competition law is 'probably among the most permissive of collusive
behaviour and restrictive practices.' the OECD says. It accepts that private
interests may exert an influence on third parties through the concerted
acquisition of economic power, but as long as there is no abuse, private
market order may be as good as, or better than, a free market.
Thus, the original law calls on the authorities only to counteract the
harmful economic effects of cartels. Revisions in the 1980s clarified that
cartels were harmful if they eliminated 'effective competition' or if their
negative effects outweighed positive ones. They also were accompanied by a
marked strengthening in enforcement, leading notably to the dismantling of
cartels in banking and brewing.
However, the OECD claims that Swiss rules remain 'in stark contrast' with
common practices in other OECD countries and particularly in the EC.
Moreover, the number of enforcement staff is 'very low by international
standards'.
It is sceptical of the view among some Swiss that most cartels will
spontaneously collapse as domestic markets are subjected to more import
competition. 'The collapse of cartels does not necessarily lead to more
competitive markets. Indeed, increased concentration is an often observed
outcome.'
It argues that only further toughening of competition law and its
enforcement will lead to greater competition.
If Swiss voters ratify the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty in a
referendum next month, then Switzerland will take on EC competition rules.
These prohibit cartels, the abuse of dominant positions and provide for
examination of proposed mergers. Other EC rules will force Switzerland to
align its norms and technical requirements, migration policy and public
procurement practices up to a point.
However, the OECD calls for a fundamentally revised Swiss competition law in
which 'the protection of the competition process per se should be
established as an overriding objective'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / France andItaly cut interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Italy yesterday cut key interest rates in moves designed to
reflect the growing confidence in their economies after the recent turmoil
on the currency markets.
The one percentage point cut in the Italian discount and Lombard rates, to
13.0 and 14.0 per cent respectively, came shortly after Prime Minister
Giuliano Amato won a confidence vote in the Senate on the core of his 1993
budget.
Mr Amato, who staked his government's life on winning the Senate vote, has
now won parliamentary approval for 80 per cent of his budget, which aims to
save L93,000bn (Pounds 45bn) next year, principally through a L53,000bn
package of tax increases, and spending freezes.
The Italian government has said that the passage of the budget is essential
both for reform of the Italian economy and the return of the lira to the
EC's currency grid.
In France, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, declared that the second
cut in French interest rates in two weeks was 'a sign of confidence in our
economy and our currency'.
The Banque de France lowered the regular intervention rate at which it lends
to commercial banks from 9.35 to 9.1 per cent, and its repurchase rate for
marginal lending to the banking system from 10.25 to 10 per cent.
Both moves had been widely anticipated in the markets. The franc continued
to trade at below FFr3.38 to the D-Mark, and share prices rose slightly.
Mr Sapin said the French central bank had now 'not only recovered all that
it had spent' defending the franc against speculative attack in September,
'but had also been able to increase significantly the level of its foreign
exchange reserves'.
Mr Sapin said the trend in European rates in general had changed when France
approved the Maastricht treaty on September 20.
The removal of uncertainty had paved the way for lower rates in a number of
countries, he said, adding: 'Today's rate cut must be seen in the European
context.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (12): Harsh realities - The South / The
Reading-Bracknell area's development boom is now well and truly over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENTS in the property markets in the south-east and the south-west
never reached the deep lows experienced in central London during the
recession. But, that said, at a national level they have been hit
considerably harder than the markets of the midlands and the north.
No clearer visual evidence of that impact was provided than by the millions
of square feet of vacant space in office block after office block in the M4
'Golden Triangle.'
Surveyor Savills' recent estimate of office vacancy rates in the
Reading-Bracknell area was 22 per cent - comparable with the most gloomy
estimates of vacancy level in the City of London.
The area's development boom, due in no small part to the introduction of the
B1 office consent - now generally regarded as misguided at best  - is well
and truly over. Savills puts estimated 1992 completions at 319,000 sq ft in
four projects. Corresponding figures for 1993 and 1994 are 140,000 sq ft in
two buildings and 85,000 sq ft in a single building, respectively.
But just recently Bracknell has started to move. Several recent lettings
included that of Grosvenor Square properties' 71,500 sq ft Greenwood House
to Novell UK and of the 40,000 sq ft L'Avenir development to Cadence Design
Systems by receiver Mr Mark Batten of Price Waterhouse.
These and other deals have, however, only taken place after hard-pressed
landlords faced harsh realities and accepted that in order to attract takers
they would have to put together incentive packages similar to those offered
by City of London landlords.
More high profile lettings in Bracknell are understood to be on the way as
tenants take advantage of what is on offer.
Reading itself accounts for little of the area's oversupply, says Mr Ken
Williams of surveyor Vail Williams. He adds that the town is one of the few
pockets in the south-east where there is only a small amount of quality
space available.
Despite this, top town centre rental packages equating to less than Pounds
20 a sq ft are being offered - in contrast to Arlington's Theale Business
Park where rents of about Pounds 24.50 a sq ft are probably the highest in
the region.
The building boom in the south-east in the 1980s was mainly concentrated in
the office and B1 categories. Very little new industrial warehouse space was
built; spiralling land values made such developments unviable. The result
was that there has been no oversupply of new industrial space and much of
the industrial property supply consists of second-hand, outdated stock. As
land values have plummeted there is a greater willingness to release land
for industrial development.
In general terms, industrial rents in the M3-M4 corridor stand at about
Pounds 6-Pounds 7 a sq ft and in the south coast areas - around Portsmouth
and Southampton - at Pounds 5-Pounds 6 a sq ft.
The south-west has also suffered. Mr Tim Stevenson of surveyor Chestertons
points out that the area had become heavily reliant upon the financial
services sector, the defence industry and, further west, the tourist
industry. All three have taken substantial hits.
In Bristol, office rents have risen to Pounds 20 a sq ft with recent small
lettings at Queens Quay, Queens Square, to County NatWest ventures and
Zurich Assurance at that figure.
Chestertons estimates that more than 1.5m sq ft of office space is available
in central Bristol, although only 375,000 sq ft is in good quality new
buildings.
Average take-up historically has been about 400,000 sq ft a year - even
during last year some 352,000 sq ft was let. But this year has been very
quiet, says Mr Stevenson - and it looks very unlikely that last year's
figure will be matched or even approached.
Bristol's first covered shopping centre, the 320,000 sq ft Gallerias, opened
last year some 75 per cent let and is reported to be trading well.
Over the years, Bristol has grown largely because of its attractions to
relocating companies. There are, says Mr Stevenson, one or two large space
users looking at Bristol seriously - along with other locations.
Falling rents in central London have reduced the cost differential which
used to be the main reason for decentralising. However, some organisations
are still considering moving out, for a variety of other reasons including
quality of staff, working environment and life style.
Surveyor Richard Ellis is advising Lloyds Register of Shipping on its move
from offices in the City of London and in Croydon. After looking at some 54
locations on the M3-M4 axis, those on the short list of three are: Swindon,
Southampton and Hook. The 330,000 sq ft of accommodation required is subject
to an architectural competition and the location which is finally selected
will receive a considerable shot in the arm for its property market.
In a generally dull market in the south-east and south-west, there are
inevitably one or two bright spots. One of these is is Plymouth where the
office market, with only some 140,000 sq ft of good quality newish space
available, is ticking over at about Pounds 12.50 a sq ft to Pounds 13 a sq
ft. But the star performer is the retail market. Mr Stephen Lobb of
Chesterton says that it has been busier in the past 12 months than at any
time during the past 10 years.
Central Plymouth is one of the few locations of its size which has yet to
benefit from a big new shopping development and it has suffered from a
shortage of prime shopping space. Operators previously unable to open in
Plymouth have scrambled for the few gaps created by relocations and or
recession casualties.
Throughout the south there is demand for investment property which meets
strict criteria: good quality building; solid covenants and a yield in, or
approaching, double figures. Such propositions are in very short supply
indeed.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (11): Few northern bubbles to burst -
The North / There is a shortage of good modern or new space in some city
centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE north of England has been reaping some rewards from being on the wrong
side of Britain's north-south divide in the 1980s. While the south bubbled,
the north's property markets hardly inflated at all, so there were few
northern bubbles to burst when the south's went pop.
Mr Tom Marshall, chief executive of Lambert Smith Hampton in Manchester,
sums up much of the situation in a vast swathe of England from Crewe and
Grimsby northwards to the Scottish border. 'The property market finds itself
in as hostile an environment as any, but has inflicted fewer wounds on
itself over the past five years than is the case for much of the rest of the
country,' he says.
Much of northern England was ignored by national property developers until
very late in the last upward swing of the economic cycle. This was not
because the north was essentially unattractive, but the pickings were easier
and richer in the south.
The result is that there is no serious over-supply of good property anywhere
in the north. Indeed, there is a shortage of good modern or new space in the
city centres of Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle.
Rental levels have softened on some older, refurbished properties, but are
holding at the top end, although Manchester's will be tested in the next few
months as 45,000 sq ft comes on stream at an asking price of Pounds 22 or
Pounds 23 per sq ft.
Leeds, however, has been steady at Pounds 19 a sq ft, with Pounds 20
projected for next year on new space. As Matthews and Goodman - a surveyor
active in London, Liverpool and Manchester - points out, Manchester's top
rents were about Pounds 15 five years ago, although growth there is not as
impressive as in Leeds, where the 1987 level was Pounds 7.
Not everything is wonderful: concessions and incentives are on offer in
several areas to get people to move in, but it is hard to find signs of real
desperation to let or sell. Developers who had stretched too far into debt
to hold on have already gone. For the rest, an absence of glut has enabled a
longer view to be taken.
If there is a problem, it is at Salford Quays, Manchester's docklands at the
terminus of the ship canal. An expiring enterprise zone brought 1m sq ft of
new office space onto the market in a rush in 1990-91, just as demand began
to falter. About 80 per cent is still unlet, but while this hit Charter
Developments hard, others such as the Manchester Ship Canal Company appear
able to afford to sit it out. Meanwhile, Amec - another big Salford Quays
developer - is getting on with serious industrial property projects in the
adjacent Trafford Park urban development area.
Mr Nicholas Kos, a partner in Bailey Deakin Hamiltons, a Preston firm of
chartered surveyors, says that although the market is sluggish and
speculative development has dried up, specific requirements are being met by
bespoke design and build projects.
He also says there is continuing demand for well-located property. Indeed,
location is proving a crucial factor, involving three elements - the
motorway network, proximity to Manchester Airport and the growth of the
financial and professional services sector in Leeds and Manchester.
The last of these is what is keeping up prime office rentals. In both
cities, the financial and professional firms involved operate within walking
distance of each other and employ tens of thousands of people between them.
Manchester Airport, meanwhile, is now the fastest-growing in Europe and is
firmly established as Britain's northern hub and international gateway. This
is spawning its own mini-market, with several sizeable speculative
developments planned. Top rents in nearby Wilmslow, for example, have been a
step ahead of central Manchester's for several years.
The motorways, however, are probably the northern property market's biggest
asset. Good sites near important junctions offer crucial benefits to foreign
inward investors, national relocators, and anyone in the distribution
business.
Warrington and Wakefield - respectively at the crossover points of the M62
with the M6 and M1-A1 - prove the point, with warehouses by the mile or
prestigious new arrivals such as Pioneer, the Japanese audio systems
manufacturer, and Cover Girl, which Procter &amp; Gamble has relocated to
Wakefield from Bournemouth.
The M1 at Sheffield and Rotherham has proved ideal for the new Meadowhall
shopping complex. After two years' operation, only five of 285 units were
unlet and 43m visitors had produced a pedestrian flow higher than London's
Oxford Street. Second-year traffic was 15 per cent up.
Finally, Crewe Business Park offers one of the best examples of how the
north is now outscoring the south. Sokkia, the Japanese manufacturer of
surveying instruments, was faced with a rent review in Crawley, Sussex, from
Pounds 9.50 a sq ft to Pounds 17.
Crewe and Nantwich Urban Renewal built Sokkia a 12,000 sq ft UK headquarters
for Pounds 900,000. It would have cost three times as much to buy a site in
the south-east - and it would have been an unprepossessing infill between
warehouses. And Crewe's green fields will allow 50 per cent expansion of
present buildings, plus the option to almost double the present one-acre
site when Sokkia wants to grow further.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (10): Let off lightly - Scotland / The
market has been cushioned by a relatively mild recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S property market is unmistakeably in the grip of recession.
Nonetheless, it has been let off lightly compared with some other parts of
the UK.
The problems of overbuilding and recession have been less pronounced than in
many parts of Britain. A later and milder upturn in the late 1980s resulted
in fewer new offices and shops than southern England.
The property market has also been cushioned by Scotland's relatively mild
recession, in which Scottish unemployment has been overtaken by that of the
UK for the first time since 1923.
The pressure has been mounting, however. Overall, Scottish office values
dropped by another 9.5 per cent last year. That brought the cumulative fall
since 1989 to 14 per cent, according to the Investment Property Databank, an
independent research group.
The most abrupt turnaround was in the Edinburgh office market where rental
and capital values more than doubled between 1987 and 1989. But the
recession in the financial services industry bit hard. Over 1990-91, capital
values dropped by 9.5 per cent, more steeply than any other provincial
centres except Bristol. Rents for modern open plan space fell to about
Pounds 20 per sq ft, down from the peak of Pounds 25 in 1991.
The downturn in demand has particularly affected offices in the Georgian New
Town, where an estimated 80-100 town house offices are on the market. But
the city does not have an excess of modern office space, either in the city
centre or in business parks. Following completion of 1.1m sq ft of new space
in 1991, office building has ground to a halt.
Glasgow's vacancy rate of 14 per cent is higher than that of Edinburgh's 10
per cent. The reasons behind Glasgow's surge in vacant space are twofold.
First, an upturn in supply - 1.2m sq ft came onto the market in 1991 and a
further 700,000 sq ft is scheduled for completion this year.
Second, demand has fallen to its lowest level for eight years, according to
Lambert Smith Hampton, chartered surveyors. This is partly because of the
downturn in the fortunes of banking and insurance organisations, which were
the biggest absorbers of office floorspace in the late 1980s. The decision
of BP's exploration arm to close its Glasgow headquarters, announced in
June, has also had a depressing impact on the city.
But Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, argues that prime rents in Glasgow
will firm up during 1993. Only nine buildings provide more than 10,000 sq ft
of space in established and recognised core addresses.
The Aberdeen office market has moved in a different cycle to other Scottish
cities. Having missed the development boom of the late 1980s, rental growth
stimulated new development in the last two years, with completions doubling
in 1991.
According to Ryden, chartered surveyors, availability has risen from 166,700
sq ft in March 1991 to 430,000 sq ft in March 1992. At the same time, the
agents say there is potential demand for 350,000 sq ft of quality modern
office space, which is currently not available.
Looking back, Scottish property has generally held its own as an investment,
compared with the UK as a whole. Total returns of Scottish offices over the
past 11 years have averaged 9.6 per cent a year compared with a UK average
of 8.6 per cent, according to the Investment Property Databank.
In the same period, industrial total returns have averaged 11.1 per cent a
year, compared with a UK average return of 11.4 per cent.
In the retail market, total returns on Scottish property of 8.3 per cent
over the same period have lagged behind the UK's 10.8 per cent, thanks
mainly to weak rental growth in the early and mid 1980s. Through 1989-90,
retail returns closely matched the UK average and last year they ran above
average.
The key to the future of the Scottish property market lies with the economy.
Over the past three years it has outperformed the rest of the UK, thanks to
a resurgence of investment in the oil industry, a slight recovery in
Scotland's share of world trade, its avoidance of the worst excesses of the
1980s consumer boom and growth in government spending.
Most forecasts point to a weak recovery in 1992, before gathering pace in
1993. 'With the special factors which protected the Scottish economy fading
in importance, Scotland is unlikely to continue outperforming the rest of
the country, but it is expected to hold its own,' concluded a report
recently published by Scottish Enterprise.
Looking to the future, PMA, an independent property market consultancy,
forecasts that rental performance in the next five years will be close to
the UK average in all sectors.
In the short term, it will do better than average because of less severe
oversupply and a smaller fall in rents.
Just as the peak of the Scottish property boom was less pronounced than its
UK counterpart, so will be its trough.
PMA forecasts that real office rents in Scotland in 1997 will be close to
what they were in 1989, whereas in London they will move back only to their
1986 real levels.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (9): Hopes punctured - Northern Ireland
/ Recession arrived this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in commercial property caught up with Northern Ireland this
year. Falling rents and poor demand from tenants punctured hopes that the
Belfast property market would largely escape the downturn. So far, the
decline is less dramatic than on much of the mainland. Top office rents have
dropped from around Pounds 9.50 to Pounds 7-Pounds 9 per sq ft. The market's
problems are largely focused on second-hand stock, of which there is 592,893
sq ft on the market, compared with 115,000 sq ft of new space.
The market's decline is only partially due to the recession. The Belfast
office market is dominated by the public sector, which accounted for 80 per
cent of take-up over the past 15 months. Back office jobs have been
relocated from the mainland and government departments have been moved into
new premises from Stormont, the old parliament outside the city.
But public sector demand for new office space in Belfast is thought to wane,
particularly with mounting constraints on public spending. Even so, the poor
quality of much of Belfast's office stock points towards an eventual pick-up
in demand for more development. 'We believe that developers who commence new
projects will be rewarded with rents significantly above current levels,'
says Lambert Smith Hampton, chartered surveyors.
New development is centred on derelict land by the river bank, which is
being developed by the Laganside Corporation with funds from the Department
of Environment of Northern Ireland. The corporation's first office
development is nearing completion but future phases are expected to proceed
slowly.
Confidence in Belfast property is at a low ebb, after a strong performance
during the 1980s. The average annual return between 1980 and 1991 was 16.5
per cent, compared with a UK average of 9.7 per cent, according to
Investment Property Databank, a research body.
Retail landlords did particularly well, with returns of nearly 20 per cent
in the 1980s, eight percentage points above the average for the UK. Rents
were boosted by a resurgence in retailing as UK retailers, previously
under-represented, moved into the province.
'Taking a seven- to 10-year view I have no doubt that Northern Ireland will
outperform the rest of the UK because there is less quality property,' says
Mr Tony O'Connor of Lambert Smith Hampton. 'But we are going to be in a
difficult period for the next 12 months.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (8): Markets succumb - The Midlands /
Confidence has evaporated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY markets in the Midlands are not exactly bubbling and some have
succumbed to inertia since the post-election confidence - evident throughout
the economy - evaporated in June and July.
The East Midlands, said Mr Tony Hewitt, chief executive of Connell Wilson,
surveyors, 'withstood the storm better than most. But it desperately needs
some boost to the economy.' The East Midlands, he went on, is better than
the West Midlands and they are both better than the south-east of England.
Both Midlands regions have in common the fact that the retail sector is
flat. 'You only have to look at the agents' boards on a high street,' noted
Mr Hewitt. In the Birmingham area of the West Midlands, 'most retailers have
put plans on hold and are concentrating on survival,' according to
Chesterton, surveyors, although it observed that there is little vacant
space in the big shopping centres.
The office market is more complex, more varied. There has been some stimulus
in Nottingham because of planned government department relocations, notably
that of the Inland Revenue. Derby, too, is receiving 1,700 Prison Service
posts. Such relocations have prompted rivalries in the area, with Mansfield
District Council pointing out that average office rents in its area are
Pounds 8 a square foot compared with Pounds 12 in Nottingham, Lincoln,
Leicester and Derby and Pounds 16 in Northampton.
However, Mr Hewitt has noticed some slippage in Northampton rents for new
accommodation to more like Pounds 12-Pounds 13 a sq ft. The contrary is true
in central Birmingham, where, said Mr Roger Ford of Chesterton, rents are
stable and there are very few discounts.
'If you look at quality space - raised floors, air-conditioning and so on -
there is very little available. It's down to about 50,000 sq ft.' Rents are
steady at about Pounds 20 a sq ft. But office property , especially, in
small units, is freely available at much lower prices in the fringe areas of
the city.
On the industrial side of the West Midlands, there is a lot of what Mr Ford
called 'poor property' available, but not very much which is brand new.
Deals are being done, although. But both the East and West Midlands have a
firm market in large distribution sheds.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (7): Energy and drive - Wales / Cardiff
and Newport are expected to out-perform most other provincial areas
</HEADLINE>

THERE is no faulting the energy and drive of the Welsh Development Agency.
On the pretext of Columbus Day, London agents and journalists had been drawn
down to Newport to watch fireworks outside Columbus House, an office
development nearing completion by Midlands developers Wilson Bowden with
help from the WDA.
Then it was on to Cwmbran, a few miles away, where the WDA was relaunching
marketing for the renamed Brecon House, a high specification manufacturing
base abandoned by a departing US electronics company for whom it had been
designed in the mid-1980s.
The government agency and the developer were putting a good face on it, but
both buildings will be difficult to fill. The problem with Brecon House is
the very high specification of which it boasts. No one other than computer
manufacturers needs the sort of clean rooms Brecon House offers: and that
industry is contracting at present.
Columbus House, an altogether more standard 25,000 sq ft office block, faces
a different struggle: competition. The building is sensibly divisible into
four self-contained units, if necessary, and its location, alongside the M4
outside Newport, is sound. But the 55-acre Langstone Office Park which it
inaugurates faces competition from two other business parks in Newport:
Cleppa Park, which has already attracted tenants of the quality of TSB; and
Celtic Lakes, a massive planned 2m sq ft science and business park, of which
the core is the 50-acre Imperial Park for Imperial College with the WDA
among its joint venturers.
The WDA has a well deserved reputation for cajoling inward investment into
South Wales - to the tune of 100,000 jobs and Pounds 4.7bn of capital in the
past 10 years. But, notwithstanding top flight letting agents - Jones Lang
Wootton for Celtic Lakes and Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks for Langstone Park
 -it will take Newport some time to absorb the space these schemes
represent.
Possibly because of the vigour of the WDA and its success in attracting big
overseas owner-occupiers, South Wales has not been seen as an attractive
region for institutional portfolio investment. But in a property recession
as severe as today's, that may be a blessing in disguise.
Jones Lang Wootton believes that rents in Cardiff, the premier location,
have fallen back from about Pounds 18 to Pounds 15-Pounds 16, with rent-free
periods a common feature. But that is a far cry from the 50 per cent drop in
Central London rents and the inducements to tenants are not so lavish.
As a business centre, Cardiff has still to see the full effects of its
docklands redevelopment. Legislation is still awaited before the Cardiff Bay
Barrage can go ahead, for example. Some of the more ambitious ideas - such
as a light railway linking town centre and bay along a Champs Elysee-style
boulevard - may be abandoned. But the scheme continues to attract interest
from investors and would-be tenants while avoiding the excesses which
undermined London's Docklands.
Outside the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation's area, however, the
presence of the WDA is vital for developments of any scale. Typical of its
new policy of partnership with the private sector is the 90-acre Cardiff
Gate business park at North Pentwyn. This involves DMD, a local developer,
and a civil engineering division of Fiat. It will provide extensive housing
and leisure facilities in addition to between 1m and 1.5m sq ft of business
space.
If that project has yet to show more than potential benefits, another WDA
initiative at the western end of the Newport-Cardiff axis is already well
into its second phase.
Bridgend has been transformed with the attraction of multinationals such as
Ford and Sony, both of which are planning local expansion despite
retrenchment elsewhere. Ford is putting Pounds 450m into its South Wales
plants and will build 350,000 Zeta engines at Bridgend. Sony is spending
Pounds 150m upgrading its Bridgend facilities and other technology-based
companies are prospecting in the area as part of the spin-off.
To the north of the favoured M4 corridor, prospects remain more mixed. Not
all the efforts of local authority and development body have been able to
guarantee the long-term commercial transformation of Ebbw Vale. One local
agent believes the 'footfall at the Garden Festival was lower than we hoped
and has produced few bankable proposals'.
In any case the commercial engine of the principality must be expected to
remain in the south-east. Cardiff and Newport are expected to out-perform
most other provincial areas from early in the upturn when it comes. The
Cardiff Bay Barrage should put the seal on the capital's regeneration and
Newport's prospects will further brighten with the opening of the second
Severn Bridge in 1996.
Meanwhile both continue to show exceptional defensive strengths at a time
when other areas have sagged noticeably with the steepening recession.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (6): Hardest to call - Industrials /
Victims of the double dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF all the property sectors, industrials are probably the hardest to call at
present; it is possible that they have reached a watershed which in turn may
have indicated the arrival of the recession's second dip.
Until the summer, factories and warehouses were undoubtedly the best
performers in an otherwise grisly market.
That certainty has now vanished. Since mid-year, lettings and capital values
surveys have been out of date almost before publication.
During the third quarter, the number of investment transactions declined
significantly, according to Mr David Hutchings, head of investment research
at Healey &amp; Baker, although demand for well-let modern space continued.
But more telling may be the accelerating decline in rental levels seen in
the Hillier Paker rent index: -2.3 per cent between February and May,
accelerating to -3.2 per cent between May and August.
There is also little joy to be found in the most recent floorspace survey
from King &amp; Co. Throughout 1990 and 1991 the industrial sector was
underpinned by a relative balance between supply and normal demand -
relative, that is, to the grossly over-supplied office market. But there are
now signs that manufacturing and distribution companies are failing to mop
up space at the same rate.
King &amp; Co's figures to mid-August show a 4 per cent overall increase in
available floorspace to an historically high level of 163m sq ft in England
and Wales - and these figures were reached before the spate of autumn
closures and shrinkages announced by BAe, Ford and others, let alone the
knock-on effects of the government's attempt to halve British Coal.
There is still strength to be seen in the industrial sector. New buildings
continue to be taken up: their supply declined, according to King &amp; Co. But
they now make up 12 per cent of all stock, which suggests that the backlog
of second-hand stock will continue to mount, with increasing amounts
virtually unlettable.
Prospects for the fourth quarter look bleaker. A reduction of two percentage
points in interest rates between Black Wednesday and mid-October failed to
restore confidence in the government's handling of the economy.
Until this autumn northern regions had appeared relatively unscathed by the
recession and there was hope that they might lead the national recovery. But
the Northern Development Company and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers
of commerce dashed those hopes.
Sales, orders, confidence and employment levels in Cumbria and the North
East have all dropped sharply and the position is worsening. Only 16 per
cent of companies are working close to capacity and nearly 90 per cent
believe the outlook is even blacker.
The depth of the UK market in industrial sheds is such, however, that deals
are still being done. Mr Guy Frampton, senior agency surveyor at Hillier
Parker, for example, reports signs of life in the M25 belt which has
stagnated for two years.
So far, evidence for new lease structures is only anecdotal. But it cannot
be long before it is made official. No property luncheon table is without
its tales of breaches of the traditional 25-year lease with upward-only rent
reviews.
As if there were not enough bad news about, another dismal trend is still
gathering pace: the knock-on effects of shrinkage in information technology
manufacturing. In itself, the 'downsizing' of IBM by 40,000 jobs with a
further 32,000 jobs gone or going at Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Digital
Equipment would be bad enough. But the property industry may not yet have
taken on board the difficulty of finding replacement tenants for
highly-customised buildings designed to meet the specifications of high-tech
manufacturers.
Overall, the key to servicing depressed industrial tenants with poor sales
prospects as well as risk-averse investors seeking reliable income streams,
may lie with good, secondary properties: true, multi-purpose,
low-specification sheds on estates close to motorways.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (5): Is the industry over-reacting? -
London Office Market / In the deepest recession in memory, with a fifth of
central London's offices empty, the prospect of shortages is emerging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON

<TEXT>
TWO bruised and battered birds symbolise the crisis in London's office
markets.
The canary is immediately recognisable as the label of that monolithic
Docklands tower block which typifies the heights of ambition reached during
the 1980s boom - only to crash into bankruptcy.
A semi-comatose duck in a sailor suit is more puzzling, yet it sums up just
as vividly what went wrong. In cartoons, Donald Duck rushes off a cliff and
is several steps into thin air before realising he is standing on thin air.
Then down he crashes.
Developers made the same mistake, building so hard and fast that they were
over the precipice before noticing that no-one was taking the space. Now
they lie broken on the ground.
'The recession started the day after Black Monday in 1987,' says Mr Geoff
Marsh of Applied Property Research. Net absorption turned negative a year
later - in other words new offices plus the old space that movers dump on
the market began to exceed demand. But no-one seemed to notice.
Even between mid-1990 and mid-1991, when demand had obviously collapsed and
vacancy rates were soaring, the flapping continued. Only 2.5m sq ft was
cancelled, according to consultants Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. Finally, in
the past 12 months, some 20m sq ft of potential development has been
scrapped.
Ironically, the industry may be over-reacting. In the deepest property
recession of living memory, with a fifth of central London's offices
standing empty and rents in free-fall, the prospect of shortages is
emerging. That sounds ludicrous when central London has a supply for between
10 and 15 years, yet certain types of space are running out.
Location and quality are important again, and there are gaps in the map of
prime space. Westminster, for example, has hardly more than a dozen or so
top-class blocks bigger than 50,000 sq ft - and almost as many leading
companies looking for that sort of space. The area could see supply and
demand balancing by the end of next year, says Mr Marsh.
Narrowing down further to the primest of prime areas - Mayfair and St
James's - only four new buildings of more than 25,000 sq ft are available,
says Mr Rupert Dodson of Healey &amp; Baker.
These quirks produce a wide spread of rent levels. Poorer second-hand space
was letting for Pounds 15 a sq ft or less in the three months to June while
prime was fetching Pounds 20 to Pounds 30, according to Jones Lang Wootton.
Yet Healey &amp; Baker and Nelson Bakewell extracted a reputed Pounds 55 a sq ft
from Cadbury Schweppes for a 50,000 sq ft Randsworth Trust block in Berkeley
Square, confirming that some buoyant companies will pay highly for quality
space in the right place.
The City of London might seem immune from shortages after vast
over-indulgence by developers during the boom. This left a vacancy rate
approaching 20 per cent and helped cut prime rents by 40 per cent to Pounds
37.50 a sq ft - not counting incentives which average an equivalent
three-year rent-free period.
Yet Mr Colin Hargreaves of Healey &amp; Baker predicts a 'material shortage' in
the core EC2 area by next year. Mr Gareth Davies at Grimley J R Eve picks
out potential problems in finding new, high-quality units of 1,000-3,000 sq
ft because 1980s buildings were designed for large-floor users.
At the other end of the scale, movers would be hard-pressed to find anything
over 250,000 sq ft for a new headquarters since MEPC stole Chemical Bank
away from Canary Wharf to take half of Alban Gate.
Numerous blocks in between are the real problem. Many are so old, badly
designed or poorly located that some may never find a tenant.
But they help contribute to a total central London stock which Edward Erdman
Research calculates would require a 25 per cent expansion in the workforce
to fill.
Even the more realistic target of reaching 'manageable' vacancy rates of 5
or 6 per cent would require the replacement of all 100,000 jobs lost since
the end of 1989.
This seems unlikely when the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is
predicting 30,000 financial services job losses by the end of this year and
the latest Jones Lang Wootton Business Confidence review shows 20,000 office
jobs will disappear across the whole south-east in the next 12 months. JLW
also predicts total demand for only 3.7m sq ft for the whole region, a third
of which is pre-let and a quarter being built for owner-occupation.
But Mr Gerry Blundell of JLW finds a bright spot in the West End, where
potential demand has soared.
Mr Marsh also sees openings for developers, because land held at historic or
nil cost - which must take in many central London pitches - can yield a
juicy return of 14.5 per cent on a 50,000 sq ft block at rents of only
Pounds 25 a sq ft.
That presupposes finding a tenant to pay this modest amount, although this
may not be over-ambitious if lower interest rates manage to kick-start the
economy.
In the City of London alone, KFR Research found almost 30 per cent of
tenants wanted to expand into new premises and were held back only because
they could not shake off existing space or new buildings were not good
enough. In fact, Healey &amp; Baker estimates there is pent-up demand for nearly
9m sq ft of City space - about three years' average net absorption.
This is the invisible thread holding up developers still building in London.
Whether they are revealed as Donald Ducks remains to be seen but they must
be looking down nervously at the dead ducks lying broken and bloody below.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (4): A different perspective on space -
Business parks / The slump has at least been beneficial in clarifying which
are the potential winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS Parks were the epitome of the affluent Eighties, when tenants
deserted congested town centres to find a brave new world. But like the
author who storms best-selling lists with a first book, they now have to
prove they can repeat the success.
Many will not make it. The slump has slowed business moves and put a clamp
on finance, dragging back the frenetic growth of even the best schemes. But
the worst would have sunk without trace even in good times. This puts a
different perspective on the vast amounts of space in the pipeline.
Applied Property Research reckons little or nothing has been built on more
than 800 planned leading schemes - and nor is it likely to appear.
The projects lack one of the vital ingredients: high-quality buildings,
extensive landscaping or, most of all, good communications.
The slump has at least been beneficial in clarifying which are the potential
winners, and that boils down to about 100 schemes and only a handful of
developers.
Arlington Property Developments, despite being part of the ailing British
Aerospace conglomerate, is among the few. Mr Patrick Deigman, managing
director, says business has halved since the boom, but inquiries are at
record levels.
'Companies have picked out where they need to go. They are just holding off
making a decision to move until they see clearer signs of a recovery,' he
says. 'The next six months could see a flood of real moves.'
The big trend is for a company to buy land and build its own premises.
British Gas, for example, is still planning a massive headquarters on almost
40 acres at Birmingham Business Park, despite rumours of backtracking on the
deal, says Mr Deigman.
Speculative building has shrunk, however, and new supply seems likely to be
less than 6m sq ft in 1992, compared with about 20m sq ft a couple of years
ago. That should about match this year's take-up - again a massive decline
since tenants gobbled up more than 17 m sq ft at the peak of the boom.
But some still feel they can risk building in advance of demand. Akeler
Developments is relying on the double bonus of regional grants and
enterprise zone incentives to underpin Doxford International, a proposed
1.25m sq ft park in Sunderland. Four blocks totalling 113,000 sq ft will be
ready for tenants by the spring and have been sold on to a property
enterprise trust for more than Pounds 18m. Arlington is also spec building
at Bracknell, Reading and Birmingham.
Another positive aspect of recession is re-emergence of the 'mid-tech'
building which mixes office and industrial space. Around London, these were
elbowed out by high-rented offices, although some planners infuriated
developers by blocking the trend. The developers may now have cause for
thanks because of shortages of mid-tech space for tenants who cannot afford
 -or do not want - pure offices.
Many companies sucked into such office schemes at Pounds 20-plus a sq ft now
have little chance of assigning leases around the western end of the M25
where new office space can be found for Pounds 17.50, according to Mr Chris
Palmer and Mr Chris Bearman at Grimley J R Eve.
They say mid-tech space has netted a clutch of deals in Barwell Business
Park, Chessington at about Pounds 8-Pounds 10 a sq ft over the past six
months, often to international companies.
Whole regions are also short of supply. 'Yorkshire and Manchester cry out
for a first-class business park,' says Mr Geoff Marsh of Applied Property
Research. Leeds-based Mr Simon Ives of Chesterton agrees that West Yorkshire
has only the Lawnswood park on the city's northern fringe, although he
points out that at least the North is not awash with empty space.
He is not optimistic about new development. 'Even if someone was prepared to
put up speculative space they would find it extremely difficult to borrow
the money. One also wonders where the demand would come from.'
But Mr Deigman would move into Manchester tomorrow if he could find the
right site. He has looked at 40 without success.
Plans for a 4.5m sq ft giant at Gloucester will keep him busy, however. This
sort of 'fourth generation' development is the pattern for the next decade,
says architect Michael Aukett - who has a special authority after creating
the template for modern development more than a decade ago through the
mould-breaking Stockley Park near Heathrow, and who now keeps busy working
up schemes in both eastern and western Europe.
The new generation will be big - more than 100 acres - with all the
trimmings of low land cover and high-quality buildings. They will integrate
with the community by providing homes, leisure and shopping facilities, and
link into public transport.
But the transition will not be easy, says Mr Aukett, particularly if
developers are tempted to recoup high land costs by clogging sites with
high-earning uses.
Some have already made this mistake and may suffer slower future growth.
Many more, however, face an even bigger disappointment for aspiring to turn
sow's ear industrial sites into high-tech silk purses.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (3): Sales remain sluggish - Retail
Sector / Last year saw the completion of some 25 town-centre developments.
But as new shopping centres continue to open they add yet more space to a
market which is probably already oversupplied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RETAIL sales remain sluggish and show no signs of returning to the heady
levels of the mid- to late 1980s. Meanwhile shopping centres, conceived with
such enthusiasm in those days, continue to open - adding yet more space to
an arguably already oversupplied market.
Last year saw the completion of some 25 new town centre developments with a
total net floorspace of some 4.62m sq ft, according to surveyor Healey &amp;
Baker. And surveyor Hillier Parker reckons that this year 23 town-centre
shopping projects will be completed adding a further 4.3m sq ft.
Another 25 centres with 3.3m sq ft are scheduled for completion next year
and just 16 with 2.5m sq ft in 1994.
The total of planned future space is, however, drifting downwards as more
developments are either deferred or scrapped altogether.
The shopping centre letting market, says Mr John Faulkner of Healey &amp; Baker,
is now largely driven by cash from landlords.
Retailers are demanding capital sums and-or contributions towards fitting
out, rent-free periods and-or stepped rental agreements before they will
agree to take space.
In addition, tenants are understandably nervous of possible continuing
liabilities under privity of contract and are looking for shorter leases -
of 10 or 15 years.
And more and more landlords are having to accept turnover-related rents.
But it is not all bad news. Mr Faulkner points out that several retailers
have seized the opportunities provided by all these incentives to build up
small chains. And, although some have gone bust - leaving landlords not only
with empty space on their hands, but also minus large amounts of hard cash -
others who have made use of the same advantages look as if they are
expanding solid and innovative new businesses.
Retail rents are down - and there seems to be a consensus that we shall not
begin to see any improvement until 1994 at the earliest.
Despite this general impression of gloom, shop agents are quick to make the
point that there are still locations where there is unsatisfied demand from
retailers and shortage of supply.
There are also towns which need either new shopping centres or the big
refurbishment of out-dated space in order to provide the type of environment
attractive to shoppers - and to remain competitive with neighbouring
locations.
Surveyor Jones Lang Wootton undertakes location-specific research aimed at
identifying locations which are likely to buck the general trend and prove
the best bets for investment and development.
Factors considered in Jones Lang Wootton's model include employment and
population growth, retail spending power, current and likely provision of
shopping space and current rental levels.
The firm's Mr John Milligan says that despite appearances to the contrary
there was actually less shopping space built in the 1980s than in the decade
previous to that.
And, he adds, a lot of that 1970s space is now looking very tired and in
need of a revamp.
In addition there are, says Mr Milligan, towns which were bypassed by the
rental explosion of the 1980s which took place as the so-called 'space
bandit' multiple retailers scrambled to take prime pitch shops in as many
high streets as possible pushing rents sky-high in the process.
Investors are certainly prepared to take another look at the retail property
sector. This despite little prospect of rental growth in the near future.
Mr Andrew Waters of surveyor Richard Ellis says that there have been several
sales of high street shops in the favoured cathedral cities - Bath, York,
Salisbury and so on - at around 5 per cent initial yields. He cites the
recent sale of a shop in Silver Street, Durham, at a little over 5 per cent
as an example.
Such purchases at first sight appear to defy logic unless buyers are taking
a long-term view. On the other hand, shop units in these popular locations
are almost always in demand and at an average lot size of about Pounds 3m,
highly tradeable - perhaps one of the very few categories of property which
could be considered quasi liquid.
Another sector towards which investment sentiment has improved substantially
is retail warehousing. Only some two years ago in the wake of the Lowndes
Queensway collapse, yields had moved out to 11 per cent.
Now yields have fallen to 8.75-9 per cent for the best product.
The sector is also unusual in that it is showing rental growth - and there
is a feeling that there could be more growth to come through. In addition
there is strong demand from a whole new range of out-of-town retailers.
Led by the privatised electricity companies these include many types of
retailers; from those selling toys to those selling pet food.
There are far fewer incentives on offer to retail warehouse tenants. And in
some cases landlords are looking for - and getting - premiums.
Shopping centre investment yields have also fallen. After drifting up to
between 9 per cent and 10 per cent, prime yields are now standing at about
8.5 per cent.
This, however, compares with the reputed 6 per cent at which some 2 1/2
years ago General Accident funded Capital &amp; Counties' recently-completed
shopping centre in Bromley.
Despite landlords' cash and the efforts of hard-pressed letting agents some
of the newer shopping centres have opened their doors with disappointingly
low occupancy levels.
The problem has been worse in the south-east where the recession has hit
consumer spending hardest.
But even here, certain centres are showing respectable levels of lettings.
Friends Provident's 450,000 sq ft County Mall in Crawley, Sussex opened
two-thirds let last Easter.
And Norwich Union's 460,000 sq ft Bentalls Centre in Kingston boasts not
only a W H Smith multi-level flagship store with its own wall-climber lift
and the largest ever single-level Dillons book shop in the UK; but also
several much-courted overseas fashion retailers.
In central London itself the shop market is confused and patchy says Ms Emma
Thacker of Richard Ellis: 'Desperate in some areas and thriving in others'.
The two traditional high fashion locations - Sloane Street and Bond Street -
have undergone a reversal of fortunes with Sloane Street rents down from
their 1988-89 levels of Pounds 410 a sq ft (Zone A) to about Pounds 250 a sq
ft while in Bond Street, where Zone A rents only reached about Pounds 200 a
sq ft at the peak, a much-needed boost has been provided by the
much-trumpeted arrival of Versace.
His new Pounds 13m store represents a Zone A rent of Pounds 250 a sq ft.
Oxford Street is reportedly trading well although some landlords would
rather accept temporary tenants at Pounds 250-Pounds 275 a sq ft (Zone A) -
or even keep shops empty - rather than provide clear evidence of a fall in
'face' rents when involved in hotly-contested rent review negotiations on
other units.
Throughout central London, and many other centres, over-renting is a serious
problem - particularly for those who took space at the high peak rents that
are now unobtainable.
The high level of the Uniform Business Rate only adds to the misery.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (2): The search for a reliable income -
Investment and finance / Net investments by life companies in the first six
months of this year amounted to only Pounds 424m. And inward investment from
foreign buyers has slowed to a trickle

MR Alan Winter, managing director of Legal &amp; General's property arm, is
quietly pleased with the performance of his portfolio. Even in central
London lettings are being achieved: last week for example, British Rail took
42,000 sq ft in Euston House.
The latest industrial development - the Campus Estate in Hemel Hempstead -
has also just become fully let, with the last 25,000 sq ft unit going to
Modern Alarms.
Of the eight shopping centres owned by the life company, only one has spaces
of more than 5 per cent - and that is a new development in Ipswich open for
trading only since the beginning of October.
The most recent retail investment purchase - the Grange shopping centre in
Birkenhead, bought for Pounds 24m in October to show a 12 per cent return -
is 100 per cent let.
In today's market, such a smooth performance has not been achieved without
cost.
Early this year Legal &amp; General decided to cut asking rents across the board
even though it had not pushed them up as aggressively as others during the
boom years of the mid-1980s.
The result, says Mr Winter, is that 'rents are now broadly supported by
today's trading levels.'
Unlike most of his competitors, therefore, Mr Winter is actively buying
properties in the market (although not, it must be said, London offices) and
he expects to invest a total of Pounds 350m in property this year with
further net investment in 1993.
Investment statistics for the market as a whole show this strategy to be
markedly against the trend; net investments by life companies in the first
six months of this year amounted to only Pounds 424m compared with Pounds
1.48bn for the whole of 1991.
Pension funds were even more reluctant buyers, putting Pounds 189m into the
market compared with Pounds 564m.
And inward investment from foreign buyers has slowed to a trickle.
Legal &amp; General finds itself in the fortunate position of being able to hunt
bargains in this weak market having sold Pounds 800m of property at the peak
of the market in 1989 and 1990. This reduced the percentage of property in
the main life fund from the high 20s to just under 16 - at the bottom of the
15-20 per cent range which Mr Winter now believes to be a comfortable
long-term benchmark for a large fund.
Despite the deliberate contra-cyclical approach, Mr Winter's choice of
purchases does offer pointers to the market. Erstwhile prime property does
not appeal: the target is higher yield - industrial and retail warehousing
at about 9.5 per cent; land banks for the future even if presently covered
by poor quality buildings; and shopping centres on yields as high as 12 per
cent.
Developments are a thing of the past; Legal &amp; General has run down its
development team from 30-strong in 1989 to just five and it is unlikely to
volunteer for fresh development schemes before the end of the decade.
The search for reliable income streams has been a feature of the investment
market for two years and now favours the industrial sector because it has
suffered less than offices from speculative over-building. But, in an
ominous sign, third-quarter yields on industrial units moved above 9 per
cent; a symptom of the fall-off in manufacturing demand which seems set to
accelerate into the final quarter. According to agents Healey &amp; Baker, only
a few choice distribution centres can now fetch 9.25 per cent; less than
prime estates are touching 10 per cent.
The retail investments market has also turned soggy again, although the
necessarily limited supply of top locations has sustained prices for the
very best high street units even without prospects for rental growth. Healey
&amp; Baker confirm that most interest is being shown in smaller investments -
under Pounds 5m - and smaller towns and market centres.
The less said about central London offices the better: over-supply and
over-renting are the market's two main nightmares. But in all areas and
sectors medium-term prospects continue to deteriorate and perhaps only the
largest funds with no liquidity problems can afford to take a sufficiently
long-term view.
That certainly does not apply to most property developers. Forced to abandon
speculation, those in a position to do so are busy repaying borrowings.
Bank of England figures show that total borrowing by property companies fell
by 5.2 per cent in the 12 months to May and total outstanding bank advances
in May were Pounds 38.6bn, down 1.6 per cent since February.
These figures show just how long it will take to bear down on the excesses
of the 1980s. The shallow decline in bank lending revealed in the Band of
England figures represents, according to Jones Lang Wootton, net repayments
of Pounds 1bn in the first half of this year. Property companies will be
occupied with repaying loans for many years yet.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (1): A growing list of failures -
Overview / Tenants' bankruptcies have added to industry problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW areas of British industry have suffered so visibly during the recession
as the UK property industry. This year, its declining fortunes became
obvious to even the most casual observer.
In place of the trappings of the boom - the duckboards, cranes, dust and
traffic diversions - there are now derelict, boarded-up buildings, unlet new
developments and rows of letting signs.
The ever-growing list of failures has embraced property companies, shopping
centres and office developments, most notably the ill-starred Canary Wharf
development that towers over East London.
The problems of the property industry are no longer merely those of its own
making. Even where it did not overvalue, overbuild and over-borrow, it has
suffered from record bankruptcies among tenants.
The industrial sector, for example, has suffered heavily from the recession
this year, even though it never became oversupplied with new buildings.
Not every participant in the property market is despondent, however. Tenants
who are unencumbered with existing premises have had opportunities to sign
cheap leases on their own terms.
Some fledgling retail companies have expanded rapidly in underlet shopping
centres with the help of incentives from desperate landlords.
Some investors, too, are cheered by the opportunity to buy at what they
perceive as the bottom of the market.
Their enthusiasm is whetted by the very high level of property yields, which
this year exceeded gilt yields for the first time since the 1960s.
Many also believe that the dearth of new construction activity will bring
the property market back into balance in a few years' time.
The state of the market is very uneven. Pockets of the market such as retail
warehouses and supermarkets have largely escaped the downturn. The decline
has not affected every part of the UK. In Scotland, for example, rents
actually rose in the year to September.
Even the depressed Central London office market shows large variations in
the severity of the downturn.
While top rents have generally halved since their peak in May 1990 to Pounds
35 per sq ft at most, the scarcity of large modern buildings in the West End
recently led Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, to
pay a reported Pounds 55 per sq ft for a building in Berkeley Square.
Record vacancy rates should not be taken entirely at face value. Herring
Baker Harris, chartered surveyors, says that 5m sq ft of offices in the City
of London, where 20 per cent of offices are empty, are virtually unlettable
space.
The prospects for some office blocks are so poor that their owners are
making them uninhabitable to escape the burden of rates bills.
Even modern buildings do not necessarily provide the premises that occupiers
want. A study by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property advisers, showed that
speculative developments often did not meet tenants' needs.
'While the development boom has affected most key office centres, this
should not be taken to mean that the choice available to potential office
occupiers has increased in line with construction activity,' it concluded.
Despite these caveats, the unprecedented imbalance between supply and demand
is putting new power in the hands of tenants seeking new space. This - and
the difficulties of letting and selling buildings - is changing the roles of
banks, developers and investors.
The developers are being kept afloat by their bankers for the present while
they attempt to let their existing buildings. But they are under heavy
pressure to cut costs and their future prospects look bleak.
There is little prospect of attracting finance for future speculative
developments as the banks are only prepared to provide property finance in
the most exacting circumstances. The banks' reluctance stems from the scale
of their existing problems, which has made them, in effect, the unwilling
owners of property for years to come.
The attitude of investors has also changed. The old adage was that all that
mattered in property was 'location, location, location.' The emphasis has
changed to stress the quality of the covenant above the location and the
quality of property.
The pressures mounting on the traditional lease is perhaps the most dramatic
symptom of the new conditions facing developers, investors and tenants.
Tenants, particularly retailers, are baulking at the 25-year lease with
upwards-only reviews every five years, which they see as restrictive and
inflationary. Landlords are being forced to concede break clauses that allow
the tenant to curtail the lease prematurely. Similarly, tenants have lobbied
intensely for a change in the law on privity of contract, which allows
landlords to reclaim unpaid rent from former tenants, where a lease has been
assigned.
Investors are anxiously watching the pressure for change to lease
structures. Many institutional investors feel that any change would be a
severe threat to the security of income from property. As a result, the role
of property in institutional portfolios could be jeopardised by reform.
The role of property in institutional portfolio is under scrutiny for other
reasons, too. The UK's withdrawal from the European Monetary System's
exchange rate mechanism has reopened the debate about property's role as a
hedge against inflation.
Even those who believe that inflation will not re-emerge as a serious
problem generally believe that property's prospects have been boosted by the
exit from the ERM. It allowed a relaxation of high real interest rates,
which bore down heavily on indebted property companies.
It remains to be seen whether institutional interest in commercial property
can be rekindled. Net institutional property investment remained subdued
this year, totalling just Pounds 212m in the second quarter, according to
the Central Statistical Office. In some parts of the market, such as the
City of London, the institutions' involvement was exceeded by overseas
investors.
Buying interest, from whatever source, has been highly selective. It is
focused on well-let, well-located and high quality property that makes up,
at most, a fifth of the market.
The bulk of the investment market will only begin its recovery after tenants
stop going bankrupt and start to absorb new space. Even if the decline
abates, few analysts expect any significant improvement in the coming year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (15) Parisian
showcase links two cultures - Shiseido, a powerful player in the
international cosmetics industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are few parts of Paris that are quite as French as the Palais Royal,
the sumptuous squares and arched arcades built by Cardinal Richelieu in the
17th century and now colonised by such Parisian institutions as Jack Lang's
arts ministry and the Grand Vefour, one of the oldest and finest restaurants
in the city.
Hidden in the arches is a prettily painted shop with astrological symbols
and animal images sketched on its walls in different shades of purple and
elegantly-shaped flasks of perfume in the windows. This is the Haute
Parfumerie opened earlier this year by Shiseido, the Japanese company which
is one of the most powerful players in the international cosmetics industry,
as a showcase for its European interests.
Shiseido spent more than Dollars 2m to create its Haute Parfumerie. It sells
its perfumes from the shop, but sees it less as a regular retail outlet than
as an extension of its publicity programme along the lines of the lavish
beauty salons owned by the established French fragrance houses, Guerlain and
Boucheron.
The Haute Parfumerie also marks the latest stage of Shiseido's expansion in
Europe. Shiseido first ventured into Europe in the early 1960s, when it
started selling its products in Italy. It formalised its Italian links in
1968 by setting up Shiseido Cosmetics (Italia) as its first European
subsidiary.
Italy was used as a testing ground throughout the 1970s - 'in the early days
we treated the Italian operation very much as an experiment,' says Mr Yukata
Goto, chief executive of Shiseido International (France). 'And we learnt a
lot from our experience there."
In 1980 Shiseido was ready to launch a fully-fledged assault on the European
market, where it faced strong competition from indigenous companies,
including L'Oreal of France, as well as the US groups, Revlon and Estee
Lauder. The group set up new subsidiaries in France, Germany and, later, in
the UK.
Shiseido also introduced specially developed versions of all its ranges  -
perfumes, skin care products and cosmetics - for the European market. Its
Italian experience had demonstrated that it could not expect to sell the
same formulae in Europe as in its native Japan.
'The demands of European consumers are different for every product type,'
said Mr Goto. 'The Japanese tend to prefer lighter, more subtle fragrances
than the Europeans. There are also differences in skin types and in the
climate, which is much more humid in Japan.'
Similarly Shiseido decided to adopt a different approach to marketing. In
1980 it appointed Serge Lutens, a French designer and stylist, as its
international image creator. He has since co-ordinated every aspect of its
publicity across different international markets ranging from its
advertising campaigns to the decoration of the Palais Royal salon.
But until recently Shiseido shipped its specially developed European ranges
over from its factories in Japan and the US. This year it opened its first
European production plant, a factory at Gien in France.
SHISEIDO now directly employs 700 in Europe, where it made sales of Dollars
134m in its last financial year, an increase of 17 per cent on the previous
year. This means that Europe now represents 30 per cent of its sales outside
Japan, or 3.3 per cent of the group's overall Dollars 4.06bn turnover. This
means that Europe now plays a pivotal part in Shiseido's attempts to
increase its overall share of the international cosmetics market from 11 per
cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000.
Shiseido plans to concentrate on expanding its distribution, rather than
manufacturing, activities in Europe. The opening of the Haute Parfumerie in
the Palais Royal forms part of this strategy being, as Yoshiharu Fukuhara,
Shiseido's worldwide chief executive, put it, 'an ideal bridge linking our
two cultures.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (14):
Understanding is deepening - Interview with Japan's ambassador to the
European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOMOHIKO KOBAYASHI, Japan's ambassador to the European Community, answers
questions put to him by Ian Rodger of the Financial Times.
QUESTION: Tension between Japan and the EC appears to have subsided in
recent months. Has the development of the relationship become less urgent?
ANSWER: Because of the decline of order in the international situation, it
is more urgent than ever to develop our relationships. The world needs
stronger leadership. Europe, Japan and North America are the only possible
leaders. Russia and China are not ready yet.
But everyone seems to be more concerned with domestic problems than
international orders.
Unfortunately, we in Japan are hindered by the weakening of the Liberal
Democratic Party and by the slowing down of the economy until some time next
year. For example, on the question of accepting tarification on agricultural
products - this kind of initiative is not foreseeable. EC Commission leaders
are also hindered by internal problems.
So what can be done?
At this stage, we cannot do very spectacular things, but we can make
concrete progress in particular areas. For example, we had our first high
level meeting early this year on environmental co-operation, and identified
many areas where we could work together.
The EC has promised to help us in studies of the Sarawak tropical forest (in
Indonesia); and Japan has agreed to participate in studies of the Brazilian
tropical forest, which is of great interest to the EC.
On science and technology, we will be having our first meeting of experts
shortly, and we have started co-operation on the Human Frontier programme.
Japan has also reached an agreement with the US, Russia and the EC on
research into nuclear fusion, and, like the US, we are a party to the
European Energy Charter, under which concrete agreements for joint research
and development into alternative forms of energy are being negotiated.
We have had three seminars on social policy so far. I think that by
comparing notes on social and labour policies, European understanding of
Japanese systems is deepening, so we no longer get these sweeping criticisms
based on lack of knowledge. For example, our annual working hours, which
everyone criticises, are almost the same as those in the US or the UK.
So, active co-operation has really started. We are not just at the
rhetorical level as we were in July 1991 when we signed our joint
declaration. Relations are no longer based only on trade problems. Of
course, trade problems exist, and we have to manage them carefully so as not
to poison our overall relations.
Some analysts say that Japan has been reluctant or unable to carry though on
its stated desire to develop stronger political relations with Europe.
Not true. We took the initiative to broaden relations. The joint declaration
was a Japanese initiative. It says that political dialogue is very
important, and between the EC Council, the EC Commission and the Japanese
government, dialogue has already started.
We have worked on joint assessments of the former Soviet Union, and we are
working together in the G24 group on eastern Europe. We have at last become
an observer on the Committee for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)
this year, but France is reluctant that we participate fully.
Maybe the European complaint that we do not pay enough attention to Europe
is justified because interest on the Japanese side is still limited to very
few people. The focus of most businessmen is on the US and Asia.
Europe, with the exception of the UK, is still considered a difficult region
for Japanese business, and this view is reinforced by anti-Japanese
outbursts from Mrs Edith Cresson (the former French prime minister) and Mr
Jacques Calvet (chairman of the Peugeot motor group).
Even Germany is a difficult country for Japanese businessmen. People
complain about Japanese keiretsu, but we find there are very strong business
ties between banks and enterprises in Germany that make it very difficult
for us to penetrate.
And there are serious labour problems in Germany. People like Mr Akio Morita
of Sony are trying hard to change views, and the latest slogan in Japan for
promoting global business understanding is 'harmonious symbiosis' - whatever
that may mean]
SOME Europeans complain that Japan is not doing enough to help the eastern
European countries and the former Soviet Union countries.
The mass media in Europe are too egocentric. Even the EC Commission says
that Japan should take on the same level of burden there as a European
country. But for us, the significance of eastern Europe is very different.
Germany got back the eastern lander, which was a triumph for democracy in
western Europe. And now the white, Christian people in the other eastern
European countries are coming back to their western cultural home, so
western Europe is very happy, even euphoric.
Therefore, it is normal that they should pay for the regeneration of eastern
Europe. Of course, if we reflect on the worldwide significance, Japan has to
share the responsibility too, and we are ready to do that. But we have not
had historical relations with eastern Europe.
Look at it the other way round: what is happening in Cambodia or North Korea
or Mongolia? Only Japan is helping Mongolia's democratisation drive with
massive aid. We are the biggest provider of official development aid (ODA)
to China, and we have other constituencies, willy nilly, as a result of
geography, like Bangladesh.
We advocate that the five former Soviet republics in central Asia should be
entitled to ODA, but our initiative is being hampered by some European
countries that want to direct aid mainly to their former eastern European
friends.
We understand that Europe is not so interested in these areas, but we are
telling Europeans that they should become more involved in Asian problems
because the US is retreating, and many Asian countries are worried. A
European presence could be an element of security in Asia, even calming
fears of Japanese domination.
As for Russia, it is doing very little to ease tensions in the far east. Its
military power there may even be increasing as it replaces old equipment. It
is still occupying part of our country.
So how can we give massive macro-economic aid? Would France give financial
aid to a country that was occupying Alsace?
Wartime resentment against Russia is still strong in Japan. The Soviet Union
took 600,000 Japanese prisoners after the war, and there were terrible
stories of torture and deprivation. Yet, we have pledged Dollars 2.6bn in
technical and humanitarian assistance. The IMF is giving Dollars 24bn to
Russia, and we are the second largest contributor to the IMF.
So there are differences in viewpoint. We cannot avoid misunderstandings -
that is why political dialogue is necessary. The UK presidency is doing a
lot. They brief us regularly and we have responded by sending the deputy
minister for political affairs for regular private consultations in Europe.
Understanding is deepening, little by little.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (11): A change in
Japan's image - Japan's growing presence in the EC is leading to greater
familiarity with what has long been the unfathomable Japanese way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS recent history Europe has regarded Japan with conflicting feelings of
fear and admiration but the image of Japan in the EC is beginning to undergo
a significant change with the growing presence of Japanese corporations on
European soil.
Japan's image in Europe has differed from country to country depending on
the specific economic and political environment of the day. Broadly
speaking, interest in Japan has been heavily geared towards industrial and
economic issues, with politics, social and cultural themes providing an
entertaining additional insight into the nation and its people.
The result has been to exaggerate the impression that Japan is a nation of
economic animals who put business before all else and are deprived of the
high quality of life enjoyed by many Europeans.
Japan is seen in Europe as a nation of disciplined and dedicated workers
where a rigorous educational system, a stable social order and co-operation
between industry and government have produced a twentieth century economic
miracle.
But this admiration in Europe for Japan's industrial achievements has been
offset by increduilty at what appear to many Europeans to be deplorable
living and working conditions in Japan and criticism of the collusive
business and trade practices and closed society which are seen to be at the
foundation of the country's economic might.
The more positive response to Japan contrasts sharply with the suspicion and
hostility felt by some towards the 'Japanese way' of doing things - the long
working hours and group-oriented way of life - which has been seen to be the
basis for the country's economic miracle.
Particularly in countries where nationalistic feelings have run strong,
Japan's economic strength has been portrayed as having a price that would be
too high for Europeans to pay.
The notorious depiction by Mrs Edith Cresson, the former French prime
minister, of the Japanese as being like ants who have little time for
anything besides work, is probably not very different from the view that
many Europeans have of the Japanese.
The French elite have been scathing in their remarks about Japanese business
practices - 'the Japanese electronics industry has developed a fearsome war
machine,' and employs a long-term strategy that is pursued until 'Japan has
conquered the entire electronics industry,' writes SGS-Thomson, the
Franco-Italian semiconductor group, in a report.
Where a nation's elite feel threatened by the Japanese challenge, they will
stoke popular fear, says Prof. Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry
management at the University of Wales. Thus in France, where the Japanese
onslaught poses a large threat to the elite who would be deprived of jobs if
Japanese companies take over most industries, popular opinion has often been
antagonistic.
While the image of Japan in Europe is not so far divorced from the reality,
as far as working conditions, lifestyle, business practices and the way
society works are concerned, there has perhaps been a tendency to read too
much into these social differences and the role they have played in Japan's
industrial success.
The large number of Japanese corporations being established throughout the
EC is, however, leading to less of a hysterical portrayal of Japan as a
nation of economic warriors and more of a concerted effort to take a direct
look at what lies behind Japan's industrial prowess.
'We've been going through a learning process in most European countries,'
says Prof. Jones. Business executives are beginning to see that the Japanese
success is not something that stems from alien social factors that would not
be acceptable elsewhere but from a different way of production, he says.
Prof. Jones is co-author of the book, The Machine that Changed the World,
which identified the Japanese production process as the source of their
success and attempts to explain it.
The growing presence of Japanese transplants in Europe has helped that
learning process in Europe - 'the more you look at the Japanese transplants
you can see that that can be done outside Japan,' he says.
While the UK has a big advantage in that respect, the French are also seeing
changes in Japan's image among influential circles, according to Mr Claude
Meyer, deputy general manager of Bank Europeenne de Tokyo and lecturer on
Japanese economy at the Paris University Graduate School of Social Sciences.
'Even in business, the Japanese style of industrial management and processes
is positively covered, including Japanese factories in France, and has led
to some adaptations of industrial processes in French companies,' he notes.
The changing environment in Germany, meanwhile, has brought about a shift in
Japan's image in another direction. While the Germans have respected Japan's
success, their own industrial might has meant that they have been less
paranoid, at times almost dismissive, about the Japanese challenge. However,
Professor Jones says that Nissan's launch of Lexus, the luxury car 'sent a
complete shock through the German system.'
The Japanese have shown in Lexus that they could do very well in an area
that the Germans felt was their own preserve. Now, the Germans are looking
at Japan in a very different way and realising that they have to get their
act together. The Machine that Changed the World has sold three times as
many in Germany as in the UK.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (12): All-round
benefits - Collaboration in research and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Hirokazu Negishi, Canon's head of research and development for
Europe, came up with the idea of a making stereo loudspeaker that would
provide stereo effect to a much broader area than conventional box
loudspeakers, he chose to develop the product in the UK.
After working on early prototypes, Mr Negishi called on the expertise of Mr
Ian Flindell, an acoustics researcher at the Institute of Sound and
Vibration Research at the University of Southampton to conduct
psycho-acoustic research, and audio designer Mike Jewitt to play a leading
role in the design of the innovative speakers.
The result, wide imaging stereo, which uses acoustic mirrors to give a wider
stereo effect, became the camera maker's first audio product and was
launched in the UK last year.
Canon is one of a growing number of Japanese manufacturers in the EC which
have been reaping the benefits of conducting research and design activities
in the region.
The number of Japanese manufacturers in the European Community with research
and development facilities has surged from 73 just two years ago to 203 at
the end of January this year, according to a survey by the Japan External
Trade Organisation, (Jetro).
Japanese companies in a variety of industrial sectors, ranging from
electronics to pharmaceuticals, have been encouraged to set up R&amp;D
facilities in the EC both by the need to localise their operations and the
recognition that Europe is a rich source of scientific and intellectual
talent.
'It is the third wave of Japanese investment in the EC,' says Mr Steve
Kremer, analyst at the Anglo-Japanese Economic Institute.
The first big wave was of investment in basic assembly facilities which was
followed by investment by component suppliers. The third wave of investment
in R&amp;D facilities is the next logical step in the globalisation process of
Japanese corporations.
The majority of Japanese R&amp;D centres are still concerned mainly with the
task of adapting products to local markets, either through cosmetic changes
or by incorporating local components into existing designs, Mr Kremer says.
Higher value-added fundamental research is still a small proportion of the
total and only 18 per cent of Japanese manufacturers responding to a Jetro
survey cited basic research as an activity carried out at their R&amp;D centres.
Nevertheless, the presence of Japanese R&amp;D facilities in the EC has brought
significant benefits not only to the Japanese companies concerned but to
local academic institutions as well.
For European academic and research institutions, Japanese R&amp;D activity,
which has sprouted a growing number of collaborative relationships between
corporate R&amp;D organisations and local insitutions, has become a major source
of research funds.
'It has certainly worked from the UK university's point of view,' Mr Kremer
notes.
'The timing is very good because universities are increasingly having to go
out and find funds for their research projects.'
Toshiba, for example, contributes substantial funds to Cambridge University
where it conducts collaborative research with the Cavendish Laboratory. In
addition to such collaborative projects, several Japanese companies with
their own R&amp;D facilities in the region commission local academic
institutions to conduct research in areas where they cannot do so themselves
either because of a lack of facilities or staff.
The Japanese have also benefitted from intellectual resources which are
simply not available in Japan, according to Mr Kremer - 'this country has
some of the best brains in pharmaceuticals research, for example.'
Many Japanese researchers point out that European researchers have much to
teach the Japanese with their different approach to research and
development.
Mr Negishi at Canon says that the Japanese approach to R&amp;D tends to be
evolutionary whereas in the west, the emphasis is creativity and big,
revolutionary breakthroughs.
In addition, Japanese companies must often look abroad for help in specific
fields such as pharmaceuticals and software where work has lagged behind the
west. Canon's project to develop 3-D graphics based on software rather than
hardware is another example of R&amp;D that the group felt would be better done
in the UK than in Japan.
The Japanese have been quick to tap the expertise of their EC partners. By
locating its R&amp;D Centre within Surrey Research Park, adjacent to the
University of Surrey, Canon was able to call on the help of engineers at the
University's music department while it was developing the wide imaging
stereo.
'Many of these people have very sensitive ears,' Mr Negishi says.
Similarly, Toshiba's Cambridge Research Centre, which is the group's first
corporate R&amp;D centre outside Japan, is located in the Cambridge Science
Park.
Toshiba's R&amp;D Centre, which is one of the more progressive of Japanese R&amp;D
facilities in the EC in that it conducts basic research, has access to
university facilities and the use of laboratory equipment to carry out
collaborative research projects.
In Germany, Matsushita, the electronics group, set up the Panasonic European
R&amp;D Centre near Frankfurt, last year.
The centre, which is working on different European television standards, has
close relationships with the University of Frankfurt and research contracts
with the University of Darmstadt as well as the Academy of Media Arts in
Cologne.
Sony Broadcast and Communications Advanced Developments is the Japanese
group's R&amp;D centre in Basingstoke which focuses on professional broadcast
and audio markets.
Taking the idea of global R&amp;D a step further than most, Sony's research
groups based in Japan, California, Australia and the UK are computer
networked for extensive co-operation on projects.
Similar collaboration between Japan and the UK has recently produced a high
quality convertor to integrate high definition TV with the European PAL
system.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (13): New scope
for European brokers and bankers - Japanese financial deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ongoing financial deregulation has provided opportunities for
European brokers and bankers, but it has also created contradictions for
these institutions, which have generally carved off small slices of markets
now subject to further deregulation.
Proposals to liberalise the heavily-regulated domestic corporate bond market
could make life more difficult for foreign institutions specialising in
Japanese business in the Euromarkets, while the planned entry of Japanese
bank subsidiaries into investment trusts will intensify the competition in a
crowded and, at the moment, shrinking market.
The liberalisation of Japanese markets has created opportunities for
European banks, brokers and insurance companies, but the pace of that
liberalisation could slow, as some senior officials at the Bank of Japan and
ministry of finance consider that these changes are partly responsible for
the mess in Japan's financial system.
These officials have been made cautious by the collapse of the stock market,
the enduring weakness of property prices and the crisis in the banking
industry. But other officials within the finance ministry argue that these
crises would not have arisen if there had been more competition and better
risk management.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has pointed the finger at foreign brokers, US
and European, for allegedly dragging down stock prices through their playing
of recently liberalised futures and options markets, and Japanese brokers
were envious of the collective profits made by foreigners during the first
half to the end of September.
During that six months, the 99 Japanese members of the TSE made a collective
pre-tax loss of around Y210bn, while 25 foreign members made a profit of
Y30bn, down from Y50bn in the previous period, but still large enough to
draw attention to their activities in the derivatives markets.
The TSE argues that individual investors are intimidated by sudden price
movements inspired by the foreigners' trading habits. These concerns
prompted the Osaka Stock Exchange, under presure from the TSE, to lift
margin requirements three times last year - the bulk of Japan's stock
futures trading is done on the Osaka exchange, although the index is based
on Tokyo cash prices.
In response, the council of the European Business Community in Japan has
suggested that there be more consultation before rule changes are made. The
TSE is presently conducting a study into the derivatives markets, and while
European brokers are confident that the exchange will find the markets are
not at fault, there is a fear that the exchange may need to be seen to
justify its concern by making further changes to trading regulations.
The manager of a British house in Tokyo says that 'arbitrary' changes in
rules are against the spirit of internationalisation that the Tokyo exchange
is wanting to cultivate. Some European brokers are booking a profit, but the
industry is under pressure to restructure because of the continuing weakness
of the Tokyo market.
A sign of the contradictory pressures created by financial reforms is the
debate over the deregulation of stock brokerage commissions.
In principle, fees should be deregulated to bring Tokyo in line with other
international financial centres, but foreign brokers warn that their market
share could be squeezed in the competitive crush.
Officials from the London exchange have cautioned their Japanese
counterparts about a sudden change in the commission structure and said
attention must be paid to the extreme pressure on brokers in the Japanese
market.
The difficulties faced by Japanese banks, badly bruised by their exposure to
the domestic property market, have provided opportunities for European
banks, though the traditionally close relationships
between Japanese banks and domestic corporate clients, often extending to
cross-shareholdings, are still strong.
At the third meeting of the Import Board of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti) in July, the EBC complained that
foreign banks' share of lending was only 1.5 per cent of the Japanese
market. To increase that share, the EBC suggested that local banking rules
should meet international standards and that deregulation should be
quickened.
The most significant change in the banking market is the non-performing loan
exposure of leading Japanese banks, which rose 54 per cent to Y12,300bn in
the six months to the end of September.
Meanwhile, banks' trimming of assets to meet capital adequacy standards
established by the Bank for International Settlements have created
opportunities for European banks. As part of that trimming, Japanese
commercial banks have been willing to sell loans to regional and foreign
banks.
Reforms are pending in the insurance market, though the fate is unclear of
recommendations by a insurance industry advisory council, which recently
recommended to the finance ministry that study groups be established to
consider a relaxation of the tight controls over product lines and pricing.
Ten European non-life companies have licences in Japan, and Mr Mike Gourlay,
manager of Royal Insurance in Japan, said that the timing and extent of the
reforms are yet to be decided, but there is a recognition that the 'consumer
deserves more choice'.
However, the regulation of prices ensures the survival of smaller companies,
and a sudden deregulation of prices could make life more difficult for some
foreign companies in Japan. Mr Gourlay says Royal Insurance, which opened
its Tokyo branch in 1975, has the advantage that many Japanese recognise
London as the international centre for insurance - 'in our direct marketing
we are emphasising that we are a British company.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (7): Concern over
market mechanisms - Japan's relations with the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S relations with the EC are meant to be governed by the high flown
commitments of their joint Hague declaration, adopted in July last year
which talks of a deepening partnership based upon the common ideals of
freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
Making the ideals of the Hague declaration a reality will be a long hard
slog.
Nothing could better symbolise the difficulties which the EC faces in
establishing its legitimacy and leverage with the Japanese authorities than
the arrival of Mr Jean-Pierre Leng, the EC's current ambassador to Japan.
National ambassadors usually present their credentials to the Emperor. But
previous EC ambassadors had been shuffled to one side and asked to present
their credentials only to the foreign minister and latterly to the prime
minister.
With Mr Leng's arrival the EC made it clear, politely but firmly, that it
expected its ambassador to be treated on a par with ambassadors from its
member-states.
Mr Leng did indeed visit the Imperial Palace to present his credentials to
the Emperor. But only after a significant delay to his arrival in Japan.
The EC's relations with Japan are clouded and complicated by several
factors.
Japan has a much more developed and intense relationship with the US, which
has played a vital role in Japan's economic and political development since
World War II.
Moreover the strategic and economic aspects of Japan's relations with the US
are deeply intwined. The nitty gritty of trade discussions have been
conducted within Japan's reliance upon the overarching framework of US
foreign policy. The strategic relationship between the US and Japan has
always been an important counterweight to growing friction over trade.
Not only is Europe's relationship with Japan less intense, it also largely
lacks the balance of this strategic political dimension. The Hague
declaration was an attempt to lay the foundations for such a relationship.
But it has not got very far according to an EC review of its relations with
Japan written in May this year. It said: 'Progress on political dialogue has
so far fallen short of expectations. There has been difficulty for reasons
of timing in keeping to the schedule of meetings and when they have taken
place they have shown that the dialogue between the Community and Japan
falls behind that between the Community and the US, whereas the two should
be more nearly on the same level.'
Senior officials at the Japanese foreign ministry regard an integrated
Europe as central to the architecture of a stable international order in the
wake of the end of the cold war. However, that recognition of the historic
significance of European integration will not be immediately reflected in
Japanese policy.
The EC and Japan have sharply differing approaches towards aid to Russia.
Japan insists it will not give bilateral aid until its dispute with Russia
over the Northern Territory islands off Japan's northern tip, is settled.
The intricacies of EC politics are not easy to follow from Tokyo. This
reflects cultural and practical difficulties.
Mr Seamus Gillespie, economic and financial counsellor at the EC embassy in
Tokyo remarked :'Japan is quite culturally and ethnically homogenous. It has
a quite centralised political system. It is difficult for the Japanese to
recognise the diversity and fertility of political forms within a
multinational Europe.'
Japan's approach is further complicated by the varying strength of its
bilateral relations with different EC member-states, in which the UK, the
main destination for recent Japanese manufacturing investment is often
presented as Japan's main friend in Europe. Some EC officials say Japan
still plays off member-states against one another, for instance over inward
investment into Europe when it needs to.
However, EC officials in Tokyo say the differences between member-states are
narrowing, policy-making is becoming more cohesive and, with it, the EC's
credibility in Japan is improving.
Mr Mark Bedingham, chairman of the European Business Council says: 'It can
often be laborious and time-consuming to gather a common EC view on trade
issues, first among industry and then getting it on to the Brussels agenda.
But the EC is now accepted as the central body for trade negotiations and
progress has been made in some important sectoral issues such as wines and
spirits, and pharmaceutical testing.'
The costs of a lack of well-developed strategic relationship and a machinery
to match it, could be cruelly exposed in the next few years because trade
tensions between the EC and Japan could worsen. Over the next decade, the
single European market could become as important to Japanese industry as the
North American market. However, Europe lacks both the political relationship
and the institutional machinery with Japan to deal effectively with growing
trade tensions.
Japan's trade surplus this year will grow to a record high and its surplus
with the EC is growing at a faster rate than with the US. The May review of
EC relations with Japan said the heart of the trade problem was 'the
structural obstacles which are currently the main barriers to doing business
in Japan, whether by exporting or by investing there. Although some progress
has been made through increase in infrastructure expenditure, more vigorous
enforcement of anti-trust legislation and some liberalisation of
distribution, the pace of structural reform remains frustratingly slow
despite declarations of intention by successive governments.'
The review identified the main problem as a failure of market mechanisms due
to 'ineffective competition policy, exclusive business practices, close and
often obscure relations between the public authorities and the private
sector and the over regulation of certain sectors.'
Concern over these issues has led the EC to adopt a much tougher formal
approach to monitoring its trade relations with the Japan, by comparing
market share for EC industries in Japan with their shares in comparable
third country markets. EC officials insist that as yet there is no
justification or reason for a European version of the structural impediments
initiative approach to trade launched by the US in 1989.
However, the EC is concerned that increasing bilateral trade negotiations
between the US and Japan may discriminate against European producers. If the
Japanese trade surplus grows next year while the European economic growth
slows the EC may come under pressure to adopt a more assertive approach to
trade.
The long hard slog may be about to become longer and harder than first
thought.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (8): How to win
trade success in Japan - Prominent European businesses are finding new ways
into a tough market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN moving to Japan can enjoy the familiarity of a wide range of
consumer brands that are well - known at home. German cars dominate the
import market and are everywhere on the streets of Tokyo. The Shell logo
hangs outside some 7,000 petrol stations around the country.
Yves Saint Laurent bags (and a host of look-alikes) hang from far more arms
in Tokyo than they do in Paris. Industrious shoppers can buy Alpen cereal,
and Body Shop cosmetics and browse for English imports at a local branch of
Harrods. Competing for the slot as the top recorded music store in town is
Virgin Megastores.
The Japanese market has a just reputation of being extremely hard to crack,
yet a number of prominent European companies - particularly those who have
been doing business in Japan for a long time - have blended into the local
business scene to a point where they are virtually indistinguishable from
the Japanese competition.
The oil industry is a case in point. The Royal Dutch/Shell group has been
operating in Japan as Shell Sekiyu for decades and in 1985 merged its
operation with Showa Oil. Shell now holds a 50 per cent stake in Showa Shell
Sekiyu, one of the most prominent retailers of petrol in the country, and by
far the most profitable refiner in an industry where profits are generally
terrible.
Its Formula Shell unleaded petrol proved a huge marketing hit in a country
where innovative products are easily sold at a premium. (Formula Shell was
withdrawn from markets elsewhere in the world because of possible problems
in the product's leaded variety.)
In short, Shell runs an integrated oil operation in Japan, including some
overseas exploration, that is virtually indistinguishable from Shell's local
operating companies elsewhere in the world.
Yet the virtues of getting in early, are well illustrated by British
Petroleum. BP has a corporate presence, a trading operation, and is active
in the chemicals business, but the costs and risks of trying to enter the
refining and retailing business virtually bar it from participating in one
of the most important oil markets in the world.
Trade statistics give a good indication of the sorts of industries where
European companies have made an impact. Of the Dollars 15.5bn in European
imports during the first half of the year, 11.3 per cent consisted of food
products; 19 per cent of chemicals and pharmaceuticals; 7.2 per cent of
textiles and clothing; and 14.6 per cent automobiles.
Aside from chemicals and pharmaceuticals - industrial products where
European companies often have a very clear technical and cost-of-production
edge - European companies have tended to establish themselves on the basis
of selling consumer goods that have a strong quality or fashion appeal.
Among the most successful companies are the German car makers -
Volkswagen/Audi, BMW, and Mercedes Benz - who together account for a
disproportionate 59 per cent share of the imported car market. They are
successful in part because of the many years they have devoted to burnishing
the image of their products.
Many educated Japanese will say that German cars offer superior engineering
and more precise handling, as well as more distinctive style, than their
Japanese counterparts even though consumers elsewhere in the world where
Japanese cars have gained large market share would plainly not agree.
VW and Audi together claimed 23 per cent of the market; BMW 16 per cent, and
Mercedes 17 per cent. German car sales have been hit by the downturn in the
market, particularly Volkswagen, which is in the process of ending a
long-standing agreement with its principal distributor, Yanase. Yet sales
declines have been roughly in line with the market, which was off 11.3 per
cent in the year to August, while sales of French cars fell by 27.5 per cent
and Italian cars by 28 per cent.
Peugot, which had a market share of just 1.56 per cent and saw sales
collapse by 46.6 per cent, has recently tied up with Inchcape, the British
international distribution and marketing service company, in an effort to
improve performance. Inchcape itself offers an interesting example of how to
get going in the Japanese market, as well as a distribution route for other
companies for whom costs of independent distribution are prohibitive.
Indeed, Inchcape has begun distributing some products for foreign companies
who have run afoul of Japanese joint venture partners.
'We've been here for a long time,' says Mr Paul Hobkinson, president and
group representative in Japan. 'We are substantially a Japanese company.'
Inchcape traces its first involvement in Japan to 1982. It now has a staff
of about 1,500, only six of which are expatriate, and three of which have
regional responsibility. Mr Hobkinson says longevity has several advantages.
It helps when recruiting Japanese staff, who wonder whether their employer
will be around not just next year, but when retirement comes. It even helps
with the rent, where landlords often charge far below market rates to
long-time tenants. As a long-time player, Inchcape is well integrated into
Japan's complex distribution network, where contacts and detailed knowledge
are key to success.
Inchcape likes to handle products where it can carve out a substantial and
secure market share. Inchcape, for example, introduced the first beer kegs
into the Japanese market, which was dominated by bottles, and now has a
majority market share. It handles Domino commercial ink jet machines, which
take about 25 per cent of the market after Hitachi's 35 per cent share.
It handles a range of other well-known products such as Royal Doulton, Mars
Pet Foods and Filofax.
For many companies, however, being in Japan is more than a marketing
opportunity. Worldwide, Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has embarked
on a worldwide restructuring and refocusing of the business, but this has
involved expansion and greater commitment in Japan. It was, after all, the
success of the Japanese consumer electronics companies that has in part led
to Philips current financial difficulties. Philips has a high reputation
among its competitors for technology and innovation but a low profile among
consumers. Mr Hendrikus Hoksbergen, who run's Philips operations in Japan,
says: 'When you can meet the competition in Japan, you can meet it
anywhere.'
Philips launched Digital Compact Cassette, its newest audio product, in
Japan before anywhere else in the world.
Mr Hoksbergen says Philips must be active in Japan because of the large
consumer market and the fact that Japan is the place where trends in
consumer electronics, fashion and technology are being set. Philips also has
plunged itself into the complex web of parts suppliers that has been an
underlying strength of the Japanese industry.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (10): Long-term
commitment - Case Study, Hoechst chemicals and pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Hoechst, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, set up its
Japanese arm in 1953, Japan was not yet the industrial power known today,
and was largely seen as only a consumer market.
However, the expansion of Japanese industries in the past decade has forced
Hoechst to change its strategy drastically, and the country's automobile and
electronics industries have now become some of Hoechst's most important
business partners.
'At a global group seminar in 1980, there was no talk about Japan,' recalls
Mr Horst Waesche, president of Hoechst Japan. 'But later, when Japan became
our competitors, we were suddenly asking ourselves: what are we going to do
in Japan?'
Hoechst found that its longstanding relationship with the Japanese market
and the familiarity of its name, made things easier in penetrating into the
corporate relationships.
Sales at the Hoechst Japan group have grown to Y174.9bn - up 66 per cent
from 1987 - and it holds a big market share in areas where it entered
earlier.
For example, Hoechst has a 25 per cent market share in the agrochemical and
herbicides market, while the company boasts a 30 per cent share in high
performance pigments.
However, the need to transform its operations in Japan from that of a
pharmaceuticals and chemicals trading company to a serious manufacturer,
supplying leading automobile and electronics makers, has not been an easy
task.
The company's basic strategy has been to build extensive production and
research and development facilities, establish alliances with leading
Japanese companies, and become suppliers to Japanese companies both in Japan
and abroad.
Hoechst has spent Y80bn in the last five years on capital investments,
including Y3.7bn on its new chemical plant north of Tokyo, completed in
1991. It has also decided to invest Y2bn for a new plant for fibre
production. Some 40 per cent of Hoechst's products sold in Japan are
currently produced locally.
In 1991, Hoechst and Mitsubishi Kasei, the leading chemical concern, agreed
to co-operate in the development and production of polyethylene film, a move
following a dyestuff joint venture between the two companies set up in the
late 1960s.
Mr Waesche brushes off worries over the current slowdown in the Japanese
economy as short term, describing the symptoms as just a readjustment phase.
'Japanese companies are still making far larger profits than European
companies,' he says, predicting solid growth in the years following a
recovery.
Instead, Hoescht has longer-term prospects in mind. The company's
pharmaceutical research laboratories will probably not show returns this
century. Mr Waesche reckons that the long-term commitment is what counts.
The company was also listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's foreign section in
late 1991. The move came when trading on the TSE had slumped, prompting
foreign companies to review the necessity of a Tokyo listing.
Last September, five international companies including General Motors of the
US, Philips Electronics and News Corporation formally applied for delisting
due to the high costs and administrative burden in spite of a sharp decline
in their local shareholders.
Mr Waesche says he was surprised by the delistings, and adds that the
listing is essential for their international profile, especially for
recruiting skilled personnel.
Moreover, Japan will become more important due to the growth potential of
China. Japanese manufacturing companies are already moving into China by
setting up production plants. Mr Waesche says the significant role of
Japanese industries in China's industrial growth provides great business
potential for Hoechst as well.
Despite claims of unfair business practices among Japanese companies, Mr
Waesche points out that if a foreign company can provide competitive
products, there is no discrimination - 'once you are in, things are fine.
The important thing is to establish yourself inside the system.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and The European Community (9): Fears over
long-term impact - Japanese concern over Maastricht treaty rows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNCERTAINTY generated by the rows over the Maastricht treaty have
prompted executives at many Japanese-owned companies to be more outspoken
than usual over political issues.
In Britain in particular, the most popular target for Japanese investment,
companies are concerned that the bridge into the rest of the European
community may be weakened. Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, said
last week that final ratification of the Maastrict treaty would be delayed
until after a second Danish referendum next May.
Most Japanese-owned companies in Britain, contacted by the Financial Times,
believe a division within countries over the Maastricht treaty could damage
their businesses in the long term. They said their immediate business plans
would not be affected, but that countries should move closer to each other,
especially over the single market and single currency.
Mr Kazumi Ueda, managing director of County Durham bearings maker NSK, said:
'The UK and other governments are being hasty in pushing it (the Maastricht
treaty) through. A rejection would cause confusion for a short time (and) in
the long term the treaty should be approved.'
Other companies expressed their concerns more cautiously. Toyota, the car
maker whose Derbyshire plant starts production next month, said: 'The single
market and stability are more important than votes in parliament.'
More than two-thirds of production from the new Toyota plant will be
exported to the Continent. The company said many people had assumed the fall
in the value of sterling after the currency left the Exchange Rate Mechanism
would improve profitability. But much of the gain was lost because half the
components are to be imported from the Continent.
Sony, Britain's biggest manufacturer and exporter of televisions, from its
factories in South Wales, said: 'The Maastricht treaty represents the
willingness of national authorities to consider Europe as a single entity.
We welcome the idea of a single currency to simplify transactions between
member-states.'
Another large consumer electronics company, which did not want to comment
officially, said: 'The UK's economic position continues to deteriorate. It
is important for Britain to move at the same pace as the rest of Europe.'
Meanwhile, Honda, one of the newer arrivals from Japan, is investing Pounds
370m in its Swindon car plant - 'part of the reason for our growth is that
we now have an effective European headquarters (in Britain). But there will
be no effect on our business plans either way the vote goes.'
Not all Japanese-owned companies were worried at the possibility of
disruptions to the progress of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Elfed Lewis, president of North Yorkshire car radiator-manufacturer ND
Marston, owned by Nippondenso, is sanguine - 'we have been trading in Europe
for more than 10 years and the vote won't affect us very much,' he added.
Much of the production is exported to Volkswagen and Volvo among others, and
a single currency would nevertheless help, said Mr Lewis.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (4): Key lessons
to be learned - Japan-EC trade relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese motor manufacturer, leapt in 1991 to become Britain's
14th largest exporter: 90 per cent of the cars built in its new UK plant are
exported. It is playing a lead role - along with Toyota and Honda - in
transforming the UK from a significant net importer of cars to a large net
exporter.
The strategic investments by Japanese car manufacturers in the UK over the
past two years provide some striking insights into the EC's trade
relationship with Japan. UK car imports fell 10 per cent in 1990, and a
further 31 per cent last year. At the same time, exports leapt 20 per cent
in 1990 and a further 21 per cent last year.
The UK produces 400,000 more cars today than it did in 1984. Nissan alone
spent Pounds 450m on supplies in 1991 - Pounds 350m of them coming from
other UK companies. The trend will be magnified in 1993, when cars start
rolling off production lines at Honda's plant in Swindon, and Toyota's
Derbyshire factory.
The evidence is clear: Japanese investment is playing a critical role in
transforming a once-moribund British motoring industry. It has boosted
competition across Europe, forcing other manufacturers to improve quality.
Yet Japan, perhaps more than any other country, raises Europe's
protectionist hackles. It is the hapless target of 150 import quotas, and of
an average of 40 anti-dumping investigations every year. Products affected
range from photocopiers and videos to toys, colour televisions and ball
bearings.
Behind this pressure from European industry for protection is a
steadily-mounting trade surplus in Japan's favour. Exports to the EC rose
from Dollars 54bn in 1990 to Dollars 59.6bn in 1991, while imports from the
EC fell from more than Dollars 35bn in 1990 to Dollars 32bn in 1991 -
leading to a visible trade balance in Japan's favour of Dollars 27.6bn.
In the face of persistent complaints by 'big industry' in Europe that Japan
'dumps' products by using 'predatory pricing policies', the European
Commission has bowed again and again to demands for protection.
Sometimes 'countervailing duties' are imposed. In other instances
'voluntary' restraint agreements are reached under which Japanese exporters
informally accept limits on the volume of products sold into the EC.
At the same time, European exporters complain that Japan's domestic market
is impenetrable. They cite arcane distribution networks, informal agreements
between vertically-integrated 'families' of Japanese companies, and close
collaboration between Japanese companies and the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti).
Objective evidence in support of either kind of complaint is hard to find,
however. In the words of a recent report on Japan by the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 'there is
little evidence to support the contention that import impediments imposed by
the (Japanese) government are a decisive factor in Japan's trade surpluses.'
Similarly, the global trade watchdog, the Geneva-based General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, concluded in its most recent study of Japan's trading
practices that industrial groupings and local distribution practices 'may be
less important than is often claimed.'
Using much more robust language, Mr Phillip Oppenheim, in his new book
'Trade Wars', argues that 'trade barriers in Japan have been, and are,
exaggerated, often for self-serving reasons.'
He attacks European industrialists who lobby Brussels for protection as 'a
pretty cossetted bunch of professional scapegoat-seekers.'
Similar conclusions are reached by Mr Walter Eltis, director general of
Britain's National Economic Development Office (Nedo) in a detailed study of
the impact of recent Japanese trade and investment on British industry.
Drawing parallels with Japan's impact on the UK car industry, Mr Eltis
recalls the collapse in the 1980s of Europe's colour TV industry in the face
of Japanese competition. His evidence shows that producers like Philips or
Thorn may have suffered, but that consumers and workers alike benefited.
While production by British-owned companies ground to a halt in 1988, the UK
is now home for 18 of the 32 Japanese TV-manufacturing plants in Europe. A
long-standing trade deficit in colour TV sets has been transformed, with the
UK earning a Pounds 446m surplus in 1991.
'Today's mainly Japanese-owned industry is sufficiently competitive to make
a very considerable net contribution to the balance of payments when the
previous British-owned companies had entirely failed to achieve the price
and quality standards set by international competition,' he notes.
In parallel with Japan's growing trade surplus with Europe has been the
ten-fold growth in Japanese investment over the decade, largely driven by
the creation of Europe's single market on January 1 1993. After peaking at
over Dollars 67bn in in 1989, Japan's direct investment settled to Dollars
45bn in 1990, lifting the cumulative total to more than Dollars 250bn.
While almost 80 per cent of Japanese investment has been in
non-manufacturing areas like banking and insurance, the residual 20 per cent
has generated an estimated 94,000 jobs in 500 plants across the EC  - almost
all opened since 1985, and at an 'infant' stage where significant further
expansion is expected.
The UK has been the prime target for Japanese investment, partly for reasons
of language, regional incentives, and the role of the city of London, but
significantly because of the British government's positive support for
investment. In allowing wholly-Japanese-owned plants on green field sites,
the UK government has enabled Japanese manufacturers to import
state-of-the-art technologies, and labour relations unsullied by entrenched
trade union practices.
One can argue therefore that within the EC, Britain has perhaps been the
main beneficiary of trade and investment relations with Japan. Investment
has helped to speed industrial restructuring, and has begun to create new
industry attitudes to the concept of quality.
Although Europe's trade and investment relationship with Japan has generated
much political heat, it is important to provide perspective by emphasising
how comparatively small a part Europe continues to play as a destination of
Japanese goods or investment. According to data compiled by Mr Jocelyn
Probert at Insead's Euro-Asia Centre in France, Japan in 1991 accounted for
2 per cent of the EC's exports, while just 5 per cent of the EC's imports
came from Japan.
The EC accounts for only 6 per cent of Japan's foreign investment, and in
1990 attracted just a quarter of the Japanese investment flowing into the
US. This occurred at a time when the EC was the world's leading recipient of
investment, accounting for almost 45 per cent of global investment flows in
1990. Needless to say, the US remains Europe's biggest source of investment.
A number of recent developments also suggest Japanese investment flows to
Europe will slip back in the mid-1990s:
Investment linked with 'strategic positioning' ahead of creation of the
single market is now mostly in place.
Recession in Europe means that most recently-built Japanese plants have more
than enough capacity to cope with foreseeable demand.
The bursting of the 'bubble economy' in Japan means that many of Japan's
strongest foreign investors are hard-pressed, more inclined to pull in horns
rather than add to investments overseas.
Higher Japanese interest rates mean investment capital is more expensive
today than it was throughout the 1980s.
Whatever the likely trend for the immediate future, the fact of the 1980s
has been that Japan has emerged to play a significant role in the EC, both
as an exporter and an investor. Most reliable evidence suggests that Europe
is gaining more from this relationship than it is losing - whatever the
special pleading of protected European manufacturers.
The best strategy for the 1990s must therefore be, in Mr Eltis's words, 'to
have the Japanese firmly inside Europe as role models for others to learn
from . . . and learn with the greatest possible rapidity.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (5): Time for
rigorous assessment - Investment in manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN CONTRAST to the 1980s, a decade that witnessed a frantic rush by Japanese
companies to invest in the European Community, the 1990s are characterised
by a more cautious approach by the Japanese to investment in the region.
The change reflects both the end of the first big wave of Japanese
investment in the EC and the different economic climate in which Japanese
corporations are finding themselves as business activity in leading world
markets, including their home market, has remained depressed.
The number of new Japanese manufacturing investments in Europe has fallen
from that in the previous year, according to a survey of Japanese
manufacturers conducted by the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro)
earlier this year.
After increasing by more than 100 each year since 1988, the Jetro survey
found that the number of manufacturing companies with Japanese
capitalisation of at least 10 per cent in 19 EC and EFTA nations rose by
just 69 last year.
While the increase still represents an 11 per cent rise from 652 to 721, the
pace has clearly slowed.
The fall in new investments comes despite the growing importance of the EC
as a market in the eyes of Japanese executives.
It is not that Japanese companies are turning their backs on Europe but
rather that most Japanese companies with an interest in setting up business
in the EC have done so already.
At the same time, the recession combined with the serious cracks that have
emerged within the EC months before the single market is set to start and
the political turmoil in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, have
all contributed to a feeling that growth for growth's sake may not be the
most sensible strategy.
Recessionary pressures, for example, have thwarted the plans of some medium-
and smaller-sized companies which had planned to invest in Europe after
setting up in the US, according to Mr Masao Kobayashi at Jetro.
The latest trend in Japanese activity in the EC is therefore not so much for
investment by newcomers but for a more rigorous assessment by companies
already located in the EC of their long-term plans for Europe.
This reassessment has brought about an interesting pattern of activity among
Japanese companies in the region.
On the one hand, there has been a strong rise in recapitalisation by
Japanese corporations in areas where they expect to see market growth.
At the same time, however, many Japanese companies are busy restructuring
their European businesses to create greater efficiencies and a better
co-ordinated regional operation. Here, the trigger seems to be the economic
downturn rather than any immediate developments arising from the impending
single European market.
Among the companies Jetro surveyed, more than 73 per cent have undergone or
are undergoing recapitalisation. The reasons for doing so vary from the need
to expand production or modernise facilities to diversification into new
fields.
NEC, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, for example, recently
announced it would invest Pounds 9m on a sophisticated order processing
system in its semiconductor manufacturing plant in Livingston, Scotland,
where the company has been located for 10 years.
The trend indicates that in some areas, expectations among Japanese
executives for the European single market have remained high despite the
current economic weakness of the region.
Meanwhile, the world recession that is slashing the profits of corporate
Japan has led to a greater awareness of the need to rationalise operations
in the region.
Toshiba's Europe Office in London, for example, is currently busy
considering ways in which the operations of 37 Toshiba companies in 11
European countries can be rationalised.
These Toshiba companies in the EC were set up over the years according to
the different needs of each division. As a result, there are many areas of
business that overlap and could be combined for greater efficiency.
'Until now, as long as sales increased it was still alright that there were
so many separate Toshiba companies each with their own staff for various
functions, such as advertising,' says Mr Yuji Wakayama, general manager of
corporate communications at the Europe Office in London.
The recession, however, has changed all that and the group is considering
restructuring some manufacturing facilities as well, although no specific
plans have been announced yet.
One step in that direction that has already been taken was to combine some
of the functions of the PC sales companies in Belgium and Holland as neither
country is large enough as a market to justify the presence of independent
sales companies.
Another aim of the Europe Office is to co-ordinate European activities,
advise on future strategies and become the corporate 'face' of Toshiba in
Europe. Before the new office was established, the group as a whole was not
represented as each business division had its own European headquarters in
various cities.
Toshiba is not alone is trying to restructure its European operations.
Other Japanese corporations are studying the possibility of relocating their
European headquarters for various strategic reasons, according to Mr Haruo
Ohtsuki, executive consultant in the international markets group at KPMG
Peat Marwick, the management consultancy.
For example, more companies are expressing an interest in taking advantage
of different corporation tax levels that exist in different countries within
the EC, Mr Ohtsuki notes.
Nevertheless, the most widespread response among Japanese companies to the
approach of the single European market has been to quicken the pace of
localisation of their operations.
Asked what steps they were taking to prepare for the single market, over
half of the respondents to the Jetro survey cited localisation of business
activities by increasing employment of local staff and activities to benefit
their local communities. There is also great interest in the goings-on in
Brussels and some Japanese companies have taken moves to help them to better
deal with the Commission.
A keen concern among Japanese companies is how the Community's relationship
with its eastern neighbours develops amid the political unrest in eastern
Europe and volatile situation in Russia. They are looking forward with great
expectations - and fingers crossed - to the birth of a huge market spanning
not just the European Community but all the way to the Russian steppes.
In the meantime, there could be more restructurings if the business climate
remains weak. But Jetro believes that once economic activity picks up, there
is plenty of room for new investments in the EC, particularly by medium to
small-sized companies.
At the end of March 1991, Japanese investment in Europe amounted to only
22.5 per cent of total Japanese investment overseas, compared with 43.3 per
cent invested in the US, according to the ministry of finance. The figures
indicate that Japanese investment in Europe has not seen its full potential
yet, Jetro concludes.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (3): A painful
period - Banking and financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese banker looked at me sheepishly. 'You know,' he said hesitantly,
'this is not a very good time to be writing about us.'
Indeed, this is a painful period for Japanese bankers and securities
companies in Europe. The high-flying 1980s, when easy money enabled them to
grab big shares in the Euromarkets and launch bold forays into some European
domestic financial markets, are over.
The collapse of the Japanese stock market has stripped the brokers of their
most important profit stream and undermined the capital bases of most large
banks. The slump in the Japanese economy has forced most industrial
companies to slash their capital spending budgets and, consequently, to
cancel the Eurobond issues that many used to finance them.
As a result of all these factors, both banks and securities companies have
been forced to tone down their activity in Europe. This can be seen in the
slide of the Japanese banks and brokers from the Euromarket league tables
and the retreat of the Japanese banks from the interbank market. In London,
for example, they account for only 30 per cent of the interbank market now,
compared with 38 per cent at the peak three years ago.
'We all have to be more conservative in building assets,' says Mr Tomonori
Naruse, senior managing director for Europe of Bank of Tokyo in London.
There is, of course, nothing that Japanese organisations hate more than
slowing down or admitting defeat. Until recently, they clung to the status
quo, insisting that they had made long term commitments and hoping
desperately that market conditions would improve. But by the middle of this
year, it became clear that, with continuing weak conditions at home, there
was no alternative but to cut back abroad - 'it is still not as drastic a
retreat as that of some US companies,' Mr Seiichi Takeda, senior
vice-president of Nomura Europe in London, says.
Last month, Nomura in London announced that it would retreat from market
making in London of all European equities and several UK ones, causing some
50 redundancies from its 600 staff.
That was the first big cutback in London but others had already taken place
in Zurich where Japanese banks and brokers have had an extraordinarily high
profile. Until recently, there were no fewer than 42 Japanese financial
institutions registered in Switzerland, reflecting the high volume of
Eurobond issues that used to be done for Japanese companies on the Swiss
franc market. Last month, Chuo Trust and Banking, the trust bank, announced
that it had closed its Zurich subsidiary in response to poor trading
conditions, and would concentrate its European activities in London and
Brussels.
Chuo was the third Japanese financial company to shut its Zurich office this
year, the others being Ryoko Securities and Yamatane Securities. Japanese
bankers in the city say none of their number are making profits at the
moment, so a few more could follow in the next few months. Nomura's Swiss
subsidiary announced two weeks ago that it was closing its Basle branch. All
of this is happening when there is, at least in theory, a rationale for
financial institutions rationalising their operations in Europe. Next year,
with the creation of the single market in the 12 EC countries and its
extension to the seven countries in the European Free Trade Association, any
financial institution that has a licence in one of the 19 should be allowed
to operate in all the others. Chuo Trust, for example, expects to be able to
continue to operate in the Swiss capital markets from its Brussels office.
In fact, however, complete harmonisation is probably still a long way away.
France and Germany, for example, still do not allow financial institutions
domiciled in other countries to be in the primary dealer group for
securities issues, and they are showing no signs of being willing to change
that stance. And while there is at least an EC banking directive that
provides the framework for pan-European banking, the investment services
directive that would do the same for securities and fund management is not
expected to surface until the end of next year. As a result, Switzerland
last month said that it too would continue to insist after January 1 that
lead managers of Swiss franc issues have a domicile in Switzerland.
Thus, it looks as if there could be a rather brutal shakeout in the next few
months, with the weaker Japanese institutions realising they have no future
in Europe, while the strongest doggedly maintain their offices throughout
Europe and, in a few cases, may even expand.
Nomura's Mr Takeda, for example, makes clear that the group's policy remains
to have an independent presence in each of the leading European countries -
'there are still a lot of peculiarities in individual country markets, so
penetration of the European market really means penetration into each
country,' he says. Another problem is that as long as taxation systems are
not harmonised, it will continue to be difficult to transfer capital and
profits easily among European units.
Among leading Japanese banks, the accent is on rationalisation and on
developing off balance sheet business after being wounded by bad loans to
some of the spectacular bankruptcies in Europe. Japanese bankers say that
branches in some less important cities could be reduced to representative
offices. One ray of light is that the Japanese ministry of finance is likely
from next year to allow them to lead manage Eurobond issues for Japanese
companies. But it is a thin ray because it merely means that there will be
more competition for the reduced amount of business around.
Bank of Tokyo is, ironically, an exception in still thinking of expansion,
this year having upgraded its representative office in Vienna to a branch
and opened an office in Moscow.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (2): Big stake in
EC's future - Japan's relations with the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL crisis in the European Community over the future of the
Maastricht treaty has alarmed few countries more than Japan.
Whatever its faults, Maastricht seemed to offer a degree of stability and
predictability to Japan's relations with the EC. Now that the fate of the
treaty hangs in the balance, the Community faces a prolonged period of
debilitating uncertainty. This is a prospect which worries the Japanese
almost as much as the Europeans themselves.
Japan's cumulative investment in the EC amounts to more than Dollars 55bn.
Although this represents less than half the Japanese investment in the US,
it still marks a hefty stake in the Community's future. By the end of the
decade, it is quite conceivable that the European market will become as
important to Japanese industry as the American.
But Japanese concerns extend beyond measuring business confidence. The big
question is whether a Europe increasingly preoccupied by crisis management
and recession will become more introverted, more nationalist, and less
predisposed to foreign competitors, particularly Japan. Two years ago, the
prevailing mood was much more optimistic. Despite enduring tensions over
trade, fears about a Fortress Europe constructed around the 1992 Single
Market programme had largely dissipated as tentative efforts got underway to
build a broader relationship between the Community and Japan.
This process led to the joint declaration in the Hague in July 1991 which
for the first time attempted to treat Japan and the EC as two economic
superpowers seeking a more mature relationship, rather than petty rivals
squabbling over their respective shares of the European car market.
An EC report submitted to the European Council last spring summed up the new
approach: 'Both (Japan and the EC) are in many ways at a similar stage of
taking up their responsibilities on the world stage, Japan because it is
searching for ways of translating its economic power into political
influence, the Community because it is adopting through the European Union
institutions and mechanisms to enable it to play a stronger foreign policy
role.'
The gap between aspirations and reality is a common theme in the development
of the EC. Recent examples include the EC's dilatory response to the Gulf
crisis and the painful divisions in Community ranks provoked by the civil
war in Yugoslavia.
Since the Hague declaration, high-level contacts have taken place in areas
such as the environment, development aid, science and technology and, more
improbably, 'Japan-EC' industrial co-operation - including training for 50
to 60 young European executives to spend 18 months in Japan to learn the
language for one year and receive six months training in Japanese companies.
The most striking example of co-operation occurred earlier this year when,
much to the surprise of the US, the EC and Japan joined forces at the World
Environment conference in Rio, Brazil. American fears that this amounted to
a new Brussels-Tokyo axis were premature; but as a senior Japanese diplomat
noted, the Rio summit showed that Japan was willing, under certain
circumstances, to step out of line with the US and play ball with the
Europeans.
The Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty last June has led to a
fundamental change in atmosphere. The image of a European super-state,
dominated by German industry and French technocracy skills has crumbled. In
the new mood of Eurocentrism, there is obviously a risk that the single most
important aspect of EC-Japan relations - trade - will come back to the fore.
In 1991, Japan's trade surplus with the EC rose to Dollars 27.4bn, an
increase of 48 per cent. Japan explained this politically sensitive increase
in three ways: a rise in exports to Germany due to an upsurge consumer
demand in former East Germany; the increase in the value of the yen; and,
most worrying, a decrease in Japan's imports of luxury goods due to the end
of the consumer spending boom and the collapse in asset values and real
estate.
However valid these explanations may be, the trade imbalance has once again
focused attention in Brussels on the lack of market access in Japan, above
all 'structural obstacles' to trade. This has led to renewed debate on how
best to prise open the Japanese market. One option is to build on the
EC-Japan deal on Japanese cars in the single European market, tentatively
called 'Elements of Consensus'. Under the still secret agreement, both sides
have attempted to address the central issues of the level of Japanese
transplant production in Europe and what share the European and Japanese
motor industries should have in the European market's future growth, or,
crucially, what share they should have in any decline in demand.
The deal is far from water-tight, notably in its failure to secure any
commitment from Japan to limit the production of Japanese cars in Europe,
and the lack of clarity concerning how Brussels and Tokyo might share future
EC car market growth and decline. But it still marks a clear step in the
direction of managed trade, based on an effort to calculate future trends in
the market.
Thus, EC officials are now looking at other European goods to check their
performance in Japan and other foreign markets to establish more persuasive
evidence on structural barriers to trade. Separately, they are reviewing the
EC's own commercial instruments such as anti-dumping mechanisms as well as
the US approach based on the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII).
Few officials in Brussels rate SII as an unqualified success; but they look
enviously at the way in which SII addresses systemic barriers across all
sectors of the economy, an intrusive approach which focuses nevertheless on
matters that generally have a long time horizon such as the scope of
exclusionary business practices in Japan, the distribution system, land use
and the savings-investment gap.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (1): Evidence of
growing goodwill - Ian Rodger highlights efforts towards political and
economic co-operation between Tokyo and Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW months ago, a Japanese tourist, one of thousands who each year ride
the famous cog railway to the Jungfraujoch high in the Bernese alps, was
horrified to discover a frenzy of Japanese graffiti scrawled on the rocky
peak.
Looking closely, he even discovered the signature of the deputy mayor of his
native town of Kurobe, and when he got home he complained. The deputy mayor
admitted his crime and offered to pay for the clean up.
Responding in kind, the Bernese said they were touched by the offer, but
they welcomed Japanese visitors and did not mind having to clean off the
graffiti every few years themselves.
It was a small incident, but it would be nice to think that it is
representative of a growing goodwill between Japanese and European peoples.
Goodwill was massively present during the memorable Japan Festival in
Britain last autumn, and other European countries are now trying to set up
similar festivals.
It also seems to be reflected in efforts in the past few years to deepen and
strengthen political and institutional relations between Tokyo and Brussels.
Japan and Europe certainly have many good reasons to get to know each other
better. They are both emerging global powers, struggling to find roles in
the post cold war world order, and sharing the frustrations of operating in
the shadow of the US. They also share anxiety about the future of their
giant but crippled mutual neighbour, Russia.
Thanks to a large and growing volume of industrial investment in each
other's territory, they both have a big interest in each other's economic
health. And Japanese industrialists have been prominent among those
monitoring closely the drama over the Maastricht treaty (see pages 2 and 4).
While bilateral cultural links have not been as strong as those that each
has with the US, there is nevertheless a deeply rooted base. A legacy of
European influence on Japan's entry into the modern world in the second half
of the 19th century is still widely present in Japanese language and
customs.
An X-ray in Japanese is a rentogen (from Rontgen, its German inventor), a
ski slope is a gelande. The transliteration of English sounds into Japanese
characters is based on British pronunciation, not American.
Nevertheless, the relationship has remained superficial, dogged by
misunderstandings and mistrust at the official level and plagued by
stereotyping at the popular level.
A recent study of British newspapers' treatment of Japan found that the
popular papers still concentrate on war atrocity and 'funny Jap' stories. In
France, senior politicians could, until recently, score popular points by
making insulting remarks about Japanese.
Similarly, many Japanese still hold simplistic and patronising views of
Europeans as self-satisfied and lazy custodians of art galleries and baroque
palaces.
Until the late 1980s, official contacts between Japan and European countries
were, as with almost all of Japan's external relationships, essentially one
dimensional, concerned only with trade and economic relations.
The conditions for change were set in the aftermath of the Plaza revaluation
of the yen in 1985 when Japan's economic superpower status came to be
recognised for what it was. Japanese leaders gradually began to accept - and
in rare cases, to covet - a greater role in world affairs.
In a landmark speech at the Mansion House in London in May, 1988, Mr Noboru
Takeshita, the then Japanese prime minister, declared that the era of US
domination of the West was over and that a structure of joint leadership by
the 'trilateral partners,' as he called the US, western Europe and Japan,
was emerging.
'There is an imperative need for effective and balanced co-operation, both
politically and economically, between the trilateral partners,' he said. 'It
cannot be denied, however, that the relations between Japan and Europe,
which form one side of the triangle, have not been close enough, compared
with the other two sides.'
Today, few would dispute that progress in building closer relations between
Japan and Europe has been disappointly modest. It has often seemed that the
EC was dragging its feet, but Mr Peter Ludlow of the Centre for European
Policy Studies in Brussels puts most of the blame on the Japanese - 'the
number of common issues Japan is willing to talk about is rather limited,'
he says.
IN November, 1990, following the signing of a comprehensive bilateral accord
between the US and the EC, Tokyo proposed that a similar treaty be
negotiated between the EC and Japan. Brussels agreed, but negotiations were
tortuous.
Tokyo tried to take the high road, seeing the treaty as a way to set up
frameworks for regular contacts on political and strategic matters and for
cultural and scientific exchanges. But the EC wanted to insert clauses
requiring Japan to open its markets and to agree that both sides would seek
'a balance of benefits' from the relationship.
In the wake of the signing of the Joint Declaration in July, 1991, the EC
has certainly not restrained its tendency to pursue trade issues.
Last year, Japanese exporters were the subject of six definitive
anti-dumping decisions, compared with only three in 1990. Also, after years
of testy negotiations, the EC won agreement to restrict Japanese car imports
until 1999.
On the political front, however, little has been achieved, and with each
side more and more preoccupied with problems in its own region, there is
little prospect of further progress at the moment.
As Mr Tomohiko Kobayashi, Japan's ambassador to the EC, acknowledged in an
interview for this survey. 'At this point, we cannot do very spectacular
things.'
It would be wrong to be too disappointed about this state of affairs. The
triangle, which has become an oft quoted symbol of the need for building up
the EC-Japan relationship, is probably too ambitious a representation of the
possibilities.
Neither side is yet willing or perhaps able to threaten its relationship
with the US to strengthen their bilateral ties. And each has security and
foreign policy priorities elsewhere - the EC in eastern Europe, Japan in
east Asia - that for the foreseeable future are likely to rank ahead of
their bilateral relationship.
Meanwhile, however, contacts at the individual, corporate and institutional
levels are multiplying and deepening. For example, more than 200 Japanese
owned companies now carry out research and development activities in the EC.
Exchanges of managers, professionals, teachers and students, not to mention
tourists, have mushroomed in the past decade.
All of which should, like the gesture of the deputy mayor of Kurobe, help to
build the goodwill upon which a stronger political relationship can
eventually be established.

FT  13 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Building sector supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were no real shocks for a building and contracting sector already
primed to expect positive moves in the Autumn Statement. The building
sectors have been outperforming the wider market since the prime minister
outlined the government's strategy for growth last month.
Commenting on confirmation of the go-ahead for the Jubilee Line extension
and the expanded road building programme, a specialist at one of the leading
London broking firms said he expected the market might well be slightly
disappointed at the outcome. Among the building material groups, Redland
picked up 8 to 387p, Rugby 5 to 218p and RMC 13 to 515p.
The Jubilee extension go-ahead gave a big boost to John Mowlem, with its big
exposure to Docklands, and left the shares 6 higher at 89p. The move also
lifted Costain 1 1/2 to 31p and George Wimpey 4 to 106p. Other contractors
to move sharply higher included Alfred McAlpine, 15 better at 135p, and
Higgs &amp; Hill, which put on 2 1/2 at 45p.
Housebuilders were broadly higher, responding to the cut in interest rates.
Wilson Bowden jumped 19 to 339p, additionally helped by their inclusion in
the influential County-30 list of best buys. Bryant, the Midlands-based
housebuilder, gained 4 at 85p after the company's pension scheme sold a
block of 2.54m shares at 93p apiece. Most of the stock was quickly placed in
the market at 94p. A further block of 750,000 Bryant shares was crossed at
94p.
BTR hit
Industrial conglomerate BTR was an early exception to a very firm market as
securities house Kleinwort Benson took a harsh look at its previous profit
forecasts for the group. Coincidentally, BTR's share price had achieved an
all-time high on Wednesday.
Kleinwort analyst Mr Andrew Hollins refused to comment on figures being
quoted by rivals, but there was a strong belief that he had cut his 1992
profits estimate to Pounds 984m from Pounds 1.03bn and, more significantly,
his 1993 forecast to some Pounds 1.035bn from Pounds 1.15bn.
This year's figure was within the current range of estimates but next year's
is below most forecasts. Kleinwort is believed to have revised its view
after having seen trading figures for September. However, many felt the 1993
estimate was unnecessarily low considering the positive effect of currency
movements on a group that earns 40 per cent of its profits in Australia and
the US.
Also, the house reached its decision without talking to the company and BTR
was said to be 'unhappy' at the situation, particularly as it has been
talking extensively to other analysts recently. BTR shares closed 12 1/2
down at 494 1/2 p with 4.9m traded.
Shell acclaimed
Shell Transport's third-quarter results found widespread acclaim and the
shares raced higher in heavy trading. Replacement cost profits of Pounds
824m were well in excess of a comparable Pounds 523m and the market
forecasts which ranged from Pounds 575m to Pounds 685m. At their best Shell
touched 553p, before slipping to end a busy session a net 12 higher at 549p.
Turnover was a hefty 9.5m shares.
Many analysts said the results were boosted by various items. At County
NatWest, Mr Fergus Macleod said: 'The more I looked, the less impressed I
was; 30 per cent of the profits came from non-operating earnings. The shares
look expensive.' Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court described Shell shares
as 'very good value for the long-term', and pointed out that the company had
reduced net debt by Pounds 750m during the quarter, leaving gearing at only
5 per cent.
Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said Shell's figures 'continue to
vindicate our long term recommendation to switch out of BP into Shell; they
show how much stronger a company it is compared with BP.' The latter edged
up 2 to 238p on 9.5m traded.
Gloomy comments at a lunch with its broker prompted a sharp fall for the
share price of Arjo Wiggins Appleton. The stock dropped 10 to 156p - one of
the biggest percentage falls in London yesterday - as the post-prandial mood
leaked into the market.
Arjo executives told broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew that when it decided to cut
its dividend two months ago it had done so on an 18-month view of life not
getting any easier. Also, the UBS media team, which has the stock as a
'hold' recommendation, is believed to be reconsidering its current forecast
of Pounds 185m for 1992.
A strong set of final figures from Burton sent the shares smartly forward,
but left analysts sharply divided over the future prospects of the
recovering stores group.
Revised profits forecasts for next year ranged from Pounds 15m (Kleinwort
Benson) to Pounds 32 1/2 m (Nomura), with bears of the stock still wary of
the group's ability to deliver sustained profits growth, given its recent
track record.
County NatWest turned from a seller to a short-term hold of the stock,
welcoming the improved sales growth and maintained dividend. However,
analyst Ms Kimlan Cook said the long-term performance of the shares remained
in doubt. 'Burton still has a long way to go before it achieves an
acceptable return on sales,' she added.
The stock, which was the most heavily traded yesterday, jumped 11 to 55p in
turnover of 25m shares. Dealers said the temperature was additionally raised
by a story that joint-broker Cazenove had lifted its 1993/94 profits
estimate to Pounds 70m, practically double the average for the rest of the
market. Cazenove refused to comment on the rumour.
Leading pharmaceutical stocks performed well on the back of rises on Wall
Street the previous day. Glaxo gained 8 to 816p, SmithKline Beecham rose 16
to 530p and Wellcome advanced 6 to 984p.
Fisons retreated 7 to 214p, pushed back by position-taking between
marketmakers.
Hammerson stood out in a muted property sector as other brokers joined the
recent bout of upgrading of its net asset value. The ordinary shares moved
ahead 16 to 254p and the 'A' stock ended 14 stronger at 249p.
In spite of satisfactory interim results, Boots retreated in busy turnover
of 3.6m on a combination of profit-taking, US drug worries and hints that
current trading may be getting tougher. The shares, which lost 10 yesterday
to 487p, had run up ahead of the results, moving close to the top of their
trading range. Boots also suffered as a perceived defensive stock, as did
Great Universal Stores, which weakened 23 to 1635p.
Publisher Euromoney produced profits well above the high end of expectations
and the shares jumped 32 to 890p. SG Warburg believes that even at this
level there is strong upside and argues that on its 1993 forecast of Pounds
14.5m the shares are a buy up to Pounds 10.
BT shares appreciated 15 to 388p and the partly-paid 16 to 284p after the
second-quarter figures. The rise in the shares, according to specialists,
reflected the increased turnover in call volumes and a reduction in costs.
Royal Insurance rose 19 to 245p after better than expected third-quarter
results.
A bearish note published by Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, was said to
have triggered the substantial underperformance of the banking sector
against the wider market.
Plastics manufacturer Plysu fell 22 to 243p after a boardroom resignation.
BAA lost 9 to 749p, with Kleinwort Benson said to be negative after the
publication of the most recent passenger figures.
Motor distributors received a fillip from the announcement in the Autumn
Statement about car tax. Lex Service advanced 18 to 244p, Jessups improved 8
to 73p and Evans Halshaw rose 10 to 189p.

FT  13 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices anticipate the
chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK chancellor of the exchequer yesterday delivered at least some of the
good news which the London stock market had been anticipating. Late trading
saw share prices consolidating the widespread gains achieved before Mr
Norman Lamont began his speech to the House of Commons.
The FT-SE Index had already boiled over after an earlier gain of 37 points,
before the chancellor rose to his feet, but after hesitating briefly,
responded optimistically to his disclosure that domestic interest rates were
being cut by one percentage point to 7 per cent.
Very modest profit-taking in the final minutes of the session brought a
final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,726.4 for a net gain of 29.6. The
Footsie is now within 12 points of its previous closing high of 2,737.8,
reached on May 11 when the UK stock market was still celebrating the
re-election of Mr John Major's Conservative government.
Some doubts were expressed regarding the likely effectiveness of the
chancellor's package to stimulate the flagging domestic economy. 'We think
it may not be enough to push the stock market significantly further,' said
Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull.
Nor is the strategy team at BZW, the UK investment bank, expecting the stock
market to move to significantly higher levels. BZW's Mr Richard Kersley
commented that, with further base rate cuts likely to be less aggressive,
financial stocks might now meet profit-taking; engineering shares, on the
other hand, would benefit from the unexpected changes in capital allowances.
However, the stock market was pleased with the cut in base rates, the
abolition of motor car tax and changes in capital allowance arrangements,
and the moves to stimulate the housing market. Investment strategists
expressed satisfaction with estimates of next year's Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement and believed that another one-point cut in base rates would be
possible early next year.
Mr Trevor Laugharne at Kleinwort Benson Securities said the chancellor had
made 'more than the best' of the situation and that he now saw the Footsie
challenging the 2,800 mark earlier than previously expected, perhaps within
a couple of weeks.
The stock market was in good form from the opening of the session,
anticipating the chancellor's speech and also responding to good trading
results from a handful of blue chip companies.
Oil shares moved up strongly in heavy turnover following good trading
figures from Shell Transport. Also firm on profits news were BT and Royal
Insurance, with the latter helping the financial sector by favourable
comment on the mortgage indemnity situation.
Confirmation that the Jubilee Line extension to London's Tube rail network
will go ahead, together with the release of some local authority housing
cash, encouraged building and construction issues.
Store and retail shares were more cautious, however, and with the base rate
reduction largely anticipated recorded only modest gains. Disappointment
with the trading statement from Boots, the high street retailer, turned the
shares downwards, and Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher closed only a few
pence up after early gains had attracted profit-taking.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NERVOUS futures market saw a mostly firm day's trading turn into a late
slide as traders declared themselves disappointed with the chancellor's
statement, writes Christopher Price.
The December contract opened at 2,729 and was squeezed up from thereon in
anticipation of some tangible signs from the government that growth policies
would be pursued. The contract peaked around lunchtime at 2,765 - a new
contract high - before nerves set in and a bout of sideways trading
followed.
However, the chancellor's speech failed to impress the market, with most
measures announced already discounted, according to traders.
December began to tumble, eventually closing at 2,745, up 28 from the
previous day and at a slight premium to its fair value of around 17. In
after-hours' trading, December came under more pressure, with traders
forecasting a weak opening this morning. Its fair value range had peaked at
17 during the day, before narrowing in late selling. Turnover was 8,265
lots.
In the traded options market, volume was a substantial 40,377 contracts, of
which 10,275 was in the FT-SE 100 option. ASDA once again led the way with
9,201.
This was followed by Land Securities, which saw 1,200 July 420 calls sold at
23p. Thames Water, on 2,306, and Scottish Power, on 1,970, were other
sizeable trades.

FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Guerrilla leader's capture prompts
recovery in Peru - A striking revival in Lima
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an impressive recovery, the Lima bolsa has turned in one of the world's
best stock market performances over the past two months following the
capture of Abimael Guzman, the guerrilla leader, on September 12.
After a 15 per cent gain in dollar terms in the second half of September,
the general index leapt more than 30 per cent in October. It has subsided by
about 5 per cent since then as investors took a breather.
Turnover rose to levels of around Dollars 1.5m per day, still only half the
February-March peak but a substantial improvement on the past six months.
Brokers say a shortage of willing sellers has kept the lid on what otherwise
would have been more active trading.
The market had been in the doldrums following President Alberto Fujimori's
April 5 decision to dissolve congress and suspend the constitution. Stocks
fell 23 per cent in six months.
But a recent chain of events has boosted the flagging market. Euphoria at
the spectacular Guzman capture coincided in late September with approval by
the IMF of Peru's economic stabilisation programme; then there was the
signing of a Dollars 200m credit which had been frozen since the Fujimori
coup.
A 30 per cent ceiling has been forecast officially for inflation for next
year, exceptionally low for Peru. And recent legislation makes Peru arguably
the most attractive country in the Latin American continent for foreign
investors. There is still no capital gains tax payable on profits from
shares.
The prospect of greater political stability is enhanced by next week's
voting in of a new 'democratic constituent congress'. Even though Peru's
principal parties are boycotting the November 22 elections, the return to
democracy is expected to encourage the full resumption of international
financial relations.
'It all adds up to the confidence factor, the spinal cord of investment,'
says a relieved stock exchange president, Mr Jose Luque Otero. 'Flight
capital is returning fast, and over half of current activity is due to
foreign investment.'
The small Lima bolsa, with some 300 quoted companies, has recently signed
reciprocal trading agreements with the stock exchanges in Caracas, Bogota,
Santiago and Barcelona. Foreign investment is likely to be boosted further
by similar accords with Madrid, Mexico City and Buenos Aires.
Mr Lorenzo Sousa of Peruval, one of Lima's principal brokers, estimates that
foreign buyers account for up to two-thirds of current business. The US and
the British have moved in strongly, he says, since the early wave of buying
that was dominated by Argentines and Chileans.
Outstanding performers over the past eight weeks have been telephone company
shares - up more than 2 1/2 times. CPT, the Lima telephone monopoly, in
which the state has a 20 per cent participation, and wholly state-owned
telecommunications group Entel, are due for privatisation in the second half
of 1993, and trading is active.
Blue chip mining shares have also outperformed the index, recovering as the
long-overvalued local currency gradually falls back against the dollar,
favouring exporters. And the perennial favourites, breweries and cement,
have remained firm. The state-owned package in Cementos Lima, worth an
estimated Dollars 50m, is due for auction on the stock exchange floor before
the end of 1992.
Enthusiastic Lima analysts are predicting a spell of 'vigorous and sustained
growth', with the prospect of prices doubling by March. Prices are still low
by comparison with neighbouring countries, they say.
Realists such as Mr Sousa know that all is not yet plain sailing for Peru.
Tough renegotiations with the Paris Club are scheduled immediately after
next week's congressional elections. The Peruvian financial system is still
far from stable and many inefficient industrial companies may yet face
bankruptcy.
'But foreign investors who put their money in Peru have worldwide
experience,' says Mr Sousa. 'They know which sectors are solid - beer,
mining, cement. They are investing in certainties.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Retailers feature as Dow
loses early gain
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices failed to find their footing as the market gave up its early
gains and ended the day virtually unchanged, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally off 0.54 at 3,239.79. New York
SE volume was fairly heavy at 226m shares, while rises retained a small lead
over declines by 901 to 862. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.67 up on
balance at 422.87 and the Nasdaq composite, which has outpaced the wider
market in recent sessions, lost 0.55 at 634.37.
The day's economic news proved unexceptional for both stocks and bonds.
Jobless claims for the week ended October 31 fell 5,000 to 355,000.
Investors had been looking for an increase of about 10,000.
The figures initially boosted stocks and depressed bonds, lifting long-term
market interest rates, but they failed to make a lasting impression on
either, and by midsession prices were narrowly mixed in both markets. Bond
prices moved higher in late trading following a successful refunding
auction.
Third-quarter results lifted The Gap Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 after
the clothing chain posted net income in line with analysts' expectations.
The Limited, which reported slightly higher net income earlier this week,
slipped Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 . Land's End fell Dollars 5 5/8 to a
52-week low of Dollars 24 1/4 on flat third-quarter profits after
expectations of a substantial improvement.
Federated Department Stores, which announced greatly improved third-quarter
results on Wednesday, ended Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 17 3/8 after
active trading.
Vons, a West Coast supermarket chain, advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 24 1/8
after revealing third-quarter net income of 51 cents a share. A year ago the
company had earnings of 42 cents that included extraordinary gains of 10
cents.
Union Texas Petroleum was the most active issue on the big board after
Allied-Signal said it would sell 30m shares of the company for Dollars 18
1/4 apiece. The stock closed at Dollars 18 1/2 , up Dollars  1/8 on the day.
Pharmaceutical issues continued to rally as the sector recovered from
earlier fears that a Clinton administration would immediately curb drug
prices. Merck, the biggest US drug company, led NYSE trading and put on
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 3/4 , Abbott Laboratories rose Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 29 3/4 and Pfizer firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 77 1/4 . Glaxo
Holdings, however, dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 .

FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses rise on French
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER cut in French interest rates lifted senior bourses yesterday, and
although the Bundesbank held rates steady, its former president Karl Otto
Pohl said he expected the German central bank to relax its tight monetary
grip next year, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw the next best thing to an earnings upgrade as DB Research
recommended Siemens after Wednesday's results, cyclicals responded to an
improvement in sentiment and the DAX index rose 23.16 to 1,535.37 in
turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM6.5bn.
Siemens rose DM13.80 to DM572.50 after an 8.9 per cent rise in net profits
and an unchanged dividend. Mr Gunter Dielmann at DB Research said that the
group had underperformed the DAX by 5 per cent since late September on
bearish expectations about the results which, in the event, were at the top
end of expectations.
Strength in carmakers, steels and engineering reflected a technical recovery
after poor performance in recent weeks. Weakness in the construction sector,
where Holzmann dropped DM13 to DM922 and Hochtief by DM11 to DM1,009,
followed reports that the industry was cooling down further.
Schering and Dresdner Bank were the only two DAX stocks to show a loss. The
pharmaceuticals company fell 50 pfg to DM738 on a fall in nine-month net
profits. The bank stayed under pressure from its planned DM750m eurobond
issue with equity warrants attached, closing DM3 lower at DM353.
PARIS saw gains in interest rate-sensitive stocks as the CAC-40 index ended
23.05 higher at 1,821.51 in heavy turnover of FFr3.3bn. BNP CIs put on
FFr11.10 to FFr380 and Schneider added FFr21 to FFr585.
LVMH, which had fallen last week on fears of a trade war between the US and
Europe, jumped FFr148 or 4.1 per cent to FFr3,740 on hopes that the Gatt
talks would end favourably.
Saint-Gobain dropped FFr10 to FFr525 on disappointing nine-month sales which
led several brokers to downgrade their earnings forecasts. Peugeot lost
another FFr5.10 to FFr490.90 due to the poor outlook for domestic car sales.
MILAN interpreted reports of a reorganisation at Fiat as a sign that the
group was about to sell off some of its subsidiaries, and shares linked to
Fiat rose sharply. But a company spokesman said later that the plans
outlined by Fiat's managing director, Mr Cesare Romiti, did not involve any
asset sales. The Comit index fell 1.8 to 448.19 in turnover estimated at
around Wednesday's L305bn.
Trading was also influenced by the end of the account today as operators
adjusted their portfolios. Analysts expect the market to perform well in the
December account on year-end window-dressing and the prospect of further
positive developments on the budget and the government's privatisation
plans.
Among Fiat group shares, Cogefar, its construction unit, rose L405 or 19 per
cent to L2,540 and Rinascente by L900 to L7,900. Fiat was fixed L37 lower at
L4,457 but then rallied to L4,650 after hours.
STOCKHOLM fell 1.2 per cent in heavy trading as the dollar faltered and
domestic interest rates climbed. The Affarsvarlden General index shed 8.10
to 714.50 in turnover of SKr573m after SKr486m.
Astra A shares fell another SKr4 to SKr585 on its nine-month earnings report
but the B shares were steady at 573.
The forestry company, Korsnas, was the day's winner with a gain of SKr11 or
15 per cent to SKr84 after the holding company, Kinnevik, increased its bid
for the company.
COPENHAGEN continued the advance prompted by Tuesday's repo rate cut, writes
Hilary Barnes, with banks up by 4.2 per cent and shipping by 4.3 per cent as
the all-share index put on 7.19 or 2.7 per cent to 269.21. Danske Bank rose
DKr8 to DKr40 and Unidanmark by DKr10 to DKr143.
Novo Nordisk rose DKr15 to DKr525 on forecasts of 15 pre-tax profits growth
in 1992 after a slightly disappointing third-quarter result.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by the dollar and a pleasing third-quarter earnings
report from Royal Dutch. The CBS Tendency index ended up 1.3 at 105.10.
Royal Dutch added Fl 2.10 to Fl 147.70, as dealers were encouraged by the
company's positive outlook for the fourth quarter.
BRUSSELS closed higher as the interest rate cut in France fuelled
expectations of a similar move in Belgium. The Bel-20 index rose 7.45 to
1,142.83 in turnover of BFr1.12bn. Among banks, Kredietbank added BFr150 to
BFr5,890.

FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK at another high as
Nikkei recoups loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for lower interest rates by a government official bolstered
sentiment, and the Nikkei average recouped an initial loss on late afternoon
buying by investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 58.78 up at 16,376.93. Traders had braced themselves as
foreign selling and margin unwinding sent the index closer to the 16,000
psychological level; but it bottomed out at 16,089.37 after Mr Yuji
Tanahashi, vice-minister of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, said short-term money market rates were too high. It attained the
day's high of 16,449.45 just before the close.
Volume remained flat, at 200m shares against 201m. In spite of the recovery
in the Nikkei, declines still led advances by 586 to 309, with 186 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost a net 1.45 at
1,246.88, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.26 at 1,005.82.
Some traders attributed the last-minute rise in share prices to
options-related trading ahead of today's settlement of stock index options.
Dealers' short-term trading revived theme stocks, which had declined in the
morning. Green Cross, the day's most active issue, rose Y20 to Y1,280.
Sega Enterprises, the game manufacturer, was one of the bright spots, moving
ahead Y80 to Y9,150. Investors were encouraged by speculation of a good rise
in profits for the current year. After the market closed, Sega reported an
83.4 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the first half and a 91.3 per cent
increase in sales.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 195.04 to 17,637.20 in volume of 30.6m
shares, its fifth consecutive fall, on stop-loss selling and
margin-unwinding.
The Nagoya Stock Exchange announced that three brokerage houses - Kyoritsu
Securities, Chuo Securities, and Ace Securities - will withdraw from options
trading on the exchange, taking the number of withdrawals to 10.
Cost-cutting may lead to further decreases in the number of brokers trading
options on the NSE.
Roundup
ANOTHER mixed day for the Pacific Basin region was again featured by the
Hong Kong market. Taiwan was closed because of a public holiday.
HONG KONG rose to its second consecutive record high as confidence in future
Hong Kong profits outweighed worries over current Sino-British friction. The
Hang Seng index recouped an early fall before ending 25.05 ahead at 6,447.11
in brisk turnover of HKDollars 4.25bn.
HSBC Holdings, which placed HKDollars 5bn in new stock on Wednesday, led
turnover at HKDollars 446m as it closed 50 cents lower at HKDollars 67.
Hutchison Whampoa and Cheong Kong were active on persistent rumours that the
former is planning a substantial placing. Hutchison added 40 cents at
HKDollars 17.50, while Cheong Kong dipped 20 cents to HKDollars 22.90. A
Hutchison spokesman declined to comment on any placing.
AUSTRALIA dropped to a 21-month low as a rise in October unemployment to
11.3 per cent from September's 10.8 per cent came in way above expectations
and soured sentiment. After gaining 5 in early trading, the All Ordinaries
index closed 19.2 down at 1,375.3 in turnover of ADollars 226.3m.
News Corp defied the trend, climbing 30 cents to ADollars 27 on the back of
New York's overnight gains and reports that Merrill Lynch had added the
stock to its research list. TNT, down heavily on Tuesday, recovered 2 cents
to 57 cents.
SEOUL fell for the third day on profit-taking. The composite index lost
21.97 to 636.99 in Won64.6bn turnover, against Won97.8bn. Selling centred on
heavily weighted Kepco and other large-capitalisation shares. Kepco and
Posco shed Won1,000 each to go limit-down, closing at Won20,300 and
Won25,700 respectively.
BANGKOK declined across the board as finance and securities firms heeded a
request by the Bank of Thailand to reduce lending to investors.
The SET index fell 22.24, or 2.4 per cent, to 914.88 in turnover of
Bt9.81bn, the biggest daily loss since May and thinnest trade in three
weeks.
KUALA LUMPUR swept to a higher close after a mild correction in recent days.
The composite index put on 5.43 at 652.23 in 233m-share volume.
NEW ZEALAND ended broadly firmer in spite of softness in Australia. The
NZSE-40 index rose 9.14 to 1,405.96 in turnover of NZDollars 18m.
BOMBAY saw widespread gains after the BSE board imposed restrictions on
sales to halt a market slide. The BSE Index added 45.28 at 2,641.81.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Money Markets: UK and France ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money market were virtually unmoved yesterday
after the UK chancellor announced that the Bank of England will post a
Minimum Lending Rate of 7 per cent today, writes James Blitz.
This signalled a 1 percentage point cut in base rates, but the reduction had
been accurately priced into the market and little trading followed the
statement.
In recent days, dealers had been punting on the possibility of a 2
percentage point cut in rates this week. But several hours before the
speech, market rates firmed, with 6-month money moving back up to 6 3/4 per
cent from 6 per cent.
Three-month money, a key indicator of how the market thinks rates are
moving, traded at around 7 per cent shortly before the chancellor stood up
in the House of Commons, and closed at that level.
Short sterling futures reflected slightly less optimism that base rates will
be at 6 per cent by the New Year. The December short sterling contract
closed down 14 basis points from its highs at 93.40, pricing 3-month money
at 6.60 per cent by Christmas.
As expected, the Pounds 1bn daily shortage forecast by the Bank of England
proved difficult to remove in the run-up to the Autumn Statement.
One commercial bank dealer suggested that today's shortage should be easily
removed because there is little expectation of another rate cut for several
weeks. 'We should have a quiet period until the next economic data come
through,' he said.
The Bank of France decided to cut its two key lending rates for the second
time in ten days, but the move had been priced into the market and had
little impact.
The French authorities decided to lower the intervention rate by 25 basis
points to 9.10 per cent and the five-to-10 day lending rate to 10 per cent.
However, French cash rates were more-or-less unchanged on the news. The
December French franc futures contract closed down 10 basis points at 90.94,
and three month money closed at 9 3/8 per cent on the offered side.
Three-month French cash is now 90 basis points above 3-month D-Marks. One
commercial bank dealer speculated that the French authorities could bring
French rates down to German levels if the franc appreciates further to
FFr3.35 to the D-Mark.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling unmoved by rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING was virtually unmoved against both the D-Mark and the US dollar
yesterday, after Britain's chancellor announced that UK base rates would be
cut by 1 percentage point from today, writes James Blitz.
However, the French franc derived considerable support from the Bank of
France's decision to cut its two main dealing rates for the second time in
ten days. According to one analyst, yesterday's moves may have set the scene
for the franc to appreciate against the D-Mark well into next year.
The 100 basis point cut in UK base rates had been generally priced into
sterling's exchange rates before the statement. The pound was at DM2.4105 at
the start of Mr Lamont's speech, rose to DM2.4150 by the end, and later
closed at DM2.4200, more than  1/2 a pfennig up on the day.
Against the dollar, the pound closed slightly weaker at Dollars 1.5240. But
this was more the product of dollar strength than an instantly negative
response to the chancellor's statement.
Mr John Hall, an international economict at Swiss Banking Corporation in
London, said that the government had given so many steers on the content of
the speech that there was little for the market to react to. 'The amount of
fiscal stimulus was exactly what was anticipated, and the pound could even
show a little upside following these moves,' he said.
However, Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said
that the chancellor showed less commitment to economic growth than he had
expected, and that sterling could weaken further before the end of the year.
'Underlying institutional money is desperate to find a home where there is
economic growth,' he said. 'But the message of the statement was that
Britain is not moving fast enough in that direction.' The rise in the public
sector borrowing requirement would also make the market wary about the
increased supply of government bonds, which may weaken sterling's exchange
rate in the longer term.
Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros, was particularly bearish about
the pound's prospects. 'The chancellor was tinkering at the edges rather
than getting to the heart of the problem,' he said. 'There was nothing
significant in the chancellor's package, and much about which one could cast
doubt.' He expects sterling to dip below the floor of its current range,
DM2.40 to the D-Mark, before the end of the year.
The French franc continued to rise against the D-Mark in spite of the Bank
of France's decision to cut its two key lending rates yesterday. The franc
closed at FFr3.3740 to the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.381.
The French currency's rise has prompted speculation that the hard currencies
in the Exchange Rate Mechanism - including the D-Mark and French Franc -
will move to narrower bands next year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia holds key to nickel
market balance, says Inco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING NICKEL production and record stainless steel output could contribute
to an improved balance between world nickel supply and demand next year,
according to Inco of Canada, the biggest producer of the metal.
Inco, acknowledges however, that its forecasts depend heavily on a reduction
in 'back door' exports from Russia and other parts of eastern Europe, which
have severely disrupted the market this year. This material, often smuggled
or disguised as scrap, has fuelled a slump in nickel prices on the LME by
nearly Dollars 3,000 from the Dollars 8,500 a tonne ruling two years ago.
At the London Metal Exchange yesterday the nickel price for delivery in
three months fell by Dollars 32.50 to Dollars 5,590 a tonne, Dollars 50
above the 4 3/4 -year low reached earlier in the week.
Mr Ivor Kirman, marketing director of Inco Europe, told an investors meeting
in Toronto that the tone of the nickel market would be improved if a higher
proportion of Russian exports were shipped through traditional channels,
rather than the growing 'grey' market.
Responding to an analyst's warning that 'if you block one hole, it will come
out another hole,' Mr Kirman said that greater use of official channels by
eastern European exporters 'would at least avoid confusion, corruption and
demoralisation' in the market.
He estimated that some European consumers now depended on supplies from the
east for up to 80 per cent of their nickel needs.
Inco is confident that, depending on the level of Russian exports, demand
for primary nickel from western producers will be higher next year than the
1.4bn lb estimated for 1992. Cuts by suppliers in response to lower prices
means that nickel supplies 'are unlikely to be greater than 1992, and could
be significantly lower,' Mr Kirman said. Inco estimates total supplies this
year at 1.54bn lb, down from 1.56bn lb in 1991.
Inco has responded to the present glut by cutting planned 1993 production to
380m lb of finished nickel, from an estimated 405m lb this year. Mr Michael
Sopko, chief executive, said that 'if over-supply continues to grow, we will
take further action'. But the company also emphasised its ability to step up
long-term production when the market recovered.
The sites of future expansion would include PT Inco in Indonesia, the
moth-balled Exmibal mine in Guatemala, two properties in Brazil, and vast
reserves in New Caledonia. Inco reiterated its determination to maintain a
share of about 25 per cent of the world nickel market.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusaf swims against the tide -
South Africa's record-breaking aluminium project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURABLE power contract, shareholder support and scale benefits lie
behind the announcement yesterday by Alusaf, the aluminium producer in the
South African Gencor group, that it is to proceed with the R7.2bn (Pounds
1.6bn) construction of a 466,000 tonnes a year aluminium smelter, the
largest ever built in the western world.
The announcement comes against the background of a deep recession in the
world aluminium industry, with about 65 per cent of world smelting capacity
uneconomical at current prices of less than Dollars 1,200 a tonne. However,
it also follows on the heels of a number of predictions that there will be a
shortage of metal by the middle of the decade, when the Alusaf expansion
comes on stream.
Mr Harry Helton, executive vice president, minerals and metals, at Reynolds
Metals, the second largest of the US aluminium groups, recently predicted
that the western world's aluminium industry needed to build 13 new smelters
of about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 if it was to keep pace with
demand. There are, however, no other significant expansions of capacity
planned at the moment because the depressed state of the industry makes it
difficult to approach shareholders for money. Mr Helton said the industry
needed a sustained price of about Dollars 1,800 a tonne before it could
reasonably start investing again.
Alusaf was not immune to this problem. The original plan was to raise about
R3bn of equity finance for the project, of which R1bn was to come from
Gencor and R800,000 from the Industrial Development Corporation. The
remaining R1.2bn was to come from local institutions. In fact, eight local
institutions were in the end only prepared to put up R500,000 towards the
project, with about 80 per cent of this coming from Old Mutual and Sanlam,
the two giant mutual insurance companies. The R700m shortfall was made up by
Gencor, including its investment arm Genbel, putting up another R225m, the
IDC investing a further R175m and Escom, the electricity utility, putting up
R300m of convertible loan finance.
What, however, has allowed Alusaf to proceed where others are showing
greater caution? The answer to this question begins not with Gencor or
Alusaf, but with Escom. Over-optimistic predictions made during the 1970s of
economic growth in South Africa have landed the country with excess
generating capacity of about 8,000 Mw out of installed capacity of about
38,000 Mw. Escom's need to recover some of this sunk investment created a
'window of opportunity' in the form of assisting Alusaf to negotiate a
favourable power supply deal, which is the cornerstone of the project. The
quid pro quo is that Alusaf will use about 16 per cent of Escom's spare
capacity, improving the latter's financial position in the process.
Alusaf has negotiated a variable tariff with Escom based upon the LME
aluminium price. According to Mr Fred Roux, the chairman, Alusaf would,
taking an average aluminium price last year of about Dollars 1,300 a tonne,
have spent Dollars 202 a tonne on its power compared with a world average
power cost of Dollars 320 a tonne for aluminium producers.
Alusaf has also negotiated competitive alumina (aluminium oxide) supply
contracts with Alcoa, the world's lowest-cost alumina producer, and
Billiton, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, for the 900,000
tonnes a year of alumina required. Taken together, these two costs - power
and alumina - will always absorb about 41 per cent of the aluminium selling
price, leaving a fixed gross margin for other costs and profits. The effect
of these contracts is to lower the risk profile of the project, smoothing
out variations in earnings from aluminium sales. On a base case aluminium
price of Dollars 1,650 per tonne, the project will offer a real rate of
return of about 8 per cent.
Apart the from low input costs, the size of the project is also crucial. The
optimum smelter size in the world today is 233,000 tonnes a year. Alusaf
will be the first producer to build a double configuration simultaneously,
and this will provide significant cost advantages. Taken together with the
old smelter, which will be upgraded, Alusaf will at full production produce
680,000 tonnes a year.
From the point of view of Gencor, the project is a crucial step into the
mineral beneficiation arena where, it is widely held, the future of South
Africa's mining and metals industry is to be found. It also offers an
important platform for the internationalisation of the group's activities,
an oft-stated ambition. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, made clear
yesterday that the company envisages Alusaf expanding upstream into alumina
and bauxite and downstream into rolled, extruded and fabricated products.
This will necessarily require offshore investments because there are no
bauxite deposits of note in South Africa and downstream activity tends to be
situated close to the markets.
Mr Gilbertson said yesterday that Gencor was comfortable with its R1.125bn
exposure in the project, which represents less than half of its current cash
and readily available liquid resources.
A novel feature of the project is the attempt to involve financial
institutions at the start, partaking in the risk and forfeiting the prospect
of any returns for about four years. Traditionally mining houses have
developed projects and then sold them on for a profit. This project,
however, was too large for Gencor to finance alone, hence the involvement of
the institutions. Their lukewarm response indicates the difficulty many of
them found in reconciling involvement in Alusaf with their traditional
commitment to obtain the best available returns for policy holders in the
short-term.
To overcome this funding gap in future, it is quite conceivable that the
government will enact legislation requiring that a portion of institutional
cash-flows be dedicated to such projects. There have already been noises
from government to this effect.
The project has been given go-ahead after accepting the recommendation of an
independent environmental assessment that the new smelter be moved from a
preferred site to an alternative location in Richards Bay, the East coast
port where Alusaf is situated. Mr Roux said this had cost 'many tens of
million rand'.
The project will not, as originally planned, be listed on the stock market
yet, so as to to avoid the possibility - probability in current
circumstances - of it trading at a discount following listing. A later
listing will be pursued.

THE PLATINUM price staged a modest rally yesterday, underpinned by a mildly
bullish interim market review from Johnson Matthey, the biggest marketer of
the metal (see story above). The price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars
351 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.75 from Wednesday, but that was still Dollars
15.50 down on the week so far. Dealers said, however, that platinum would
have difficulty making headway while gold and silver prices remained
depressed. The GOLD price edged another 90 cents higher on short-covering to
reach Dollars 333.05 an ounce, still 95 cents down on the week. SILVER
closed at 368.5 cents an ounce, unchanged on the day but 24 cents lower on
the week. Base metals were mixed at the London Metal Exchange, with LEAD,
NICKEL and ALUMINIUM prices lower, but ZINC, COPPER and TIN registering
modest gains. The zinc market reversed a sharpish early fall, which ran into
trade buying, to close Dollars 8 up at Dollars 1,062.50 a tonne for three
months delivery.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price forecasts cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, has scaled
down its short-term forecasts for the metal's price because of the effects
of recession on the Japanese, the biggest platinum buyers.
Earlier this year the company forecast that the price would be rising
towards Dollars 400 a troy ounce by the end of 1992, but this underestimated
the impact of collapsing property and equity prices on rich Japanese. It now
expects the average for the fourth quarter of this year to be about Dollars
370 an ounce, rising to Dollars 385 in the first quarter of 1993.
Sales of large investment platinum bars in Japan were badly affected by the
uncertainties created by the market collapse and JM expects demand for these
bars to drop to 90,000 ounces this year from 240,000 ounces in 1991.
Also, a sharp fall in sales of high-quality and expensive platinum jewellery
in Japan is forcing retailers to adjust stock levels. Sales of simple,
cheaper platinum jewellery in Japan continue to be buoyant, however, and JM
predicts that overall demand from jewellers will drop this year by only
10,000 ounces to 1.46m ounces.
According to Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of JM's interim market review,
published yesterday, platinum supply and demand are closely balanced. He
forecasts a supply surplus of about 30,000 ounces compared with one of
135,000 ounces in 1991.
The total platinum market will be smaller this year, says Mr Coombes, with
both supply and demand contracting. Demand is forecast to be 3.86m ounces,
down from 4.025 ounces last year, and supply 3.89m ounces, down from 4.16m.
Recession in many industrialised countries will cause a 5 per cent fall in
industrial demand for platinum, to 760,000 ounces. But, despite recession,
tightening anti-pollution legislation affecting cars in Europe and North
America will see demand for platinum in automotive exhaust catalysts rising
by 6.1 per cent this year to a record 1.655m ounces.
This means non-investment demand for the metal is heading for the ninth
successive year of growth, says JM.
On the supply side, Mr Coombes suggests that Russian platinum exports, which
spiralled out of control in 1991, are now strongly constrained by the
authorities and JM therefore expects these exports to fall by nearly one
third this year - to about 750,000 ounces compared with 1.1m ounces in 1991.
In 1990 Russia exported about 720,000 ounces.
Also, a year ago JM expected South African producers to supply more than 3m
ounces to the market in 1992. This estimate is trimmed in the review to
2.82m ounces, a rise of only 1.8 per cent on the 1991 level. A combination
of industrial and political action, technical problems, mining
inefficiencies and difficult ground has disrupted production and expansion
programmes and developments have been delayed.
Mr Coombes says: 'Returns are now inadequate to provide funds for future
investment and, without a recovery in prices, there could be more delays in
expansions or even cuts in production at high-cost areas'.
The review suggests the palladium market will see a supply deficit of
110,000 ounces and the metal's prices should therefore remain firm. Rhodium
will be in surplus by 13,000 ounces, partly because of de-stocking by
Japanese car makers.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee surges to fresh 9-month
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S ROBUSTA coffee market continued to rally strongly yesterday, with
the January contract breaching resistance at Dollars 950 a tonne to hit a
nine-month high of Dollars 955.
In New York the December arabica contract was up more than 2 cents at 67.45
cents a lb in late trading.
Last week the London market briefly touched Dollars 950 a tonne, partly on
reports of a smaller Brazilian crop. But the inevitable technical correction
set in, and dealers, pointing out that the market had risen Dollars 200 in
just two months, were hoping towards the end of the week that the January
price would hold above Dollars 900 a tonne.
The recent recovery also appears to be technical. 'This is a beautifully
trending market,' said Ms Judith Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York. However, she noted that prices, while well above the summer's 20-year
lows, remained relatively depressed. 'We are only just beginning to dig out
of the hole.'
ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, suggested in its latest coffee report
that, with producers delaying sales in expectation of even higher prices
there appeared to be plenty of scope for further gains.
Man now estimates the 1992-93 Brazilian crop at 19.15m bags (60 kg each) -
at the low end of expectations but above the Brazilians' own estimate of
18.9m bags. This is thought by most analysts to be the biggest single
fundamental factor in coffee's recent rise.
FO Licht, the German statistician, on Monday estimated Brazilian production
at 20m bags, down from 27.9m bags in 1991-92. Total world output was put at
93.3m bags, down from 102m last year.
However, stocks are high. On Tuesday US certified stocks for delivery
against New York hit a record 5.33m bags. As Licht put it: 'Even though
coffee production is forecast to decline this season, the road to recovery
will be painful and slow as there is still too much coffee around'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact settlement remains
out of reach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO WEEKS of talks between cocoa producing and consuming countries on a new
price-stabilising international agreement are set to end inconclusively
today. The 45 countries taking part in the United Nations-sponsored talks
will return to Geneva in February for a fourth and final attempt to conclude
an accord to replace the 1986 pact, which expires in September 1993.
The past fortnight has seen a significant narrowing of the gap between
producers and consumers on the maximum amount of cocoa that could be
withdrawn from the market to help defend whatever price range is set by the
agreement. Consumers have now proposed 330,000 tonnes, up from 300,000
tonnes when the meeting began. Producers have asked for 380,000 tonnes, down
from 600,000.
But, despite some movement on both sides, the gulf between producer and
consumer price proposals remains dauntingly wide. And there has been
virtually no progress on the thorny issue of financing the new accord.
On Monday, producers proposed a price band of SDR1,180-1,770 a tonne with a
median price of SDR1,475, down from a median price of SDR1,820 at the start
of the meeting. Consumers raised their price offer by just SDR50 last week
to a median price of SDR1,050 in a price band of SDR840-1,260 a tonne.
Conference delegates said yesterday that consumers had some modest
flexibility to raise their price offer but this went nowhere near to
satisfying producer demands. The offer already surpasses the current market
price for cocoa, equivalent to about SDR815 a tonne.
On financing, producers want equal contributions from the two sides via a
levy system. However, the European Community, at the insistence of Britain,
the Netherlands and Germany, continues to press for funds to come from
existing assets in the first instance. These assets comprise mainly arrears
of contributions to the present agreement by producers, notably the two
biggest, Ivory Coast and Brazil, and the 240,000 tonnes of cocoa held in the
buffer stock.
The EC, which accounts for 40 per cent of world consumption, is the most
important consumer at the Geneva talks, in the absence of the US.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slide as Lamont fails to provide
much support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds closed as much as a quarter point lower on the day, as
the Chancellor's Autumn Statement and base rate cut failed to provide much
support for the gilt market.
The one percentage point cut in the base rate, from 8 per cent to 7 per
cent, which comes into effect today, had already been priced into the short
end of the market, dealers said, and left short-dated issues little changed
on the day.
Earlier this week, the market had hoped for an interest rate cut of 1.5 to 2
percentage points in conjunction with the statement. Dealers said
yesterday's smaller-than-expected cut was welcomed by the long end of the
market, given the view that the government might have problems keeping
inflation down with a two-point cut.
Overall, long-dated issues ended the day lower, as the post-Statement rally
was insufficient to overcome the earlier weakness in the gilt market.
Mr Lamont's comments on the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)
received mixed reviews. The Chancellor's forecast of a Pounds 37bn PSBR for
1992-1993 came as little surprise, as analysts calculate that the government
need only raise a further Pounds 4bn in the gilt market in the remainder of
the financial year.
However, the forecast PSBR of Pounds 44bn for 1993-1994 came as a shock to
the market as it implies gilt issuance of around Pounds 50bn for the year.
THE Bank of France cut its key interest rates yesterday morning by a quarter
point, prompting a rally in the French government bond market.
Mr Michel Sapin, economics minister, said the latest cuts reflected the
strength of the franc. The Bank of France cut the intervention rate from
9.35 per cent to 9.1 per cent and its five-to-10 day securities repurchase
rate from 10.25 per cent to 10 per cent. The central bank last cut the key
rates - also by a quarter point - on November 2.
The December bond future on the Matif exchange traded in a range of 110.86
to 111.20, but profit-taking wiped out some of the gains and the market
ended slightly higher on the day.
THE GERMAN government bond market ended little changed as any positive
impact of the French cut in interest rates was cancelled out by statements
from the Bundesbank denying the need for lower German rates, dealers said.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.48 and traded at around 91.47
by late afternoon. Dealers noted stronger interest in the two to three-year
area, while the long end closed slightly weaker.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, told German radio that the
Bundesbank saw no need for a cut in key interest rates. The Bundesbank's
Lombard lending rate is currently 9.50 per cent and the discount rate is
8.25 per cent.
US TREASURY prices firmed along the length of the yield curve yesterday
afternoon following a successful 30-year bond auction.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond jumped  13/16 to 95
29/32 , yielding 7.592 per cent, while the two-year note was up 5/32 for a
yield of 4.400 per cent. The long bond recovered after easing slightly in
morning trading on news of an unanticipated decline in jobless claims by
5,000 to 355,000 for the last week of October.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally, taking their cue from the
stock market fall and speculation that the Bank of Japan will be forced to
ease interest rates.
The March futures contract rose from 107.58 at the opening to a high of
107.70, as the Nikkei index fell sharply. However, as the stock market
recovered its losses later in the day to close higher, the bond market fell
on profit-taking.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moved from 4.62 per cent at the
opening to 4.615 per cent but ended the day at 4.635 per cent.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Swedish issue takes advantage of
buoyant conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST sterling issue from Sweden since 1988 was by far the most
glamorous of yesterday's stream of deals in the international bonds market.
The speed with which the Pounds 600m five-year paper sold out underlined
again the demand for quality Eurosterling assets and the lack of sovereign
and supranational paper in the currency, said traders. Launched at Pounds
500m, it was quickly increased.
The kingdom's bond is the largest single sterling Eurobond yet seen, and
provides a much needed new benchmark in the absence of current coupon gilts.
Traders agreed that with a launch spread of 45 basis points over comparable
gilts it was correctly priced for a large issue, particularly in the light
of the country's continuing heavy borrowing programme.
Lead managers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and S. G. Warburg Securities said the
issue was timed to take advantage of buoyant market conditions in the narrow
window prior to the UK's Autumn Statement. Mr Staffan Crona, director
general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said: 'We have big borrowing
needs and not many issuing possibilities remain before Christmas.'
The issue continues the second phase of the emergency borrowing programme
drawn up by Sweden to raise a total of Ecu31bn after the late summer
currency crises. Like the earlier DM2.5bn and FFr6bn bonds, proceeds will go
directly into foreign currency reserves.
Mr Thomas Kranzen, a deputy governor of the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank,
said the latest published figures showed the reserves standing at SKr176.9bn
in the first week of November, compared with the low point of SKr95.2bn at
the start of September.
Sweden still needs to borrow a further Ecu10bn under the second phase, to
meet its target of Ecu15bn, but Mr Crona says the timetable for meeting that
target is more relaxed now that the reserves have been rebuilt and the
programme can extend into next year.
Commenting on market rumours that Sweden will make a large borrowing in US
dollars before the end of the year, Mr Crona would not rule this out. 'We
are discussing different alternatives with the banks,' he said. The dollar
alternatives include floating rate notes, straight Eurobonds and global
issues.
Sweden's official forecast remains that it will not need to raise new
foreign borrowings beyond the Ecu15bn, although it will refinance some
maturing foreign debt. It plans to tap the domestic market to meet its other
needs.
There are conflicting views on where the sterling market is heading after
the Autumn Statement. Some feel it could continue to perform well over the
next few weeks. Others argue that it will be adversely affected by the UK's
growing public sector borrowing requirement.
Almost eclipsed by Sweden, KfW International Finance's DM1.5bn five-year
bond duly emerged with a launch spread of 22 basis points over German
government bonds.
The European Investment Bank followed the success of its Pounds 200m issue
with two other bonds, one for SFr200m over five years at 6 per cent through
Swiss Volksbank, the other for Dollars 120m over four years at 5 3/4 per
cent through Credit Suisse First Boston.
Wood Gundy launched two coupon-driven retail-targetted CDollars 100m deals,
for Communaute de Montreal and Caisse Centrale Desjardins du Quebec.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Foreign banks' claims on
Latin America fall 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT owed by the eight biggest Latin American countries to their
foreign bank creditors has fallen by around a quarter since the mid-1980s as
a result of debt reduction, buy-back and conversion policies.
In a report published today the Bank for International Settlements, the
grouping of central banks from the leading industrial countries, reports
that foreign banks' claims on these countries fell by Dollars 57bn, or 23
per cent, in the five years to the end of 1991.
'The multiplication of instruments and techniques aimed at reducing existing
exposures was a major factor contributing to the decline in banks' claims
after 1985,' it says. Debt conversions and buy-backs became common in
1987-1988, while debt reduction has followed more recently from the Brady
initiative of 1989.
This process has left the eight - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela - with debts to foreign banks which
account for only 52 per cent of their total foreign debts, down by nearly 20
percentage points from the end of 1983 - in part a result of the upsurge of
securities from Latin American issuers on the international markets.
The debt reduction has not been evenly spread across all bank creditors. In
1983, European banks were owed 33 per cent of the outstanding claims. By the
end of last year, that had jumped to 44 per cent. The reason, according to
BIS figures, is a reduction in the exposures of US banks, whose share of
claims on the region dropped from 40 per cent to 28 per cent over the same
period.
This largely reflects a reduction in claims of regional and smaller banks in
the US. The BIS also notes that UK banks 'cut back their exposure markedly,
whereas most other banking groups maintained their outstanding positions'.
While bank exposure to the region has shrunk, portfolio investors have
committed substantial sums - around Dollars 25bn in 1991, the BIS says.
These have tended to take the form of longer-term borrowings or the sale of
equity.
'From the wider international financial system, such sounder forms of
capital inflow also imply less risk of systemic weakness of the kind which
suddenly emerged in 1982,' the BIS says.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks step up pace
of international withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of Japanese banks' withdrawal from the international banking market
accelerated in the second quarter of this year, according to the BIS.
The Dollars 53bn reduction in their international banking assets - largely
accounted for by a continuing fall-off in inter-bank lending - was the
greatest ever recorded, leaving them with less than 30 per cent of all
international banking assets for the first time since 1986.
Largely as a result, the international banking system generated only Dollars
15bn of net new credit in the second quarter, half what it had managed in
the first three months.
This reversed what had been a gradual acceleration of international bank
lending since early in 1991, when the BIS had recorded the first-ever fall
in international banking activity.
This overall stagnant picture masked some sharp rises in international
assets by European banks.
Those of German banks jumped by Dollars 39bn, while French banks added
Dollars 31bn and those in Switzerland and the Benelux countries accounted
for an extra Dollars 30bn.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dark days at Hong Kong's
Hutchison - Reasons for a decline in the company's esteem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are dark days for Hutchison Whampoa, Hong Kong's oldest company and
one which, until recently, could hold its own with the likes of Swire and
Jardine Matheson.
Hutchison has been in the doldrums for the past 18 months.
Its share price has under-performed the local stock market by 30 per cent -
a poor performance which has been aggravated by a constant stream of bad
news about its 49 per cent owned Canadian energy company, Husky Oil, and
more latterly by the poor prospects for near-term returns on its investment
in UK telecommunications.
Hutchison has done nothing to make matters better. It produces one of the
most opaque balance sheets of any important company in Hong Kong. Its senior
executives have been in purdah since the summer, giving interviews only to a
tame local media and avoiding stock analysts altogether.
Little wonder, then, that two leading securities houses have recently
produced reports on the company which project profit growth within a narrow
margin of each other but which come to completely different conclusions
about Hutchison's prospects.
Warburg Securities - which has a 'sell' recommendation on the stock -
estimated in a recent report on the company that the combined effect of
Hutchison's foray into Canadian energy and UK telecommunications would, over
the period 1988 to 1995, cost shareholders HKDollars 4.5bn (calculated in
1992 dollars) in profits foregone. It forecasts profits this year of around
HKDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 323m), rising in 1993 to HKDollars 5.25bn.
Credit Lyonnais - which recommends buying the stock - estimates profits this
year of HKDollars 2.87bn, rising next year to HKDollars 5.5bn. Its view of
Hutchison's telecommunications venture in the UK is that it is risky, but
that rewards are large and will safeguard its future into the next century.
Unlike Warburg, it thinks Hutchison could pull it off.
To date, the market seems to be inclining to the Warburg view. A report last
month that Hutchison has decided at a board meeting to pull out of its UK
telecommunications venture saw strong buying of the stock. Two subsequent
denials of a pull-out by Hutchison have not convinced the market; it expects
the company to announce it has sold its UK telecommunications business by
the late spring of next year.
This view has been strengthened by the actions of Hutchison itself. The head
office staff of Hutchison Telecoms has been cut from 45 to 40. The company's
plans for expansion in India, Bangladesh, Taiwan and South Korea have been
shelved, and it has pulled out of the race to introduce personal
communications networks (PCN) in Australia and Germany.
A survey of fund managers published last month revealed the extent of
Hutchison's decline in the esteem of investors. Hutchison has slipped
sharply since 1991 in a field of Hong Kong companies, in terms of quality of
management and in financial soundness.
At present, it is clear that the board of Hutchison is seriously divided,
although there are signs that a management reshuffle is in the offing.
Evidence of senior management division comes from the company's two most
senior executives - the wily Mr Li Ka-shing, its chairman, and Mr Simon
Murray, Hutchison's usually chipper managing director. They seem unable to
tell the same story to the investing public about the company's business
prospects, especially its UK telecoms operations.
In the summer, Mr Murray was saying the UK telecommunications market was
buoyant and that prospects for Hutchison 'excellent'. In June, Mr Li
attributed the company's cut in dividend to the need to preserve cash in
view of the UK business's funding requirements - more than HKDollars 7bn
over the next few years - and forecast losses in the UK.
In a recent newspaper interview, Mr Li said that for the past few months he
had been spending 70 to 80 per cent of his time on Hutchison. He called on
investors to be patient 'because, frankly speaking, Hutchison has a few
problems'.
The market, being the market, knows the outcome of any friction between Mr
Li and Mr Murray. If talk doing the rounds in the colony's financial
community is true, and few doubt it is, then Mr Murray is on the way out and
Mr Richard Siemens, the head of Hutchison Telecommunications, could be soon
following him.
Face will, however, be saved. If Mr Murray goes - and the market is
speculating that it could be as early as the new year - then Mr Li - whose
flagship, Cheung Kong, owns 40 per cent of Hutchison - is likely to soften
the blow by investing in Mr Murray's new business venture.
Whatever Mr Murray's future holds, analysts say that Hutchison is undergoing
a change in strategic direction. This will see greater emphasis placed in
the company's Hong Kong operations and its investments in China, the latest
example of which is its joint-venture with Shanghai's Port Authority to
develop a container port for the city.
The company is also gearing up to develop property on the mainland and to
participate in telecommunications developments in China.
While investors would welcome Hutchison's retreat from overseas investments
and its reorientation towards China, one large concern still remains. If Mr
Murray is not going to head Hutchison and foreigners are out of favour at
the company, who is in?
The appointment in August of Mr Richard Li, Mr Li Ka-shing's 25-year-old
son, as an executive director of Hutchison has caused anxiety in investment
circles. This was heightened when Mr Li said in the recent interview: 'One
day I hope that my boys (his other son, Victor, is managing director of
Cheung Kong) and the team of people can run the businesses themselves.'
Mr Richard Li is seen as being too young to run a company of the complexity
of Hutchison.

HALLA Engineering and Heavy Industries, the South Korean group, is seeking
government permission to join the nation's highly competitive vehicle
industry, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'We plan to submit the application to the government for the production of
commercial vehicles next week,' the company said.
Halla plans to invest Won55bn (Dollars 70.6m) to produce about 12 kinds of
large commercial vehicles such as cement mixers, dump trucks and fork-lift
trucks at an annual rate of 5,000 units, beginning in 1993 or in 1994. It
plans to import technology from Iveco Fiat of Italy to produce the vehicles
of 11 tonnes or more.
In 1990, Halla tried and failed to win government approval to enter the
vehicle market.
The deal between Halla and Iveco Fiat is expected to last for five years
after the government gives its approval.
Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), a part of the nation's largest conglomerate
Samsung Group, won government approval in July to produce commercial
vehicles in technical co-operation with Nissan Diesel Motor of Japan.
Halla Engineering and Heavy Industries is a unit of The Halla Group, founded
by Mr Chung In-yung, younger brother of Hyundai Group ex-chairman Mr Chung
Ju-yung.

SANKYO, the Japanese drugs maker, boosted its non-consolidated pre-tax
profits for the first six months to September on brisk sales of its
anti-cholesterol drug.
Pre-tax profits for the first six months advanced by 27.8 per cent to
Y35.8bn (Dollars 291m) on a 13.1 per cent rise in sales to Y200.7bn.
After-tax profits rose 2.8 per cent to Y13.5bn.
Expanding sales of Mevalotin, Sankyo's mainstay, plus insecticides helped in
the company's strong performance, while sales of health drinks slumped on a
fall in consumer demand.
Sankyo will raise its interim dividend to Y5 per share from Y3.75.
For the full year to March, the company forecasts a 25.4 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y65bn on a 8.5 per cent increase in sales.
After-tax profits are expected to rise 10.5 per cent to Y25bn.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Slow growth in telephone traffic
hits KDD returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slowest growth in international telephone traffic from Japan for almost
35 years was the main factor behind a 5.1 per cent drop in half-year pre-tax
profits at Kokusai Denshin Denwa, the Japanese international
telecommunications group known as KDD.
The company's pre-tax profits for the six months to September were Y13.2bn
(Dollars 107m), about 5.1 per cent down on the same period last year.
KDD executives said the fall in profits was due largely to extremely slow
growth in telephone traffic from Japan, a reflection of the slowdown in the
economy.
The depression in the Japanese financial services sector, which has been
cutting back on its overseas activities to reduce costs, is thought to be
one factor behind the fall in call volumes.
KDD said international call volumes were just 1.6 per cent up on last year,
the worst rate of growth since there was a 4.3 per cent decline in 1958.
The company's overall sales in the first half of the year were 2.8 per cent
up at Y120.2bn. Income from its main telephone business fell 2.3 per cent,
largely because of the much slower growth in call volumes and a switch to
cheaper rate calls.
For the year as a whole, KDD expects cost-cutting measures to allow it to
make a pre-tax profit of about Y26bn, unchanged from last year on a 0.6 per
cent increase in sales to Y243bn.

post declines

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Petrochemicals and Mitsui Petrochemicals, two of Japan's leading
petrochemicals producers, yesterday reported sharp falls in profits as a
result of the sustained downturn in the Japanese economy.
Mitsubishi Petrochemicals, Japan's largest petrochemicals producer, reported
a 69.2 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y6bn (Dollars 48.7m) in the six
months to the end of September.
The company's sales were 10.4 per cent down at Y187bn. A fall in demand from
industrial customers was compounded by an average 13 per cent fall in
prices.
About 41 per cent of Mitsubishi Petrochemicals sales come from bulk
chemicals, such as plastics. It is Japan's largest producer of polystyrene
and polyethylene.
At the peak of the recent boom in the Japanese economy, Mitsubishi
Petrochemicals made a record annual pre-tax profit of Y54bn for 1989-90.
The company said sales of phenol fell by 15.5 per cent from the first half
of last year, while resin sales were 6.7 per cent down and sales of
special-use chemicals were 2.1 per cent down.
The sales downturn has made it harder for the company to cover the higher
depreciation cost of its investment in new facilities, such as the Kashima
ethylene plant, which is operating well below capacity.
Mitsubishi Petrochemicals is forecasting a Y15bn pre-tax profit for the year
as a whole, about 50 per cent down on last year on sales of 390bn down 4.2
per cent.
Mitsui Petrochemicals reported a 54.4 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to
Y3.6bn in the first half of the year.
Mitsui Petrochemicals, which exports about 16 per cent of its output, said
it had managed to contain the fall in its sales to 4.8 per cent largely
through increasing exports.
It said its domestic prices fell by 10 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SATOSHI Iue, president of Sanyo, the ailing Japanese electronics company
and the closest Japanese business acquaintance of US President-elect Bill
Clinton, yesterday fell victim to a rare boardroom coup.
Mr Iue is to become the group's chairman responsible for supervising the
group's overall business, while his successor as president, Mr Yasuaki
Takano, will concentrate on implementing a wide-ranging restructuring
programme at its main electronics businesses.
Mr Iue formed a close relationship with the incoming US president after
Sanyo became the first Japanese company to invest in Mr Clinton's state of
Arkansas. The Clintons have stayed at Mr Iue's home when visiting Japan. On
their most recent visit, Mr Iue guided them on a late-night tour of karaoke
bars in Osaka.
One measure of the scale of the crisis gripping Sanyo is the speed with
which the senior management changes are taking place. Mr Iue will step down
from the presidency on December 1. While Sanyo said he would act as a chief
executive supervising all the group's businesses, the chairman's role is
regarded as largely honorific in most companies.
Sanyo said it would launch a restructuring programme next month to give more
responsibility to each of its business sectors. The group has been hit by
the downturn in consumer demand and a slump in its industrial equipment
business.
Analysts expect Sanyo to incur an operating loss of Y10bn (Dollars 81.3m) in
the year to November, against operating profits of Y11.2bn a year earlier.
It has introduced pay cuts of up to 20 per cent for executives and reduced
bonuses for other staff. About 350 staff are being transferred from its
Osaka head office to sales and marketing departments.
Mr Iue is being replaced by Mr Yasuaki Takano, 61, Sanyo's vice president
since 1986.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Gap stock rises despite slide in
after-tax earnings
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in The Gap, one of the most highly regarded US specialty store
groups, rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 at close of trading yesterday,
despite news of a tumble in the third-quarter earnings to Dollars 62m after
tax.
In the same period of 1991, The Gap - which takes in the Banana Republic and
GapKids stores as well as its namesake chain - recorded a net profit of
Dollars 70.8m.
At the earnings per share level, the figure drops from 50 cents to 43 cents.
The third-quarter profits slip means The Gap has now produced after-tax
profits of Dollars 145m in the first nine months of 1992, compared with
Dollars 145.9m in the same period of 1991.
The company blamed the profits fall principally on additional advertising
expenditures and reduced merchandise margins, but it pointed out that all of
its divisions had been profitable during the three-month period.
The company, which is heavily committed to denim product, cut prices of
jeans during the summer, in an effort to cling on to market share.
Its stepped-up promotional programme resulted in a same-store sales rise of
7 per cent during the third quarter, and one of 5 per cent in the nine-month
period.
With the total number of stores operated by the company rising to 1,295 by
the end of the third quarter, compared with 1,201 a year earlier, The Gap's
sales were Dollars 827.2m, up from Dollars 702m in the latest three months.
For the nine months, sales advanced to Dollars 2.03bn, against Dollars
1.72bn last time.
The Gap's shares have fallen sharply this year after the heady gains scored
in 1991.
However, having feared the worst, analysts seemed reassured that The Gap's
management's commitment to protecting market share was paying off.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: St Paul to take write-down on
Minet
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ST PAUL Companies, the Minnesota-based property-casualty insurer, is
planning to write down the value of its large, but troubled London-based
insurance broking subsidiary, Minet Group, which was acquired by the US
parent in 1988.
St Paul said yesterday that it intended to take a write-down of a portion of
goodwill associated with the group as a non-cash charge against its
fourth-quarter earnings.
The US company did not specify the size of the write-down, but said this
would be 'material' and result in the operating loss for the group in both
the fourth quarter and for the year overall.
In the first nine months of 1992, the US company reported total operating
earnings of Dollars 92.5m.
St Paul bought out the 74 per cent of Minet which it did not already own for
around Dollars 515m in 1988. At the end of September this year, the carrying
value of Minet-related goodwill was put at Dollars 482m.
The Minnesota-based parent has made no secret of the problems within its
insurance broking division, which employs around 4,000 people and has about
100 branch offices, recently.
Reporting third-quarter results - which also bore the adverse impact of
Hurricane Andrew - Mr Douglas Leatherdale, St Paul's chairman, said that
Minet had proved 'a major disappointment', and generated 'substantial'
losses in the first nine months of the year.
On a pre-tax basis, Minet's deficit was put at Dollars 32.1m for the third
quarter, and Dollars 51.7m for the first three quarters.
As a result, efforts to restructure the Minet business are underway.
According to St Paul, these concentrate on reducing the number of
profit-centres, so that back-office facilities and support staff can be
streamlined; putting more emphasis on a 'country-based' structure, rather
than operating by product line; and also emphasising specific, specialised
product areas, such as professional liability.
Nevertheless, some analysts have cautioned against expecting a rapid
turnround in the brokerage business, given the weakness of premium volume in
international insurance markets.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Carrier awaits decision on
rescue package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government is facing a tough decision over whether to support a
rescue package for ailing Canadian Airlines International.
Ministers are torn between rival commercial and regional interests. Their
decision is likely to be a key factor in determining the outcome of the
increasingly desperate battle for survival between the country's two leading
airlines, Calgary-based Canadian and Air Canada of Montreal.
A group of Canadian Airlines employees, backed by management and regional
interest groups in western Canada, has asked Ottawa and various provincial
governments to guarantee up to CDollars 290m (USDollars 241.6m) in loans to
the airline. The loans are required to meet conditions set by American
Airlines for an alliance with Canadian, which would include a minority stake
for the US carrier.
The American investment, which would be combined with a partial buy-out by
Canadian's employees, appears to be the loss-making carrier's last hope.
Merger talks between Canadian and Air Canada collapsed last week. Canadian
has warned if talks with American fail, it will have little choice but to
file for bankruptcy protection.
Canadian's requests for government support are opposed by Air Canada, which
is losing about CDollars 1m a day. Air Canada's chairman Mr Claude Taylor
said his airline should also receive a bail-out, if one is offered to its
competitor.
Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems, the Canadian reservations
system, has filed a CDollars 1bn lawsuit against PWA, alleging 'breach of
its fiduciary responsibilities as a partner in Gemini'. It also filed a
CDollars 500m suit against PWA, its Canadian Airlines unit, AMR, and AMR's
American Airline subsidiary, claiming 'unlawful interference with Gemini's
economic interests'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese carmaker, reported pre-tax profits of
Y224m (Dollars 1.8m) for the first half, its first profit in three years and
a sign that a restructuring overseen by Nissan Motor has increased
profitability.
In the year-earlier period the company reported taxable losses of Y2.4bn.
First-half sales rose by only 1.3 per cent to Y399.86bn from Y394.76bn,
though the company still reported after-tax losses of Y274m against losses
of Y2.4bn.
However, Fuji Heavy, which makes Subaru cars, said profitability had
improved because of a cost-cutting programme. The company remains under
pressure because of the weakness of the domestic car market, a problem also
afflicting Nissan Motor, which has a 4.2 per cent stake in Fuji and has
consigned production to the company.
The volume of Fuji Heavy sales fell 9 per cent to 235,000 units during the
period, reflecting the difficult market conditions, in particular the
weakness in demand for mini-cars, which has been affected by stricter
Japanese parking regulations.
For the full year to end-March, Fuji Heavy is forecasting a 9 per cent
increase in sales to Y900bn, and pre-tax and after-tax profits of Y1bn,
revised down from a previous estimate of Y2bn.
Last year, the company reported pre-tax losses of Y4bn.

<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the diversified Australian mining group, plans to concentrate
on reducing costs to offset price falls for its main products of copper,
lead and zinc, Reuter reports from Brisbane.
Mr Norm Fussell, chief executive and managing director, told the group's
annual meeting that the Australian and world recessions appeared to have
some distance to run.
'We cannot, therefore, anticipate substantial rises in prices for MIM's main
products in the short term,' he said. 'Recent falls in copper, lead and zinc
prices confirm this.
'MIM must concentrate on reducing costs, thereby improving its competitive
position against other producers worldwide.'
Mr Fussell said costs at the group's Mount Isa and Hilton copper, lead, zinc
and silver operations had been cut by about ADollars 80m (USDollars 57.1m) a
year since a concerted cost-cutting campaign began 18 months ago.
He said MIM's net profits for the three months to September 20 of ADollars
29m, up from losses of ADollars 3.5m a year earlier, was due to cost
reductions at the group's main operations and low-cost gold mines.
'Gold will continue to be very important for MIM,' Mr Fussell said, adding
that MIM was also planning to expand its copper output.
'In exploration, the search for copper has highest priority, particularly in
north-west Queensland, Papua New Guinea and Chile,' Mr Fussell said.

<TEXT>
THE New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), the world's largest energy market,
will remain in New York City.
The Nymex board voted late on Tuesday to move the exchange to a building at
390 Greenwich Street in Manhattan. The move is scheduled for late 1994. The
Greenwich Street property, built in 1986 and specifically designed for
technology intensive use, is owned by the American Express unit Shearson
Lehman Brothers.
Nymex's decision to stay is a boon for New York City, which is struggling
financially.
Mr Carl Weisbrod, president of New York's Economic Development Corporation,
declined to give details of the incentives the city offered Nymex to remain.
However, he said they included funds for building renovation, special tax
benefits, and an agreement for subsidised power.
Nymex pays Dollars 75m in city and state taxes each year.
The new address is just a few blocks away from the site where the Nymex's
sister exchanges, the Commodity Exchange, The New York Futures Exchange, and
the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange are negotiating to build a facility.
All four of New York's futures exchanges are now jammed into a single
25,000-foot trading floor in the World Trade Center. Seeking to relieve the
congestion, the exchanges discussed leaving New York entirely and relocating
to New Jersey, where costs were believed to be lower.
That plan was abandoned last year.
Nymex broke off from the group after a series of disagreements and since
then has been searching for its own premises.
Last year 27.8m futures and options contracts changed hands at Nymex. A
majority of those were in the exchange's crude oil futures pit, which is
used to price oil transactions worldwide.

POWER Financial, the financial services group controlled by Montreal
financier Mr Paul Desmarais, unveiled a profits advance to CDollars 163.8m
(USDollars 136.5m) or CDollars 1.87 a share in the first nine months. This
compares with CDollars 129m or CDollars 1.43 a year earlier.
Consolidated revenues were little changed at CDollars 4.2bn,
The Great-West Lifeco made an increased contribution, as did Investors
Group. Pargesa, the European holding company jointly owned with the Frere
Group of Belgium, contributed CDollars 26.3m to Power Financial's earnings.
The latest period included a CDollars 61.5m special gain taken in the second
quarter, resulting from a stock issue by Investors Group.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 28m or 31 cents a share, against CDollars
37m or 41 cents a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 1.39bn, little
changed.
United Westburne, the North American plumbing, heating and electrical goods
wholesaler controlled by Dumez of France, suffered a third-quarter loss of
CDollars 330,000 or 1 cent a share, against a profit of CDollars 2.7m or 7
cents.
Sales were CDollars 579m, down nearly 4 per cent, due to the sale of the
Memphis division.
The nine-month loss was CDollars 7.9m or 21 cents, including a Dollars 2m
loss from discontinued operations, against a loss of CDollars 4m or 11
cents. Sales for the period were little changed at CDollars 1.6bn.

THOMSON Corporation, the international publishing and travel group, lifted
third-quarter earnings by 9 per cent. But the Canadian-owned company warned
that its performance was being held back by slow holiday bookings in the UK
and the poor newspaper market in Ontario.
Much of the improvement in earnings came from the group's US publishing
interests. Despite a lacklustre performance by Thomson's UK regional
newspapers, operating profits of the information and publishing division
jumped by 19 per cent after amortisation charges.
The company has also been helped by a substantial drop in financing charges,
including lower preferred share dividends.
Total third-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 221m, or 38 cents a share,
from Dollars 202m, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 1.94bn
from Dollars 1.76bn.
Thomson Travel's operating income rose fractionally to Dollars 150m, with a
9 per cent rise in summer packaged-tour volumes being offset by fierce
discounting.
October departures were 'weak' and holiday bookings for the coming winter
season are below the level at this time last year. Summer 1993 bookings have
also started slowly.
Thomson Newspapers, which includes the group's US and Canadian papers,
reported third-quarter operating profit of Dollars 34m, almost unchanged
from last year. But advertising lineage in the first nine months was 2.7 per
cent lower in the US and 5.8 per cent down in Canada. The newspaper
operations benefited in the third quarter from lower newsprint costs and
various belt-tightening measures.
Thomson noted in general that 'economic conditions remained depressed in
both Canada and the UK, and the very modest recovery in the US has not to
date materially benefited the markets in which we operate'.

CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, the state-controlled Austrian bank, hopes to post
an unchanged partial operating profit this year following a modest setback
during the first nine months of 1992, Reuter reports from Vienna.
'We are optimistic that we will be able to achieve a partial operating
profit at Creditanstalt this year in line with last year as a result of
tight cost management,' the bank said in a letter to share-holders.
Improved results from the bank's trading on its own account should ensure
that Creditanstalt's total operating profit rises against last year, the
bank said.
Nine-month partial operating profits slipped by 8 per cent to Sch1.33bn
(Dollars 118.64m). Operating profits improved by 3 per cent to Sch2.2bn.
Increased credit risks, especially among Austrian borrowers, mean that net
profits will fall short of last year, the letter continued.
Creditanstalt said operating conditions had been very difficult, but that it
had taken measures to improve earnings by increasing account fees and by
pushing since August to widen interest rate margins.

SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile is to receive a capital injection of between SKr2bn
and SKr3bn (Dollars 335m-Dollars 503m) in the next few months, according to
Saab-Scania, which jointly owns the company with General Motors of the US.
Mr Lars Kylberg, president of Saab-Scania, said the final amount would be
decided in December once Saab Automobile has finalised its new business
plan.
The motor group announced a wide-ranging rationalisation plan on Monday,
including 2,000 job cuts, in order to save SKr2bn.
In June 1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr5.5bn in Saab, which has made
losses for the last three years, and doubts have been expressed about the
extent to which they would continue to provide support.
'This will be last time,' said Mr Kylberg yesterday.
The hope is that the capital injection, together with the cost-cutting
measures and the launch of the group's new model next year, will provide the
basis for Saab's return to profitability. The group made a SKr1.3bn loss in
the first nine months of 1992 and says it expects to make a loss of more
than SKr2bn in the full year.
Volvo will delay but not cancel plans to invest some SKr500m in a Polish
joint venture, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
A spokesman said negotiations to build a new plant in Poland are continuing.
Volvo had hoped for a final agreement by the end of this year, but this will
not now happen. The spokesman did not give any new timetable.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sega surges 83% on strong sales

SEGA Enterprises, the Japanese electronic games maker, continued its
remarkable rate of growth during the first half, when sales surged 91 per
cent and pre-tax profits advanced 83 per cent.
The company said sales of home-use video games doubled during the half, in
which it made greater inroads into the Japanese market share of the main
competitor, Nintendo, which has traditionally dominated the domestic market.
While many other leading Japanese companies' assets are shrinking and their
profits falling, Sega has doubled in size over the past year, even though it
was forced to pay Dollars 43m in a US patent dispute.
Pre-tax profits for the half were Y27.4bn (Dollars 221m), compared with
Y14.9bn for the same period last year, while sales were Y167.3bn against
Y87.49bn. Net profits rose 72 per cent to Y13.77bn from Y8.01bn, and the
company is to pay an interim dividend of Y12 a share, up from Y7 last year.
Sega also runs amusement arcades in Japan, and reported that sales in this
sector rose from Y18.7bn last year to Y28.3bn. The company has profited from
a shift towards cheaper amusements as the domestic economy has slowed.
The company maintained momentum in international markets after having scored
unexpected victories against Nintendo last Christmas in the US. Domestic
sales, which account for about 45 per cent of revenue, have also risen on
the success of new games.
For the full year, Sega is forecasting a 50 per cent increase in sales to
Y320bn, and a pre-tax profits of Y50.3bn, also 50 per cent higher.

<TEXT>
SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, suffered a 6 per
cent fall in earnings to DM201m (Dollars 125.60m) for the first nine months
of 1992, on turnover up 2 per cent to DM4.89bn.
The company blamed the setback on lagging sales of agro-chemicals and
exchange rate-induced losses by foreign subsidiaries.
Full-year earnings are expected to be slightly higher once gains from the
sale of Schering's industrial chemicals, natural substances and
electro-plating divisions are included, the company said.
The disposals were made in order to concentrate on pharmaceuticals and
agro-chemicals, the most profitable sectors.
While pharmaceuticals sales rose 10 per cent to DM2.9bn, turnover in
agro-chemicals dropped 12 per cent to DM1.07bn. Sales of industrial
chemicals increased by 2 per cent to DM894m. Schering's overall sales were
up 6 per cent in Germany and were 11 per cent higher abroad.
Earlier this month Schering concluded the sale of its chemicals and natural
substances divisions to the Witco chemicals company of New York for DM660m.
It was financed by banks in the US, Germany, the UK and Spain.
Last August Schering sold its electro-plating division to the Elf group in
France.
Mr William Toller, Witco chairman, said the company's competitive position
would be greatly strengthened in Europe, where it gained two former Schering
production plants in Germany as well as factories in France, Italy, Spain
and the UK, in addition to plants in the US and Ecuador.

<TEXT>
TELEVISION and Telecasters (TTL), the holding company for Australia's
Channel Ten television network, yesterday announced net profits of ADollars
15.2m (USDollars 10.51m) for the 50 weeks to end-September.
The result marks a significant recovery for the network, which went into
receivership in 1990 and is now owned by Westpac Banking Corporation,
formerly its biggest creditor.
Westpac is in the process of completing a deal to sell the network to a
consortium led by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting
company which also owns a majority stake in New Zealand's TV3 network.
TTL, which controls programming for the network and operates three east
coast stations, reported a profit of ADollars 28m before interest and tax,
representing a gross return of 11 per cent on sales.
Mr Gary Rice, managing director, said the result was achieved in spite of
difficult trading conditions caused by slow economic growth.
He said he was confident the network could maintain its improved performance
in the current year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Unilever freezes managers' pay
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, said yesterday that it is
to freeze the maximum pay scales of its 2,000 managers and assistant
managers based in the Netherlands.
The move reflects similar wage measures at some other Dutch companies and
uncertainty about the outlook for the domestic economy.
The company said that the wage freeze would be limited to managers in the
Netherlands and would not be extended to staff at either its British arm or
in other parts of the world.
Of Unilever's 2,000 managerial staff in the Netherlands, around 600 will be
directly affected by the freeze because they already receive the maximum
salary in their scale.
The other 1,400 managers will receive an as yet undetermined salary rise.
Unilever has a total Dutch workforce of 9,500.
A Unilever spokesman said that maximum pay scales for managers may be raised
later in 1993, depending on the economic conditions in the Netherlands and
the pay trend for similar jobs at other companies.
Pay scales for Unilever's Dutch managers are normally raised on January 1.
The spokesman said that the freeze 'has nothing to do with the situation at
Unilever itself'.
Last week, Unilever reported a 4 per cent increase in third-quarter net
profit in guilder terms and an 8 per cent rise in sterling terms.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rexmore, the Liverpool-based contract furnishing and timber group, saw
pre-tax profits tumble to Pounds 202,000 in the 27 weeks to October 3.
The fall from last time's Pounds 639,000 came on turnover of Pounds 20.1m
(Pounds 22.7m).
Directors said the decline was mainly attributable to the discontinuance of
the Albert H Letheren business and difficult conditions in the rest of the
timber operations.
The division incurred an operating deficit of Pounds 103,000 against profits
of Pounds 300,000. Turnover was Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 5.95m).
In contrast, the contract furnishing side held up well with operating
profits of Pounds 829,000 (Pounds 863,000) from turnover of Pounds 13.5m
(Pounds 13.1m).
Earnings per share dipped to 0.95p (2.69p). The interim dividend is
maintained at 0.7p.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Staveley edges ahead and expects better
second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAVELEY Industries, the measuring and mechanical engineering company which
also owns British Salt, yesterday reported a slight increase in interim
profits and said the second half should be stronger.
Pre-tax profits edged up from Pounds 9m in the 27 weeks to October 5 last
year to Pounds 9.1m in the slightly shorter 26 week period to October 3.
Mr Brian Kent, chairman, said he expected second half gains from higher salt
prices, and a return to profit at the measurement division's new German
factory. But overall the mood remained cautious, he said.
Turnover increased by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 156m, helped by a stronger than
expected performance from mechanical and electrical services. Orders
increased by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 162m and the company said export orders,
especially to China and eastern Europe, showed gains.
British Salt saw a slight fall in profits because of a shorter reporting
period and a delayed 5 per cent price increase. Mr Kent said a cold winter
usually added Pounds 500,000 to profits because salt was used to clear
frozen pavements.
Mechanical and electrical engineering, which mainly sells to the recession
affected construction industry, increased orders but margins were affected.
Mr Roy Hitchens, who joined as chief executive last month, said bad debts
were not significant.
The measurement division, which includes Salter, Weigh-Tronix and Chronos
Richardson, was helped by an improvement in the US market.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 700,000) due to low US
interest rates.
The company did not reveal its level of borrowings but Mr Kent did say
gearing was 'in the low 20s' and would end the year 'in the mid 20s'
compared with 12 per cent at its last year-end.
Earnings fell to 6p (6.3p) while an unchanged dividend of 2.3p is declared.
The shares, which have risen from 162p in July, fell 8p to 207p.
COMMENT
Staveley may be slightly disappointed that its upbeat presentation to
analysts failed to lift the shares. Mounting order levels, and the company's
apparent ability to weather recession in the construction industry, should
have impressed. News that Germany must be nearly back to break-even was also
promising. But analysts were caught off guard by a higher-than-expected rise
in gearing. After the shares' recent rise, the market was probably also
looking for a chance to take profits. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 25m put
the shares on a p/e of 12.5, which does not look too demanding. But there
are lingering concerns about the outlook for construction. And with new
arrival Mr Hitchens still something of an unknown quantity, the shares could
go sideways awhile yet.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dividend windfall for McLeod Russel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCLEOD RUSSEL Holdings, the paints group with interests in property and
textiles, defied recession in the year to September 30 with a 17 per cent
increase in profits thanks to cost cutting and a windfall dividend receipt.
Pre-tax profit climbed from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 5.19m. Turnover was
static at Pounds 43.4m, but improving margins led to an increase in
operating profit to Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 3.31m).
Mr Paul Humphreys, finance director, said the group received an unexpected
Pounds 480,000 dividend from a long-standing investment in Moray Petroleum,
an oil exploration company. This was unlikely to recur in coming years.
The streamlining of the vehicle painting, wood stains, marine painting and
paint distribution operations, with the creation of a paints division, would
lead to further cost savings, he added.
Mr Humphreys said the group had net cash reserves of Pounds 10m, and was
seeking a suitable acquisition to give the business 'a third leg', possibly
in the engineering sector.
Although sales were flat, profitability at Granyte Surface Coatings, the
wood stains and lacquers offshoot, jumped 25 per cent while Kennedy
Wagstaff, the textile machinery company, moved back into the black.
Earnings per share rose to 8p (6.81p); the final dividend is raised to 3.25p
for a total of 6p (5.85p).

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Plysu managing director quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Gordon, managing director of Plysu, the manufacturer of plastic
bottles, resigned yesterday after a boardroom coup led by non-executive
directors.
Mr Stephen Nobbs, the finance director, said that following the group's June
expansion into Europe with the acquisition of SEP Group, there was a need
for greater delegation of decision-making.
'The centralised management style led to bottlenecks with the one person
having to take every single decision at the top,' Mr Nobbs said.
Mr Gordon had recognised the need for changes but had been unable to put
them in place, said Mr Alan Brooker, a non-executive director. The problem
had been looming since the SEP acquisition.
Plysu was developing into a company with sales of Pounds 100m from eight
production sites and was no longer suitable for management style centred
around one person.
Plysu's shares fell 22p to 243p.
Mr Gordon had agreed to limit his public reaction to a statement that there
had been 'a serious disagreement with the chairman (Mr James Summerlin)'. Mr
Gordon and Mr Summerlin are both substantial shareholders and jointly helped
develop Plysu over the past two decades.
Plysu brought forward the announcement of its interim results by three weeks
as a result of Mr Gordon's resignation.
Pre-tax profits in the period to October 9 rose 21 per cent to Pounds 5.81m
on sales up by 19 per cent at Pounds 42.45m.
Earnings per share rose 17 per cent to 8.4p and the interim dividend is
increased from 1.65p to 2p.
Mr Malcolm Macintyre, production director, has been appointed acting
managing director while a successor to Mr Gordon is found.
COMMENT
Before yesterday Plysu was successfully following a well-thought out
strategy. It was developing new products and pushing into continental
Europe. Steady profits and earnings increases had given the company a
deserved premium rating. Maybe none of this has changed. But the resignation
has been accompanied by the suppression of Mr Gordon's side of what happened
which does few shareholders any service. If neither the profit and loss
account nor the balance sheet nor the European expansion strategy are
off-track, then why such a precipitate departure? At best it is a graceless
parting of the ways; at worse something darker lurks. Shareholders who have
enjoyed a good ride may decide to get off and watch for a while, even though
forecasts for the year give profits of Pounds 12m and earnings of 6.75p.

Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers yesterday reported a 30 per cent rise in
first-half profits.
However, a warning from the publishing, printing and retailing group about
prospects for the second half left the shares 22p lower at 483p.
The company said the start to the second half had been disappointing and it
did not expect to achieve the same results as in the comparable period.
Sales in the 26 weeks to September 26 rose from Pounds 48m to Pounds 52.3m.
After reduced interest payable of Pounds 43,000 (Pounds 296,000) pre-tax
profits came out at Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 2.6m).
In the year to March 28 1992 profits decreased to Pounds 4.39m (Pounds
5.28m) after redundancy costs.
Acquisitions helped lift publishing revenue in the first half by 9 per cent
to Pounds 24.6m; without their contribution the increase was only 3 per
cent.
The opening of another three stores brought the number of One Stop Community
Stores to 72, which contributed Pounds 800,000 to profits.
The interim dividend is raised to 2.84p (2.73p) on earnings per share of
20.2p (14.4p).

FT  13 NOV 92 / Irish Company News: Bank of Ireland jumps 69% as US and UK
losses are reduced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANK OF Ireland, the Republic's second largest clearing bank, yesterday
reported a 69 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to IPounds 65.8m (Pounds
72.4m) in the half year to September 30, up from IPounds 38.6m at the
interim stage last time.
Mr Paul D'Alton, group financial officer, said 80 per cent of the
improvement had come through loss reductions in the bank's US and UK
divisions, while the 20 per cent growth in income to IPounds 409m was
largely a result of the incorporation of last year's acquisitions of
Amoskeag and BankEast banks in the US, into its First New Hampshire
subsidiary.
Retail profits in Ireland advanced 15 per cent to IPounds 70.6m, while those
from corporate and treasury operations rose 18 per cent to IPounds 35.2m. UK
losses were reduced by 48 per cent to IPounds 5.3m, while losses at FHN were
cut back by 22 per cent to IPounds 27.3m.
Mr Pat Molloy, group chief executive, said: 'We have had solid performance
in our Irish-based business, and given the prevailing market conditions we
believe we have done very well.' He said business prospects in the UK 'were,
and still are very bleak", while any improvements in the US market 'will be
very gradual and are not very perceptible'.
The bank has writen down 'to a realistic value' its 940,000 shares in GPA
Group, the aircraft lessor in talks with its bankers. Mr D'Alton declined to
give the new value of its 0.41 per cent stake but said 'Any further
write-down will not have a material impact on our results'.
Loan loss provisions have been held at IPounds 72m (IPounds 70.4m), of which
IPounds 42.6m relates to the New Hampshire market and collapse in property
values there. Mr D'Alton said the bank had decided 'to grasp the nettle' in
making, from the IPounds 42.6m, a IPounds 21.6m provision for market decline
there.
Hilco, an FNH subsidiary to which its problem property debts have been
transferred, has had the carrying value of its repossessed properties
reduced from Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) to Dollars 21m by sales and
write-downs, and which includes an additional Dollars 50m in transfers over
the past year from FNH's books.
Mr Molloy said he was not 'particularly pessimistic' about current high
interest rates in Ireland. 'If these persist, however, then that has to be
worrying.'
An unchanged interim dividend of 3.33p is declared out of earnings per share
up 34 per cent at 7.1p.
COMMENT
Bank of Ireland's ill-timed foray into the New Hampshire banking market in
1988 has cost it well over Dollars 500m in losses and write-offs, but there
are hopeful signs that the corner has been turned. The millstone of FNH's
failed property loans is being lightened, while rationalisation and
acquisition of new plug-on retail banking assets in the New Hampshire market
gives FNH a commanding 25 per cent market share with a wholly renovated loan
portfolio. Good domestic retail performance and well-run treasury operations
during the September currency crisis have made a strong contribution this
time round. The only real worry is whether high interest rates will push the
Irish economy into recession next year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: FKI improves 19% to Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FKI, the electrical engineering group, reversed its profits decline with a
19 per cent interim increase from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 16m before tax.
Four of its five divisions made progress and interest costs were cut.
The share price gained 6p to close at 88p, the highest level since early
1990.
A year ago FKI announced the halving of its interim pre-tax profit and
dividend and the resignation of its chief executive. The board has since
been strengthened by the recruitment as managing director of Mr Bob Beeston
from BTR.
Turnover in the six months to September 30 fell from Pounds 371.1m to Pounds
332.2m, while operating profit reached Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 18.5m). The
previous year's figures included Pounds 20.1m sales and Pounds 800,000
profit arising from different rates of exchange; 53 per cent of sales lie in
North America. Ongoing businesses raised their operating profit contribution
from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 18.8m at constant exchange rates. Interest costs
fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 2.8m. Debt was cut from Pounds 60m in March to
Pounds 50m in September.
Mr Beeston has set a target of getting a 10 per cent return on sales across
the group. He said that an average of 9.6 per cent had been achieved at
subsidiaries accounting for nearly two thirds of sales. 'We have to get the
rest right.'
Process control was the only division to go backwards with operating profit
falling from Pounds 5.87m to Pounds 3.7m on sales of Pounds 82.5m (Pounds
95.6m). It included two loss-makers in computer peripherals and cutting
tools.
Material handling improved profit from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 4.54m on sales
of Pounds 82m (Pounds 85.8m). Two North American loss-makers had been
brought back to profit. One area of concern was British Coal's pit closure
plan which could cost Pounds 8m sales next year.
Hardware, virtually all in North America, improved operating profit by 10
per cent to Pounds 7.1m in spite of adverse exchange rates on same-again
sales of Pounds 62.5m.
The automotive division was returned to a Pounds 218,000 profit from a
Pounds 614,000 loss on Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 66.7m) sales. It had suffered
some disruption after factory closures but should experience a better second
half, Mr Beeston said. Engineering, UK-based and mainly supplying niche
markets, raised profit by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m with the help of export
growth.
Earnings per share rose to 2.65p (2.2p) and the interim dividend goes up to
1.2p (1p).
COMMENT
Results at the top end of expectations and a welcome revival of the dividend
confirmed the view that the revamped management has taken the group by the
scruff of the neck. It still has its work cut out to increase operating
margins from less than 6 to 10 per cent, and further refining of the group
through disposals is part of the plan. The itch to acquire is also there,
although the paint is still a bit wet on the new-found credibility to allow
it to do anything big just yet. Signs of recovery in the US should help
progress to continue. Pre-tax profit is forecast to recover from Pounds
30.5m to Pounds 37m-Pounds 38m for the full year, giving a prospective p/e
of just over 14 which looks about right after a substantial re-rating this
year.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Second half lifts Burton to Pounds 9.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Burton Group jumped 25 per cent to 55p yesterday as the fashion
retailer announced a return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.4m
for the year to August 29 and maintained its final dividend.
The profits, which compared with a loss of Pounds 13.4m last time, were
struck on turnover 6 per cent higher at Pounds 1.76bn and were helped by the
absence of last year's Pounds 24.6m exceptional reorganisation costs.
Nevertheless, analysts said the results were much better than expected,
especially with the welcome decision to change the accounting treatment of
the property development portfolio. The Pounds 4.2m in property holding
costs - net of rents received - were included above the line for the first
time.
Mr John Hoerner, who became chief executive in February, said there was much
work yet to be done to improve the company's performance. Trading profits
before exceptionals had declined from Pounds 46.2m to Pounds 35.3m, with
Pounds 3m of the decline due to the sale of Harvey Nichols. 'No one is
kidding themselves that this is a wonderful performance, because it isn't'
At the interim stage profits halved to Pounds 2.2m. However, the group was
encouraged by the substantial progress of the second half. The final pay-out
was maintained at 1p, for a lower full-year total of 2p (2.7p). Earnings per
share were 0.8p against losses of 2p.
The year had been 'a story of two halves,' Mr Hoerner said. 'In the second
half, very cautiously and very quietly, we have turned the corner.'
During the latter part of the year, Burtons moved from a trading loss of
Pounds 17.4m to profits of Pounds 2.7m. Sales in the second half improved by
14 per cent to Pounds 830m, with same space sales 15 per cent ahead.
The improvement was partly due to a significant restocking. The board also
decided not to be beaten on prices, which contributed to a fall in gross
margins from 2.8 per cent to 2 per cent. However, market share improved to
more than 12 per cent (11 per cent).
The best performance came from Debenhams, with trading profits of Pounds
31.1m, and Dorothy Perkins, the women's wear retailer. The multiples
business was hit by disappointing performances from Principles and Burton
men's wear.
COMMENT
Mr Hoerner has done much in this set of results to dispel the shadows of
recent years. However, it must be noted that 1990-91 had been an appallingly
bad year and the achievement compared with 'a very easy base' in the words
of one analyst. The road to real recovery is sure be long and hard before
profits are anything like respectable for a company with almost Pounds 2bn
in sales. The good news is that Mr Hoerner is under no illusions about this
and he appears to be doing all the right things. The question now is whether
the gains will be short or long-term. Many potential investors will be
watching the interims with more than ordinary interest before plunging in.
Forecasts are for Pounds 25m next year. The p/e of 32, based on an uncertain
tax charge of 25 per cent, might look expensive at the moment. However, the
yield could attract investors in the short term.

On Sunday morning huge cranes will rumble through the Somerset village of
Street to remove one of its most famous landmarks. C&amp;J Clark, Britain's
biggest shoe maker, is selling the giant Henry Moore sculpture which graces
the lawns of its headquarters, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The 3 1/2 -tonne bronze sculpture, entitled Sheep Piece, is thought to have
been sold for about Pounds 2m.
Although the buyer remains anonymous, it is believed that the sculpture will
go abroad.
Clark intends to commission another sculpture to sit in its planned retail

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water shows 25% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT PROFITS and rises in water charges allowed Northumbrian Water to
lift half-year pre-tax profits by 25 per cent, from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds
39.2m, despite rising debt and the impact of recession on recent
acquisitions.
Profit included a one-off gain of Pounds 7.3m from the maturity of its
equities portfolio. That helped push earnings per share up by 27 per cent to
56.7p (44.8p), allowing the interim dividend to rise to 7.5p (6.8p).
Mr Michael Taylor, finance director, said the recession had been
'noticeable' in the north-east of England but although commercial demand for
treated water had fallen by about 3 per cent in the six months to September
30, this category accounted for only a small part of revenue.
Turnover from the core regulated water and sewerage businesses rose to
Pounds 93.4m (Pounds 84.4m) after a 10 per cent rise in water charges,
allowing operating profit to rise by 29 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds
21.2m).
Turnover in non-regulated water businesses - the Keilder reservoir and the
supply of untreated water to industry - rose to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 10.5m)
following an increase in charges, but operating profits were squeezed to
Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.6m).
Other turnover rose to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 3.1m), mainly from acquisitions
of water services and leasing companies. They were hard hit by recession and
operating profit rose only to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.3m).
Associated companies - the joint venture bid to open a new sewage sludge
treatment plant - again cost Pounds 100,000. The Department of the
Environment has turned down the project's appeal and the group will now have
to investigate incineration schemes.
Net interest payable was Pounds 3.5m, compared to Pounds 3.2m receivable.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 52m and acquisitions of Pounds 7m in the first
half took net debt to Pounds 54.4m, compared to Pounds 85.8m cash in
September 1991 and Pounds 6.1m net cash in March 1992.
Sir Michael Straker, chairman, said that he welcomed the stability given by
the recent agreement with Ofwat, the water industry regulator, to allow
increases in charges of 6 per cent above inflation in 1993-4 and of 7 per
cent the following year.
COMMENT
The eye-catching increase in pre-tax profits owes even more to
Northumbrian's investment fund than to its core businesses. That fund is now
wound up, net cash has become net debt, and growing interest bills will
begin to restrain profits growth. The group's attractions remain its larger
than average non-regulated businesses and high dividend cover. But if the
National Rivers Authority chooses to take a stringent interpretation of the
EC Urban Waste Water Directive that could double the annual capital spending
bill. That uncertainty, the likelihood of tighter regulation after Ofwat's
1994 industry review, and the strong performance of the shares so far this
year may mean that short term performance is dull.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: International publishing boost for
Euromoney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROMONEY Publications, the publisher of specialist magazines, yesterday
reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.8m in the
year to September 30.
The company warned, however, that first-quarter revenues were likely to be
down on last time because 'upheavals in foreign exchange markets, Europe's
political difficulties and the emerging troubles of many international banks
have weakened confidence'.
Euromoney, 76 per cent of which is owned by the Daily Mail and General
Trust, said it achieved record results from international financial
publishing, with a sharp rise in revenues from central and eastern Europe.
Euromoney said that regional magazines in Latin America and Asia also
produced record results, as did energy, law and tax publishing and database
and information services. Publications in the aviation and leasing sectors
continued to suffer from the recession in their markets.
Operating profits rose by 47 per cent to Pounds 11.6m and earnings by 33 per
cent to 44.4p a share. A final dividend of 21.5p makes a total of 29.5p
(22.5p).
Since the half year Euromoney has bought four companies for a total of
Pounds 1.9m, including Asia Law and Practice and Mundy Perry, publishers of
a port operators' and users journal.
The best Euromoney performer was international financial publishing, with
operating profit up from Pounds 6.05m to Pounds 8.78m followed by law and
tax publishing up from Pounds 899,000 to Pounds 1.28m.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Shell Transport up 58% to Pounds 824m -
Sterling devaluation bolsters Anglo/Dutch oil group's third quarter
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE CURRENCY gains after the devaluation of sterling helped Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, increase its third quarter
profits by 58 per cent to Pounds 824m.
The profits increase on a replacement cost basis, which strips out the
effect of stockholding gains and losses, was higher than analysts' forecasts
and the share price rose 12p to 549p.
However, net income on a historic cost basis showed a slightly smaller
increase of 38 per cent to Pounds 783m.
Despite the strong third quarter, replacement cost profits for the first
nine months of 1992 were down slightly at Pounds 2.26bn (Pounds 2.4bn).
Sir Peter Holmes, chairman, said fourth quarter earnings were expected to
benefit from a seasonal increase in natural gas sales, and higher oil
production after the completion of North Sea maintenance programmes.
He admitted that foreign currency earnings were higher than expected at
Pounds 196m compared with Pounds 67m currency losses in the third quarter of
1991 when sterling appreciated against the dollar. Tax benefits and related
interest contributed a further Pounds 80m.
'The figures are littered with exceptional items, both credits and debits,
but the underlying performance was pretty much as we expected,' said Mr Nick
Clayton, analyst at Smith New Court.
Mr Clayton said an 18 per cent reduction in capital expenditure might be
evidence of strict discipline on spending, but did not reflect any reduction
in Shell's ability to spend. Surplus cashflow allowed the company to pay off
Pounds 750m during the third quarter and reduce gearing to 5 per cent.
Third quarter turnover was down slightly from Pounds 18.94bn to Pounds
17.72bn, but earnings from exploration and production beat expectations at
Pounds 389m (Pounds 316m). Results were boosted by higher crude oil and
natural gas prices, and production was slightly higher at 2.11m barrels a
day.
However, the refining and marketing division suffered a Pounds 65m fall in
earnings to Pounds 303m. Analysts said the decline was not as large as had
been feared, with continued pressures on refining margins offset by a better
performance from marketing.
Further deterioration in the petrochemicals market thanks to weak economic
conditions was blamed for the chemical division's slide into a Pounds 40m
loss (profit Pounds 12m).
The coal and metals divisions also recorded losses compared with small
profits last year.
Earnings per share rose to 8.1p from a restated 5.9p.
COMMENT
Even without the currency gains and other credits, these results underline
Shell's strength. Fourth quarter earnings should benefit from higher natural
gas sales and a higher sterling oil price, with the dollar's strength
against the pound more than offsetting the recent slide in dollar crude
prices. But the downturn in refining, marketing and chemicals is likely to
continue, and Shell is expected to make a provision of Pounds 400m-Pounds
450m to comply with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's statement
106, which requires companies to show their future healthcare obligations to
retirees, rather than what they are actually paying out in any given year.
However, Shell should still outperform the market on earnings and dividend
growth over the medium term, and is seen as a good devaluation hedge as the
link with Royal Dutch means that as sterling weakens against the guilder,
the dividend rises to compensate.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: John Waddington moves ahead 18% to Pounds
7.76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WADDINGTON, the packaging, printing and games company, reported higher
interim profits, helped by the absence of exceptional charges.
Pre-tax profits increased by 17.6 per cent to Pounds 7.76m in the 26 weeks
to October 3, up from Pounds 6.59m in the corresponding period last year
when profits were reduced by a Pounds 1.04m charge in exceptional costs to
cover redundancy and relocation costs.
Earnings per share increased to 7p (6.12p), and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 3.6p.
Despite 'extremely difficult trading conditions' sales volumes increased in
most businesses and margins improved in all three divisions. The margin gain
was attributed to the group's capital investment programme and savings
produced by last year's cost reduction programmes.
Operating profits from continuing businesses increased by 5.8 per cent to
Pounds 9.48m (Pounds 8.95m) on turnover which was flat at Pounds 108m
(Pounds 107.6m) reflecting weak market prices. Discontinued operations last
time added Pounds 442,000 to operating profits and Pounds 7.25m to turnover.
In the packaging division operating profits increased to Pounds 5.68m
(Pounds 5.44m), despite a 3 per cent decline in sales to Pounds 61.6m
(Pounds 63.6m) which reflected the impact of the dollar's weakness on the
group's US plastic food-services business.
Waddingtons Cartons' sales volume grew by 15 per cent, helped by significant
growth in some of the company's main accounts. However, the group's label
business experienced difficulties after Waddingtons of Gateshead lost a
large Heinz contract, resulting in a Pounds 400,000 operating loss and the
need to make further cost cuts, including redundancies.
Operating profits in the business forms and specialist printing division
rose to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.59m) on sales which increased to Pounds 33.9m
(Pounds 32m). Waddingtons Business Forms continued to suffer the effects of
overcapacity in the industry, but the group's two specialist printing
companies, Chorleys and House of Questa, improved sales and profits.
The games division, responsible for some of Waddington's best-known board
games, such as Cluedo and Monopoly, also performed well despite the
difficult retail market trading conditions. Trading profits improved
slightly to Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 1.92m) on sales marginally higher at 12.4m
(Pounds 12m).

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Receivers appointed at Henry Barrett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATIVE receivers were yesterday appointed to Henry Barrett Group,
the Bradford-based steel stockholding and construction company, which
suspended its shares on Wednesday at 7p.
Five subsidiaries are in receivership - Westbury Tubular Structures; Don
Reynolds, which makes flat-panel cladding; Potter Johnson, which fabricates
steel-framed buildings; OSS Origo, a material handlings company; and HB
Projects, which manages construction.
Subsidiaries not in receivership include Henry Barrett Steel Services, the
stockholding side of the business; Henry Barrett Steel Buildings; and
Lindpater International, the special fastenings group. The receivers - Mr
Alan Griffiths, Mr Peter Flesher and Mr Geoff Gee from Grant Thornton - said
all three had interested buyers and negotiations for sale were underway.
Mr Gee said the companies in receivership would continue to trade while
potential buyers were sought. It was too early to tell whether redundancies
would be inevitable.
The group employs 750 people, of whom 400 are based in Bradford with a
further 81 in Wetherby, Yorkshire. A total of 225 employees are in
subsidiaries affected by receivership.
Henry Barrett has been supported for some time by its banks, led by
Barclays. It appears that the group's failure to achieve any of the
disposals under negotiation, along with the gloomy trading outlook, led to
the receivership.

HELPED BY a pension credit of Pounds 846,000, the 600 Group, the machine
tool and mechanical handling equipment company, sharply reduced its pre-tax
losses from Pounds 2.32m to just Pounds 97,000 in the six months to
September 30.
Mr Simon Powell, group finance director, said that the capital goods sector
had seen little glimmer of any upturn except for 'the odd sign in small
ticket stuff'. Although turnover eased to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 50.7m) the
company made trading profits of Pounds 489,000 (losses Pounds 1.18m).
Losses per share were cut from 5.1p to 1.1p but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1p with a Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 3.28m) transfer from reserves.
Within the machine tool division, Colchester Lathe has now been amalgamated
with TS Harrison, with the former's site being sold to Tesco for Pounds 12m
net. Borrowings were paid down (giving the lower interest), but have since
risen with relocation and redundancy costs. Gearing rose from 12 per cent at
the March year-end to 20 per cent at September 30 but is expected by Mr
Powell to reduce in the second half.
Mr Powell said that for the first time in over two years orders received
were exceeding sales. About 60 to 65 per cent of total sales go for export.
Sir Jeffrey Benson, chairman, said that benefits were beginning to show from
the previously implemented cost controls, restructuring and new product
policy.
Mr Powell said that in the half 234 jobs had been shed bringing the group
total to 1,653. He said that two years ago the figure had been 2,800 and
that virtually all the job losses had been in the UK.

FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rental strength lifts Warner Howard 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPEAL of renting rather than buying commercial equipment in a recession
helped half-year results to August 31 at Warner Howard, the UK's leading
supplier of commercial laundry equipment and warm air hand-dryers.
Warner, which earns most of its revenue from life-of-equipment rental
agreements, reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 3.01m
(Pounds 2.78m), even though turnover rose only Pounds 130,000 to Pounds
11.2m.
Operating profit was Pounds 3.03m compared with Pounds 2.8m. Earnings per
share increased to 8.59p (8p), and a 10 per cent higher interim dividend of
2.12p (1.925p) is declared.
Mr Ernie Hazell, managing director, said Warner's higher pre-tax profit was
pleasing given that revenue was flat overall. It was a reflection of the
success of the group's rental business as well as cost cutting.
He said development of a rental culture and nationwide operations at its
Euroelectrics subsidiary - which was a sales-driven business confined to the
London area when bought by Warner two years ago - was more than compensating
for poor equipment sales.
Increasing rentals at Derek Wright (Food Machinery), a beverage machines
supplier, was proving harder to achieve, but sales were firm.
Hazell said Warner's rental business 'acts as a buffer against the
recession'. In hard times, there was a dearth of alternative financing
facilities as businesses' capital spending dried up, and financing
com-panies were reluctant to service small purchases for customers with
lower credit ratings. Rental agreements therefore became increasingly
attractive.
Mr Hazell said Warner's catering, laundry and hand-drier business was
exposed to the leisure and construction industries, and the group would
depend on a turnround in these sectors for its performance to improve
sharply.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Royal Insurance cuts losses by 60% to Pounds 83m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of a recovery in the UK insurance sector emerged yesterday
when Royal Insurance, the composite (general and life) insurer, reported
reduced losses for the nine months ending September 30.
Pre-tax losses were cut by 60 per cent to Pounds 83m compared with Pounds
214m in the same period of 1991. General insurance losses of Pounds 96m
(Pounds 207m) were offset by higher life profits Pounds 38m (Pounds 37m) and
a lower interest burden Pounds 25m (Pounds 44m).
The announcement prompted a positive reaction from the markets and the share
price rose by 21p to close at 247p.
The company's performance in the third quarter was substantially better,
with pre-tax losses cut to Pounds 4m as against Pounds 117m last year when
it made heavy provisions for mortgage indemnity losses.
Improvements in the domestic UK market underpinned the result. General
insurance losses in the nine months fell to Pounds 57m, from Pounds 227m.
In the third quarter, for the first time since June 1990, the company
produced a pre-tax profit on general insurance of Pounds 16m, compared with
a loss of Pounds 123m a year earlier.
For the nine months, domestic mortgage indemnity business continued to be a
problem area, but losses fell to Pounds 136m from Pounds 173m.
Losses on personal motor insurance fell from Pounds 28m to Pounds 2m, as a
result of higher premiums, reduced exposures and lower claims frequency.
Losses from commercial property policies rose Pounds 1m to Pounds 27m,
mainly due to the impact of the IRA bombs in London last April. Elsewhere,
US business produced a Pounds 12m profit compared with a Pounds 14m loss
last year, in spite of the impact of hurricanes Andrew and Iniki.
Total group losses from these events are estimated at Pounds 35m. Royal UK
lost Pounds 2m from the hurricanes, mainly due to claims from Grand
Metropolitan, whose Burger King buildings in Florida were damaged.
Royal International recorded a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m against Pounds
4m in 1991, but profits at Royal Canada fell to Pounds 22m, from Pounds 31m,
and pre-tax losses at Royal Reinsurance rose from Pounds 11m to Pounds 41m.
Royal has reduced staff numbers worldwide by 2,500 since the beginning of
the year, with 1,170 jobs cut in the UK.

FT  13 NOV 92 / BT falls 36% in wake of redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG redundancy programme was behind a 36 per cent fall in British
Telecommunications' pre-tax profits for the half year to the end of
September.
Profits fell from Pounds 1.61bn to Pounds 1.03bn and earnings per share were
42 per cent down from 17.4p to 10.1p.
However, if redundancy charges of Pounds 442m and a Pounds 135m exceptional
loss incurred on the disposal of its Canadian Mitel subsidiary are added
back, earnings per share would have fallen only 2 per cent.
BT has cut its workforce by 35,300 since the start of the financial year and
expects to trim its 175,000 workforce by a further 15,000 a year over the
next two years.
The interim dividend will be 6.15p (5.7p), a 7.9 per cent increase. BT's
shares closed up 15p at 388p.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said the recession, regulation and tougher
competition led to a 1.5 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 6.53bn. But in
the second quarter 'the first signs of a slight improvement may have been
perceptible' and this had continued in October.
On a 12-month moving average, inland call volumes fell 1 per cent,
international volumes grew 5 per cent and exchange line connections
increased 0.9 per cent.
Mr Vallance said of the link this week between Mercury Communications, its
main UK rival, and BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group: 'I am fairly
relieved at the choice of partner.'
He dismissed stockbroker suggestions that shareholder value could be
enhanced by increasing dividends more sharply or buying back the company's
shares.
Mr Barry Romeril, finance director, said such suggestions were based on the
hypothesis that the company would accumulate a cash mountain whereas its net
debt was more than Pounds 2bn.
Mr Vallance defended last week's sale of BT's stake in McCaw Cellular
Communications, the large US mobile communications company, as 'not a
strategic blow'.
He said that in the UK BT would like to provide entertainment services over
its network and integrate its mobile communications operations with its
mainstream network. Both are prevented by regulation.
Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 1.17bn to Pounds 952m.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Ford names president in reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR yesterday named Mr Alex Trotman president and chief operating
officer of its worldwide vehicle operations in a top management reshuffle
which left a question mark over the succession to Mr Harold Poling, the US
group's chairman and chief executive, who will retire next year.
The shake-up stems from yesterday's announcement that Mr Philip Benton, the
group's 63-year-old president and chief operating officer, will retire on
January 1. No date has been announced for the retirement of Mr Poling, 67,
though he said yesterday it would be late in 1993.
Mr Benton's title disappears under the shake-up while the top management
team - the office of the chief executive - is expanded from four members to
six.
The reshuffle places 59-year-old Mr Trotman, previously head of North
American car operations, in a much stronger position in the succession
stakes. Many analysts now expect him to get the top job rather than Mr Allan
Gilmour, 58.
Mr Poling said yesterday the changes were part of a smooth succession plan
and that an heir-apparent had already been selected, though he declined to
name him.
Mr Trotman rose on the operations side of the automotive business while Mr
Gilmour's experience has been mainly financial. Mr Trotman is the only
senior Ford executive to have run its vehicles operations in each of the
company's main markets - North America, Europe and Asia. He also becomes a
member of the board and office of the chief executive.

FT  13 NOV 92 / Mapping an approach to corporate ills: An initiative by the
Bank of England to help beleaguered companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers to British companies are getting nervous. 'What I describe as some
of the better names among companies are breaching their borrowing
covenants,' said a senior director of one of the UK's biggest banks.
He and his peers fear that unless the banking community - foreign banks
included - works together to support these companies, serious damage might
be done to the UK economy.
To reinforce the need for co-operation between banks, Mr Pen Kent, an
associate director of the Bank of England, has in the past fortnight spoken
to closed meetings of bankers on guidelines operating in the City as to how
banks should behave when a company runs into difficulties. These guidelines
are known as the London Approach and are a statement of best practice
supported strongly by the Bank.
Yesterday he repeated the speech in a more public forum, at the Chartered
Institute of Bankers.
The intention of the London Approach is to create an orderly framework for
negotiations between a bank and a troubled company to prevent that company
from going into receivership unnecessarily.
When a company runs into difficulties, it often asks its banks to defer
principal payments, roll up interest or extend new credit. Most lending
agreements contain covenants requiring a unanimous agreement of the banks to
any such substantial changes in the loan terms.
The convention that there should be unanimity allows a bank wanting to get
back its loan from a troubled company to hold the company's other banks to
ransom. One recalcitrant bank may threaten to vote against a reconstruction
proposal and put a company into receivership, unless other banks promise to
repay that bank's loan.
In such disputes the Bank of England is normally happy to intervene and put
pressure on the rogue bank to be more co-operative. Mr Pen Kent may either
talk to the bank himself, or, if that bank is foreign, to its domestic
regulator.
However, he is adamant that this is not a process of favouring the views of
UK banks over foreign banks. 'We operate an open-door policy and will talk
to any player involved whether large or small, domestic or foreign,' he
said. Mr Kent has intervened in bank negotiations in relation to 70
companies in the past year.
Although the Bank has usually been successful in forging a unanimous view
among banks, Mr Kent urged banks to adopt new procedures when writing loan
covenants. He said the requirement of a unanimous vote for a reconstruction
to go ahead should be replaced with a qualified majority.
He attacked banks and professional advisers for charging excessive fees when
refinancing companies. 'Fees and costs are . . . always too high.'
Companies such as Eurotunnel, WPP and Brent Walker have complained that
their bankers and other advisers have been charging tens of millions of
pounds for changes in their borrowing agreements. Mr Kent said: 'I know of a
number of cases where the costs associated with a proliferation of advisers
has led to a real risk to the future of the company concerned.'
All the advisory costs in a corporate reconstruction are typically paid by
the company being rescued, even if those costs relate to legal and financial
advice given to the company's banks.
Mr Kent said that when a company has several banks, those banks should share
a single legal adviser. He warned that 'we in the City . . . shall bring
ourselves into disrepute' unless these fees and costs are kept down.
Mr Kent also has misgivings about the new practice of banks selling their
loans in troubled companies to other financial institutions. These
transactions are relatively common in the US and are gradually taking place
in the UK. Some of WPP's banks for example sold their loans when the
advertising group ran into difficulties.
Mr Kent was concerned that when banks are trying to rescue a company - what
he calls a 'work-out situation' - debt sales 'will impede progress'.
He added: 'Selling debt in response to news that a company is in difficulty
is not in keeping with one of the basic tenets of the London Approach.'
The Bank of England does not want to discourage the creation of a secondary
market in corporate debt. But Mr Kent wants the banking community to draw up
a 'code of conduct to minimise disruption during the formulation of a
work-out'.
In particular, any institution buying debt in a troubled company should be
made aware that it is taking on a responsibility to join in the negotiations
to rescue the company and not rely on the company's traditional bankers to
organise the rescue alone.
Mr Kent added that in general banks should not exclude non-bank creditors -
holders of bonds or short-term debt securities - from the process of
rescuing a company.
But he has not been persuaded by the request from foreign banks that the
Bank of England should establish a register of companies' debts, so that any
bank lending to a company could discover whether that company had already
borrowed too much from other sources. The request for such a register was
made after last year's collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's companies. Mr Kent
said: 'I have my doubts about whether such an institution would be
effective.'
Such a register would not work in the UK, he believes, because companies can
borrow offshore and therefore any company which wanted to disguise its
overall indebtedness could do so.
Some companies, such as O&amp;Y Canary Wharf, owner of Europe's biggest property
development in London's Docklands, are, however, incapable of being rescued
by the voluntary efforts of bankers. These companies need to use insolvency
legislation to protect themselves from the competing claims of creditors.
But Mr Kent said that UK insolvency law is unsatisfactory. Too few companies
are using the administration procedures of the Insolvency Act to acquire
creditor protection for a limited period while rebuilding their businesses.
So if bankers cannot agree on a voluntary rescue, most troubled companies go
into receivership, from which they rarely emerge as a going concern.
'I would like to see a detailed review of the working of these parts of the
Insolvency Act to explore ways of making these (administration procedures)
more usable,' he said.
But the best cure for corporate ills is not any legislative change, he
added. lt is for banks to learn more about their customers and only lend
when the cash flows of a company can support the loan. In the meantime, 'If
we all keep our nerve . . . there will be more survivors to benefit from
those lessons.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / Boots 15% ahead as chemist shop sales advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from Boots' chemist shops and a return to profits from
Halfords, its chain selling car accessories and bicycles, helped the retail
and pharmaceutical company increase pre-tax profits by 15.6 per cent to
Pounds 187.8m in the first half of its financial year.
However, a fall into losses by the do-it-yourself joint venture and
disappointment that a patent extension on one drug would not be possible
contributed to a 10p drop in the share price to 487p.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said in the current economic climate the
results were 'very good'. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said although
consumer confidence was still low, 'it would require a very bad Christmas
overall for Boots to have a bad Christmas'.
Group sales rose 7.9 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn in the six months to end
September, and trading profit was 6.6 per cent higher at Pounds 198.2m.
There was a fall in interest payable from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds 10.4m, of
which Pounds 8.8m was due to the conversion of bonds into shares.
Earnings per share rose 11.5 per cent to 12.6p and the interim dividend is
up 7 per cent to 4.6p.
The Boots the Chemist chain increased trading profits by 20.8 per cent to
Pounds 117.4m, in spite of a Pounds 5.6m charge resulting from an inquiry by
the National Health Service into discounts. This represents half the
expected charge for the full year. Sir James said the chain's sales of fine
fragrances were not being affected by discounting by rival retailers.
Among its other retail chains, Halfords made a profit of Pounds 1.2m,
against a loss of Pounds 6.2m, while Boots Optician profits rose from Pounds
2.5m to Pounds 2.8m and Childrens World losses fell from Pounds 2.8m to
Pounds 2.6m. AG Stanley DIY business suffered a fall in profits from Pounds
4.4m to Pounds 1m while Boots' share of the Do-It-All joint venture loss was
Pounds 4.9m compared with a profit of Pounds 4.2m. Losses from Sephora, the
French perfume business, increased from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.2m.
The pharmaceutical division's profits fell from Pounds 67.2m to Pounds 64.8m
as an extra Pounds 8m was spent on marketing Manoplax, a new drug for
congestive heart failure. This was launched in the UK in September and Sir
James hopes for US approval by next March.
Profits from the property division fell from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 30.2m,
including profits on property sales of Pounds 2.8m, up from Pounds 2.3m.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: 2.5% rise in NHS patient
capacity - Health
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NHS in England will be able to increase the number of patients it treats
next year by over 2.5 per cent, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Secretary of State
for Health, said yesterday.
'That means an extra 190,000 acute in and day patients and one million extra
patient contacts by community nurses, taking the total number of patients
treated to its highest ever level,' she said in a statement.
'This increase in services is the result of the extra funds which have been
announced today for the NHS next year and of the efficiency improvements
which we expect the service to make.
'The Government is providing more than Pounds 1bn extra for health services
in England next year - a real terms increase of 3 per cent over our original
plans for 1992-93, or of one per cent over forecast outturn, equivalent to
about 1.8 per cent after taking account of the effects of the measures on
pay restraint which the Chancellor has announced today. That means the total
increase in Government spending on the NHS in England since we embarked on
our NHS reforms in 1989-90 will be over Pounds 9bn, or 17.7 per cent in real
terms. Between 1979 and now, Government spending on the NHS has grown by
57.6 per cent in real terms; we have increased nurses' pay by 51.6 per cent
after inflation, and doctors' pay by 33.6 per cent. This Government has
treated the NHS well: providing more resources and the means for them to be
put to best use. The announcement today shows the high priority we continue
to attach to the NHS.
'Pounds 800 million of the new money for next year which has been announced
today will go to the services provided by trusts and other hospitals and
community units. The extra money will be used for the benefit of both
patients and health service staff, by:
Maintaining the momentum of the health reforms and ensuring that money
continues to be used to the maximum benefit of patients;
Reducing waiting times by building on our successful Patients' Charter
targets;
Providing extra support for community health services so that the NHS can
play its part in implementing Caring for People;
Continuing to give emphasis to health promotion as well as treatment of
disease;
Making further progress on reducing junior doctors' working hours and
providing more Project 2000 training for nurses.
'These sums are in addition to the Pounds 539m which I have already
announced will be provided to local authorities next year to implement
Caring for People.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Shortfall to be met by
Exchequer grant - National Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTFALL in the National Insurance Fund will be met by an Exchequer grant
rather than by increasing the standard rates of contributions for either
employees or employers, which remain at 9 per cent and 10.4 per cent
respectively, Mr Peter Lilley, secretary of state for social security, said
in a statement yesterday.
He added: 'This legislation will also introduce the 1 per cent additional
rebate for appropriate personal pension holders aged 30 and over.
In line with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the
lower earnings limit for class 1 contributions is to be raised to Pounds 56
a week, which is the nearest whole pound to the basic retirement pension
rate for a single person from April 1993.
The upper earnings limit is to be raised to Pounds 420 a week, which is
slightly less than 7 1/2 times the new basic pension rate as provided by the
Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act.
These new earnings limits will replace the current ones of Pounds 54 and
Pounds 405. Under the current structure, employees whose earnings reach the
lower earnings limit will continue to pay an initial contribution of 2 per
cent of that limit, and standard rate contributions of 9 per cent on that
portion of their earnings which exceeds the lower but not the upper earnings
limit.
'For employers, the reduced contribution rates of 4.6 per cent, 6.6 per cent
and 8.6 per cent for the lower paid will continue.
However, the thresholds for these rates will be raised so that from April
1993 they apply to weekly earnings which fall below the ceilings of Pounds
95, Pounds 140, and Pounds 195 respectively, compared with Pounds 90, Pounds
135 and Pounds 190 at present.
Neither the employee nor his employer will have to pay any contributions if
earnings are less than Pounds 56 a week. Those whose earnings do not exceed
Pounds 405 (the former upper earnings limit) will pay 14 pence a week less
in contributions than at present. This is because a further Pounds 2 of
their weekly earnings will be subject to a deduction of 2 per cent rather
than 9 per cent. For employees with earnings above Pounds 405 a week, the
maximum possible increase will be Pounds 1.21 a week.
Employers' contributions will generally be unchanged, although some will pay
less where employees' earnings which were above the former thresholds fall
below the new thresholds. There will be no increase for employers of the
higher paid since there is no upper earnings limit for employers'
contributions.
The statutory review of the contracted-out rebate for employees and
employers, the result of which was announced in February, resulted in a
reduction in the rebate from April 1993. Al-though the main rates of
contributions remain unchanged, the effect of the reduced rebate is that
many employees will pay a little more.
Those with earnings between Pounds 110 and Pounds 405 (the former upper
earnings limit) will pay up to 59 pence a week more.
Those who earn more than Pounds 405 will pay contributions on the next
Pounds 15 of earnings from next April (ie up to Pounds 420 a week, the
proposed upper earnings limit), a maximum increase of Pounds 1.67 a week.
Contracted-out employees who earn Pounds 110 or less will pay the same or
slightly less.
Because of the fall in the rebate, employers will generally pay more,
although some will pay less where employees' earnings which were above the
former thresholds fall below the new thresholds. The flat-rate class 2
contribution will be raised by 20 pence to Pounds 5.55 a week. There will be
no increase in the rate of class 4 contributions, currently 6.3 per cent.
The annual limits of profits between which class 4 contributions are paid
will be raised to Pounds 6,340 and Pounds 21,840 from Pounds 6,120 and
Pounds 21,060 respectively.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Student numbers to rise by
220,000 - Education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday an-nounced a Pounds 523m
increase in government spending on education. A central feature of this
funding is to increase the number of students in further education by
222,000 during the next three years.
This 25 per cent rise in student numbers is intended to produce more people
with technical skills in order that Britain can compete effectively in the
world economy.
Mr Patten said: 'Spending on education means investment in human capital.
That is a vital part of the programme which the chancellor of the exchequer
has announced today.
'In the toughest public expenditure round for many years the government has
continued to make education a priority. Spending in 1993-94 will be Pounds
9,523m, Pounds 523m or some 6 per cent higher than equivalent expenditure in
1992-93. Spending in 1994-95 and 1995-96 will total Pounds 10,115m and
Pounds 10,497m.
'Within the extra money available, we have given a special new emphasis to
further education. This will be a large step towards achievement of our
National Education and Training Targets. It will help to provide many more
people qualified with the technical skills industry urgently needs, and
should lift us towards the top of the international league table in
staying-on rates for 16-19 year-olds within the next three years.
'We shall continue to raise standards by providing the funds to sustain the
increasing number of grant-maintained schools. Capital spending on
grant-maintained schools will top Pounds 500m over the next three years, and
overall capital spending on schools should be maintained in real terms at
least at this year's level, building on last year's 15 per cent increase in
the programme.'
'Funding over the next three years will provide for an increase of 104,000
or 13 per cent in higher education student numbers.'
He added: 'The government has given high priority to the launch of the new
further education sector so as to build up the supply of those with
technical and other skills.
'There are currently 342 grant-maintained schools (in England and Wales)
open or approved. That number is projected to rise to some 500 by next
April. The government's spending plans provide for the number of GM schools
to grow to 1,500 in April 1994. The great bulk of recurrent funding for GM
schools is found from within the totals for local authority expenditure.
Central government expenditure on recurrent and capital grants to GM schools
is planned to rise substantially over the next three years as the number of
GM schools grows.
'Total central government expenditure on GM schools is planned to total
Pounds 61m in 1992-93 and Pounds 157m, Pounds 294m and Pounds 446m in
1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96. Capital expenditure alone will total Pounds
501m over the next three years. The funding plans include provision for the
running costs of the proposed Funding Agency for Schools.
'From 1 April 1993, further education and sixth form colleges will be funded
direct by the new Further Education Funding Council, set up under the
Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The plans provide for the launch of
the newly independent sector. Total recurrent spending is planned at Pounds
2,549m, Pounds 2,734m and Pounds 2,943m in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96.
That increase in funding will allow for an assumed 25 per cent increase in
student numbers between 1992-93 and 1995-96.'
The number of students on full-time and sandwich courses in higher education
has expanded faster than the rapid rate of growth envisaged in the
government's Higher Education White Paper of May 1991, on which the
government's previous expenditure plans were based.
'The government has provided substantial additional funding for further
education to enable the country's needs for skills to be met. Given the need
to strike a balance with the rate of expansion of further education, the
government envisages a period of consolidation in higher education.
The figures underlying the expenditure plans announced today accordingly
assume that the proportion of young people entering higher education will
remain broadly steady in the next three years, and increase to the level of
one in three at the end of the decade, which has long been assumed.
Total central government provision for capital expenditure on
grant-maintained and LEA-maintained schools (in England and Wales) is Pounds
598m, Pounds 613m and Pounds 624m in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Shortfall in fund will be
met by Exchequer grant - National Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTFALL in the National Insurance Fund will be met by an Exchequer grant
rather than by increasing the standard rates of contributions for either
employees or employers, which remain at 9 per cent and 10.4 per cent
respectively, Mr Peter Lilley, secretary of state for social security, said
in a statement yesterday.
He added: 'This legislation will also introduce the 1 per cent additional
rebate for appropriate personal pension holders aged 30 and over.
In line with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the
lower earnings limit for class 1 contributions is to be raised to Pounds 56
a week, which is the nearest whole pound to the basic retirement pension
rate for a single person from April 1993.
The upper earnings limit is to be raised to Pounds 420 a week, which is
slightly less than seven and a half times the new basic pension rate as
provided by the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act. These new
earnings limits will replace the current ones of Pounds 54 and Pounds 405.
Under the current structure, employees whose earnings reach the lower
earnings limit will continue to pay an initial contribution of 2 per cent of
that limit, and standard rate contributions of 9 per cent on that portion of
their earnings which exceeds the lower but not the upper earnings limit.
'For employers, the reduced contribution rates of 4.6 per cent, 6.6 per cent
and 8.6 per cent for the lower paid will continue. However, the thresholds
for these rates will be raised so that from April 1993 they apply to weekly
earnings which fall below the ceilings of Pounds 95, Pounds 140, and Pounds
195 respectively, compared with Pounds 90, Pounds 135 and Pounds 190 at
present.
Neither the employee nor his employer will have to pay any contributions if
earnings are less than Pounds 56 a week. Those whose earnings do not exceed
Pounds 405 (the former upper earnings limit) will pay 14 pence a week less
in contributions than at present. This is because a further Pounds 2 of
their weekly earnings will be subject to a deduction of 2 per cent rather
than 9 per cent.
For employees with earnings above Pounds 405 a week, the maximum possible
increase will be Pounds 1.21 a week. Employers' contributions will generally
be unchanged, although some will pay less where employees' earnings which
were above the former thresholds fall below the new thresholds.
There will be no increase for employers of the higher paid since there is no
upper earnings limit for employers' contributions.
The statutory review of the contracted-out rebate for employees and
employers, the result of which was announced last February, resulted in a
reduction in the rebate from April 1993. Although the main rates of
contributions remain unchanged, the effect of the reduced rebate is that
many employees will pay a little more.
Those with earnings between Pounds 110 and Pounds 405 (the former upper
earnings limit) will pay up to 59 pence a week more. Those who earn more
than Pounds 405 will pay contributions on the next Pounds 15 of earnings
from next April (ie up to Pounds 420 a week, the proposed upper earnings
limit), a maximum increase of Pounds 1.67 a week. Contracted-out employees
who earn Pounds 110 or less will pay the same or slightly less.
Because of the fall in the rebate, employers will generally pay more,
although some will pay less where employees' earnings which were above the
former thresholds fall below the new thresholds.
The flat-rate class 2 contribution will be raised by 20 pence to Pounds 5.55
a week. There will be no increase in the rate of class 4 contributions,
currently 6.3 per cent. The annual limits of profits between which class 4
contributions are paid will be raised to Pounds 6,340 and Pounds 21,840 from
Pounds 6,120 and Pounds 21,060 respectively. Self-employed people who pay
only class 2 contributions will pay an extra Pounds 10.40 a year in 1993/94.
For people with profits between Pounds 6,340 and Pounds 21,060 (the former
upper profits limit) class 4 contributions will be reduced by Pounds 13.86
per year assuming an unaltered level of profits. For those self-employed
people with profits at or above the new upper profits limit, the annual
charge for class 4 contributions will be Pounds 35.28 higher.
The rate of class 3 (Voluntary) contributions will be raised by 20 pence to
Pounds 5.45 a week.
The allocation to the National Health Service, currently 1.05 per cent from
employees and 0.9 per cent from employers, remains unchanged.
As usual I shall be laying a draft order before parliament together with a
report by the government actuary describing the effects of my proposals
(which) will take effect from 6 April 1993.'
Mr Lilley said that benefit rates would be raised by 3.6 per cent next
April, in line with the Retail Prices Index in the year to September 1992.
He added that planned expenditure on social security would rise to Pounds
79.8bn in 1993/94. It would go up to Pounds 82.9bn in 1994/95 and Pounds
87bn in 1995/96.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Monitoring range of 4% to 8%
set - Broad money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR an-nounced a monitoring range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent
cent for the 12-month growth rate of M4 for the remainder of 1992-93.
The Treasury issued the following statement yesterday: The range takes
account of M4's sluggish growth during the first half of the financial year,
which will depress the figures for M4's 12-month growth over the rest of
1992-93. The range is lower than would have been set at the beginning of the
financial year.
Broad money is one of the indicators which the authorities look at in
conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates.
As the chancellor explained last month, the relationship between M4 and
either money GDP or future inflation is not close enough to justify a formal
target for M4.
Growth of M4 outside the monitoring range will not be sufficient to justify
changes in interest rates, but the reasons for such a development would be
studied closely and taken into account with other evidence about monetary
conditions and the outlook for inflation.
In monitoring M4, attention is paid to the behaviour of its components and
counterparts, such as lending to the private sector, as well as its overall
growth.
Monitoring ranges will be set at a level consistent with progress towards
the government's inflation objectives.
While M4 has increased by 5 per cent over the year to September, over the
past six months it has increased, after seasonal adjustment, by only 2.1 per
cent, or 4.2 per cent at an annual rate.
The relaxation of monetary policy since September will lead to some
acceleration of M4, though not necessarily in the immediate future.
A continuation of monetary growth over the remainder of 1992-93, at about
the rate recorded in the first half, would bring the increase in M4 on a
year earlier down close to 4 per cent by next March.
This would not necessarily give additional cause for concern. Four per cent
is thus an appropriate level for the bottom of the target range.
For M4's 12-month growth to reach a rate as high as 8 per cent by the end of
this financial year would require M4 to increase by about 1 per cent a month
from now on.
Persistent growth in excess of this rate might start to throw doubt on the
judgments behind recent monetary relaxation. Thus 8 per cent has been chosen
as the upper limit for the monitoring range.
Target ranges for broad money were published in the first seven editions of
the Medium Term Financial Strategy (1980 to 1986 inclusive), but the target
ranges were overshot in all but two years.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: MacGregor promises green
paper on funding - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S proposals involve an Pounds 18bn programme for transport,
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said in a statement yesterday.
He promised a green paper on possible arrangements for paying for the use of
inter-urban roads and the best ways to involve the private sector in their
provision.
'Road construction over the period of the survey will be at a record level,'
the statement said. 'This means that all the schemes planned to start next
year will go ahead. There is a huge need for roads expenditure and we need
to secure the best value for money we can.
'So ,in the longer term I hope to see greater involvement of the private
sector in the financing, design building and operation of national roads.
The green paper will look at possible new approaches to this; it will also
discuss the related question of arrangements for payment for the use of
these roads.
'An extra Pounds 130m has been made available to British Rail in 1993/94
compared with last year's plans and an extra Pounds 100m in 1994/95. This
will allow BR to press ahead with investment in Channel tunnel services, to
complete the Pounds 0.8bn project to upgrade services for inner-Kent
commuters and to continue with necessary investment in track and signalling.
'In the run-up to privatisation BR are being given increased scope to fund
new rolling stock by leasing.
'The government is providing nearly Pounds 1.5bn of grant towards London
Transport's existing business over the next three years which should allow
for investment of around Pounds 1.75bn.
'This would be Pounds 0.5bn higher in real terms than over the last three
years and would, among other things, enable London Underground to complete
the Pounds 750m project to upgrade the Central Line.'
On the Jubilee Line extension, Mr MacGregor said: 'I am glad that
substantial progress has been made in our discussions with the
administrators, who have now offered financial contributions equivalent to
those promised by Olympia &amp; York.
There are to be further negotiations between the administrators, the banks
and London Transport over the detail of the funding agreement. The
expenditure plans will provide for the line to go ahead if the final
agreement matches, in all material respects, that drawn up with O &amp; Y.
The provision for the Civil Aviation Authority will enable them to maintain
their major investment programme, and in particular to be able to keep the
new en-route centre on target for completion in 1996.
Our support for local authority public transport is unchanged. All the
projects for which we have already made provision will go ahead as planned.
Spending will continue on the South Yorkshire Supertram, Merseyside
resignalling, bus priority measures and local rail service safety works.
The provision for local authority airports, used in conjunction with
airports' own resources, will ensure safety and security schemes can
proceed. We look to the private sector to play the major role in financing
significant airport expansion.
'The temporary relaxation of the rules about capital receipts will give
local authority airport owners just the opportunity for which several of
them have been asking and will provide extra resources for local authorities
to spend, at their discretion, on public transport and roads, as well.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Incentives for investment in
equipment - Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday acted to increase business confidence by
encouraging companies to bring forward new investment in equipment and
buildings.
The proposals involve a new 40 per cent first year allowance for expenditure
on machinery and plant (excluding cars and certain other assets) incurred by
businesses in the 12 months ending October 31 next year.
The Inland Revenue, in a statement yesterday, said: 'This will be given in
place of the writing down allowance of 25 per cent currently available in
the year the expenditure is incurred. The balance of expenditure will
continue to be written down for tax purposes in subsequent years at 25 per
cent per annum on a reducing balance basis.
The proposed increase in first-year relief for machinery and plant will mean
that over half the cost of equipment incurred between now and October 31,
1993 can be written off against tax within the first couple of years of its
life. Similarly, about a quarter of the cost of new buildings qualifying for
initial allowances can be written off over the same period.
The cost of these new reliefs will be about Pounds 200m in 1993-94 and
Pounds 500m in 1994-95. Subsequently, tax yields will be rather higher than
they would otherwise be because reliefs on the balance of expenditure will
be less.
The legislation for these measures will be included in the 1993 Finance
Bill. The intention is to publish draft clauses before the end of the year.
The new 40 per cent first year allowance will be available for expenditure
which is incurred on machinery and plant (excluding cars and certain other
assets described in paragraph 8. below) between November 1, 1992 and October
31, 1993.
At present, most expenditure on machinery and plant qualifies for writing
down allowances at the rate of 25 per cent per annum on a reducing balance
basis (that is to say, relief of 25 per cent of the full cost is given in
the year that the equipment is bought; 25 per cent of the remaining balance
is given in the second year; and so on for subsequent years).
The rules for the new first year allowance will work like those which
operated when similar allowances were generally available in the past.
Relief will accordingly be given in place of the writing down allowance that
is normally available in the year in which the expenditure is incurred, with
the balance of expenditure written down in future years at the same rate as
now. Qualifying expenditure will therefore be given relief at the rate of 40
per cent in the first year, to be followed by 25 per cent of the remaining
balance in the second year, 25 per cent of the balance in the third year,
and so on for subsequent years.
Businesses will be able to disclaim all or any part of the first year
allowance, should they wish to do so.
For this purpose, the existing definition of 'incurred' in Section 159
Capital Allowances Act (CAA) 1990 will apply. This means that expenditure
will generally be regarded as incurred on the date when the obligation to
pay for the asset becomes unconditional. The main exception to this rule is
where the period of credit allowed is longer than four months.
In these cases, the date on which the bill for the asset is payable is
regarded as the date on which the expenditure is incurred.
In addition, the rule for pre-trading expenditure in section 83(2) CAA 1990
(which deems such expenditure to be incurred on the first day of trading)
will not apply for the purpose of determining whether the expenditure falls
within the year ending October 31, 1993. In other words, first year
allowances will only be due where the expenditure concerned is actually
incurred in that year.
The new 40 per cent first year allowance will apply to all expenditure on
machinery and plant currently qualifying for 25 per cent writing down
allowances except:
Cars, other than taxis, short term hire cars and mobility allowance vehicles
for the disabled (as defined in Section 36 CAA 1990)
Most assets which are acquired from a connected person; or are sold and
leased back; or are acquired in a transaction the sole or main benefit of
which is to obtain a first year allowance (ie. expenditure within the scope
of Sections 75 and 76 CAA 1990).
Where machinery or plant depreciates rapidly, taxpayers will be able to
elect for short life treatment in the usual way.
This means that a full deduction against profits can be taken for any
unrelieved depreciation when the asset is sold or scrapped.
The new 20 per cent initial allowance will be available for industrial and
agricultural buildings which:
Currently qualify for writing down allowances. Are constructed under a
contract entered into between 1 November 1992 and 31 October 1993.
And are brought into use for the purposes of a qualifying trade by December
31, 1994.
Expenditure on structures within the definition of industrial and
agricultural buildings is currently written off over a period of 25 years,
normally at the rate of 4 per cent of the original cost each year, starting
from the year in which the building is brought into use.
The rules for the new relief will work like those which operated when
similar allowances were generally available for qualifying buildings in the
past.
So, relief for 20 per cent of the cost of the building will be available in
the tax year in which the expenditure is incurred, subject to the building
being brought into use by December 31, 1994.
Allowances which are given, based on an intention to bring the building into
use by this date, will be withdrawn where this condition is not, in the
event, met.
The balance of relief will continue to be given at the rate of 4 per cent of
the original cost of the building per annum from the tax year in which it is
brought into use (ie the balance of expenditure, after taking the 20 per
cent initial allowance, will be written off over the next 20 years).
In cases where the expenditure is incurred in the same year in which the
building is brought into use, both an initial allowance and a writing down
allowance will be available, ie. the total allowance due in that year will
be 24 per cent.
Businesses will be able to disclaim all or any part of the initial allowance
should they wish to do so.
Expenditure will qualify for the new 20 per cent initial allowance if it is
incurred under:
A legally binding contract made in the year ended 31 October 1993.
And the claimant was contractually committed to the expenditure by that
contract.
Expenditure which a person incurs by exercising an option in a contract is
not expenditure incurred under that contract. It is expenditure incurred
under a new contract made when the option is exercised.
Such expenditure will qualify for the initial allowance where the new
contract meets the conditions that are set out above.
An industrial building or structure will qualify for initial allowances if
it is brought into use for one of the trades qualifying for the purposes of
writing down allowances, as set out in section 18(1) CAA 1990. The list
includes:
Factories and other premises used for manufacturing.
Buildings or structures in use for the purposes of transport, dock, inland
navigation, water, sewerage, electricity or hydraulic power undertakings.
Tunnel, bridge or toll road undertakings.
Certain storage trades.
Mine, oil well or other mineral workings.
Cultivating land (except where the separate agricultural buildings allowance
is available).
Catching fish or shellfish.
Hotels which qualify for writing down allowances under the industrial
buildings rules will also qualify for an initial allowance.
The definition of a qualifying hotel is in section 19 CAA 1990. In summary,
the hotel must be a permanent structure which meets all the following
conditions:
It must be open for at least four months in the season.
When open it must have at least 10 bedrooms available for letting.
The sleeping accommodation offered must consist wholly or mainly of bedrooms
available for letting.
Meals, bed making and room cleaning services must normally be provided.
Initial allowances will also be available for expenditure on buildings
currently qualifying for agricultural buildings allowances.
This relieves expenditure incurred for the purposes of husbandry on the
construction of farmhouses, farm buildings, cottages, fences and other
works, such as ditches and drains (section 123 CAA 1990).
The allowances are restricted for any private use by the farmer; for
example, in the case of a farmhouse.'
EXAMPLE 1
A company which makes up its accounts annually to December 31 makes a
contract on October 1, 1993 to buy a computer for Pounds 15,000.
The computer is to be delivered on October 15, 1993.
Under the contract, the obligation to pay becomes unconditional on October
15, 1993 but actual payment does not have to be made until 30 days later, on
November 15, 1993.
In this case, the expenditure is incurred on October 15, 1993, ie. before
the cut-off date of October 31.
That means the company is entitled to a 40 per cent first-year allowance for
its accounting period ending on December 31, 1993.
The allowance (ie. 40 per cent of Pounds 15,000), to be deducted from the
company's taxable profits, is Pounds 6,000.
If the computer continues to be used during the following year, the company
will be able to claim a 25 per cent writing down allowance against profits
for its accounting period ending on December 31, 1994.
The allowance will be Pounds 2,250, ie. 25 per cent of the unrelieved
expenditure of Pounds 9,000.
Suppose, however, that the computer is sold for Pounds 5,000 in the
company's second year.
In that case, if the company makes a short-life election, it can claim a
deduction against profits for a balancing allowance equal to the unrelieved
depreciation.
The computer cost Pounds 15,000 and the first year allowance in Year 1 was
Pounds 6,000; hence the balancing allowance in Year 2 will be Pounds 4,000
(which is the unrelieved expenditure of Pounds 9,000 less the sale proceeds
of Pounds 5,000).
EXAMPLE 2
A manufacturing company, which has a December 31 accounting date, enters
into a binding contract to build a factory for its trade on July 1, 1993.
The factory is completed in January 1994. The company moves in immediately
and begins production in May 1994.
The 20 per cent initial allowance will be due because:
the contract was made between 1 November 1992 and October 31, 1993;
the building began to be used before December 31, 1994.
If, for instance, the obligation to pay for the factory became unconditional
in January 1994, when the factory was completed, the result will be:
a 20 per cent initial allowance will be due for the year ended December 31,
1994 (this is the year in which the expenditure was incurred under the rules
in section 159 CAA 1990);
a writing down allowance of 4 per cent of the cost will also be due for the
year ended December 31, 1994 because the asset was in use by the end of that
year.
When a building is in use for the purposes of a trade is a question of fact
in each case.
Normally, the test will be met when the building is being used for the
purpose for which it was built.
A building is not in use for the purposes of the trade when it is being
fitted out.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Benefits from Budget wiped
out - Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE real increase in the government's science budget, promised in the Autumn
Statement a year ago, disappeared when the chancellor spoke yesterday.
The science budget - distributed mainly through the five research councils -
will rise in cash terms by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 1.164bn in 1993-94. That
is Pounds 17m less than the planning figure released a year ago.
The new planning figures for 1994-95 and 1995-96 show level funding,
allowing for expected inflation, instead of a rise.
This is the first public spending round in which science has been outside
the Department of Education and in the Office of Science and Technology
under Mr William Waldegrave. The outcome shows that he has had some success
in protecting the research budget against cuts. 'If the OST had not existed
this year, science would have had a rougher time,' he said.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Hope for co-op boost to
market - Housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING associations will be able to take at least 16,000 houses off the
market, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday.
In a statement, he said Pounds 580m of new money would be made available in
1992/93 to enable housing associations to purchase new, empty or repossessed
homes to use for families in housing need.
Taken together with the private loans which will support these purchases the
total package of spending is expected to approach Pounds 1bn. The programme
would be run by the Housing Corporation.
He added: 'In addition Pounds 50m will be available this year in grants to
help tenants of housing associations and local authorities to buy and move
into homes in the private sector.
This means that up to 3,500 first-time buyers will enter the housing market.
Their homes will then become available for people in housing need.
This new injection of capital funds will enable housing associations to take
at least 16,000 houses off the market and, with the properties freed up by
those taking advantage of grants to buy new homes, this will provide nearly
20,000 additional homes for social renting. This will generate an immediate
and substantial boost to the housing market as well as bringing help to
people in need of social housing, including those currently in bed and
breakfast accommodation. It increases the total capital resources being
spent through the Housing Corporation this year from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds
2.3bn.
Our existing programme of grants to help tenants into owner occupation has
been very successful. Some 15,000 households have already taken advantage of
these grants to move out of renting and to own the home of their choice. I
hope that local authority and housing association tenants up and down the
country who could afford to move into owner occupation will consider this an
excellent opportunity to consider buying a home of their own now, without
having to wait until they have saved the necessary deposit.'
The Department of the Environment said Pounds 577m would be made available
through the Housing Corporation for housing associations to buy 'off the
shelf' new, repossessed and vacant properties in this financial year, for
use to meet local housing needs.
The funds will be channelled through a limited number of housing
associations by the Housing Corporation to ensure that maximum value for
money is achieved. The package is expected to deliver a higher leverage of
private finance with lower rates of grant than the normal corporation
programme.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Government to encourage more
private finance - Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government plans to investigate further ways of encouraging the use of
private finance for infrastructure projects. The Treasury said yesterday:
'The government does not see this as the end of the process.' The chancellor
was 'looking to the private sector to identify barriers to the successful
development of the policy as well as to bring forward proposals for
projects'.
The objective of the changes announced yesterday was 'to find new ways of
mobilising the private sector to meet needs which have traditionally been
met only by the public sector'. The statement added: 'The key question is
whether the private sector is genuinely assuming risk; there must be no
creative accounting. The changes mean that:
If the private sector is wholly responsible for a project which needs
government approval and can recoup all its costs by charges at the point of
use, comparison with a theoretical public-sector alternative will not be
needed. Such a project will normally be put to competition. Under the
current rules a comparison has generally been required if a project is one
which the government might have undertaken itself.
The government will actively encourage the private sector to take the lead
in joint ventures with the public sector provided the private sector's costs
can be recovered by charging users directly. There will need to be a
sensible sharing of risks and rewards between the public and private
sectors. Joint ventures will be let by competition to ensure the best terms.
The government will specify its contribution in terms of money and risk. If
it takes an equity stake, it will not be a controlling one. The government
is willing to consider debt and grant finance for such projects.
The public sector will have greater opportunity to use leases where they
offer best value for money. The capital value of leased assets apart from
property is at present usually set against spending allocations unless the
lease meets only a short-term need. In future, the criterion will in all
cases be based on risk, which is also the principle underlying the relevant
accounting standard. Departments and nationalised industries will be able to
enter into operating leases and count only the leasing payments against
their provision, provided the great majority of the risk stays with the
private sector. This change should give a new impetus in areas such as
contract energy management.
The measures which the chancellor has announced will add to the total level
of national investment. The spending which is financed by government will
come out of departmental spending allocations. The private-sector element
will make additional resources available in the area concerned, and allow
the publicly financed part to be used to the full.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Public sector pay ceiling
applies to all settlements - The Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CEILING of 1 per cent on public sector pay rises will apply to all
settlements regardless of whether pay is usually set by negotiation, a pay
review body or a formula tying pay to another settlement.
The chancellor said that the prime minister wrote yesterday to each of the
review body chairmen and asked all except the school teachers' review body
(because of its statutory basis) not to recommend basic pay increases for
1993.
However, the review bodies had been invited to continue work on performance
pay and other specific issues as appropriate to their remit groups.
In a statement, the Treasury said the school teachers' review body had been
directed 'to have regard to the government's general policy that increases
in public sector pay should be restricted to between 0 per cent and 1 1/2
per cent in the coming year'.
The statement continued: 'The government intends that groups covered by the
doctors' and dentists' review body, the nurses' pay review body and the
armed forces pay review body, should receive an increase in pay of 1 1/2 per
cent from 1 April 1993. In common with ministers, top salary review body
groups will receive no pay increase for 1993.
For TSRB groups, the government intends to honour the second stage of the
1992 award, under which these groups will receive an increase of 2.9 per
cent from 1 April 1993.
The government sees a continuing role for the review bodies, whose advice it
has greatly valued, although there must be changes from time to time to
reflect developments in their remit groups.
Policy on public-sector pay for future years will depend on a wide range of
economic and other factors, including the development of performance pay and
more decentralised arrangements.
The government could not accept that a year of pay restraint should be
followed by a series of catching-up settlements which would dissipate the
benefits achieved.'
The chancellor said pay restraint 'will release sums of the order of Pounds
1 1/2 bn in 1993-1994 with similar effect on the pay bill in future years'.
He added: 'The constraint will apply to all offers made by public-sector
managers from yesterday.
Any formal offers which have already been made will be honoured.
The constraint will last for one year until it has been applied to all
public-sector groups.
Those groups which have already settled this year, or where offers are
outstanding, will have their 1993 settlement constrained instead. No group
will be caught twice.
The private sector is already subject to strong downward pressure on pay and
pay increases are now lower than for a generation.
The recent depreciation of sterling has given a significant boost to the
competitiveness of British producers.
It is essential that this is not eroded by rising labour costs.
The government has a particular responsibility to ensure that the public
sector is subject to the same rigorous discipline.
The government will continue to pursue its long-term objectives of
increasing flexibility within public-sector-pay systems and of strengthening
the link between performance and pay.
There should be no reason for lower settlement levels to stand in the way of
progress towards the decentralisation of pay bargaining and the extension of
performance pay.
Where more flexible arrangements are already in place, increases for
individuals will be both higher and lower than the overall figure.
A figure of 1 1/2 per cent does not represent an entitlement and
public-sector managers will continue to negotiate pay increases which are
consistent with the need for their organisation to deliver agreed levels of
service within an agreed provision.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Public spending targeted for
a tougher bridle - The Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury yesterday stressed that its main target was to limit rises in
public expenditure in its allocations to the departments.
Its statement said: 'Firm control over public expenditure and a sustainable
fiscal position are fundamental to the longer term prospects for the
economy. The government's objective is to reduce public spending as a share
of national income over time. Because of the effects of the cycle, the ratio
of public spending to national income is expected to rise slightly in
1993-94, to a level still well below the peaks seen following previous
recessions. Thereafter it will resume its downward trend.
The achievement of the government's medium-term public expenditure objective
will be supported by the new system of public expenditure control announced
in July. Under the new system, expenditure will be measured against a new
spending aggregate - the new control total (NCT). The NCT includes local
authority self-financed expenditure but excludes the main elements of
cyclical social security, privatisation proceeds and debt interest. Growth
in the NCT will be constrained to a rate which ensures that total public
spending - general government expenditure - grows by less than the economy
as a whole over the economic cycle.
The new arrangements involve a top-down approach to public expenditure
planning, focusing first on what can be afforded and then on how the
available resources should best be allocated to meet the government's
priorities.
The new expenditure plans meet the remit for the public expenditure survey
set by the cabinet in July - maintaining existing cash plans for 1993-94 and
restricting growth in the new control total thereafter to give average real
growth over the three years no higher than 1 1/2 per cent.
The new plans imply a planning total for 1993-94 of Pounds 244.5bn, the
figure set in last year's Autumn Statement.
Consistent with this, the new control total has been set at Pounds 243.8bn
for 1993-94, and at Pounds 253.6bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn for
1995-96.
The real growth in the new control total implied by these figures is 2.3 per
cent in 1993-94, 0.7 per cent in 1994-95 and 1 per cent in 1995-96. Over the
three year period, the new control total is planned to grow on average by
1.4 per cent in real terms. The corresponding figure for the previous three
years was 3.2 per cent.
The new control totals include reserves of Pounds 4bn in 1993-94, Pounds 7bn
in 1994-95 and Pounds 10bn in 1995-96.
These are a little lower than the corresponding figures last year,
reflecting the changed nature of the control system.
The chancellor announced a series of measures to provide a substantial boost
to capital spending by both public and private sectors.
There will be a time-limited increase in the capital allowances available in
the first year for investment in plant and machinery (excluding cars); and a
special initial allowance for industrial and agricultural buildings.
There will be important changes in the use of private finance to enable the
public and private sectors to work more effectively together, particularly
on infrastructure projects.
The temporary relaxation of the local authority capital receipts rules
announced yesterday will be worth over Pounds 1bn over the survey period.
Restraint on current spending has also helped make room for protecting
capital.
The new plans include:
Maintenance of the national roads programme at the level previously planned.
Because of the fall in construction prices the level of new starts in
1993-94 will be nearly double the level likely to be achieved this year.
Total investment by British Rail and London Transport in 1993-94 expected in
real terms to be almost double the level in 1979.
The leasing of some Pounds 150m new rolling stock by BR in the next three
years, provided suitable leases are offered
Provision for the Jubilee Line extension.
Health capital spending in England at a record level next year of nearly
Pounds 2.1bn.
Privatisation proceeds, which are not part of the new control total and do
not therefore affect expenditure, are projected at Pounds 5.5bn in both
1993-94 and 1994-95, in line with previous plans, and at Pounds 1bn in
1995-96.
The planning total for the current year is forecast at Pounds 226.1bn, in
line with the plans in last year's Autumn Statement after allowing for
classification changes and the Pounds 750m housing recovery package.
The overall objective for public expenditure is expressed in terms of the
wider aggregate, general government expenditure (GGE), excluding
privatisation proceeds. GGE includes all of social security expenditure and
central government debt interest.
Total government spending as measured by GGE as a share of national income
is likely to rise to an estimated 44 per cent in 1992-93, mainly as a result
of the recession. It is projected to rise a little further to 45 1/2 per
cent in 1993-94. The government is determined to reduce this ratio, although
it is below the recession-related peaks of 49 1/4 per cent in 1975-76 and 47
1/2 per cent in 1982-83.
It is expected to fall to 45 per cent in 1994-95 and 44 1/4 per cent in
1995-96.
The survey has been an extremely tough one, requiring difficult decisions of
all cabinet ministers.
No programme has been protected from intense scrutiny for savings. But,
where possible, the government has sought to give priority to capital
spending and to other expenditure that contributes to the long-term health
of the economy.
Pay: settlements in the public sector in the coming year will be restricted
to a maximum of 1 1/2 per cent in order to keep pay bills as low as
possible. Without pay restraint there would be less room for spending by
government departments, the NHS and local authorities on services to the
public and on capital.
Transport: the cash plans agreed for the national road programme last year
have been maintained, permitting increased activity as a result of lower
construction prices. The plans provide for higher real investment by BR in
1993-94 than at any time in the 1980s.
They also include provision of over Pounds 1.2bn over the next three years
for the Jubilee Line extension, which will go ahead subject to satisfactory
completion of legal agreements. The government is seeking to encourage
greater levels of transport investment in the medium term through the new
initiatives on private finance.
To encourage the development of a private-sector leasing market for rolling
stock in the lead up to privatisation, BR will be allowed to lease some
Pounds 150m of new rolling stock over the next three financial years.
Housing: the government made a manifesto commitment to provide 153,000 homes
over three years through the Housing Corporation. The new plans should
enable this figure to be comfortably achieved. The government will be
looking for a growing private-sector contribution to the corporation's
programme.
Education: central government spending on education, including support for
local authorities, will be Pounds 9.5bn in 1993-94, Pounds 0.5bn or 3 per
cent higher in real terms than the equivalent forecast out-turn in 1992-93.
The plans will fund an increase of 8 per cent in students attending further
education and sixth form colleges next year, and a 25 per cent increase over
three years, as well as the expansion of grant maintained schools outlined
in the White Paper Choice and Diversity. Provision has also been made to
enable participation in higher education to remain constant at record
levels, following the rapid rise in numbers in recent years.
Employment: the new plans provide real growth of 1 per cent in 1993-94 over
the planned level in 1992-93, which will allow for 500,000 more
opportunities to the unemployed, Youth Training places for a higher
proportion of school leavers and the creation of a new adult training and
work preparation programme.
In addition Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) will have more
flexibility to decide how best to use their resources in line with local
labour market needs; and extra money has been provided for schemes such as
Investors in People which are based on close collaboration between Tecs and
local business communities.
Health: planned spending on the National Health Service in England in
1993-94 will be Pounds 29bn, Pounds 1.6bn higher than the plans for 1992-93.
This represents a real-terms increase of 1 per cent over forecast out-turn,
and should allow for growth in hospital activity of at least 2 1/2 per cent.
Capital spending by health authorities and NHS trusts is likely to be at a
record level of almost Pounds 2.1bn.
Defence: during the period covered by the new plans the benefits of the
Options for Change review will be secured and some further savings will be
made consistent with the policies underlying it. Defence spending will fall
by 3 per cent in real terms next year, partly reflecting the much lower pay
settlements now expected, and will continue to decline in real terms in the
following two years.
In total, expenditure on defence is planned to fall in real terms by 10 1/2
per cent between 1992-93 and 1995-96. Over the same period, defence
expenditure will fall as a percentage of GDP from 4 per cent to 3 1/4 per
cent.
Social security: Pounds 3bn has been added to plans for social security
spending in 1993-94, honouring existing commitments. The plans maintain the
real value of social security benefits, most of which will go up by 3.6 per
cent in April 1993.
The increase also reflects the impact of higher unemployment, and of higher
take-up rates for other benefits. The new plans take account of further
action to combat fraud and recover overpayments.
Local government: central government support for local authority revenue
expenditure will rise by 3.7 per cent in England next year compared with the
current year and total standard spending by 3.1 per cent.
The total revenue to be raised from domestic taxpayers in the first year of
the new council tax will be similar in cash terms to the amount being raised
through the community charge in the current year. There will be a special
grant of Pounds 539m next year in England, including Pounds 140m of new
money, to help local authorities discharge their new responsibilities for
community care.
The secretaries of state for the environment, Scotland and Wales will make
announcements about the details of the local authority settlements later
this month.
Overseas Development: planned UK external assistance will rise by 1995-96 by
more than Pounds 200m in cash terms, or 10 per cent, compared with 1992-93
plans. Aid to developing countries will rise in 1993-94 by nearly 1 per cent
in real terms compared with 1992-93 plans, to about Pounds 1,900m. It will
be maintained at that level for the following two years.
Legal departments: the new plans provide additional resources of around
Pounds 0.4bn for legal aid next year. Total expenditure on legal aid is
forecast to rise to Pounds 1.5bn by 1995-96.
The government will be taking steps to secure improved value for money by
more effective targeting and by payment arrangements which encourage
efficiency and quality.
Agriculture: the new plans provide for substantial increases in provision in
each year, mainly reflecting the reform of the Common Agricultural Programme
agreed by European Community agriculture ministers in May 1992.
The reform is expected to lower the cost of the CAP to consumers by reducing
prices, with compensation to farmers in the form of increased direct
payments.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: The system for allocating to Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland the consequential effects of expenditure
decisions in England remains in place.
The formula has been updated to take account of the latest population
figures contained in the 1991 census.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Consumer spending forecast
to lift GDP by 1% - Economic prospects for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains the main Autumn Statement forecasts from the Treasury
on government expenditure for 1993-94 and the two subsequent financial
years, and on developments in the economy next year. Also included are
releases on spending from the main government departments
RECOVERY in the world economy has stalled again. GDP growth in the major
seven economies (G7) slowed sharply in the second quarter and industrial
production is falling in a number of the larger countries.
Moreover confidence has fallen following recent turmoil on the foreign
exchange markets. As a result, independent forecasts of G7 growth have been
revised down sharply. The Treasury forecast of G7 growth is 1 1/2 per cent
this year, rising to 1 3/4 per cent in 1993 - well below the early summer
consensus of around 3 per cent.
UK demand and activity: Demand and activity in the UK have been weaker than
expected at the time of the Budget. GDP fell  1/2 per cent in the first half
of 1992 and may fall slightly in the second half, reflecting the recent
deterioration in business and consumer confidence. The Treasury forecast is
a fall of 1 per cent in 1992 as a whole. However, the substantial easing of
monetary policy since mid-September and the measures announced in the Autumn
Statement strengthen the conditions for recovery next year.
The average independent forecast made since sterling's ERM suspension is an
increase in GDP in 1993 of 1 1/4 per cent. Fifteen out of 24 forecasts
envisage growth of 1 per cent or more.
The Treasury forecast is an increase in GDP in 1993 of 1 per cent. As in
most independent forecasts the stimulus to growth is expected to come
largely from consumer spending and stocks. Exports are also generally
forecast to increase more rapidly than in 1992 in response to the recent
depreciation of sterling.
Inflation: Underlying inflation has fallen further over the past year.
The RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), rose by 4 per cent in
the year to September compared with 5 3/4 per cent a year earlier.
As inflation responds with a lag to demand, the effect of the recession
should continue to exert strong disinflationary pressure over the next year.
However, the depreciation of sterling inevitably means that, despite the
weakness of demand, prices will be higher than they would otherwise have
been.
The Treasury forecast shows underlying inflation at 3 3/4 per cent for the
RPI excluding MIPs by the fourth quarter of 1993. The average independent
forecast puts underlying inflation a little higher than this at 4 1/4 per
cent.
Labour market: The growth of average earnings fell to 5 1/2 per cent in
September from 7 3/4 per cent a year earlier, and is expected to fall
further over the next year.
The rate of increase of unemployment has picked up in recent months, but is
lower than in the first half of 1991. Most forecasters are projecting
further increases in unemployment in 1993.
Current account: The current account deficit is forecast to be Pounds 12bn
in 1992, but it is expected to widen further in 1993 to Pounds 15.5bn.
Much of the deterioration arises from import prices rising faster than
export prices following the depreciation of sterling.
The average independent forecast for 1993 is more optimistic at Pounds 14bn,
but the wide range of forecasts indicates the great uncertainty.
Financial developments: Since sterling's ERM suspension in mid-September the
sterling index has averaged 81, 11 per cent lower than its average in the
first half of 1992.
The forecast makes the conventional assumption that sterling remains close
to recent levels. Short-term interest rates, 10 1/2 per cent a year ago,
were down to 8 per cent by the end of October. Equity prices have picked up
since ERM suspension, making good earlier losses to show a small increase
since this time last year. House prices have fallen 8 3/4 per cent over the
last year.
M0 has remained in the upper half of its target range over the last year.
Broad money (M4) growth has continued to slow and was 5 per cent in
September. Bank and building society lending to the private sector has
followed a similar profile and was 4 3/4 per cent higher in September than a
year earlier.
Public finances: The latest Treasury forecast is that the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) will be Pounds 37bn in 1992-93, up from Pounds
28bn in the Budget forecast.
The upward revision largely reflects lower than expected activity and
earnings, but also the measures announced in the Autumn Statement. On the
basis of the latest forecasts for activity and inflation, the new public
expenditure plans and the other changes announced in the Autumn Statement,
together with the standard assumptions of the indexation and revalorisation
of taxes, imply a PSBR in 1993-94 of about 7 per cent of GDP. The range of
outside forecasts is Pounds 31bn-Pounds 52.5bn, equivalent to 5-8 1/4 per
cent of GDP. The actual PSBR for 1993-94 will be set in the Budget.
World economy: G7 industrial production rose strongly in mid-1991, led by a
recovery in the US, but fell again from the autumn as the US recovery
stalled and production began to slide steeply in Japan. In the first half of
1992, the weakness spread to continental Europe, with falls in industrial
production in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
Following a deceptively strong rise in the first quarter of 1992, GDP growth
in the G7 countries slowed sharply in the second quarter. Output was weak in
all major countries, and fell slightly in Germany.
In the first half of the year, G7 GDP was just under 1 1/2 per cent higher
than a year earlier, following growth of  3/4 per cent in 1991. Though G7
industrial production has stabilised in recent months, it remains 2 per cent
below its peak in autumn 1990. Also both business and consumer confidence
have continued to weaken in the US, Japan and most continental European
countries.
This may in part be a consequence of recent monetary and fiscal policy
developments, especially in Europe. Though interest rates have continued to
fall in the US and Japan, strains within the ERM in September forced up
rates in some European countries - notably France, Italy, Ireland and
Sweden. German market rates have now fallen back by about 1 point from their
end-August peak and rates in some other countries have followed, but
European real interest rates remain exceptionally high, at around 6 per cent
on average.
Recent sharp changes in exchange rates may help growth in those European
countries whose exchange rates have fallen. But elsewhere in Europe growth
will be hit by higher real exchange rates.
Many European countries are also tightening fiscal policy, as the prolonged
slowdown undermines plans to reduce budget deficits.
Sluggish growth and abundant spare capacity in most G7 countries have
maintained downward pressure on inflation. During 1992 inflation has
stabilised at around 3 per cent in the US and has fallen substantially in
Japan, Italy and Canada. In Germany headline inflation has fallen to 3 3/4
per cent from its peak of 4 3/4 per cent in March, as last year's indirect
tax increases have dropped out of the annual rate. In September consumer
price inflation in the G7 countries averaged 3 per cent, compared with 5 1/2
per cent at the end of 1990.
Strong disinflationary pressures in the world economy are also reflected in
non-oil commodity prices, which have weakened again in recent months,
following a brief revival early in the year.
In real terms, non-oil commodity prices are at their lowest level since the
early 1970s. Oil prices have been relatively stable since falling back in
the first quarter of 1991 from their Gulf crisis peak. They have averaged
Dollars 20 a barrel since the Budget and are assumed in the forecast to
remain at that level.
Forecast: Against this background of weak indicators and tight policy in
Europe, most forecasters have revised down their projections of G7 GDP
growth, especially for 1993. Forecasts of growth in 1992 fell steadily from
2 1/2 to 3 per cent last autumn to 1 3/4 per cent by the spring. The Budget
forecast, at 1 1/2 per cent, was at the bottom end of the range. But the
consensus is now close to the Treasury forecast, which is unchanged from
Budget-time.
The profile of activity through 1992 has, however, been rather different,
with a stronger first half and weaker second half than expected. This has
implications for the forecast of growth in 1993, which has been revised down
to 1 3/4 per cent (compared with the Budget forecast of 2 3/4 per cent in
the year to the first half of 1993). The OECD in June and the IMF in
September both forecast G7 growth of around 3 per cent in 1993. But the OECD
has now indicated that it has revised down its forecast of OECD growth in
1993, to around 2 per cent.
This outlook represents an unusually prolonged period of slow growth. Growth
is expected to remain well below trend in the second half of this year, and
is not expected to recover to around trend until the second half of next
year. Despite very low interest rates, recovery in the US is forecast to be
sluggish, with growth of 1 3/4 per cent this year rising to 2 1/4 per cent
in 1993. The recovery in consumption in the US is likely to be held back by
the weakness of employment growth and, with debt levels still high, the
absence of much scope for a sustained fall in personal saving.
Growth in Japan could be only 1 3/4 per cent in 1992, the lowest since 1974.
Though some recovery is widely expected next year, helped by low interest
rates and the fiscal package announced at the end of August, the prospects
are for growth of around 2 1/2 per cent - well below trend. Growth in the
three main continental European economies is forecast to be under 1 per cent
in 1993, following 1 1/4 per cent in 1992. The expected boost to German
growth from the removal of the temporary income tax surcharge in July 1992
has not materialised. German GNP may continue to fall in the short run, and
could show little recovery until the middle of next year.
With no strong pick-up in world demand expected next year, real commodity
prices are forecast to remain very subdued. This and the persistence of
below trend output provide a favourable background for further reductions in
inflation. G7 consumer price inflation is forecast to fall from its current
level of 3 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1993. This is
more optimistic than many independent forecasts which show no further
progress on G7 inflation, and some rise in the US once the recovery gets
going. These forecasts may understate the disinflationary impact of abundant
spare capacity and high unemployment, which are likely to persist well into
1993 in the US, as elsewhere. The Treasury forecast is for US inflation to
fall further to 2 1/2 per cent by the end of 1993. Underlying German
inflation should fall too, but the headline rate will be boosted by the
proposed 1 per cent VAT increase at the beginning of 1993.
Despite the slowdown in industrial countries, activity in developing
countries has remained buoyant, with strong rises in Latin America and the
Far East. This has helped sustain world trade in manufactures, which is
estimated to have risen by 4 per cent in 1991. A similar rate of growth is
forecast for 1992, rising to 5 per cent in 1993. This would still be below
the average for the 1980s.
UK demand and output:
Domestic demand edged up over the year to the second quarter of 1992,
increasing by over  1/2 per cent despite consumers' expenditure remaining
flat. But with imports rising more than exports, GDP fell. By the second
quarter of 1992 GDP was over  1/2 per cent below its level a year earlier.
And although non-oil GDP rose marginally in the second quarter it was almost
1 per cent down on a year earlier.
Activity in the first half of 1992 has turned out weaker than in the Budget
forecast: GDP growth in the first half was about 1 percentage point lower
than forecast. Domestic demand was weaker than expected and, more
importantly, imports took a higher share than forecast, largely reflecting a
shift in the composition of demand towards manufactures.
Within non-oil GDP, output fell in the year to the second quarter in all the
main sectors - manufacturing, services, non-oil energy and construction -
with the largest fall in the construction sector. But service sector output
has fallen only marginally this year and manufacturing output rose in both
the first and second quarters.
Prospects: The signs are that GDP may have been broadly unchanged or fallen
slightly in the third quarter. With the exception of North Sea oil and gas,
output may have been at best flat in all sectors, and may have fallen in
some. The prospects are that the remainder of the year may be weak too.
Consumer confidence has fallen over the summer and into the autumn, and a
range of recent surveys show falling business confidence. The fall in the
value of sterling following suspension of ERM membership, recent cuts in
interest rates and the measures announced, should reverse these trends, but
they are unlikely to have a large impact on GDP in the remainder of 1992.
Exporters can no doubt expect some early benefit, but there has been renewed
weakness in the world economy and part of the additional demand is likely to
be met from stocks.
The Treasury forecast for GDP in 1992 as a whole is a fall of about 1 per
cent, implying a decline of roughly  1/4 per cent between the first and
second halves of the year. This is in line with the average of recent
independent forecasts. The Treasury forecast for manufacturing output in
1992 shows it falling by a similar amount to GDP.
Growth prospects for 1993 have been improved by the recent easing of
monetary policy and measures announced. But this needs to be set against the
projected weakness of the recovery in the world economy, and the muted
response of domestic demand, particularly consumer spending, to earlier
reductions in interest rates.
The Treasury forecast for GDP growth in 1993 is 1 per cent, well within the
range of recent independent forecasts, but a little below the average.
Growth in the year to the second half of 1993 is forecast at 1 3/4 per cent.
The recovery could, of course, be a lot stronger than this if confidence
picks up quickly in response to recent Government initiatives. But it seems
prudent not to base the forecast on this assumption.
In the Treasury forecast all components of domestic demand are forecast to
rise in 1993, but the largest contributions to growth are from consumer
spending and stocks. The growth of exports is expected to rise next year too
in response to the depreciation of sterling and the projected world economic
recovery.
The increase in domestic demand in the Treasury forecast is somewhat larger
than in the independent average forecast, but this is more than offset by a
smaller contribution from net trade. Within domestic demand the Treasury has
slightly stronger growth of consumers' expenditure and investment - in part
reflecting the measures announced - and a larger contribution from stocks.
Personal sector
Consumers' expenditure dipped in the first quarter of 1992 but recovered in
the second quarter to much the same level as in the second half of 1991.
This pattern is probably accounted for by uncertainty in the run-up to the
election. Retail sales moved up again in the third quarter, by  1/2 per
cent, in spite of declining consumer confidence since the spring. Car
registrations also rose.
Prospects: The outlook for consumption depends on the balance of opposing
influences. Factors pointing to higher expenditure include:
Rising real incomes. The  1/2 per cent fall in real personal disposable
income in 1991 is expected to be reversed in 1992, with further growth of 1
1/2 per cent forecast in 1993.
Lower interest rates. The effects on consumption of interest rate falls
prior to the suspension of sterling from the ERM have yet to come through
fully. The residual effects of these cuts will add to the effects of the
interest rate cuts since sterling's suspension. Income gearing - the ratio
of interest payments to income - which peaked at over 12 per cent in 1990,
should be down to around 9 per cent at the end of 1992.
Factors holding consumer spending back include:
Low consumer confidence, which may partly reflect rising unemployment.
The high level of personal sector debt: This grew rapidly in the 1980s
because financial liberalisation and rising house prices raised the amount
of debt people were prepared to hold and the amounts lenders were prepared
to advance. Rising interest rates from 1988 and falling house prices from
1989 put these factors into reverse.
But it is unclear what level of debt the personal sector is now aiming for,
and to what lengths it will go to achieve it. The latest figures suggest
that the debt-income ratio peaked during 1991 and has declined a little in
1992.
Continued weakness in the housing market, reflected in depressed turnover
and falling prices.
Housing market: Personal sector spending has been closely linked with
developments in the housing market in recent years. The decline in house
prices which started in 1989 has continued in 1992, with house prices as
measured by the Halifax index 8 3/4 per cent lower in October than a year
earlier.
The temporary suspension of stamp duty on purchases of less than Pounds
250,000 was effective in stimulating activity, with a sharp pick-up in
turnover and a slowdown in price falls towards the end of the concession in
mid-August.
It would not be surprising if activity were to have fallen back temporarily
after the withdrawal of the concession.
Private sector housing starts and completions remain on downward trends; new
orders have, however, stabilised in recent months.  Falling mortgage rates -
now at their lowest levels since the 1970s - and lower house prices mean
that house purchase has become more affordable.  This should help to
stabilise the housing market, which will also benefit from the measures
announced.  Although the current position is unfavourable, it is possible
that both turnover and prices will start to rise some time in 1993.
In common with most independent forecasts, the view taken in the Treasury
forecast is that the balance of factors affecting consumption will result in
an increase in spending in 1993, following a slight fall in 1992. The
forecast is a rise of 1 1/4 per cent in 1993 - slightly above the average
independent forecast of 1 per cent.
In the Treasury forecast the increase is more than accounted for by the
projected rise in real incomes, with the saving ratio rising marginally in
1993. Earlier forecasts anticipated small falls in the saving ratio.
With the saving ratio over 10 per cent in both 1992 and 1993 and housing
investment continuing to be weak, the personal sector's financial surplus is
forecast to be around 6 per cent of disposable income in 1992 and perhaps
around 6 1/2 per cent in 1993. The debt-income ratio at the end of 1993
could be some 5 per cent below its peak.
Company income and saving: Industrial and commercial companies' profits (net
of stock appreciation) were flat between 1990 and 1991, as the recession
squeezed both margins and turnover. But profits were somewhat stronger in
the first half of 1992, reflecting improved cost control. So with falling
interest and tax payments, and despite high dividend payments, company
saving (undistributed income) rose modestly in the first half of 1992
relative to the average for 1991.
Business investment: Against the background of extremely large financial
deficits in 1989 and 1990 and weak profits during the recession, companies
have cut back on investment as they have sought to improve their financial
position. Total business investment fell 9 1/2 per cent in 1991, but rose
slightly in the first half of 1992, mainly as a result of higher investment
by public corporations and North Sea oil companies. For 1992 as a whole
business investment is forecast to fall by 1 3/4 per cent.
Looking ahead to 1993 it would be unrealistic, with the large degree of
spare capacity and only a modest recovery in demand, to expect a sharp
turnround in business investment. However, the temporary increase in capital
allowances will boost investment in 1993. Non-oil business investment is
forecast to rise during the course of the year, but with lower North Sea
investment, total business investment is projected to show no change in 1993
as a whole. Even in 1993, however, the ratio of business investment to GDP
is expected to be higher than the levels seen between 1970 and the
mid-1980s.
General government investment: General government fixed investment is
forecast to rise in volume terms by 7 per cent in 1992 and, despite the
tight public expenditure round, it should increase further in 1993 by 1 3/4
per cent. This compares with projected increases in the volume of general
government consumption of  1/2 per cent in both 1992 and 1993.
Whole economy investment: The Treasury forecast is a fall of 2 per cent in
whole economy investment in 1992, followed by a rise of  1/4 per cent in
1993. This is more optimistic than the average of independent forecasts,
which suggests a fall of  1/4 per cent in 1993. This difference probably
reflects in part the positive impact on investment of the measures
announced.
Stockbuilding: Companies shed stocks heavily in 1991, but the pace of
destocking slowed progressively from mid-year and into 1992. However,
further destocking is to be expected, particularly by manufacturers, in the
second half of 1992. Distributors ran down stocks rapidly in the second
quarter and manufacturers appear to have been caught out by lower than
expected demand, leading to involuntary stock holding. And with demand
remaining weak destocking may continue into 1993, before rising sales and
output justify a return to stockbuilding. The turnround in stockbuilding is
forecast to contribute  1/2 per cent to GDP growth in both 1992 and 1993.
Companies' financial position: Profitability of non-North Sea companies, as
measured by the real rate of return, is forecast to pick up slightly in
1992, and more strongly in 1993 as demand rises. Companies' saving will also
benefit from lower interest rates which will reduce debt service payments.
With industrial and commercial companies' saving rising and their capital
spending falling in 1992 and rising only slowly in 1993, their financial
deficit is forecast to undergo further correction, moving back to balance in
1993.
Employment and unemployment: Total employment in June 1992 was over 1.5m
down on its peak in June 1990. Firms have shed labour faster during this
recession than during the two previous ones. Consequently productivity
performance has been better: it has been increasing since the start of 1991,
a much earlier stage than usual in the cycle. Productivity gains moderated
as the rate of job losses slowed sharply between the first halves of 1991
and 1992. However, it may be some time before employment stops falling -
typically it lags the cycle in output.
Claimant unemployment has increased by less than the fall in employment
during the recession. From its low point in April 1990 it rose about 1.1m to
June 1992, though with clear signs that the rate of increase was moderating.
But in more recent months the rate of increase has risen reflecting renewed
job shedding, particularly in manufacturing. Unemployment may continue to
rise for some time, though the rate of increase should start to slow again
as activity picks up.
Trade and balance of payments
Developments in 1992: The current account deficit was about Pounds 3bn in
each of the first three quarters of 1992. The visibles deficit was on a
gently rising trend with export volumes levelling off after rising early in
the year, and import volumes continuing to rise, albeit at a slower rate
than earlier in the year.
The invisibles surplus in the first three quarters is projected at less than
Pounds 1bn - well down on the Pounds 4bn surplus recorded in 1991 when it
benefited from overseas contributions to the UK's Gulf expenditure and from
unusually low net contributions to the EC.
Weaker invisibles than anticipated in the Budget forecast, which showed a
surplus of Pounds 4.5bn in 1992, are in part the consequence of revisions to
previous outturns which have reduced the invisibles surplus in 1991 by
Pounds 1bn.
In addition, a downward revision to the UK's net stock of overseas assets at
the end of 1991 to Pounds 16bn - half the earlier estimate - has reduced
estimated net investment income in 1992.
Although the fall in the exchange rate will have increased the net stock of
overseas assets, the prospective current account deficits will tend to have
the opposite effect.
Turning to visible trade, the deficit on manufactures has run ahead of the
Budget forecast for 1992. It was Pounds 5bn in the first three quarters -
the same as the earlier forecast for the whole of 1992. Non-oil exports fell
back a little in the third quarter, after reaching record levels in the
second. Non-oil imports have grown more quickly than forecast mainly because
the demand for manufactured goods appears to have risen unusually quickly in
relation to the overall growth of demand.
Competitiveness: Growth of UK unit labour costs has continued to come more
into line with that of our competitors. In 1991 UK manufacturers' unit
labour costs rose 5 per cent faster than competitors' unit labour costs
measured in local currency.
In 1992, UK unit labour cost growth is expected to be, if anything, a little
slower than in competitor countries. In 1993, this favourable gap is
expected to widen further, with UK labour costs perhaps falling a little.
The implication is that the improvement in competitiveness from the recent
depreciation of sterling will be maintained through 1993. In 1993 on
average, cost competitiveness is projected to be some 16 per cent better
than in the first three quarters of 1992.
Outlook for exports: Manufactured export volumes reached record levels in
mid-1992, but fell back in the third quarter. Overall they are expected to
rise by 1 1/2 per cent in 1992. Deliveries in the fourth quarter should
benefit a little from the improved competitiveness, but this will have its
greatest effect in 1993 and later. This should mean exports growing faster
than world trade: manufactured export volumes could rise by 7 1/4 per cent
in 1993, compared with world trade growth of 5 per cent.
Overall, goods and services export volumes are forecast to rise 5 1/2 per
cent in 1993. This is a little above the average independent forecast which
puts export growth at 4 3/4 per cent in 1993, but within the independent
range.
Outlook for imports: The improvements in competitiveness will also benefit
firms competing with imports. Non-oil import volumes are expected to grow by
7 1/4 per cent in 1993 - the same as in 1992 even though total final
expenditure is expected to increase 1 1/2 per cent more quickly in 1993 than
in 1992. The continuing specialisation of world production is likely to mean
a further rise in import penetration, but this should be muted by improved
competitiveness. The volume of imports of goods and services is forecast to
increase by 5 3/4 per cent in 1993, less than the rise in 1992. The forecast
for 1993 is above the average of independent forecasts of 3 3/4 per cent,
but well within their wide range.
The North Sea: North Sea production fell back in the first half of 1992,
following its strong recovery at the end of last year. Output is expected to
rise by only per cent in 1992, less than expected at Budget time. Delays in
starting up new fields and in returning old fields to production after
maintenance explain the shortfall. Output is expected to rise by 7 per cent
in 1993. With production rising and oil prices assumed to remain close to
recent levels, the surplus on oil trade is expected to rise to Pounds 2bn in
1993 from Pounds 1.5bn in 1992.
Invisibles: Even without the benefit of the lower exchange rate, the balance
of interest, profits and dividends (IPD) was expected to improve in 1992.
The 1991 balance was depressed in part by stock losses arising from oil
price changes at the time of the Gulf war. The lower exchange rate will
boost the surplus from the fourth quarter of 1992 by increasing the sterling
value of foreign currency denominated credits. While the surpluses on
services and IPD are both expected to rise in 1993, the invisibles surplus
as a whole rises by less because of slightly higher net outward government
transfers. Overall, the invisibles surplus is expected to rise to Pounds 4bn
in 1993 from Pounds 2bn in 1992.
Current account: The current account deficit is projected to be Pounds 12bn
in 1992, rising to Pounds 15.5bn in 1993. The deterioration is more than
accounted for by a rise in the visibles deficit. With export and import
volumes growing at similar rates, this is largely explained by price
movements. Equal rises in export and import prices following the
depreciation would automatically worsen the current account before volumes
adjust. Moreover, import prices are expected to react more quickly to the
depreciation of sterling as exporters keep prices down to increase volumes.
The terms of trade (excluding oil) are expected to worsen by 2 1/2 per cent.
The forecast of the current account deficit in 1992 is virtually the same as
the independent average. The forecast for 1993 is above the average figure
of Pounds 14bn, though the wide range of independent forecasts illustrates
the high degree of uncertainty.
Inflation
Good progress has been made in reducing inflation. Underlying inflation, as
measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), fell to 4
per cent in September, down 1.7 percentage points since April. All-items RPI
inflation has been a little lower than expected since the Budget and was 3.6
per cent in September. Producer output prices are increasing even more
slowly, with the rate excluding food, drink and tobacco at 2.5 per cent in
October, the lowest since May 1969. And with unit wage costs in
manufacturing in June to August only 2.3 per cent up on a year earlier,
pressure on profit margins has been easing.
In response to falling inflation, a weak labour market, and the tight
financial position of companies, pay settlements have continued to fall over
the past year. CBI and other data point to settlements in both manufacturing
and services recently averaging just over 4 per cent, about half the level
in early 1991. Whole economy underlying earnings growth fell to 5 1/2 per
cent in September, down from over 10 per cent in mid-1990 and the lowest
since 1967. And the full effect of lower settlements has still to feed
through into year-on-year earnings growth.
Prospects: Inflation reacts with a lag to demand and activity. The
considerable degree of spare capacity in the economy will therefore continue
to exert powerful downward pressure on inflation for some time to come, even
if the economy recovers as projected. Support for this view comes from the
CBI Survey which shows the balance of firms planning to raise prices at
record lows in recent months.
The prospect for inflation has, however, been altered by the lower interest
rates and exchange rate following sterling's suspension from the ERM. The
lower exchange rate will inevitably mean higher inflation compared to what
it otherwise would have been, as the cost of imports rises and domestic
producers face less competitive pressure from foreign producers. But the
speed with which the lower exchange rate affects domestic prices and
earnings is uncertain. On the one hand the weakness of domestic and world
markets may mean both that importers will be more restrained than usual in
passing on higher world prices in sterling, and that domestic producers will
be more restrained in passing on higher import costs. On the other hand,
with domestic margins already pared by the recession, there may be limited
scope for absorbing further cost increases.
However, against a background of strong disinflationary pressures, the lower
exchange rate may imply only a marginal and almost certainly a temporary
increase in inflation. Producer output price inflation is now expected to
average 2 1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, before rising to a
temporary peak of 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993. Underlying RPI
inflation may also rise slightly in the months ahead as the lower exchange
rate affects import prices directly, and more generally limits
disinflationary pressure. But the Treasury forecast is that it will fall
back to 3 3/4 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1993.
The outlook for the all-items RPI inflation rate will depend on what happens
to mortgage rates. The Treasury forecast implies that RPI inflation will be
3 1/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992 on the basis of mortgage rates
already announced. For the fourth quarter of 1993, the forecast implies that
RPI inflation would be 3 1/2 per cent if mortgage rates remained unchanged
from those due to take effect from December. But a one percentage point
decrease (increase) in mortgage rates would lower (raise) the level of the
all-items RPI by just over 1/2 per cent, other things equal.
Other forecasters are rather more pessimistic about inflation prospects. The
average of recent independent forecasts for underlying RPI inflation in the
fourth quarter of 1993 is 4 1/4 per cent. There are, however, a number of
independent forecasts showing inflation within the Government's 1-4 per cent
target range. The difference between the Treasury and the average view
probably mainly reflects our somewhat less buoyant view of output, and our
assessment of the amount of disinflationary pressure in the pipeline prior
to ERM withdrawal, rather than a difference of view about the effects of the
lower exchange rate.
Recent and prospective developments in underlying inflation are expected to
be reflected in the GDP deflator, which measures the price of domestic value
added (principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output). The
GDP deflator is now forecast to increase by 4 1/4 per cent in 1992-93, a
little less than forecast at Budget time, and by 2 3/4 per cent in 1993-94.
The projected increase in the deflator in 1993-94 is less than the increase
in consumer prices because of public sector pay restraint and weak
investment prices. Investment prices have fallen over the last year and are
forecast to rise by about 2 per cent in 1993-94.
Financial developments
Exchange rates: Over the last year until its suspension from the ERM,
sterling traded for the most part comfortably within its ERM margins, close
to its central rate of DM2.95. Since suspension, sterling has averaged
DM2.47. In effective terms it was 11 per cent lower on average in October
than a year earlier.
Interest rates: Short-term interest rates began their fall from their 15 per
cent peak in the autumn of 1990; this has continued in 1992. They fell  1/2
per cent in May to 10 per cent, and, after two further cuts since ERM
suspension, they stood at 8 per cent at the end of October. Long rates have
fallen  3/4 per cent over the last year: an increase following ERM
suspension has now been reversed. But the yield curve is now upward sloping
for the first time since early 1988. Equity prices have picked up since ERM
suspension, making good earlier losses to show a small increase since this
time last year.
Monetary aggregates: M0 has remained well within its target range throughout
1992. Its 12-month growth rate has been between 2 and 2 1/2 per cent in
every month, except June when it dipped to 1 1/4 per cent. M4's 12-month
growth rate has continued to decline during the past year from 6 1/2 per
cent in September 1991 to 5 per cent a year later. The trend in M4 velocity
has flattened recently. The monitoring range for M4's 12-month growth rate
has been set at 4 to 8 per cent for the remainder of the financial year.
Credit: The growth of M4 lending has fallen further in 1992. In September it
was 4 3/4 per cent. M4 lending to industrial and commercial companies in
1991 was well down on recent years at Pounds 1.3bn, and remained low in the
first half of 1992. Personal sector borrowing has weakened reflecting the
lack of activity in the housing market and weak borrowing for consumption.
Subdued lending is consistent with the personal sector's efforts to reduce
its debt and also with the weakness of company spending.
Public finances
PSBR: The forecast is for a PSBR of Pounds 37bn, as compared with Pounds
28bn in the Budget forecast. Borrowing is usually higher in the first half
of the year than in the second half. However, this year the proportion of
borrowing in the first half is expected to be less than usual for a number
of reasons. Mainstream corporation tax receipts, three-quarters of which
normally come in the second half of the year, are expected to be
substantially down on 1991-92. The growth of central government cash outlays
has been relatively low compared with the forecast for the year as a whole,
and may pick up in the second half. The bulk of privatisation proceeds for
the year (Pounds 5bn out of Pounds 8bn) were received in the first half.
Local authorities' net borrowing has been exceptionally low in the first
half. Finally the measures announced will increase the PSBR in the last five
months of 1992-93, by over Pounds 1bn. Taking all these factors into
account, the PSBR for the second half of the year is now expected to be
around Pounds 18.5bn, the same as in the first half.
Changes since the Budget: The higher PSBR now forecast mostly reflects lower
general government receipts, mainly due to lower economic activity and lower
earnings growth. General government expenditure is Pounds 2.25bn higher than
forecast at Budget time, but around half of this reflects the measures
announced, which also have a small impact on receipts.
Expenditure: The estimated outturn for the planning total would be unchanged
since the Budget, but for the housing measures announced. These account for
a Pounds 750m upward revision. The measures, however, only account for
around one fifth of the higher forecast of local authority self-financed
expenditure, which is up by nearly Pounds 1.5bn. This largely reflects
higher than expected capital spending by local authorities. Central
government debt interest payments are also a little higher than forecast at
Budget time.
Receipts: General government receipts are now forecast to be Pounds 6bn
lower than in the Budget forecast. The downward revision is more than
accounted for by lower tax receipts; other receipts are now expected to be
higher than in the Budget forecast. Much of the lower tax receipts forecast
reflects a lower level of economic activity and lower earnings than in the
Budget forecast. Tax receipts are also reduced a little by the abolition of
car tax. Customs and Excise receipts are expected to be around Pounds 3.75bn
lower than in the Budget forecast and Inland Revenue receipts around Pounds
4.25bn lower. VAT receipts are forecast to be down by Pounds 2.25bn, and
income tax receipts to be Pounds 2bn lower. Receipts of social security
contributions are also down by nearly Pounds 1bn. There has also been a
substantial downward revision (of around Pounds 2bn) to the forecast of
corporation tax receipts; this largely reflects lower than expected tax
payments on profits earned in 1991, and larger repayments of tax as
companies use current losses against tax liabilities.
On a national accounts basis, total taxes and social security contributions
are now forecast at 34 3/4 per cent of GDP, a fall of nearly 1 1/2
percentage points on the previous year. Most of the fall reflects the
recession, and in particular the substantial reduction in corporation tax
receipts.
Independent forecasts: The latest Treasury forecast for the PSBR in 1992-93
is, at Pounds 37bn, around Pounds 3.5bn higher than the average of
independent forecasts. In part this difference reflects the effects of the
measures announced not taken into account in independent forecasts.
Uncertainties
All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. Recent Industry Act
forecasts have emphasised that these are most acute when the economy is at
or close to a turning point. This remains no less true on this occasion, and
applies as much to the forecast of the world economy as to that for the UK.
The recent turbulence in financial markets has added to the uncertainty. The
Treasury forecast is based on the assumption that the exchange rate remains
close to recent levels.
The forecasts presented here are central forecasts, a balance of upside and
downside risks. Domestic demand and GDP have been considerably weaker than
forecast over the past two years, with errors well above the average.
However, the counterpart has been faster than anticipated progress in
reducing inflation, though errors here have been less than the past average.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - The Chancellor's Speech: Strategy
aims for sustainable long-term growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Delivering the Autumn Economic Statement yesterday, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, said:
'With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make my Autumn Statement.
As usual, the main public expenditure figures and the full text of the
Industry Act Forecast will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I
sit down. The printed Autumn Statement will be published next Wednesday,
after which there will be a full debate in this House.
Economic background
Madam Speaker, following the announcement I made in my Budget, next year the
Autumn Statement will be brought together with our proposals for taxation in
one annual Budget statement.
This is a long overdue reform. For one final year, however, I shall bow to
tradition and leave my Budget proposals until the spring. But this Autumn
Statement will also be the first occasion on which the Treasury's economic
forecast will be presented alongside others.
Two weeks ago, I announced my intention to establish a new panel of
independent forecasters. That will be in operation for next year's Budget.
But in the meantime, the forecast I am publishing today will include some
details of how the government's own economic forecast compares with the view
that other organisations have taken. I am sure this change will be widely
welcomed.
Madam Speaker, this year's Autumn Statement has been drawn up against a
background of continuing recession at home and renewed weakness abroad.
Despite exceptionally low interest rates, confidence in the United States
remains depressed.
Industrial production has fallen sharply in Japan.
And the countries of continental Europe face the prospect of continuing high
interest rates and a marked slowdown in Germany.
It is not surprising, therefore, that here in Britain, the recovery that
nearly all forecasters expected at the time of the Budget has still not
become established.
There has been an encouraging increase in retail sales. But the housing
market remains depressed and confidence has taken a severe blow from the
turmoil in the foreign exchange markets that led to sterling's suspension
from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Economic strategy
Madam Speaker, against this difficult background, a strategy that brings
renewed confidence and a return to growth is more essential than ever.
But the government has no intention of engineering a short-lived boom that
would lead swiftly to higher inflation and higher interest rates. Our
objective is sustainable, long-term growth.
And our strategy to achieve that is based on three principles. First, with
the pound floating, a completely new framework is required for monetary
policy. Interest rates are now set according to British monetary conditions
 -to meet the target I have established for inflation. Underlying inflation
will be kept within the range of 1-4 per cent and our aim is to get it down
to the lower half of that range by the end of this parliament.
Low inflation is the key to sustainable growth and a lasting reduction in
unemployment.
I have set out clearly the indicators that will guide my assessment of how
far we are on track to meet our inflation objectives. The exchange rate,
asset prices and the growth of M0 are all taken into account. And today, I
can announce the monitoring range I intend to use for the broad measure of
money, M4. For the second half of this financial year that range will be 4-8
per cent.
Madam Speaker, as I have explained to the House before, in the last few
months of our ERM membership, monetary policy was tighter than was needed to
deliver our inflation objective.
It is crucial that monetary policy should not be so lax that the private
sector faces higher inflation. But, nor should it be so tight that money
demand is inadequate.
Outside the ERM, I have been able to rebalance policy by cutting two
percentage points off interest rates. This, in itself, will provide a
significant boost to the economy, without re-igniting inflation. Despite the
fall in the exchange rate, I expect underlying inflation to be below 4 per
cent by the end of next year. And in common with most economic forecasters,
I expect GDP to rise next year, by about 1 per cent, following a fall of a
similar magnitude in 1992.
My second principle is that there must be an appropriate balance between
fiscal and monetary policy. Above all, public spending must be kept under
firm control.
The government therefore put in place last July a clear medium-term strategy
for the control of public spending, designed to ensure that public
expenditure declines as a share of GDP over time.
The new system is based on a top-down approach. Clear and affordable limits
are set for the total level of public expenditure and the government can
then settle its priorities through a process of collective discussion -
involving first a new cabinet committee, and then the full cabinet itself.
And the third key principle of the government's strategy is that the best
way to increase the long run growth rate in the economy is to make markets
work better. So we will be pressing ahead with our policies on
privatisation, deregulation, cutting out waste and keeping the tax burden on
companies and individuals as low as we can.
We must also fight for the interests of British business in world markets
and provide them with the best environment in which they can compete and
succeed. And in the short-term, that means securing a successful outcome to
the Gatt round.
Madam Speaker, low inflation, tight control of public spending, open
markets, competition, and a vigorous supply side policy - these are the
principles of the government's strategy and they provide the right framework
for economic growth. I do not believe that governments can spend their way
out of recession.
It is individuals and companies in the private sector that are the engine of
economic growth.
But, that does not mean that once the right economic framework is in place,
the government's task is complete. The government too is investing for the
future, in the nation's infrastructure and the development of human capital.
And, as I said in my Mansion House speech, the government has also been
looking at specific policies to ease the path to recovery. I shall be
announcing later in my Statement, a series of measures to rebuild
confidence, to help industry and strengthen the economy.
Taking account of these measures, I expect the PSBR in the current year to
rise to around Pounds 37bn. Of course that is high, but borrowing is bound
to rise in a recession;
and it would be damaging to seek to prevent it from doing so. As the economy
recovers it is absolutely vital that borrowing is brought back towards
balance. We have made an excellent start today with a tight overall
settlement for public spending.
National Insurance contributions
Much of the recent increase in the PSBR reflects the rapid growth in
expenditure on social security benefits, and this has also damaged the
financial position of the National Insurance Fund.
In normal circumstances, it would have been necessary to raise National
Insurance contributions, to reduce that shortfall. But, given the current
weakness of the economy, I do not believe this would have been appropriate.
Accordingly, while the upper and lower earnings limits and the thresholds of
the bands for the employers' contribution will be indexed as usual, the
rates for National Insurance contributions will remain unchanged. And I have
agreed with the Secretary of State for Social Security that the fund should
receive a Treasury grant to make up the shortfall.
Public spending
Madam Speaker, let me now turn to the government's public spending plans.
In this Survey, the priority was clear. It was vital to put the needs of the
economy first. So within a tight overall settlement, we have sought,
wherever possible, to protect programmes, especially capital programmes,
that will promote recovery and Britain's longer term prospects.
At current levels of borrowing, the amount we have to pay in debt interest
is rising rapidly, diverting billions of pounds a year away from spending on
services. Against that background, the cabinet decided in July to set a
remit for the public spending round which would keep expenditure under firm
control.
That remit had two elements. For next year, we set ourselves the objective
of sticking to existing cash plans. And, for the three survey years as a
whole, our aim was to hold the growth of the New Control Total down to 1 1/2
per cent or less, to keep the overall growth in public spending to a rate
below that of the economy as a whole.
Although our target for next year of Pounds 244.5bn allowed a real increase
of 4 1/2 per cent, the pressures for more spending have been intense. And we
have had to consider carefully whether the original targets were achievable.
But I can now announce to the House that we have indeed hit our target. The
planning total for next year will be Pounds 244.5bn. As a result of certain
definitional changes I should warn the House that the number which actually
appears in the printed document will be slightly different. It will, in
fact, be Pounds 2bn lower.
I can also announce that the new totals for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are fully
consistent with the remit agreed in July. Despite the pressures that have
emerged since the summer, the real growth in the NCT over the next three
years will average just under 1 1/2 per cent a year, half the rate of growth
over the last three years.
I am sure that Hon and Rt Hon Members on this side of the House will welcome
the meeting of the remit; and let me at once pay tribute to my Rt Hon Friend
the Chief Secretary for his skill, perseverance and hard work in making this
possible.
Madam Speaker, to meet our objectives we have had to look very carefully at
every single programme and particularly at current spending. The biggest
single budget is of course social security. Indexing the social security
benefits in the coming year would cost Pounds 2 1/2 bn. And if we are to
protect capital spending it is to areas of current spending such as social
security that we must look first.
But, I can now tell the House that despite the many claims on the available
resources the government has been able to meet in full its commitment to
index pensions and other benefits.
The other major claim on current public spending is public sector pay.
The earnings of public sector staff have risen on average by 20 per cent
over the last two years - compared with just 13 per cent in the private
sector. But if the gains in competitiveness from the recent fall in the
exchange rate are not to be lost it is vital that all employers keep tight
control over their paybills.
The public sector cannot be sheltered from the difficulties faced by the
private sector, where pay awards are now the lowest in a generation.
I have therefore decided that in the coming year pay settlements in the
public sector should be restricted to a maximum of 1 1/2 per cent. This is
of course consistent with a lower growth in paybills. The aim must be to
keep the growth in paybills in each area of the public sector as low as
possible.
The restriction will apply to the whole of the public sector and related
bodies without exception, regardless of whether pay is negotiated,
recommended by the Review Bodies or subject to formula calculations. It will
apply to all offers made from today, though formal offers already made will
be honoured.
The government will in due course bring forward a resolution on MPs' pay,
consistent with this policy. Ministers will receive no increase at all.
Other programmes
Given the overall objective of restraining the growth in public spending,
this Survey has involved some difficult decisions. If some items are to be
increased, it means that others must be cut back.
Our tough decisions about public sector pay will lead to savings of Pounds
1.5bn a year. That will permit higher levels of service to the public and
higher capital programmes.
Nonetheless, in some programmes we have made reductions in the baselines set
out last year. But in many cases, expenditure still remains on a rising
trend.
What is more, the progress we have made on inflation will help to ensure
that reductions in baselines are consistent with continuing improvements in
public services.
Even so, individual programmes have faced searching scrutiny and hard
choices have been made.
Over the next few years, defence expenditure will continue to fall in real
terms. The benefits of the Options for Change Review will be secured and
some further savings, consistent with the policies which underlie it, will
be made.
The Legal Aid budget is a demand-led programme that has been putting immense
pressure on the public finances. The Lord Chancellor is announcing changes
to restrict its growth, and they are fully reflected in the Survey.
And at a time when tight control over public expenditure is needed at the
national level, the same discipline should be applied locally. Central
government support for local authority revenue expenditure in England will
therefore rise by 3.7 per cent next year, and total standard spending by 3.1
per cent.
In addition, there will be a special grant of Pounds 539 million in England
to help local authorities meet their new responsibilities for community
care.
This settlement should be fully adequate to meet local authorities'
requirements. The proposals assume that local authorities implement in full
our policy of pay restraint. Provided that they do this, the savings made
will enable them to ensure proper provision of services without exerting
upward pressure on the council tax. The government will not hesitate to use
its capping powers as necessary. My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for
the Environment will be making a full announcement later this month.
Full details of the new plans for local authorities in Scotland and Wales
and for other programmes are being made available separately.
The population-related formulae which largely determine changes to
expenditure provision more generally in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
have been updated. Expenditure plans for the territories will be announced
by their respective Secretaries of State at a later date.
Madam Speaker, at the time of the general election, the government made
clear that education and health would be amongst its key priorities for the
longer-term. Rising spending in these areas is fully justified, not just in
terms of immediate needs, but as a contribution to the country's human
capital.
The education programme is therefore planned to rise to a level Pounds 1 1/2
bn higher in 1995-96 than the equivalent spending this year. There will be
some important changes over this period.
The proportion of children staying on at school beyond 16 is expected to go
on rising. The government is providing for a higher proportion of school
leavers to take up YT places.
And we shall finance a sharp increase in the number of students attending
further education or sixth form colleges - 25 per cent up over the Survey
period.
At the same time we have earmarked enough finance to maintain the present
record level of participation of young people in higher education. All this
is an important investment in our young people which will improve the
quality of the country's human capital and benefit the economy in the longer
term.
There will also be increases in the level of real resources provided to the
National Health Service in each of the next three years. Spending in the NHS
will rise by nearly 3 per cent in real terms next year compared with this
year's plans. That means an increase of over Pounds 1.9bn.
Capital
Madam Speaker, this is a very tight settlement overall. And at the beginning
of the spending round, there was widespread speculation that the Government
would take the easy way out, by letting current spending rise and cutting
capital spending instead. But what we have done is take the tough, but
necessary decisions to put the needs of the British economy first.
Restraint on current expenditure has made it feasible to provide more
protection to capital. And we have done so across a whole range of
programmes:
Next year there will be a significant increase in the volume of road
building. We have maintained the national roads programme at a time when
construction prices have fallen;
Our new plans will ensure that in real terms, compared with 1979, we will
have a doubling next year of the combined capital spending of British Rail
and London Transport;
Next year health capital spending in England alone will be at the record
level of nearly Pounds 2.1bn;
And the new plans should more than deliver our election commitment to
provide through the Housing Corporation 153,000 homes over three years.
One major project for which we have expressly reserved provision is the
Jubilee Line extension. Subject to satisfactory completion of negotiations,
the line will be able to go ahead. This will create many thousands of jobs
and give an important boost to the construction industry.
Private finance
Madam Speaker, the government has taken seriously its pledge to do what it
can for capital projects. But there is yet more that can be done.
I said in my Mansion House speech that I was examining ways to increase the
scope for private financing of capital projects.
Obviously, we have to protect the taxpayer. But I also want to ensure that
sensible investment decisions are taken whenever the opportunity arises. I
am now able to announce three significant developments.
In the past, the government has only been prepared to give the go-ahead to
private projects after comparing them with a similar project in the public
sector. This has applied whether or not there was any prospect of the
project ever being carried out in the public sector. I have decided to scrap
this rule. In future, any privately financed project which can be operated
profitably will be allowed to proceed.
This should be widely welcomed, particularly by the construction industry.
Secondly, the government has too often in the past treated proposed projects
as either wholly private or wholly public.
In future, the government will actively encourage joint ventures with the
private sector, where these involve a sensible transfer of risk to the
private sector. We may be prepared to consider such an approach, when the
time arises, for projects such as the East West Crossrail, the Central
Scotland Fastlink, the Birmingham western orbital road and perhaps also the
Channel tunnel rail link.
Thirdly, we will allow greater use of leasing where it offers good value for
money. As long as it can be shown that the risk stays with the private
sector, public organisations will be able to enter into operating lease
agreements, with only the leasing payments counting as expenditure and
without their capital budgets being cut.
In addition, British Rail will be allowed to lease some Pounds 150m of new
rolling stock in the next three years.
The new leases will be undertaken with a view to developing the leasing
market for rolling stock which will facilitate privatisation.
In addition, my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport will
publish a Green Paper early next year on the scope for motorway charging.
If, in the light of consultation, the government decided to proceed with
charges for inter-urban roads, this would create significant new
opportunities for private finance. And as a possible transitional step,
private contractors might be invited to design, build and operate roads for
which they would receive payments from government relating to the use of
their roads.
Money contributed by the private sector under these arrangements will not
contribute towards public spending - it will represent additional resources
in the area concerned.
And these changes are only a beginning. I have asked my Hon Friend the
Financial Secretary to carry forward and develop our policy in this area,
encouraging the private sector to bring forward proposals, and to help us
identify any obstacles which frustrate its success.
Supplementary Package
Madam Speaker, many of the measures I have announced so far today will take
time to have their full effect. I therefore propose to introduce a
supplementary package of time-limited fiscal measures. These will be aimed
at sectors of the economy which have been hardest hit by the recession,
helping to rebuild confidence and so foster recovery.
Housing
Housing and construction have faced particular difficulties in the last two
years. But home-buyers now have some of the lowest mortgage rates since
1978. And the government has responded in a number of other ways, most
recently with measures to help those with negative equity who wish to move.
Today, I propose to go further.
The overhang of empty properties in the owner-occupied sector is holding
back activity in the housing market. I therefore propose to make available
an extra Pounds 750m to be used before the end of this financial year to buy
up some of these properties. I hope that the Housing Corporation will be
able to achieve a substantial contribution on top of this from private
sector lenders. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will introduce parallel
measures.
This measure should reduce the overhang of empty properties by over 20,000
over the next few months, so providing a helpful stimulus to activity. It
will also increase the available stock of subsidised housing by a similar
amount and make a real contribution towards housing families in need.
Local Authority Capital Receipts
Many Hon Members will be aware of the representations by many local
authorities to persuade the government to relax the rules on local authority
capital receipts. Many local authorities have accumulated a stock of these
receipts, rather than use them to pay off debt as the government advised.
That remains the government's view, and I do not intend to reward those who
have ignored it.
I propose instead to allow a time-limited relaxation of the rules governing
local authorities' use of their future capital receipts. The existing rules
allow them to spend only 25 per cent of housing receipts and 50 per cent of
other receipts. With certain exceptions, local authorities will now be
entitled to spend all the capital receipts they realise between tomorrow and
the end of December 1993.
This measure is expected to stimulate extra capital spending by local
authorities, of over Pounds 1 3/4 bn in the next three and a half years. The
government hopes that local authorities will make early and effective use of
the additional spending power before the end of this financial year across
the range of local authority capital programmes, including housing,
education, schools and roads.
Any receipts not spent this year or next will provide an on-going stimulus
to house-building and construction in 1994-95 and 1995-96 as well.
The availability of these extra receipts will be taken into account in
distributing credit approvals between local authorities. In this way,
virtually all local authorities should receive some benefit. There will be
separate measures for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Exports
Madam Speaker, the reduction in the exchange rate has offered immense
opportunities to exporters. But our exporters of project equipment and other
supplies requiring medium or long term finance rely heavily on the
guarantees provided by the Export Credits Guarantees Department.
And I now intend to make available a further Pounds 700m of ECGD cover and
to ease some of the constraints on cover for individual countries. This will
enable these exporters to compete more effectively in the increasingly
difficult situation they now face.
I have also considered the position on capital allowances.
It remains my view that the reform of business tax by Lord Lawson in his
1984 Budget was the right one. Low tax rates and a broad tax base provide
the best framework for the medium-term.
However, in present circumstances, I am prepared to allow some changes which
should help to bring forward private sector investment.
Accordingly, for a limited period of twelve months, I propose to raise from
25 to 40 per cent the allowances available in the first year for investment
in plant and machinery, excluding cars. I also propose to introduce an
initial allowance of 20 per cent for expenditure on new industrial and
agricultural buildings for which contracts are placed before 31 October 1993
and which are brought into use before the end of 1994. I propose to
legislate for these changes, with retrospective effect to 1 November, in the
next Finance Bill.
Car tax
I have one final measure to announce. The motor industry lies at the heart
of British manufacturing. In recent years, it has seen a renaissance, with
large increases in inward investment. However, the recession has brought a
more difficult climate. I have considered what might best be done to help.
Any action in this area will, of course, have to be paid for in my next
Budget by higher motoring taxes after 1992-93.
I have decided nevertheless to continue with the tax reform begun in my last
Budget and to abolish car tax altogether from midnight tonight. This will
mean a saving of about Pounds 400 on a typical family car. This measure will
require a simple Bill, which I shall bring forward shortly. It will provide
a direct boost to the motor industry and will, of course, benefit business
more widely. I am sure it will be warmly welcomed.
Madam Speaker, the measures I have announced today should provide an
immediate boost to confidence and welcome relief for some of the most
hard-pressed sectors of the economy. Taken together they will add some
Pounds 4bn to borrowing over the next three years, but with no increase in
the PSBR over the medium-term.
And these measures come on top of the Government's new spending plans for
the next three years and the proposals I have announced to liberalise the
rules on private finance.
Finally, Madam Speaker, there is the significant relaxation in monetary
policy since Britain left the ERM just two months ago. Britain already has
the lowest interest rates in the European Community; and the pound is
trading at a level that gives British industry a sharp competitive edge in
foreign markets.
That relaxation of policy has been possible because of the dramatic progress
we have made in getting inflation down; and it is precisely because our
inflationary prospects remain excellent that today, Madam Speaker, I can go
further.
Alongside the tight public expenditure plans I have announced I believe it
is appropriate now to make a further reduction in interest rates. The
Governor and I have agreed that the Bank will tomorrow set the Minimum
Lending Rate at 7 per cent. That reduction is, in my judgment, fully
consistent with the government's inflationary objectives.
Today's reduction takes British interest rates down to their lowest level
for nearly 15 years; it means that our interest rates have been cut by fully
8 per cent over the last two years; it takes a further Pounds 1bn off
industry's costs on top of the Pounds 9bn fall in interest payments we have
already seen; and it will provide further help to all those with mortgages.
Madam Speaker, British business now has the opportunity it has been looking
for - to bring the country out of recession; to increase sales, expand
production and invest for the future.
And industry can now seize the new opportunities, safe in the knowledge that
the Government will play its full part.
We have a new monetary framework that will deliver low inflation over the
medium-term.
We have a new system for controlling public expenditure that will deliver
annual spending increases which the country can afford.
We have new spending plans, which protect the poorest in society and offer
hope, help and opportunity by switching resources to programmes that support
the long-term prosperity of the country.
We have the lowest interest rates in the European Community.
And we have a carefully targeted set of measures designed to lift confidence
and get the country back to work.
This, Madam Speaker, is a clear and comprehensive strategy.
It is a strategy for growth. I commend it to the House.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Tecs positive in spite of
cut for programmes in real terms - Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) described the Employment
Department's package of training and job-seeking measures for the unemployed
and young people as positive given the current constraints on spending.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, has fought hard to defend
her total budget which at Pounds 4.1bn will show a real increase of 1 per
cent on expenditure in 1992-93. Part of this will be for planned
redundancies in the department. Expenditure on training programmes including
Youth Training and Employment Training - which is to be merged with
Employment Action, the work experience scheme - will suffer a cut in real
terms of 3 per cent.
The majority of the increases will be spent on non-training initiatives,
such as Job Clubs, which the government claims are cost-effective ways to
get people back to work. Critics say they do not increase individuals'
skills.
Schemes will be extended and will include Jobplan workshops for all people
who have been unemployed for more than a year and not taken up offers of
help.
The package will disappoint Tecs, which administer government-
funded training schemes. They wanted a more radical overhaul of training
programmes, including 'entitlement credits' to allow the unemployed to
choose different options.
The package will mollify them to the extent that some of their requests have
been met, including guarantees of funding for most programmes for three
years.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Spending rises but NHS
faces tough times - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Health service, after three years of relatively generous
financial settlements in the run-up to last year's health reforms, faces a
tougher time next year.
Spending in England will rise from a forecast outturn of Pounds 28bn in
1992-93 to Pounds 29bn in 1993-94. Under last year's plans for 1993-94,
spending would have increased to Pounds 29.7bn.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said this meant that in an
exceptionally difficult year, the service would receive a real terms
increase of 1 per cent over forecast outturn - rising to 1.8 per cent after
taking account of the public sector pay restraint proposals.
The health secretary said the settlement would enable the NHS to increase
the number of patients treated by more than 2.5 per cent. But the
achievement of this target, and the other expectations of the health
settlement, will depend on the NHS continuing to make about Pounds
390m-worth of savings from improved efficiency.
Leaders of nurses and other health workers were sharply critical of the
proposed pay curbs at a meeting with Mrs Bottomley yesterday, and the effect
on morale, which may make efficiency savings difficult to secure.
The impact of health settlements, good or bad, are not felt in an immediate
or uniform way. Yesterday's global figure has yet to be divided and
allocated to the health service at local level, before the start of the
financial year.
It will be for health authorities and hospital managements to decide how
they are going to handle the tighter financial circumstances in which they
will find themselves.
But one of the consequences of the contract-based system of financing
hospital care, introduced under last year's health reforms, is that the
impact of funding pressures is more visible than in the past. If the
financial settlement proved insufficient - which it almost certainly would
if the pay restraint measures were not adhered to - it would soon show.
While pay is by far the biggest single item of NHS expenditure, it is not
the only source of inflationary pressure. Health service inflation tends to
run ahead of price rises in the general economy for several reasons - the
costs of medical advances, research and the increasing number of elderly
people.
The settlement was received with guarded optimism by the National
Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, the NHS Trust Federation, and
the Healthcare Financial Management Association. The British Medical
Association warned that, even with pay restraint, the settlement might not
be sufficient to maintain clinical services, while the Labour Party said the
package disguised 'real and damaging cuts'.
In an bid to contain rising drug costs - the NHS drugs bill is expected to
grow by 11 1/2 per cent in cash terms this year - the government plans to
renegotiate the voluntary pharmaceutical price regulation scheme and extend
the use of acceptable lower-cost drugs. The Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry said the proposals would affect research, exports
and employment.
Next year will also see the beginning of a new source of expenditure for the
NHS - the implementation of the Tomlinson report's proposals for the
reorganisation of London's healthcare.
Ministers are expected to agree in January to a restructuring programme
involving hospital closures and the improvement of family doctor and
community services in the capital. Mrs Bottomley said that some of
yesterday's package would be earmarked to finance these developments.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Council tax bills still
hang in balance - Local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIZE of individual council tax bills next year still hangs in the
balance after yesterday's announcement. However, the statement did show,
that the government prefers to exercise its extensive powers to limit local
authority spending rather than to use taxpayers' money in smoothing the
introduction of the property-based council tax.
The assertion from Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, that the
statement means there is no reason why local authorities in England should
have to raise more next year from the council tax than they are raising this
year from the poll tax, depends on assumptions not shared by local councils.
Among those assumptions are the opportunities for further efficiency
savings, and authorities' ability to keep to a maximum increase of 1.5 per
cent on their pay bills. Above all, they do not take account of the
difference between government plans at the start of the year and the
increase which occurs when the local budgets are drawn up and the money is
actually spent.
Local authority associations were swift to warn yesterday that the
government's plans could mean drastic cuts in services and jobs. Mr Jeremy
Beecham, the leader of the Labour-controlled Assocaiton of Metropolitan
Authorities, said: 'The target falls far short of what is needed to provide
crucial services.'
In particular, the associations pointed out that councils are already
committed to Pounds 350m more spending on pay next year as a result of pay
deals agreed with groups such as the police and the fire service. The cost
of 1.5 per cent for the next round of pay deals represents a further Pounds
300m or so.
Year-on-year comparisons in local government finance are never easy, but
this year the task is made harder by the shift in functions and by the
change from the poll tax to the council tax.
The new figure for total standard spending - the government's plans for
local authority budgets - is Pounds 41.142bn. This is, the department of the
environment says, an increase of 3.1 per cent on the plans for this year,
taking account of local government's loss of most responsibilities for
further education, and its gain of responsibility for community care.
Those changes carry in themselves the prospect of further disagreements
between central and local government. The new grant of Pounds 539m for
community care is considered insufficient by the authorities. They also
argue that in deducting about Pounds 2.4bn from the spending total for the
loss of further education the government has overstated the amount that
councils were spending, and has, as a result, left them in an even more
difficult position.
The increase in total local spending is noticeably lower, compared with the
amount that councils are actually spending this year. This is set to
overshoot the government's target by just over Pounds 1bn, taking spending
for this year to Pounds 42.9bn.
Overall, English councils will receive an extra Pounds 1.2bn in money from
central government and the business rate, as aggregate external finance
rises to Pounds 33.519bn.
The three local authority associations, including those dominated by Tories
as well as those led by Labour, said that the target represented an increase
of less than 0.5 per cent over the current year's budget.
In any event, the final spending outcome for next year will be higher than
the government's intention. This is because even the stricter regime of
capping local spending which will be announced later this month leaves some
leeway for spending slightly over the government's plans, and also because
councils will have to take account of poll tax arrears, which remain outside
the process of limiting local spending.
The range of council tax bills across the country will not be apparent until
later this month when Mr Howard announces the grant distribution and the
provisional criteria for capping local spending.
However, one element in the amounts people will have to pay in council tax
will be the scale of the transitional relief scheme, which is included in
the total Pounds 33.519bn of central government support and the business
rate. Latest estimates put the cost of this for next year at about Pounds
500m maximum, with those in lower property bands qualifying more readily for
help.
The increase in the business rate by the inflation rate - 3.5 per cent  - is
a blow for business organisations which have been agitating for a freeze.
It was inevitable that the government would put the rate up by the maximum
possible because a fall in the number of businesses paying has already led
to a shortfall in the national non-domestic rate pool from which the
government distributes the business rate to local councils.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Eligibility rules to be
tightened - Legal aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's plans to curb legal aid expenditure would result in 'a
massive cut in the number of people eligible for legal aid', The Law Society
warned yesterday.
The government plans the net cost of legal aid to rise to Pounds 1.284bn in
1993-94, Pounds 1.406bn in 1994-95 and 1.528bn in 1995-96 - representing
increases of Pounds 399m, Pounds 502m and Pounds 606m respectively over last
year's public expenditure targets.
This will result in an increase, on average, of 10 per cent a year from
present levels. But to ensure that legal aid spending 'did not rise even
faster', the Lord Chancellor said it was necessary to take a number of
measures from April next to tighten eligibility rules.
Lord Mackay's proposals include:
a reduction in the level of disposable income at which an applicant is
entitled to free legal aid to income support levels - a reduction from
Pounds 3,060 per annum to Pounds 2,213 per annum.
dependants' allowances for civil legal aid will be reduced to income support
levels;
equivalent changes will be made to financial eligibility regimes for
criminal legal aid and for advice and assistance under the Green Form
scheme;
the upper eligibility limits for civil legal aid (the level of disposable
income at which people cease to be eligible) will not be increased next
year;
contributions for those above the free legal aid limits will increase from
one-quarter of disposable income to one-third, and will continue for the
life of the case.
The Law Society, the solicitors' governing body, said it was 'devastated' by
the proposals. 'It will result in a massive reduction in access to justice
taking more than 7m people out of eligibility for legal aid,' a spokesman
said.
Mr Paul Boateng, shadow legal affairs spokesman, accused the Lord Chancellor
of caving in under Treasury pressure and of 'betraying his office as
protector of the rights of all people regardless of means to equality under
the law and access to the courts'.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Manufacturers to bear brunt
 -Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE spending will fall by 10 1/2 per cent in real terms over the next
three years, more than twice as much as set out in the summer's defence
White Paper.
The cuts are as deep as many in the defence industry had feared, and are
likely to lead to the postponement or cancellation of contracts.
The alternative of lower current spending has been all but ruled out,
because staff cuts are still being implemented as a result of the 1990
Options for Change defence review.
The changes outlined by the Ministry of Defence will cut about Pounds 1bn a
year from the level of spending proposed in the defence white paper in July.
The MoD said technical changes in the treatment of pensions reduced the cuts
to about Pounds 500m.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence minister, gave few clues as to where the
cuts would fall. 'The best means of making these savings will be identified
during the normal recosting of the defence programme which is already under
way,' he said, adding that some savings would be achieved through pay
restraint.
Nevertheless, the figures show that the brunt of the cuts will fall on
manufacturers of military equipment which take the biggest slice of the
defence budget at 37 per cent.
The forward procurement programme is now worth 'over Pounds 8bn a year',
said the MoD. This compares with the previous figure of Pounds 9bn.
Several companies are vulnerable. British Aerospace is involved in the
Pounds 700m mid-life upgrade for Tornado GR1 aircraft, while its Royal
Ordnance offshoot had been hoping to build a new gun for an upgrade to
Challenger 1 tanks, which the MoD said performed only 'adequately' in the
Gulf war.
BAe may also have to live without a contract for a medium-range
surface-to-air missile to replace the retired Bloodhound. A decision on the
Pounds 500m contract has been postponed several times and is now not
expected until June 1993.
GEC-Marconi could be affected. It is also bidding for the Bloodhound
replacement contract and would be a leading contractor on the Tornado GR1
update.
Another defence company, Vickers, is the lead contractor on the Challenger
upgrade.
The Trigat anti-tank missiles project worth Pounds 425m could also be
abandoned. The production phase has already been cut from spending plans.
The cuts take Britain a notch lower in the world rankings of defence
spenders. Britain's defence outlay as a proportion of GDP will fall from 4
per cent to 3 1/4 per cent over three years, moving it below the level spent
by France.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Older students the top
priority - Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANT-maintained schools and further education for 16-19 year-olds are top
of the government's agenda for extra education spending in the figures
announced yesterday.
Teachers and local-authority schools fare much worse, however, and expansion
of the university sector is likely to slow.
The chancellor said that increased spending on education was a vital
national investment 'to improve the quality of the country's human capital'.
Central government's education spending will rise by 5.8 per cent - Pounds
523m - next year, one of the most generous departmental settlements.
However, total national education spending will rise by far less, because
most of it - about Pounds 19bn of Pounds 27bn in the current year - is met
by local government, which gained only a 3.7 per cent increase in its
government grant.
The precise implications for local education authorities (LEAs) will not be
clear until ministers reveal the breakdown of the local government grant
later this month. But given the full-year effect of last year's teachers'
pay award, and next year's award, there will be little room for LEAs to
increase recurrent spending.
LEA leaders were last night predicting redundancies and other cuts in school
grants. Some may, however, be able to increase their capital spending on
schools as a result of the government's decision to relax the rules
preventing councils from spending capital receipts.
Teachers fare poorly from the award, with their pay rise for next year
capped at the 1.5 per cent ceiling for public sector pay. Loud cries of woe
issued from the teachers' unions last night. Yet a serious backlash is
unlikely. Teachers' pay has been increased significantly above the rate of
inflation for the past three years.
The government may still hit trouble, though, with the performance-related
pay scheme it has instructed the teachers' review body to produce in the New
Year. Mr John Patten, education secretary, wants to see a much larger
proportion of the total pay bill awarded for performance. Past practice
suggests that such schemes cause bitterness if introduced with a tight
overall award.
Mr Patten stressed last night that further education was the government's
top priority. The increases 'should lift us towards the top of the
international league table in staying-on rates for 16-19 year-olds within
the next three years,' he said.
The government's target is to increase the number of students in further
education and sixth form colleges by 25 per cent within three years, taking
numbers from 899,000 this year to 1.1m in 1995-96.
However, the emphasis on expanding further education will be at the expense
of universities. Yesterday's statement talks of a 'consolidation' of higher
education student numbers. The next leap towards the government's target of
one in three 18-year-olds proceeding to university by 2000 is now to come
'at the end of the decade', with full-time student numbers for higher
education projected to rise by 13 per cent - from 776,000 to 880,000 -
between 1992 and 1996.
To encourage efficiency the government will instruct the new Further
Education Funding Council to relate part of its provision to actual student
numbers. 'This funding approach will encourage institutions to compete for
students and will enable the sector as whole to improve its efficiency,' the
education department said.
The Autumn Statement provides for the number of grant-maintained (GM)
schools to rise from 342 to 1,500 by April 1994. Encouraging schools to opt
out of LEA control to GM status is the most sensistive aspect of government
education policy. The decision to increase central government spending on
the GM sector from Pounds 61m this year to Pounds 446m in 1995-96 will be
controversial.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Slight decline in
expenditure - Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S share of government expenditure will decline slightly as a result
of updating the formula under which most of the Scottish Office budget is
determined. The change is due to the decline in the Scottish population
compared with that of England.
However, the effect will be marginal in the next financial year and should
be offset by measures worth Pounds 208m, announced by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, to boost construction and help business.
The Scottish Office's 1993/94 budget will be Pounds 13.5bn, a rise of 2 per
cent in real terms, taking into account new responsibilities for
universities and community care.
Since 1979 the Scottish Office, which funds such matters as health,
education, law and order and local government in Scotland, has received 11.7
per cent of any increase in England's share of government spending on
similar items. This will fall to 10.6 per cent. The change may satisfy
English MPs who claim that Scotland receives too large a share of spending,
but does not affect the basic expenditure to which annual increases are
added.
Wales and Northern Ireland have benefited slightly from the updating of
regional spending rules. On the 1991 census, they will receive 6.02 per cent
and 2.87 per cent respectively of any changes to comparable programmes in
England.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Farm funds go to Europe and
the greens - Agriculture and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cost of reforming the EC Common Agricultural Policy, added to
agricultural spending on the environment, will boost planned expenditure by
the agriculture ministry by Pounds 670m to Pounds 2.38bn in 1993-94, and by
a further Pounds 790m to Pounds 2.52bn the following year.
The CAP increases dwarf the reductions in government expenditure on domestic
agriculture, which will fall Pounds 20m to Pounds 1.09m and Pounds 50m to
Pounds 1.1bn in the corresponding years. Total planned expenditure is
projected at Pounds 3.49bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 3.64bn in 1994-95.
Overall, environmental programmes have been spared the cuts - almost all
have extracted more government cash for the next three years. Spending on
the main schemes by the environment ministry is expected to rise from Pounds
617m this year to Pounds 649m in 1993-94, Pounds 682m in 1994-95 and Pounds
695m in 1995-96.
Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, said yesterday that the costs of last
May's CAP reform represented a switch in the cost of farm subsidies from
consumers to the EC budget. Farmers would themselves be receiving less money
under the reforms. If the CAP had continued unchanged the Pounds 790m extra
cost expected in 1994-95 would have been Pounds 1.5bn, he suggested.
The EC's switch to direct payments to farmers per hectare or per head meant
that the UK would recieve a higher proportion of total CAP expenditure than
in the past.
The agriculture ministry will also give Environmentally Sensitive Areas,
pilot schemes to protect sensitive landscapes, Pounds 43m in 1995-96
compared to Pounds 11m this year. A further six Environmentally Sensitive
Areas will go ahead six months later than planned.
An extra Pounds 30m is being made available in the UK in the next three
years to help reduce levels of nitrates in drinking water and on other
agricultural schemes.
Environmental groups welcomed the protection given to environmental
protection bodies such as the Countryside Commission and the National Rivers
Authority, but criticised the relaxation of rules on private funding of road
building, fearing a further stimulus to traffic levels.

for satisfaction - Export financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH exporters seeking positive government support in the Autumn
Statement were left unsated yesterday - pleased to have extra cover
available, but still complaining that the cost of export credit insurance
remains significantly higher for UK exporters than for most international
competitors.
The additional Pounds 700m of export credit guarantee cover is to be spread
over the present financial year and 1993-94. Just Pounds 200m is to be added
to cover this year, with Pounds 500m next year - amounting to about a
quarter of the total exports guaranteed by the Export Credit Guarantees
Department.
The extra guarantees are to be focused on 11 markets - all of them countries
in which exporters are heavily involved. These markets are China, Hong Kong,
South Africa, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Turkey and
Zimbabwe.
The first five of these are defined by the ECGD as 'concentrated markets' -
meaning that they account for such a large proportion of the ECGD's overall
foreign exposure that new cover is unavailable.
Exporters have frequently argued that this restraint prevents them from
winning orders in some of their biggest markets.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Marginal impact on new
investment - Capital allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY RAISING capital allowances on new investment in plant machinery and
buildings, the chancellor has made new investment marginally more
attractive. But the Treasury's growth forecasts suggest this incentive will
have no more than a marginal effect on investment.
The statement introduces a 40 per cent first-year allowance for expenditure
on machinery and plant incurred by businesses in the 12 months ending
October 31 next year, rather than 25 per cent as at present, and a 20 per
cent allowance on new buildings.
Companies will use the allowances to write off more of the cost of
investment against their corporate tax liability in the year in which the
investment is made. The balance of expenditure will continue to be written
down in subsequent years at 25 per cent a year. The measure will cost Pounds
200m in 1993-94 and Pounds 500m in 1994-95.
But while the Treasury expects total fixed investment to grow by  1/4 per
cent next year, business investment is expected to remain stagnant. The rise
in total investment is accounted for by a projected 1 per cent rise in
private dwellings investment and a 1 3/4 per cent increase in public
investment, neither of which is affected.
The corporate tax change effectively reverses, for a limited period, a
central element of the 1984 change in corporation taxes, piloted through by
the then chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson. The increase in allowances, in effect,
rebalances the taxes that companies pay on new investments by giving greater
relief in the year in which the investment is carried out.
The problem with raising allowances, according to the Institute of Fiscal
Studies, is that it is an expensive way of generating what tends to be a
small amount of activity. Investment which would have occurred anyway
qualifies for the extra relief as well as any new investment the relief
generates. If investment is discouraged by depressed consumer demand,
marginal tax changes tend to make little difference to investment volume.
The Labour party proposed an almost identical change in allowances for new
investment in its election manifesto. The Labour party estimated its
increase in allowances would cost Pounds 600m in the first year, assuming a
larger investment response.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Jury is out on whether the
slump will end - Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a welcome among housing professionals and mortgage lenders for the
measures in the chancellor's Autumn Statement to bolster the housing market.
But opinion appeared divided over the likelihood that the package could end
the worst housing slump in a generation.
Last month saw house prices fall 2.7 per cent, according to the Nationwide
building society - following a 1.4 per cent fall in September. This means
that house prices were on average 6.6 per cent lower than in October last
year, with a fall of 27 per cent in real terms since July 1989 and 12 per
cent in nominal terms.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said
that the 1 percentage point cut in interest rates would help reduce arrears
and ease repossessions.
'It will also raise demand,' he said. 'Lower interest rates have so far
escaped the public's attention - I expect to see some very attractive offers
from developers and lenders in the next few weeks.
'Buying is now cheaper than renting - and we will see some renters who have
been holding off from entering the housing market making the jump.'
The National Association of Estate Agents described the package as 'a recipe
for recovery'. However, Mr John Wriglesworth, the housing analyst with UBS
Philips and Drew, the stockbroker, was sceptical of the impact that a
further cut in interest rates would have on the housing market.
'Building societies have been offering 8.5 per cent interest rates for a
couple of months now,' he said, 'and house prices have fallen 4 per cent. An
extra 1 percentage point off the rate is unlikely to create a rush towards
the estate agents.'
Mr Wriglesworth cited as the main causes of the continuing fall in house
prices fear of unemployment and fear of the debt trap created by negative
equity. The Bank of England recently estimated that more than 1m homeowners
owed more on their mortgage than the value of their homewere.
He also questioned whether the scheme to spend Pounds 700m on removing
20,000 empty homes from the market would make much impact.
'The numbers sound big, but there are 200,000 empty homes on the market,
70,000 of them repossessed. In any case, many of the repossessed ones are
unsuitable for housing the homeless - either because they are flats for
single people or in the wrong place.
'The market is in total dereliction. The government is sitting in a car with
a flat battery fiddling with the keys. It would be better to get out and
give it a push.'
There was a welcome from housing professionals for the release of local
authority receipts on future sales of council houses for capital spending.
'It is a change of heart on the part of the government which we have been
calling for since the first sales of council houses under the right-to-buy
scheme,' said Shelter, the housing campaign.
'We are disappointed, however, that by only allowing receipts from future
sales to be released, the government has pointedly rejected the opportunity
to free up over Pounds 5bn currently sitting in local authority bank
accounts.'
The Institute of Housing estimated that freeing up future receipts could
produce an additional Pounds 1bn for housing over the next three years.
However, the government plans to reduce the amount it allocates for local
authority capital spending by an estimated Pounds 400m, which will reduce
the net benefit to Pounds 600m.
'In effect housing spending is being brought forward to counter the effects
of the recession,' said the institute's director Mr Peter McGurk.
Funds are also being brought forward to pay for the scheme to buy up the
20,000 empty properties. This is not new money, but is part of the funds
allocated in the next two years to the Housing Corporation, the quango which
finances housing association homes.
This appears to break the government's manifesto commitment to spend Pounds
6bn over the next three years on building extra houses. The level of subsidy
to housing associations for building homes for rent will be cut from 75 per
cent of costs to 67 per cent.
But the chancellor appeared confident that cheaper land prices, lower
tenders from hard-pressed building contractors and reduced interest rates
will allow housing associations to build the 153,000 homes promised.
'It's good news for 20,000 families in desperate housing need,' said Mr Jim
Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations. 'The
cash for 1993-94 has been cut in line with falling costs, but it will still
allow housing associations to start the 50,000 homes previously announced.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Relief for roads lobby as
spending holds up - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROADS programme has been saved: so, theoretically, has the Jubilee line
to London's Docklands. But public transport users in central London will pay
a price for these triumphs in the Department of Transport's settlement.
Road spending will not actually rise. But to the relief of the roads lobby
and the construction industry - and contrary to speculation - the road
spending programme has emerged unscathed at more than Pounds 2bn a year for
the next three years.
Even that level of spending, however, will not be enough to carry out the
transport department's programme of road building to the end of the century.
The government therefore intends to produce a green paper early in the new
year setting out proposals for involving the private sector.
Probably the most interesting - and certainly the most controversial - of
these proposals will be the introduction of electronic tolling for trunk
roads and motorways. This would eradicate one of the biggest obstacles to
private sector toll roads: their inability to compete with public sector
roads which are free at the point of use.
Other proposals will explore ways in which the government and private sector
might work together on projects. One early candidate could be the Birmingham
western orbital motorway, a planned private sector toll road at present
stymied because the private sector regards it as unviable.
Rail projects, too, could benefit from the new approach. Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, was yesterday citing the London CrossRail scheme and
the planned Channel Tunnel Rail Link as two projects where public and
private sectors could get together, though there are at present no
indications of how this might be achieved.
The relaxation of spending controls on local authority capital receipts
could boost local spending on transport - perhaps on one or two of the many
light rail schemes presently awaiting funding. Ministers also hope the
relaxation will encourage councils to sell off the remaining
municipally-owned bus companies and airports.
But there was little good news elsewhere on the public transport front.
British Rail welcomed a move to allow it to embark on experimental leasing
deals involving rolling stock worth Pounds 150m over the next three years;
but the tiny increase in its overall budget - from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds
1.49bn next year - is no more than enough to allow it fulfil existing
contractual obligations.
Much worse hit is London Transport. Having only last year won a big increase
in its budget following a monopolies commission report urging more funds to
pay for desperately needed investment in the underground, the increase has
been almost wholly taken away again. With next year's budget slumping from
Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 1.01m, many projects will have to be postponed -
among them the long-overdue modernisation of the decrepit Northern line,
dubbed the misery line.
On a brighter note, part of London Transport's budget is intended to pay for
the extension of the Jubilee line to Docklands. But as the government
confirmed yesterday, it has still not been able to reach a deal with the
administrators of Canary Wharf over their planned contribution of Pounds
400m towards the project's cost, so there is no guarantee that it will go
ahead. And if it folds, the money provided for it will revert to the
Treasury - not to London Transport.
The outlook for CrossRail is also clouded by uncertainty. This east-west
London subterranean line linking Paddington and Liverpool stations was
supposed to start construction in 1995 and open in 2000. But with the
government now talking about getting the private sector involved in the
funding of it, fresh doubts about the government's commitment have arisen.
Significantly, Mr MacGregor said yesterday: 'It isn't possible to be
specific about timing at present.'

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Approval for finance deals
that shift risk to private sector - Leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE the public sector can take advantage of the new freedom to use leases
where they offer the best value for money, much more detail on how the
scheme will work will be needed.
Current government rules usually require the capital value of leased assets
to be set against public sector bodies' spending allocations. This has
strongly discouraged their use. In future, the way leases are treated will
be based on where the risks associated with the lease - typically, the
question of the residual value of the asset - falls.
Under so-called operating leases, common in the private sector, the
ownership of an asset remains with the lessor, usually a bank or finance
company. The value of the asset - and hence the risk that its residual value
will prove less than expected - is borne either by the financier or the
supplier of the equipment.
In future, as public sector bodies carry out operating leases with the
private sector, they will only have to show the annual payment on a lease in
their accounts. Just as significant as this accounting change is the shift
in the climate, to one in which leases are regarded as an acceptable form of
public-sector finance, rather than an attempt to evade spending controls.
The Treasury said yesterday that the private sector should assume the risk
in such arrangements and stressed that 'there must be no creative
accounting'. In fact, the new rules bring the treatment of leases more in
line with the accounting rules used by the private sector.
In an accompanying announcement, the government has allowed British Rail to
take advantage of the new approach to lease Pounds 150m of rolling stock
over the next three years. It also cited areas such as contract energy
management.
Mr Eddie Oliver, managing partner of the infrastructure and government
practice at KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'Whether there is an avalanche or no
change as a result will all depend on the details that follow up these
statements.' We need a lot more information to know how radical they are.'
But Mr Chris Elliott, head of the project advisory unit at BZW, the
investment banking arm of Barclays, said: 'This is overall good news.' He
cautioned that financial institutions had traditionally been reluctant to
take on risks in asset-related projects and there were many questions still
to be answered.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: A long-awaited welcome for
private sector support - Infrastructure projects financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREATER use of private finance for public sector infrastructure projects
looks, at first glance, to be a notable retreat from a long-held government
position. But in reality it is a logical development in public finance that
reflects the transformation in the composition of the public sector since
the Tories first came to power in 1979.
In his recently published memoirs, former chancellor Lord Lawson reveals
that Sir Leo Pliatzky, a distinguished former Treasury official who
specialised in public finance, was asked in the early 1980s to devise new
means of financing nationalised industries. His proposals for bringing
private sector funding to state enterprise were found lacking in radicalism
by Lawson and Pliatzky's unpublished report was shelved. But his approach is
now back in fashion because the privatisation programme has slowed down. The
state has been left with a recalcitrant rump of enterprises which defy early
privatisation and pose continuing financing problems.
There has, in addition, been some retreat from the traditional Treasury
hostility to such private financing. The so-called Ryrie rules, which
imposed stringent tests for the use of private money in public projects,
were abolished in 1989. Yet the consequent loosening in the criteria for
using private funds led to only a handful of cases in which private sector
money was invested in infrastructure projects.
The Autumn Statement's proposals, though somewhat tentative, are intended to
lower further the hurdles for private sector financiers. Where private firms
are responsible for government-approved projects and are able to recoup the
cost through charges at the point of use, the Whitehall mandarins will not
apply a value-for-money test against a theoretical public sector
alternative. This is important because public sector enterprise enjoys cheap
capital thanks to the government's implicit or explicit guarantee. This
saddled the private sector with a competitive handicap.
The government also appears to have shed some of its ideological antipathy
for joint ventures between the public and private sector provided there is a
'sensible' sharing of risks between the two sides. The intention is for the
government to specify its contribution in terms of money and risk, and then
invite participation through open competition. One ideological remnant,
however, is that the state will eschew controlling stakes. Leasing, hitherto
used in the public sector mainly by local authorities to dodge the financial
constraints imposed by central government, is also to be given wider scope.
The more relaxed approach to joint public-private sector financing will no
doubt be welcomed by the construction and transport sectors and by the
banks. There is a clear opportunity for creative financial engineering. But
how great an opportunity is a moot point. One of the reasons why the
disappearance of the Ryrie rules had so little impact was that few
infrastructure investments hold out much hope of an adequate commercial
return.
By definition, infrastructure projects like the Channel Tunnel or the
Jubilee Line extension are very long term, subject to planning delays and
cost over-runs. Private capital is notoriously shy of such high-risk, long
term investments. Plans for building toll roads, meantime, have to contend
with the fact that the bulk of the existing, competing road network is free.
The ability to bring in large amounts of private capital may be contingent
on the introduction of road pricing or the imaginative use of government
grants.
Perhaps the biggest question mark over the viability of the Autumn
Statement's proposals concerns the location of risk in the partnership. The
government insists that there must be no creative accounting and that the
private sector must genuinely assume risk if the sums borrowed or leased are
not to fall on the public sector borrowing requirement. The banks and
building societies may be able to meet such criteria in financing the
government's new plans for the housing market, since the Pounds 750m of
houses to be nationalised offer security (albeit with initial valuation
problems) and a potential rental stream when let. Elsewhere, there will be
complex problems in defining and evaluating risk.
The one thing additional private financing will not do for the government is
help generate an economic recovery. The impact, if it is more than modest,
is unlikely to be felt before the end of the decade.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Small satisfaction for the
trade sector - Export financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH exporters seeking positive government support in the Autumn
Statement were left unsated yesterday - pleased to have extra cover
available, but still complaining that the cost of export credit insurance
remains significantly higher for UK exporters than for most international
competitors.
The additional Pounds 700m of export credit guarantee cover is to be spread
over the present financial year and 1993-94. Just Pounds 200m is to be added
to cover this year, with Pounds 500m to be added next year - amounting to
about a quarter of the total exports guaranteed by the Export Credit
Guarantees Department (ECGD).
The extra guarantees are to be focused on 11 markets - all of them countries
in which British exporters are heavily involved. These markets are China,
Hong Kong, South Africa, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman,
Turkey and Zimbabwe.
The first five of these are defined by the ECGD as 'concentrated markets' -
meaning that they account for such a large proportion of the ECGD's overall
foreign exposure that new cover is unavailable.
Exporters have frequently argued that this restraint prevents them from
winning orders in some of their biggest markets. So the decision to provide
an extra Pounds 500m on an annualised basis - an increase of about 30 per
cent on cover presently available - will be welcome.
'It's encouraging to see that the government has taken some note of what
industry has been saying,' said Mr Philip Hills, head of export finance at
the Midland Bank: 'In some of these eleven markets there has been growing
concern that the ECGD was unable to cover British exporters' initiatives.'
For example, British Aerospace is negotiating with the Indonesian government
to sell Hawk jets worth several hundred million pounds. Until yesterday's
provision of extra cover, BAe would have been unlikely to have access to
export credit guarantees for the deal.
But the availability of extra cover does nothing to resolve the principal
complaint of British exporters - that the cost of export credit insurance
premiums is so much higher than costs for competitors that they suffer a
significant competitive disadvantage.
All the ECGD said yesterday is that premium rates were reviewed - and in
some cases trimmed - in April this year as part of the annual review
process, and they would not be reviewed again until next spring.
The government may feel that the competitive advantage won by exporters as a
result of the recent devaluation of sterling is sufficient to leave premium
rates untouched.
This analysis may be simplistic, however, since many of the components going
into British exports are imported, and so have become more expensive
following devaluation.
One trade financier said: 'Devaluation may have helped for exports inside
Europe, but has probably made little difference in overseas markets where
the cost of export credit insurance is going to bite. The evidence at
present is clear - we are still uncompetitive with some of our fiercest
competitors because of the cost of insurance.'
Since the ECGD introduced in May 1991 its 'portfolio management system'
(PMS) - designed to link export premium rates more closely to the existing
risks - Britain has become one of the most expensive insurers in the world.
The government has nevertheless been unflinching in its commitment to the
system, arguing that the new premiums provide an accurate assessment of the
risks of non-payment involved in selling goods to developing country
markets. It insists that taxpayers should not subsidise insurance premiums
when exporters face a very real chance of not being paid for their goods.
Some other industrial exporters have recently raised insurance premium
rates, but few by enough to reach British levels. Exporters still complain
of premiums three and four times higher than those for competitors in risky
markets in developing countries.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Breath of fresh air for
Britain's building industry - Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE construction industry will have breathed a collective sigh of relief
last night after the Chancellor delivered an Autumn Statement aimed at
reviving one of the sectors worst hit by the recession.
Contractors and building material companies said the outcome was better than
they expected even though most are still expecting 1993 to be another
difficult year.
Initial judgments were that UK construction output would still fall next
year but perhaps not by as much as the 2 per cent to 3 per cent decline
which had been forecast.
Much depends upon how quickly local authorities and industry can take
advantage of concessions allowing councils to spend up to 100 per cent of
capital receipts between now and the end of 1993, and provide 20 per cent
capital allowances on new industrial and agricultural buildings.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is expected to announce measures
today to ensure that local authorities release these receipts as quickly as
possible.
Much of this would be spent on housing repair and maintenance, one of the
most labour intensive of construction activities.
There was relief that public sector construction programmes for transport,
housing and other public infrastructure have been maintained, even though
some budgets for projects have been reduced to take advantage of lower
construction costs in the recession.
There will be particular pleasure at the signal that the Pounds 1.8bn
Jubilee Line extension will go ahead as soon as agreement can be reached
with bankers over financing.
Of all the large transport projects the Jubilee Line is most advanced.
Letters of intent awarding contracts are in place for much of the work,
which could start almost immediately the geen light is given.
The work will provide about 12,000 jobs. This compares with the 400,000 jobs
the construction industry is estimated to have lost since summer 1989.
There was some disappointment that more was not done to help the housing
market.
An interest rate cut of one percentage point would help but could have been
deeper, was the view of builders which have seen sales and prices slump even
further this autumn, following the recent turmoil in the currency markets.
A decision to give housing associations a windfall Pounds 750m to buy 20,000
of the estimated 200,000 empty properties on the market was welcomed, but
was not expected to find its way into the pocket of builders.
Most of the money was likely to be used to buy homes repossessed by building
societies and banks.
The consensus was that the construction recovery may start with the Autumn
Statement but that it would still be a hard and long haul back. More
measures to stimulate housing, in particular, could still be needed.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: One's best is not always
good enough - The overall economic impact of what has turned out to be a
full-scale Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A very old trick used by chancellors of all parties when replying to critics
of a Budget is to ask: 'Are my critics saying that I have stimulated the
economy too much or too little? Should I have borrowed more or less?' This
never fails to floor the opposition; and judging by the way Gordon Brown
began his reply with prepared, but stale and inaccurately phrased, Labour
party cliches, it will be quite effectively used on him.
The word 'Budget' is used advisedly. For although the switch from spring to
end-year Budgets was not due until next year, the British chancellor, Norman
Lamont, effectively presented his 1993 Budget yesterday. It is difficult to
see what more he can do next spring, unless there are still further shocks,
requiring still further U-turns. Yet there was no one document listing all
the measures and their expected spill-over effects of the kind to be found
in the Budget Red Book.
I worried much less that this omission would give the chancellor an unfairly
bad specialist press when he began his monetary section by repeating what he
last said at the IMF after sterling had been forced out of the ERM.
'Interest rates are now set according to British monetary conditions - to
meet the target I have established for inflation' - with a metaphorical
glance over his right shoulder and an emphasis on 'British', which no-one
who has only seen the written statement will appreciate. If that is his
view, the question arises what he was doing being chancellor for nearly two
years up to September operating an ERM policy he now seems so delighted to
have junked.
My own answer to the standard Budget question is that the chancellor has
been insufficiently bold on the fiscal side but could be taking too many
risks on the monetary and exchange rate side. It looks as if total spending,
or the national income in money terms, will still rise by less than a normal
rate; yet much too much of this will be inflation, and not enough real
growth.
One must accept that the Treasury has made an honest attempt to find ways of
stepping up public spending and quasi-public spending (by which I mean
private investment committed to public-sector projects) in a way which need
not add to public spending in the medium term. I do not mind the creative
accountancy involved, as it seems to be valued by the profoundly
non-market-oriented business and professional bodies to whom the Major
government gives so much attention. But I would scrap the lot for the
temporary tax holiday suggested by Peter Jay.
Most worrying are the special tax incentives for industrial investment -
which contradict the principles of the anti-tax privilege 1984 Budget that
Mr Lamont praised and which will be difficult to get rid of in later years.
They could have been devised by Robert Reich, Bill Clinton's economic czar
designate.
The fact that some analysts were simultaneously criticising the chancellor
for excessive public-sector borrowing, and for not doing enough to stimulate
the economy, strengthens the low-level case for creative accountancy. The
projected public sector deficits of 6 per cent of GDP in the present
financial year and 7 per cent next year would not be alarming for depression
years, if one had more confidence in medium-term monetary and exchange rate
strategy.
The doubts stand out from the Treasury's own documentation. After several
years of recession the official forecasters expect real GDP to rise by only
1 per cent in 1993. This means that the gap between output and productive
capacity will carry on rising - which is why I have started writing about
depression - and that unemployment will continue to rise. As unemployment is
now almost certainly well above the equilibrium rate one would normally
expect inflation to carry on falling further.
Yet the Treasury expects the underlying fall in inflation, measured by the
RPI, excluding mortgage interest, to stall. It is expected to be 3 3/4 per
cent in the fourth quarter of both this year and next. Producer price
increases - in some ways a better measure of the underlying trend - are
expected to accelerate from 2 1/2 to 4 per cent. Only the GDP deflator,
which suffers from statistical jinxes, especially in the market price
version on which the Treasury has unhappily hooked itself, shows a
continuing decline.
The most dubious part of the official reasoning is the chart, reproduced
here, showing cost and price competitiveness retaining all the devaluation
advantages, which makes British products more competitive than at any time
in the 1980s. Indeed, another chart shows competitiveness continuing to
rise.
This can probably be reconciled with the inflation forecasts by some
assumptions about improved profit margins. But unless the exchange rate is
taken more seriously than the present team is inclined to do, I can see
inflation climbing in the 1990s, while output and employment are still at
depressed levels.
Suspicions are further confirmed by the second in the series of much vaunted
explanations of base rate changes, which refers in some detail to domestic
monetary indicators, but has nothing to say about the exchange rate, which
in principle is supposed to have an equal weight as it had before sterling
joined the ERM.
As so often, one should be most grateful for the touted measures which the
Budget did not contain. There was no attempt to freeze social security
benefits. The temptation to make a disguised increase in income tax by
raising National Insurance contributions - which must have been considered,
as the chancellor had the figures at his finger tips - was resisted. I wish
he had also resisted the base rate cut, at least for now.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: Chancellor tries to start
recovery - Financial Times, Editorial Comment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICALLY, the chancellor of the exchequer did himself and his party some
good yesterday. But he did so in intriguing ways. The spending package was
resoundingly un-Thatcherite, for example, both in the appalling state of the
public finances revealed by the chancellor and in its detail. It was full of
gimmicks to help industry and the housing market, both causes close to the
heart of Tory backbenchers. To add to their relief, careful news management
had led many to expect more spending 'cuts' than were delivered.
The element in the package most likely to cause political trouble is the
ceiling of 1 1/2 per cent on the increase in public sector pay. Even
complaints over this should be containable when things are as grim for the
private sector as they are now, and are likely to remain.
The problems lie elsewhere, in the bleak state of the economy and the
certainty that managing the public finances will become hugely difficult,
unless the UK economy recovers far more vigorously than now seems likely.
Mr Lamont's macroeconomic policy judgments are defensible. In cutting
interest rates by a further 1 percentage point, he has focused the policy
loosening where, given the problem of the debt overhang and the long period
of monetary stringency, it was best to do so. As for fiscal policy, he has
continued to abide by the increases to spending plans made in more confident
days, while doing nothing yet to increase revenue. The result: a public
sector borrowing requirement, excluding privatisation receipts, forecast at
7 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product this year and probably at over 8
per cent in 1993-94. These numbers are horribly realistic.
What the chancellor offers is certainly not fiscal stringency. The plans
allowed for a real increase in total general government expenditure of just
under 4 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94 and even for a real increase of
2.3 per cent in the new control total, supposed to exclude the cyclical
element. The stringency is postponed to next year: the control total is
supposed to rise by about 1 per cent a year in real terms between 1993-94
and 1995-96. The stringency also follows profligacy: total expenditure is
expected to rise by 12 per cent in real terms between 1990-91 and 1993-94,
while GDP will probably have fallen. No wonder the public finances are in a
dismal state.
The public finances are not all that looks dismal. What a difference eight
months - and an election - can make to economic forecasts] In March, the
Treasury forecast growth of 1 per cent in GDP in 1992 and of 3 per cent in
GDP in the first half of 1993. Now it says GDP will fall 1 per cent in 1992
and rise by only 1 per cent in the whole of 1993. Even growth between the
second half of 1992 and the second half of 1993 is forecast at a mere 1 1/2
per cent. This is a forecast for a recovery that will feel like recession,
coming after a recession that feels like depression.
Nor is only the outlook for growth disturbing. In March, the Treasury
forecast a current account deficit of 1 1/2 per cent of GDP in the first
half of 1993. Now, despite far lower expectations for the growth of domestic
demand, the current account deficit is forecast to be 2 1/2 per cent of GDP
in 1993. These all too plausible figures emphasise the importance of
export-led growth and the risks in stoking up domestic demand via more
fiscal stimulus.
The prospects for a sustained and balanced recovery depend overwhelmingly on
the response of inflation to the devaluation. The Treasury is optimistic on
this score, forecasting the retail price index (less mortgage interest) up
by 3 3/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993 and the producer
price index up by 4 per cent. But wages matter most. If the gain in
competitiveness is to be maintained, the real cost of labour must fall. The
government has taken the bold step of limiting the rise in public sector pay
settlements to 1 1/2 per cent. The private sector has to follow suit.
If the private sector does not do so, the government may find its action on
public sector pay a serious error. The chancellor notes that public sector
earnings have risen by 20 per cent over the past two years, while those in
the private sector have risen by only 13 per cent. But public sector pay had
previously lagged behind that in the private sector. The government has now
made itself the direct target for all protests about low public sector pay.
If public sector pay lags too far behind the private sector's over the next
year or two, there will be enormous pressure for a catch-up in the future.
In the details of what the chancellor has proposed are various actions to
lift the gloom of recession. Noteworthy among them are the temporary
increases in first-year capital allowances for plant and machinery; the
allocation of Pounds 750m to buy up empty properties for social housing; the
release of Pounds 1.8bn in local authority capital receipts; the abolition
of the car tax; and extra export credits.
None of this is likely to prove immensely important. Nor is any of it
particularly objectionable. But some of it represents a move towards the
sort of short-term tinkering with taxation that would have been anathema
during the Thatcher era. The inclination to match any powerful lobby with a
fiscal goody needs to be resisted.
More welcome is the determination to maintain ongoing capital spending. The
chancellor and the chief secretary have reason to be pleased with the new
top-down control over public spending if it has allowed them to keep within
the earlier total for next year, admittedly a generous one, and impose
sensible priorities on the allocation of spending as well.
In the longer term, the most important innovation - apart from the new
procedure for control over spending, the new control total and the new
unified procedure for spending and revenue decisions, to be introduced next
year - is likely to be the scope for a private role in public infrastructure
spending. 'The key question,' says the Treasury, 'is whether the private
sector is genuinely assuming risk.' The Treasury is right. This should not
be public borrowing by the back door.
Yet, in the end, it will not be for the details of public spending - and for
the absence of the feared 'shock horror' cuts - that this Autumn Statement
will be remembered. The question is whether the chancellor has crafted a
package capable of delivering a recovery that will start to heal both the
economy and the wound in the public finances.
With the ratio of public spending (less privatisation receipts) to gross
domestic product at 45 1/2 per cent of GDP and the PSBR, similarly defined,
rising to some 8 per cent of GDP, the British public sector looks
Italianate. Even with reasonable recovery, the prospects for the public
finances look worrying and the spending rounds to come horrendously
difficult. Without it, they look disastrous. The government is reduced to
hoping that this time devaluation and monetary easing will lead to the kind
of long-term economic improvement that has failed to occur so often in the
past.

the government - If the Tories' fortunes have turned, it may not be for long

It will only work if it works. The autumn mini-budget announced by Mr Norman
Lamont yesterday brought instant cheer to the Conservative benches, but if
there is no quick response in the real economy the effect will soon wear
off. Much depends upon whether the chancellor's interventionist package of
direct measures really does lead to new orders in the construction industry,
restart the housing market, and sell a few more motor cars.
Yesterday's news sounded promising. So it should. It is born of the
government's desperation. No promise, no government. This explains the
abandonment of some of the ideology of the 1980s. After a decade of being
told that attempts to fine tune demand had been consigned to the dustbin of
economics, along with schemes for kick-starting growth, Conservatives are
now being asked to believe in some of the familiar nostrums of stop-go once
more. What was anathema during the Reagan-Thatcher years is being attempted
under duress by Mr John Major's government. It is a remarkable turnround.
Before the president-elect of the United States has had time even to
rearrange the Oval Room furniture Mr Lamont has introduced Clintonomics to
Britain.
Thus money will be spent on roads, railways, the Jubilee Line and new public
housing (reversing Mrs Thatcher's drive for privatisation of home
ownership). Car tax is abandoned to help automobile sales. Capital receipts
are to be released. There is one important difference from the 1960s. Real
growth in spending in 1993-94, the only year of which we can be sure, is
held to a mere 4 per cent. The cash limit set in November 1991, with an
election in the offing, is maintained.
Some of the extra spending is to be funded by cuts, particularly in defence;
by a welcome near-freeze on public sector incomes; and by ingeniously
accounting for expected fresh injections of private capital as if it were
not being used for public purposes. The items on the list sound very like
the gimmicks, different in detail but similar in spirit, peddled to American
voters by the Democratic candidate during the recent election. Throw in the
one-point interest rate cut and you quickly detect an echo of Labour's plans
for engineering a recovery.
Most Conservative MPs are unlikely to quibble about this. Their constituents
have for some time been asking about what concerns them most: jobs. The
recession has created a widespread and understandable fear of unemployment,
among all classes and in all businesses. It is the single most important
reason why the government is so unpopular. The slump in the housing market
has frightened many voters who have been caught with mortgage debts greater
than the value of their properties. Will a loss of job mean a loss of house?
At first sight yesterday's package appears to address these fears. That in
itself should win the government a plaudit or two.
It needs every manifestation of support it can get. Mr Lamont's package
constitutes a last throw of the dice by a chancellor whose job has been in
jeopardy since Black Wednesday and a prime minister who has since the same
date lost much of his authority. The parliamentary occasion was therefore
carefully prepared, partly by the Treasury's familiar device of intimating
in advance that there would be greater horrors (such as an increase in
national insurance payments) than there actually were on the day, and partly
by what is quaintly called a 'charm offensive'. This series of meetings at
which Treasury ministers pre-sold the autumn statement to backbenchers was a
no doubt necessary exercise.
We shall have to wait to see if the net effect is to do more than get the
government through the night. It is perhaps too much to expect that what was
said yesterday will put a stop to the run of political accidents that has
hit the prime minister since September 16. The latest is still running. Mr
Major came to question time prepared for an assault on his and certain of
his colleagues' integrity over the sale of machine tools to Iraq in spite of
an arms embargo. The extent of his homework, visible in the civil-service
folder he held before him, is a measure of the danger he perceives.
In the event questions put by the Labour leader, Mr John Smith, were
parried, but the game is not over. The more level-headed of Mr Major's
ministers know that there is no quick way of restoring his administration's
reputation, let alone its authority. They merely hope that the chancellor's
economic statement will constitute a first step in what will be a long
campaign.
The idea is that the government will at last be seen to be doing something
about the economy. It will insist, with a little more justification than it
could before Mr Lamont sat down, that it has an economic strategy, that
there is no longer a vacuum in Downing Street. We will soon know if this
scheme is working. If it is, people will say that at last the cabinet is
getting a grip; that it is no longer the plaything of events.
The chances are that it will go wrong, but this is not certain. The limit on
public sector pay increases may produce marching nurses on the evening TV
news. That would hurt the Tories. But not all public sector workers can so
easily win sympathy. Some of the worst-paid - auxiliary workers, local
authority employees and others - belong to unions whose track record is to
use methods that quickly turn opinion against them.
A squeeze on public employees' pay is always going to be unpopular on the
left of politics. The reaction of the conservative, middle-class heartland
of England is not so predictable. The upsurge of sympathy for miners
threatened with dismissal when the pit closures were announced may have been
due to poor timing. The national mood was nearing a nadir. Contempt for the
government was rising. This may change. Cuts as part of a recovery package
are quite different from cuts when there is no hope.
There is, in short, a slim prospect that the mini-budget will bring about a
turn in the government's political fortunes. It may not, however, be much of
a turn, nor will it necessarily last. Mr Lamont's latest forecasts are
cautious, which is hardly surprising. If he is right for once, there will be
only the slightest relief from economic gloom during 1993, with the prospect
of further cuts, or tax increases, thereafter. As his Labour shadow, Mr
Gordon Brown, says, unemployment and bankruptcies will continue to rise. In
those all too easily imaginable circumstances, yesterday's Autumn Statement
could come to be seen as this government's political epitaph.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: Chief secretary who stays
dry in a downpour - Michael Portillo has won plaudits in this year's public
spending negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are not many ministers who can cheerfully write themselves out of a
job and be confident of a sparkling future. But then Mr Michael Portillo is
among that rare group of politicians who manage effortlessly to set
themselves apart from their peers.
At 39, the chief secretary to the Treasury is the youngest and the most
junior member of the cabinet. He is one of its most assured performers,
smart enough to know that even if Mr John Major's luckless government does
hit the rocks, he will find a privileged place in the lifeboat.
If the Autumn Statement does not live up to its claims, Mr Norman Lamont
will bear the opprobrium. The beleaguered chancellor is still living on
borrowed time. If the package does allow the government to regain a grip on
the nation's finances, Mr Portillo, deservedly, will derive much of the
credit.
Perhaps he foresaw such a situation earlier in the summer when he
enthusiastically backed the complete restructuring of the annual public
spending negotiations. Some say it was Mr Portillo who dreamed up the new
system. Mr Lamont insists it was his idea.
Either way the effect has been to reduce significantly the role of the chief
secretary in deciding who gets what in the Whitehall share-out of the public
spending cake. Instead, much of his role as holder of the Treasury
purse-strings has been taken over by something with the appropriately
sinister name of EDX, the new cabinet committee established to consider the
competing departmental claims. Mr Portillo was the committee's
representative not its master. Ultimately, the important decisions - on the
council tax, on public sector pay, on social security benefits - were
hammered out in several exhausting sessions of the full cabinet.
But if the new system changed his role from that of a principal to that of
an agent, Mr Portillo can claim justly that the system delivered the
objective he started out with when he took the job after the April general
election. After several years during which the government in practice
abandoned its commitment to tight controls on public spending, Mr Portillo's
starting point was that it had to begin again to face up to tough decisions.
In contrast with many of his colleagues, the chief secretary believes in the
practice as well as the theory of cutting back the role of the state and the
amount of money it demands of its citizens.
An intellectual Thatcherite in the Nigel Lawson mould (he worked for the
former chancellor before entering parliament in a 1984 by-election), Mr
Portillo pays more than lip-service to the economic ideals and achievements
of the early 1980s.
He judged in the summer that a return to relative austerity would not be
easy. Cabinet colleagues had become accustomed to winning more cash each
year to expand their Whitehall empires. The recession was, and still is,
wreaking havoc with public finances by forcing up demand-led expenditure. He
concluded that the cabinet would agree to break with tradition and stick to
previously agreed spending targets only if ministers were given a collective
voice in setting priorities.
He was right. Though the numbers are slightly different he can claim that
the government has broadly met the remit he set back in July. The other key
element in this year's reforms of the system - a switch to a new control
total for spending which excludes those programmes most vulnerable to the
economic cycle - has set the government's medium-term objectives in a more
rational perspective.
It must not be assumed that the government will stick to those objectives.
The reintroduction yesterday of a 1970s-style pay policy underlined that
U-turns come cheap after the turmoil of the past few months. But Mr Portillo
can claim that the settlement he has mapped out  - much tighter in the
second and third years than in the first and with the cuts biting deeply on
areas such as defence - has at least provided a coherent framework.
In the process the chief secretary has won himself plenty of plaudits. His
confident, sometimes stubborn, negotiating style has impressed cabinet
colleagues. His diligence and grasp of detail has prompted one senior
Treasury official to remark that he is the sharpest minister he has worked
with since Mr Lawson.
Mr Portillo's illiberal instincts are not to everyone's taste. He is in
favour of hanging, and an apparent believer that many of the poor and
disadvantaged have no-one to blame but themselves. He has blind spots; he
believed that the poll tax represented a rational approach to local
authority finance. His approach to Europe - he is publicly loyal about the
Maastricht treaty but privately hates it - comes strangely from one born of
a Spanish father.
But if the chief secretary is the standard-bearer of the Tory right, he is
also a politician looking to the future. He is ready to smooth if not
smother his ideology with the politics of realism. He wants to be prime
minister. In five or perhaps 10 years time he may well achieve his ambition.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Recession brings spending
shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHIFT of spending from weapons purchases to payments for the poor is among
the changes forced on the government by the longer-than-expected recession.
There is also a big switch in the pattern of spending by local authorities,
with the Treasury being willing to sanction a large increase in spending
which councils finance themselves while cracking down on payments to them by
central government.
At the same time, funds channelled to councils by central government have
been shaved back.
Councils' self-financed spending is due to increase to Pounds 11.1bn from
the Pounds 9bn planned a year ago, but at the same time the Treasury will
crack down on payments to them by central government.
The new plans also indicate a cut in transport spending in relation to
existing plans, while health spending has emerged virtually unscathed.
Spending on defence will total Pounds 23.5bn in 1993-94, 4 per cent down on
the Pounds 24.5bn sketched in for the year in the 1991 Autumn Statement,
including the effects of a technical adjustment for pension costs.
Some of the Pounds 1bn taken from defence funds will be injected into a 6
per cent overall rise in social security spending, up sharply from the
Pounds 76.1bn envisaged a year ago to a new estimate of fully Pounds 80.5bn.
Under new Treasury rules outlined yesterday, only that element of social
security spending which is reckoned to be unrelated to the economic cycle
will be counted as part of the new control total introduced by the
government to curb rises in overall spending.
After taking into account various changes in classification, the new control
total - set at Pounds 243.8bn for 1993-94 - is equivalent to the Pounds
244.5bn planning total for this year announced by the Treasury 12 months
ago.
Overall social security spending is divided into two parts: Pounds 65bn
which is unrelated to the economic cycle and Pounds 15.5bn linked to the
economic downturn. That takes the form of unemployment pay and some elements
of income support to people under 65.
The Treasury is assuming that unemployment will average 2.8m this year and
total 2.9m in 1993-94, staying at this figure until 1995-96.
Even as recently as the March Budget, the Treasury was assuming that growth
would be much higher during this period, with unemployment as a result being
limited to 2.5m.
As a consequence of the shift in thinking about unemployment, overall social
security spending is likely to continue to rise steeply.
For next year, the Treasury has found it possible to increase social
security spending by making small cuts in other departments' spending -
among them transport - and by pencilling in a Pounds 1.2bn reduction in
finance to European Community funds compared to last year's plans.
Other extra funds have come from reducing the unallocated reserve - which is
part of the 1993-94 spending plans - from Pounds 8bn a year ago to Pounds
4bn.
Some of the comparisons between the different plans for 1993-94, shown in
the table, have been affected by changes in responsi-bilities of specific
departments; for instance the taking over of the responsibilities of the
Department of Energy by the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Banks give cautious welcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS AND other financial institutions gave a cautious welcome to the Autumn
Statement, predicting that it would help to take some of the pressure off
bank balance sheets and give a lift to trading in the securities markets.
Mr Phil Nunnerley, assistant general manager for retail banking at Lloyds
Bank, said the banks welcomed the government's measures to stimulate the
housing market by allocating Pounds 750m for buying empty properties.
He said the banks were in a better position than building societies because
they had fewer repossessed properties.
Mr Geoff Ellerton, product director for branch banking at Midland, said the
cut in base rates would make saving less attractive. The banks were already
noticing a downward pressure on savings accounts, which could lead to
increased consumer spending.
Securities houses looked forward to continuing interest in equities - and
thus higher commissions - from falling UK interest rates.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Inward investors give
qualified approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INWARD INVESTORS in the north gave the statement a cautious welcome but
stressed that, while its main points were helpful, they alone could not
transform confidence.
The cut in interest rates, improvements in capital allowances and the
decision not to increase national insurance contributions were all
applauded. But investors emphasised that economic stability and clarity of
policy remained vital.
There was some disappointment that the chancellor had not been more bold. Mr
David D'Arcy, financial director of Norwegian-owned Grorud, which relies
heavily on local authorities to buy the stair lifts and door and window
fittings it produces at Consett, County Durham, said that the permission
given to councils to spend future capital receipts would have limited
impact.
Mr John Dolan, managing director of Compaq, the US-owned computer
manufacturer based at Erskine, near Glasgow, welcomed capital allowances
improvements, although he had hoped for more relief on research and
development.
Mr David Smith, human-resources manager at NSK, the bearings and automotive
products manufacturer at Peterlee, County Durham, said: 'In general all the
measures are gratefully received.' But he said they were 'insufficent to
transform our future'.
Nissan Motor Manufacturing, which employs 4,600 people at its Sunderland car
plant, welcomed the abolition of car sales tax but said confidence had to
return before sales could rise significantly.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Northern Development Company, responsible
for attracting inward investment to north-east England and Cumbria, said the
boost to export cover would help.
Professor Neil Hood, director of Strathclyde University's International
Business Unit, said improved capital allowances might influence the timing
of some inward-investment projects, and the cut in interest rates would send
a favourable signal to inward investors.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Disappointment at training
commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAT WALLACE, who is in charge of government-funded training programmes at
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, called it an 'autumn non-statement'. He was
disappointed that Mr Lamont had not mentioned training apart from making a
brief reference to youth training.
He was not the only disappointed training chief. 'I welcome the
determination of the government to invest in the development of human
capital,' said Mr Brendan McGuinness, director of education and training at
the Engineering Employers' Federation in the west Midlands. 'I would have
welcomed a stronger commitment in the actual statement to training,' he
added.
Mr Peter Harrisson, managing director of Linread, the fasteners group, said
training was focused too much on the short term.
'You've got to see it long-term as an investment, and that is where one
would have liked to have seen government putting some money in,' Mr
Harrisson said.
Mr Edward Roberts, chief executive of Heath Springs of Redditch and chairman
of G10, the group which liaises between Training and Enterprise Councils and
the government, said: 'From what we can see at first glance it is a help.'
'They haven't smacked the funding, and they have allowed us more
flexibility,' said Mr Richard Archer, a member of the Birmingham Tec board
and a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
The greater freedom for TECs to run their own operations and to have three
year funding on some training projects Mr Archer classified as 'basic common
sense'. It would will also help those who provide training. 'Our planning
jumps from year to year. If the TECs get more stability, they can pass it on
to us.' He observed it was less difficult to give people qualifications than
to find them jobs when they had qualifications.
'I think the whole thing sounds very good for the West Midlands,' said Mr
Roberts.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Treasury projects a cautious
line on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY, when it arrives, will be modest and driven by consumption
rather than investment, according to the latest Treasury projections.
In a muted and heavily qualified statement of UK economic prospects, the
Treasury admitted that its Budget projections have proved to be
over-optimistic while forecasting that the economy will grow by 1 per cent
in 1993 after contracting by the same figure this year.
The Treasury forecast for 1993 is lower than that of most independent
forecasters. The consensus of forecasters expect a rise in gross domestic
product of 1 1/4 per cent next year. In its pre-election budget, the
government had forecast growth of 1 per cent this year and 3 per cent in the
first half of 1993.
Treasury forecasters have been criticised over the past year for being both
wrong and over-optimistic. In a recent FT analysis of recent forecasting
performance, the Treasury came 19th out of 41 forecasters.
A Treasury calculation of its forecasts over the last 10 years show thats
its forecast for GDP growth tends to be wrong, on average, by 1 1/4
percentage points of GDP. This implies that the Treasury's growth forecast
for 1991 could vary between 2 1/4 per cent and - 1/4 per cent.
But the Treasury appears to have swapped optimism for caution.
'The recovery could, of course, be a lot stronger if confidence picks up
quickly in response to recent government initiatives' it says.
'But it seems prudent not to base the forecast on this assumption.'
The effect of projected slow growth, rising unemployment and higher spending
is to raise the public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 37bn this
financial year, up from the Pounds 28bn target announced in the budget.
Excluding privatisation receipts, the PSBR is Pounds 45bn, equivalent to 7
1/2 per cent of GDP.
The Treasury expects the headline PSBR to rise to around 7 per cent of GDP
in the 1993-94 financial year, equivalent to Pounds 44bn.
The government expects a moderate recovery in consumer spending, forecast to
grow by 1 1/4 per cent next year. Fixed investment is expected to rise by a
quarter of 1 per cent.
The relatively sluggish pick-up in consumer spending means lower than
expected import growth, although at 5 3/4 per cent it is higher than the
independent consensus. It is also faster than expected growth of exports.
There is little sign of a stimulatory effect on exports from the recent
devaluation of sterling. Indeed, the short-term effect is to increase the
current account deficit as import prices rise faster than export prices. The
deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 15.5bn in 1993 or 2 1/2 per cent of
GDP compared to 2 per cent of GDP this year.
The devaluation does affect the government's inflation projections.
Retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest tax relief, is expected
to remain at 3 3/4 per cent this year and next. But producer price inflation
is expected to jump to 4 per cent from 2 1/2 per cent this year as
manufacturers use the devaluation to boost their profit margins. The
Treasury downplays this inflation risk.
'Against a back of strong disinflationary pressures, the lower exchange may
imply only a marginal and almost certainly temporary increase in inflation,'
it says.

FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Labour condemns 'spiteful
mini-budget'

THE Autumn Statement failed to provide an effective economic and industrial
strategy for the future, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, told the
Commons.
Waving aside shouts of 'cheer up' from the Tory benches he maintained that,
with unemployment still set to rise, the chancellor should have gone still
further in adopting Labour policies as a way of restoring the confidence
needed in order to get the economy moving again.
Mr Brown's remarks contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic response which
most Tory backbenchers accorded Mr Norman Lamont in private and public.
A concerted effort by Treasury ministers to brief Conservative MPs of the
economic backdrop to the statement appeared to have paid off. He was told by
one of his more persistent critics, Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for
Macclesfield, that 'your credibility has been restored'.
Lord Parkinson, the former Tory Cabinet minister and frequent critic of the
government, said on BBC television that Mr Lamont, 'was clearly right on top
of the job'.
But Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, contended
that the total package was unlikely to have anything like the impact needed.
'There is a danger that today's fireworks may burn out very quickly,' he
said
Mr Robert Sheldon (Lab Ashton-under-Lyne), a former Treasury minister,
welcomed the chancellor's belated recognition of the need to help the
manufacturing sector through improved capital allowances but warned
'although you have done something you have not done enough'.
The decision to impose a zero to 1.5 per cent limit on public-sector wage
increases was fiercely condemned by the Opposition.
Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover) accused the chancellor of having introduced
a 'spiteful mini-budget' which attacked the lowest paid, and Mr John Garrett
(Lab Norwich South), protested that thousands of public-sector workers faced
an absolute cut in their standard of living and quality of life.
The chancellor stressed that in the past two years public-sector workers had
done better, on average, than those in the private sector.
Responding to concern from Tory backbenchers that the policy of the banks
had prevented small businesses from receiving the full benefit of earlier
reductions in interest rates Mr Lamont noted that some had imposed a 'floor'
below which they would not reduce their charges.
To cheers, he said: 'I hope they will consider this position very
carefully.'
While the help provided for the housing market was given a general welcome
Mr Lamont agreed with Mr George Walden (C Buckingham) that it would be 'a
great mistake if we just tried to have a great house price boom again'.
