FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Norcros drops 12% to Pounds 5.56m - Job
losses and recession continue to bedevil UK tile-maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE false dawn in the building sector early this summer, Norcros was
forced to make further redundancies in its UK tile-making business.
This was the main component in the Pounds 2.65m exceptional costs which lay
behind a 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 6.32m to Pounds
5.56m, in the six months to September 30.
Operating profit advanced from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.7m on sales of
Pounds 191.2m (Pounds 196.3m).
Interest costs fell to Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 4.29m).
Earnings per share fell from 3p to 2.5p, and a maintained interim dividend
of 3.5p is again uncovered.
There was a retained loss of Pounds 1.42m (profit of Pounds 792,000).
Building products, the largest division by sales with Pounds 80.8m in the
first half, staged a recovery in operating profit to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds
2.16m).
Mr Michael Doherty, chief executive, said losses had been halved at Crosby
Sarek windows and doors and Crittall Windows had improved to break-even.
Triton showers continued to grow.
Profit slipped in ceramics to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 5m) on sales of Pounds
55.3m (Pounds 60.1m). A further fall in the UK tile market of 12 to 15 per
cent this year led to another 150 job losses at Johnson.
'As late as July we hoped there would be no more restructuring, but our
attitude had to change after that,' Mr Doherty said.
The headcount came down from 2,500 to 1,200 in three years, although
capacity increased and quality improved.
By the year end the wages bill should be 5 per cent down despite pay
increases of up to 4 per cent.
In print and packaging, profit fell to Pounds 4.38m (Pounds 5.1m). Norprint
was hit by a substantial drop in demand for price labels from small shops.
Fierce competition also undermined prices.
Property disposals amounted to Pounds 20.6m this financial year, of which
nearly Pounds 10m was received in cash, plus Pounds 3m deferred from the
previous year.
Borrowings were reduced by Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 119.9m, giving gearing of
between 80 per cent and 90 per cent.
COMMENT
Six months ago the story was that Norcros's restructuring was complete and
it was ready to start growing. The reverse has happened. It was, of course,
not the only company to think the worst was over. The result has punctured
the recovery staged in ceramics last year, leaving the joinery businesses
short of sufficient sales to make a profit. The continuing slump in
commercial construction continues to hold back the tile market, while
over-capacity in doors bodes ill for loss-making Crosby Sarek. This year's
figures have a small cushion in a pension fund surplus and provisions set up
to cover the liquidation of the property portfolio. The group still has a
little way to go before it is cash neutral, leaving aside property sales.
Full-year pre-tax profit, helped by lower interest costs and reduction of
losses in building products, is forecast to inch ahead to about Pounds 16m,
a prospective p/e multiple of 15 on last night's share price of 113p. A
yield of just over 8 per cent - the final dividend should be maintained -
provides a floor for the price.

Increased operating profits and lower interest charges led Casket, the
bicycles and clothing group, to a 79 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
for the six months to September 30.
The advance, from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 1.87m, was achieved on turnover up
42 per cent at Pounds 50.1m (Pounds 35.4m).
Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the bicycle operations - where the group
has more than 20 per cent of the UK market following the purchase of Falcon
Cycles late last year - continued to expand successfully. The clothing
businesses were operating more efficiently in difficult market conditions.
The interim dividend is doubled to 0.3p, payable from earnings ahead 89 per
cent at 1.7p (0.9p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCHANT RETAIL Group returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 467,000 for the
half year to September 26 on turnover of Pounds 88.8m.
Although the figures compared with Pounds 1.22m and Pounds 79m respectively
for the same period of the previous year directors said 'robust trading' was
experienced at its discount supermarkets and department stores.
Trading profits of the Normans supermarkets fell to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 2m)
but at that level were considerably ahead of those for the second half of
the past year.
A slight decline in trading profits at the Joplings department stores to
Pounds 736,000 (Pounds 818,000) reflected tighter margins and an increase in
sales on interest-free credit.
The interim dividend is cut to 0.35p (1.1p), in line with the company's
objective of maintaining the full year pay-out - the final dividend was
omitted last time. Earnings on the enlarged capital emerged at 0.44p
(0.97p).

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Marshalls shows decline to Pounds 6.41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group,
slipped from Pounds 7.13m to Pounds 6.41m for the six months to September
30.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.25p on capital increased by the
Pounds 20m rights issue concluded in the summer.
The distribution is covered by earnings of 1.85p a share. That compared with
earnings of 2.68p, restated to take account of the rights issue, at the
corresponding stage last year.
The share price was unchanged at 48p, compared with the rights issue price
of 75p.
Mr Simeon Marshall, director, said the results were creditable given that
some two thirds of group sales of concrete, stone and clay products were to
the depressed UK private commercial, industrial and residential markets.
Turnover fell from Pounds 97.9m to Pounds 93.2m. Mr Marshall said the fall
in profits would have been greater but for demand from local authorities for
paving products which, although not increasing, had held up well.
The cost of bad debts increased from Pounds 397,000 to Pounds 453,000,
mostly due to higher credit insurance costs. The group was fully covered
against bad debt risks, Mr Marshall said.
Redundancy costs also increased, from Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 605,000.
During the past 12 months the group has cut its workforce by about 6 per
cent, equivalent to 150 jobs.
The group said that the rights issue cash had been ear-marked for profitable
acquisitions but these had proved harder to find than had been expected.
A number of possibilities had been investigated and discussions were
continuing in some cases.
'Capital expenditure is lower than forecast with the market downturn making
it difficult to justify some of the expected investment,' said Mr Marshall.
The rights issue proceeds, however, had enabled the group to further reduce
net debt which, since the halfway stage last year, had fallen from Pounds
39.4m to Pounds 13.6m.
Gearing was reduced from almost 40 per cent to less than 12 per cent.
Interest charges as a result fell from Pounds 2.81m to Pounds 1.67m.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals reduces loss after recent
upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPA MINERALS, the UK mining finance house dogged by poor performances at
its mines and by boardroom upheavals since its 1989 listing, came close to
break-even in the six months to July 31 - during which it was refinanced and
restructured under new management.
The group, which owns gold and coal mines in Australia and has North Sea and
Indonesian oil and gas interests, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 289,000,
reduced sharply from a Pounds 2.45m loss at the interim stage in 1991.
Austmin, a small Australian mining company and Europa's largest shareholder,
took over management of the company earlier this year. The Australian
operations are now run by executive directors Mr Guido Staltari and Mr Bob
Duffin.
Sir David Hardy, executive chairman, said Europa had emerged from 'a
frustrating period in which it had lost its way' as a slimmer and fitter
company.
Turnover rose from Pounds 8.31m to Pounds 8.91m. Costs of sales rose only 6
per cent which, with lower distribution and administration costs, enabled
the company to return an operating profit of Pounds 14,000, compared with a
loss of Pounds 1.55m in 1991.
Losses per share were 4.3p, against 26.8p.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook shareholders urged to reject
tender offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Etonbrook, the property developer which is in dispute with its
largest shareholder over a capital restructuring, has written to investors
urging them to reject a tender offer for 13.4 per cent of the company.
The letter warned shareholders that the offer of 73p per share would bring
the stake held by Mr Andrew Perloff and companies associated with him to
29.9 per cent.
'He will have achieved a disproportionate degree of control over Etonbrook
without having made a full bid,' the letter states.
The letter further claimed the offer compared unfavourably with the stated
net asset value per share of more than 100p.
The group said that following the disposal of a London property, Etonbrook
had cash balances of 61p per share and no debt - or 34p after repayment of
Pounds 1.2m in preference shares.
Mr Perloff has consistently objected to a capital restructuring which would
allow full repayment of the preference shares and payment of dividends. His
objections were supported at an extraordinary meeting in September, although
he failed in his attempt to win a seat on the board.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Body scanners keep Oxford in health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG DEMAND for body scanners helped Oxford Instruments, which makes the
equipment in a joint venture with Siemens of Germany, report a marginal
increase to Pounds 4.26m in interim pre-tax profits.
However, core businesses suffered a sharp drop, with the operating profit
tumbling by Pounds 1m to Pounds 797,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 49.7m to
Pounds 45.1m.
Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased with
the results achieved in 'these difficult times and difficult circumstances'.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p, payable from earnings 0.2p up at
5.9p.
The group expected the difficult trading conditions to continue into the
second half, Mr Williams said, with only 'insipid signs of recovery in the
US'. About 33 per cent of group sales are in the US.
Oxford Magnet Technology, which was incurring losses in 1989 before the
creation of a joint venture with Siemens, contributed Pounds 2.9m, against
Pounds 2.3m last time.
Mr Williams could not explain the continued buoyancy of the scanner market.
'There has been no sign of the recession there,' he said. He added, however,
that perhaps a note of caution on the outlook for scanners was to be
recommended, 'but we also said that a year ago'.
Profits were also boosted by a Pounds 370,000 gain on interest receivable to
Pounds 500,000. Oxford finished the first half with net cash of Pounds 3.3m.
Two of Oxford's three loss-making businesses were returned to profit in the
period. The remaining loss-maker, Plasma Technology, had cut its deficit
substantially.
The group had no orders for its much-touted synchrotron - a device that
enables semiconductor manufacturers to pack more circuits onto microchips
than with conventional systems.
The prototype, being used for research by IBM, had been successful and
Oxford was building a second on spec. So far it had cost about Pounds 4.5m.
COMMENT
The main message from Oxford appears to be steady as she goes. The slight
bias towards the second half and exposure to the dollar market also offer
some encouragement that forecasts of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m for the
full year could be achievable. The worries might centre on the decline in
the core businesses and just when the axe will fall on the body scanner
market. Efforts to shore up the core business slide have produced patchy
results, and it is unlikely anything more significant will be achieved
without general economic recovery. Nevertheless, the shares - on a
prospective p/e of about 16.6 - are looking more reasonable than they were
in the heady days of the 1980s. Current investors might see some
outperformance in the near future, but there might not be enough there yet
to tempt buyers.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dealings in Cabra suspended at 2p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Cabra Estates, the property company that owns two London football
grounds, were yesterday suspended at 2p, pending clarification of its
financial position.
The move, likely to lead to the appointment of receivers, followed demands
by two of Cabra's banks on Monday for repayment of their loans.
The decision added further confusion to long-running negotiations about the
grounds used by Chelsea and Fulham football clubs.
Cabra had been hopeful it would soon conclude talks to sell the grounds.
Chelsea said yesterday's announcement would have no impact on its
negotiations for the acquisition of the grounds.
'We have been kept closely informed of the situation between Cabra and its
bankers,' the club said.
Negotiations were expected to 'be satisfactorily concluded in the near
future,' it added.
Fulham Football Club, which is due to move next May when its lease expires
on the Craven Cottage site, said its position would not necessarily be
improved if Cabra went into receivership.
The future of Craven Cottage was up to its eventual owner, the club said.
Cabra said it was surprised by its banks' decision to demand repayment of
their loans.
At an extraordinary meeting last Friday, Cabra said it hoped talks on debt
restructuring and sale of the football grounds would soon be resolved.
'These demands (for repayment of debt) were totally unexpected,' said Mr
Gordon Young, chairman of Cabra.
'As constructive negotiations had continued up to the EGM on Friday and no
indication had been received of this precipitative action,'
Demand notices for debt repayment were issued by Midland Bank and The Royal
Bank of Scotland, which has a charge over the football grounds.
They have been in debt restructuring talks for 10 months.
In the year to March, Cabra incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 22.1m.
Its net assets fell to less than half the called-up share capital of Pounds
24m.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: General Accident's Pounds 37m loss blamed
on Hurricane Andrew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVIER-THAN-expected claims from Hurricane Andrew in the US left General
Accident, the composite insurer, nursing pre-tax losses of Pounds 36.7m for
the nine months to September 30 but masked an underlying improvement in the
UK and the Far East.
Losses from the hurricane amounted to Pounds 38m, some Pounds 7m more than
originally estimated.
GA suffered losses of Pounds 31m on its direct US business and a further
Pounds 7m on its reinsurance portfolio. US underwriting losses rose to
Pounds 136.6m (Pounds 89.6m).
In the UK, the company reported a continuing improvement on its domestic
motor and householders' business, largely reflecting rate increases, more
selective underwriting and reduced costs.
Losses from motor policies were reduced by over 50 per cent to Pounds 50.5m.
Premium income fell to Pounds 268.2m (Pounds 308.5m) despite average rate
increases of about 15 per cent.
The houseowners' insurance account also improved, with a Pounds 2.2m profit
in the third quarter. Over the nine months the account was only marginally
in the red with losses of Pounds 1.3m, compared with Pounds 34.5m.
Subsidence claims fell from Pounds 30m to Pounds 17.3m.
Anticipating greater profitability in this area GA aims to increase its
exposure.
It has agreed to acquire a block of 216,000 policies sold by Cheltenham and
Gloucester and formerly underwritten by Municipal Mutual, the local
authority-owned insurer which withdrew from the market this year.
The deficit on the commercial property account was also reduced, from Pounds
53.4m to Pounds 23.1m.
Losses from mortgage indemnity policies, which insure mortgage lenders
against losses on sales of repossessed houses, fell to Pounds 32m (Pounds
35m).
Overall UK underwriting losses were down to Pounds 133.1m (Pounds 259.7m),
with premium income ahead at Pounds 920.1m (Pounds 906.9m).
Elsewhere, Canadian underwriting losses increased to CDollars 11.9m (Pounds
5.9m) compared with CDollars 1.5m last year, but losses in the Pacific fell
from Pounds 20m to Pounds 5.2m.
Net investment earnings increased to Pounds 301.5m (Pounds 276m). Estate
agency losses increased to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 11.9m). Long term profits
were virtually unchanged at Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 22.2m).

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Express sees profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Express, the scheduled coach service operator joining the stock
market later this month, is forecasting a sharp turnabout from pre-tax
losses of Pounds 1.2m last year to pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m for the 53
weeks ending January 2.
The figure emerged yesterday in a pathfinder prospectus for the flotation.
It reflects a strong recovery from heavy restructuring costs taken after
last year's management buy-in.
The full prospectus, due out on November 24, is likely to value National
Express at more than Pounds 50m. The flotation will be through a placing and
offer for sale, with 25 per cent of shares being offered to the public.
One reason for the flotation, expected to raise about Pounds 25m for
National Express, is to help the company pay off borrowings and restructure
its balance sheet after a period of rapid change.
About Pounds 9m will be used to redeem preference shares held by venture
capital funds that backed last year's buy-in. The balance will wipe out
Pounds 11m deficit on shareholders' funds, most from a goodwill write-off.

ANGLIAN WATER, which supplies water and sewerage services to customers from
the Humber to the Thames, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 9 per cent
to Pounds 100.2m for the six months to September 30.
The increase was mainly due to higher prices and cost cutting.
Mr Bernard Henderson, chairman, said Anglian continued to perform well. Mr
Chris Mellor, group finance director, said second-half profits would be
slightly lower because of seasonal factors, such as pumping costs, and
higher net borrowings.
Turnover rose 9.7 per cent to Pounds 286.3m, helped by average price
increases of 9.4 per cent. Industrial volumes, which have been affected by
recession, appeared to have stabilised and fell 1 per cent compared with 7
per cent in the corresponding period.
Operating costs increased 7.7 per cent to Pounds 127.2m because of inflation
and higher running costs owing to new quality standards.
Anglian said increased efficiency, stemming from improved productivity and
rationalisations, saved Pounds 2.5m. Operating profits increased 12 per cent
to Pounds 114m.
Depreciation jumped 18 per cent to Pounds 25.4m, reflecting the capital
expenditure programme.
Capital expenditure, which totalled Pounds 294.9m last year, is expected to
reach Pounds 330m this time. Anglian's programme to improve sewage treatment
works is nearly complete. An increasing amount of spending will now go
towards improving water supply.
Interest costs increased 39 per cent to Pounds 13.9m as net debt increased
from Pounds 209.2m a year ago to Pounds 283.6m. This lifted gearing more
than 4 percentage points to 20.6 per cent.
Anglian was one of the slowest of the privatised water companies to buy
non-core businesses, acquiring Rosewater Engineering in July. The company
said it was now combining this company with two existing subsidiaries to
create a broader based water process engineering company.
Earnings increased 8.9 per cent to 31.7p and the interim dividend rises 7.9
per cent to 6.8p, broadly in line with Anglian's policy of real annual
dividend growth of 4 per cent.
The results were in line with forecasts but Anglian's shares gained 12p to
479p in line with a firm water sector.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Oceana swings Pounds 158,000 into red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEANA Consolidated, which has interests in stockbroking and finance, swung
into the red in the six months to end-September.
The pre-tax deficit for the period amounted to Pounds 158,000, against a
profit of Pounds 115,000 last time.
The outcome was struck in spite of an increase in operating income from
Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.79m and a rise in net interest receivable to Pounds
115,000 (Pounds 86,000).
Trading throughout the period fluctuated widely, the company said. The first
quarter included the election, and business was at record levels. The second
quarter, in contrast, was marred by exceptionally low trading volumes,
reflecting uncertainty about the economy.
Losses per share were 2.43p (earnings of 1.47p).

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: GPA seeks to improve position in bank talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD, ROBERT PESTON and BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP is expected to outline its debt restructuring proposals at a
meeting of its 73 banks on November 23.
The world's biggest aircraft leasing company, with total debts of about
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn), is talking to its banks as part of a complex
series of discussions with creditors and suppliers to strengthen its
financial position.
Several of GPA's banks said yesterday that the successful resolution of
negotiations with the suppliers, led by Boeing and Airbus Industrie, was
essential if the company was to win support from bankers for rescheduling
some of its debt payments.
GPA, which is being advised by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, wants
suppliers to defer delivering billions of dollars of aircraft the company
has agreed to buy.
In a separate development, GPA yesterday recovered 13 of its aircraft which
were leased to VASP, Brazil's second leading airline after it failed to meet
leasing payments of about Dollars 12m.
When aircraft are seized in this way GPA has to find new leases before
receiving revenue from the aircraft.
One of GPA's principal bank lenders said yesterday the bank talks were
triggered earlier this year after the company revised its revenue
projections.
A reduction in projected revenues led to a potential breach of its borrowing
covenants.
The banker said the potential breach postponed attempts by GPA to raise
Dollars 752m from the sale of bonds backed by 18 aircraft leases, called
ALPS 2.
It helped scuttle an attempt to raise Dollars 350m from the sale of
convertible preference shares before the end of the year.
GPA said yesterday that if it succeeds in talks with banks and manufacturers
an equity issue and the ALPS 2 would go ahead in the first quarter of 1993.

<TEXT>
The Robert Bass group is pushing for the right to make direct presentations
on its offer of about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m) for the main US businesses
of Maxwell Communication Corporation.
A group of investors led by Keystone, formally the Robert M Bass Group and
Acadia an investment partnership including Mr Bass, confirmed yesterday that
it had made an offer for the Macmillan publishing businesses and the
Official Airline Guides.
The offer is Dollars 725m cash plus the assumption of all liabilities to
third parties.
Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, has rebuffed the approach on the
grounds that it is at the bottom end of their Dollars 700m-Dollars 1.1bn
expectations net of tax and other obligations. Price Waterhouse and JP
Morgan, its US adviser, have said they plan to sell OAG and float Macmillan.
Those involved in the approach believe the bid represents full value. It is
clear that negotiations over the offer have not been ruled out.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Warburg well below expectations - The bank
says poor results were predictable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS HE announced SG Warburg's pre-tax profits of Pounds 51.2m for the first
half, well below market expectations of about Pounds 75m, Lord Cairns, chief
executive, said: 'It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep the market
informed.'
The stock market promptly wiped some 8.5 per cent off the UK merchant bank's
share price.
Increased public concerns about insider trading had meant that the bank now
felt less able to guide analysts about what profits it would report, said
Lord Cairns.
However, he added that recent poor results from other other investment
banks, such as Salomon and Barings, should have given stock market analysts
a warning of what was to come.
Most of the bad news the market had to digest yesterday came from two
directions. Warburg's fixed income division turned in a loss of about Pounds
10m, while the German subsidiary of its Pallas Leasing group had been closed
at a cost of Pounds 11.6m.
Together, these helped to pull down profits in the group's investment
banking operations to Pounds 20.4m, compared with Pounds 65.2m in the same
period in 1991.
Other investment banking activities presented a mixed picture. Corporate
finance had been generally busy during a quiet period for the industry as a
whole, with Warburg advising on the Hongkong Bank merger with Midland, the
Wellcome share flotation and ICI's planned demerger.
Equities experienced a strong first quarter to the financial year as trading
volumes jumped after the general election, but suffered along with other
houses from a fall-off in activity in the second quarter.
Warburg said it had begun to restructure its loss-making Japanese equities
business with the loss of a small number of jobs, and had restricted the
range of Japanese equities it researched.
However, 'results in the main UK, US and Japanese markets did not meet our
expectations.'
Warburg announced an unchanged interim dividend of 5.25p, despite a fall in
earnings per share from 27.6p in the first half of 1991 to 11.9p (or 17.4p
on continuing businesses). Mercury Asset Management bolstered the group's
position with pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.5m, up from Pounds 34m in the
same period of 1991. This was despite the decision to write off the
remainder of MAM's investment in Isosceles, representing a charge of Pounds
4m.
Mr Peter Stormonth Darling, chairman, said he remained confident that at
least part of this investment could be recovered. MAM's improved performance
came from a reduction in its costs from Pounds 49.2m to Pounds 45.8m.
Turnover was up less than Pounds 200,000, at Pounds 76.3m.
Mr Stormonth Darling said the company had not lost any clients following the
departure of Mr Leonard Licht, vice-chairman, this summer, and that its
funds under management had grown by Pounds 1bn to Pounds 42bn.
MAM's investment performance, while disappointing in 1991, was likely to be
stronger in 1992, putting it back among the leading managers on results,
said Mr Stormonth Darling.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: De La Rue achieves 48% advance to Pounds
46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL acquisition helped De La Rue, which prints banknotes and makes
cash-handling machines, boost pre-tax profits by 48 per cent to Pounds 46m
in the six months to September 30.
The UK group's figures reflected for the first time a full contribution from
Inter Innovation, the Swedish competitor in payment systems for which it
paid Pounds 94.7m last October.
Turnover rose by 64 per cent to Pounds 272.7m.
Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the Swedish acquisition had, as
predicted, not been dilutive. Indeed earnings per share grew by 23.2 per
cent to 17p (13.8p).
Mr Marshall said: 'I am delighted with the continuing progress De La Rue is
making, which is reflected in these results. Security printing has continued
to grow strongly, while the addition of Inter Innovation to payment systems
has proved to be a valuable acquisition. In spite of depressed economic
circumstances, prospects for De La Rue remain good.'
The board said that the sustained increase in earnings, together with good
prospects for the rest of the year, justified a 10 per cent increase in the
interim dividend. from 3.5p to 3.85p.
Mr Marshall said that in spite of the uncertain outlook for economic growth
in the UK, and in many countries overseas, the order books in both security
printing and payment systems remained strong.
Demand for banknotes and other high-security documents grew particularly
strongly in formerly Communist countries.
Having raised Pounds 160.3m in a rights issue last year to help fund the
Swedish acquisition, the group still has net cash of Pounds 109.9m. Interest
receivable rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 5.6m.
COMMENT
Mr Marshall's transform-ation of De La Rue has been one of the great City
success stories of recent years, so a 5p drop in the group's shares to 648p
seems a rather grudging response to these figures. Analysts were slightly
concerned by the drop in security printing's profit margins, which reflect
in-creased competition. However, they also acknowledged that Mr Marshall's
cost-cutting skills should produce further benefits from Inter Innovation.
Forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 96m put the shares on a premium
prospective multiple of just over 18. Although the shares may not advance
much in the short-term, the group is building a strong market position for
the time when banks can afford the capital investment necessary to replace
staff handling money with machines.

FT  11 NOV 92 / United Biscuits expands to Australia: UK snack maker to buy
Coca-Cola Amatil beverage group for ADollars 430m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED BISCUITS, Britain's largest biscuit and snack manufacturer, is to
acquire the snack foods business of Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), the Australian
beverage group, for ADollars 430m (Pounds 195.5m) in cash.
To help fund the purchase, UB raised about Pounds 80m by placing 24.1m new
ordinary shares with institutional investors yesterday at a price of 332p.
UB's shares closed at 337p, down 9p.
UB said the deal was an important step in its plan to become a world leader
in biscuits and snacks and would give it a strong position in Asia Pacific.
CCA snacks has 56 per cent of the Australian market, which accounts for
about 85 per cent of its sales. It is also brand leader in extruded snacks
in Italy, where it has 27 per cent of the market, and has factories in
Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.
The business, to be renamed Smiths Snackfood, earned a trading profit of
ADollars 36.1m on sales of ADollars 401m in the year to December. UB said it
expected profits in the current year to be 8 to 10 per cent higher.
The deal must be approved by Australia's Foreign Investments Review Board.
The board is under pressure from economic nationalists opposed to a ADollars
209m hostile bid by Campbell Soup, the US foods group, for Arnotts,
Australia's leading biscuit company.
UB said it was confident its planned deal would face no such problems, as
the bid was friendly and for a company already foreign-controlled.
CCA, which is 51 per cent owned by Coca-Cola of the US, said the deal would
allow it to concentrate on its soft drink distribution business, which has
grown from four countries to eight since 1989.
The sale will result in a ADollars 243m extraordinary profit for CCA.
UB said it expected the deal, to be completed in January, to be non-dilutive
next year and to lead to a Pounds 116m rise in group borrowings.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Warburg profits fall to Pounds 51.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ABORTED leasing venture in Germany and trading losses stemming from the
crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism this summer have cost SG
Warburg more than Pounds 20m and dented its reputation as the UK's
pre-eminent merchant bank.
Warburg yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 51.2m for the six
months to September 30, down from Pounds 91.5m in the same period in 1991.
Its share price lost 45p to close at 479p.
Warburg's fixed-income division lost Pounds 10m during the period, due to
the upheaval in European bond markets following Danish rejection of the
Maastricht treaty and the exit of sterling from the ERM. Holdings of Ecu
bonds accounted for much of this loss.
'We would have been running, as we always are, fairly big positions between
the markets, and the Ecu was one of the positions we had,' said Lord Cairns,
chief executive.
The losses were at least partly balanced by foreign exchange profits, which
helped the bank's treasury operations to record a strong half, but these had
not been substantial enough to cancel out the fixed-income losses.
The group's fixed-income division has now been merged with its treasury
operations and the bank has changed its approach to marketmaking, said Lord
Cairns. The group would in future be less willing to trade unless clients
were prepared to reward the bank for its commitment. 'The balance of
accommodation is changing and we need to recognise that.' He added that
Warburg had no plans to withdraw from markets as a result.
Warburg also announced a loss of Pounds 11.6m on its German office equipment
leasing business, which was launched in the late-1980s. Credit losses
experienced so far had led it to conclude it would never make substantial
profits from the market.
The Pounds 11.6m covers closure costs and 'very conservative' provisioning
against possible losses on the leasing book, the bank said, though it did
not release further details of the provisioning levels.
The group's profits were bolstered by Mercury Asset Management, its 75 per
cent-owned subsidiary, which recorded profits up to Pounds 1.5m to Pounds
35.5m, after writing off its investment in Isosceles with a further Pounds
4m provision.

FT  11 NOV 92 / T&amp;N to acquire Goetze for DM250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, one of the leading UK motor component makers, has reached conditional
agreement to acquire Goetze, the German components maker, in a deal valued
at DM250m (Pounds 101m).
The takeover, which is T&amp;N's first big acquisition in Germany, will increase
its worldwide turnover by more than a quarter and will substantially
strengthen its position as a leading supplier of engine components.
The T&amp;N share price rose yesterday by 7p to close at 142p.
Goetze, which is privately owned, is the largest producer in Europe of
piston rings, an important engine component, for supply to vehicle makers as
original equipment. It also produces gaskets and has an important
manufacturing presence in the US.
Goetze made a profit before interest and tax last year of DM21m on a
turnover of DM887m. At the end of June, it had a workforce of 7,838,
including 5,643 in Germany. It has six plants in Germany and five in the US,
as well as plants in France and in Turkey.
Its profits have fallen sharply in the past three years with net income
declining from DM24.6m in 1989 to DM8.5m last year. Profits before interest
and tax have fallen from DM75m in 1989 to DM21m in 1991.
T&amp;N had a turnover of Pounds 1.36bn last year, which would have increased to
Pounds 1.71bn with the inclusion of the German group. The combined group
would have had sales in Germany of Pounds 234m last year compared with
Pounds 106m for T&amp;N alone.
The UK group said yesterday that Goetze had already embarked on radical
restructuring to improve profitability, including a reduction in the German
workforce of around 700.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N, said that Goetze was now
'trading approximately at break-even', but it was expected to bring
'material earnings benefits' once the restructuring was completed.
The DM250m purchase price will be payable in three instalments with DM90m
due on completion of the deal, DM90m a year later and DM70m after two years.
The acquisition, which needs the approval of T&amp;N shareholders and the
competition authorities in the UK, Germany, France and the US, is expected
to be completed by April.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Marsh &amp; McLennan buys Frizzell Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARSH &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, yesterday announced
the Pounds 107m acquisition of Frizzell Group, the Poole-based financial
services and insurance group.
The deal, Marsh's most significant expansion in the UK since it acquired CT
Bowring, the Lloyd's and London market insurance broker, in 1980, could pave
the way for an expansion of marketing of personal insurance through
'affinity' groups such as trades unions and leisure groups.
Frizzell and Marsh are market leaders in this field, which can yield
significant cost advantages over traditional distribution methods.
It will also yield a large profit for 3i, the venture capital company, which
has built up a 40.8 per cent stake in Frizzell since 1954. The Frizzell
family own a further 40 per cent of the company, with the balance held by
directors, staff and the company's pension fund. These shareholders will
retain ownership of Frizzell Insurance Brokers, but the rest of the group
will become part of Marsh.
At the core of the group, Frizzell Financial Services insures more than
500,000 individuals through organisations such as the Caravan Club, the
National Trust, the National Association of Local Government Officers, the
National Union of Teachers and Civil Service Motoring Association. Revenues
in 1991 were Pounds 66m.
The Marsh subsidiary, Seabury &amp; Smith, is the leading manager of insurance
programmes for affinity groups in North America and counts employees of
corporations such as Ford and Chrysler among its clients. Seabury 1991
revenues were about Dollars 150m (Pounds 96.7m).
Mr Colin Frizzell, chairman, said: 'We had reached a point in our history
where we needed to spend more capital on information systems. We needed to
re-engineer or update the whole of our business.'
Refurbishment of the company's offices in Poole, where most of the 1,450
employees work, will be a priority.
The link would allow Marsh to sell personal lines insurance products to
employees of companies with which CT Bowring does business.
Mr Claude Mercier of Seabury said that by combining with Frizzell his group
hoped to 'achieve savings. The secret of this business is to keep costs to a
minimum.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / A deal snatched from under the giant's nose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits, was quick to acknowledge
yesterday that, however compelling the logic of the proposed CCA snacks
deal, it required particularly deft selling to a stock market unnerved by
recent reverses in UB's fortunes, writes Guy de Jonquieres. 'We are well
aware that a strategic initiative at this time, when the performance of
other parts of the business isn't optimised, raises all kinds of questions
in the investment community,' he said.
Mr Nicoli and his colleagues were ready with two answers. First, UB was
making good progress in tackling the problems at Keebler, its US biscuits
and snacks subsidiary, which led to a 17 per cent fall in the group's
first-half profits.
Keebler's sales during the second half-year, which began in July, were up 8
per cent, it had regained half its lost market share and profits were on
course for a recovery.
The second answer was blunter. The CCA deal was an unrepeatable opportunity
to establish an Asian-Pacific bridgehead. 'The timing is entirely a matter
of availability - we had to take it now,' Mr Nicoli said.
UB has snatched CCA from under the nose of PepsiCo, the US soft drinks
company, with which it is engaged in a worldwide race for market share.
PepsiCo's annual snacks sales of almost Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) are about
four times greater than UB's. However, the CCA deal means UB can claim to be
bigger than its US rival in the two markets where growth is fastest - Asia
Pacific and Europe.
Valued at roughly 12 times CCA snack business's annual cash flow, the price
of the acquisition compares favourably with recent international food
industry deals. There is also a neat fit with UB's existing businesses.
The deal will strengthen UB's position in Italy and give it a plant in
Germany. CCA's scattered Asian businesses also complement UB's outposts in
China, Hong Kong and the Philippines.
The restricted overlap limits the scope for recouping the purchase price
through rationalisation. Profits growth will depend mainly on expanding
sales.
UB plans to restructure the management of its KP snacks division. CCA's
European operations will be merged with KP's continental businesses, while
management in Australia will take responsibility for all snacks operations
in the Asia-Pacific region. In the near-term, UB aims to increase volumes by
adding its existing products to CCA's range in Australia.
However, the full promise of the deal will be realised only if it unlocks
the potential of emerging Asian markets. Though some are growing rapidly,
all except Japan are still quite small.
According to Mr David Hearn, managing director of KP, the company's
near-term approach will be 'a question of planting seeds and waiting'. But
if UB is to maintain its early lead, it will need at some stage to make
substantial investments to develop these markets.
The company also faces a waiting game nearer home, particularly in Germany,
Europe's second largest snacks market after Britain, which is dominated by
Bahlsen and Convent, both privately owned companies.
For the foreseeable future UB is resigned to playing a marginal role in
Germany, but consoles itself with the thought that PepsiCo is in the same
position. 'Neither we nor PepsiCo will break into Germany without buying one
of the two local manufacturers,' says Mr Hearn. 'The play is to wait until
one of them becomes available.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Credit Lyonnais to take controlling stake in BfG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the aggressive French state-owned bank, yesterday won
agreement to take 50.1 per cent control of BfG Bank, Germany's sixth largest
private commercial bank, for DM1.42bn (Pounds 570m).
This is the climax of a five-year campaign by Credit Lyonnais to boost its
presence in Germany, the biggest gap in its international branch network.
BfG has 170 branches in western Germany against which Credit Lyonnais has
23.
The French bank will pump an initial DM740m of equity into undercapitalised
BfG. DM540m will be in cash and the remainder as shares in its German
subsidiary, Credit Lyonnais Deutschland.
This will give Credit Lyonnais an initial 26 per cent stake. It will buy the
24.1 per cent balance to obtain a majority in equal parts from BfG's
existing owners, Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the insurance
group, and BGAG, the German trades union holding company.
Credit Lyonnais, the latest in a long line of big French investors in
Germany, hoped to improve access to the German market through a partnership
with Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, but four years of talks
broke down last autumn.
AGF, the French state-owned insurer, asked Credit Lyonnais to consider
buying BfG early this year to help the insurance group consummate a separate
alliance with AMB.
The German insurer, looking for an exit from what had proved a costly
diversification into banking with formerly loss-making BfG, agreed terms
with AGF. Yesterday's deal completes a rare example of two French
state-owned groups helping each other in the German market.
BfG, which yesterday welcomed the deal, is restructuring. Its staff has been
cut from 7,000 to 5,200, allowing it to make a DM120m operating profit last
year, against a DM390m loss a year earlier.
Mr Alexis Wolkenstein, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Europe, said BfG
should be profitable this year, but this depended on provisions on BfG's
DM3.5bn of sovereign loans.
It set aside 50 per cent provisions for bad sovereign debt at the end of
last year, and this would rise to more than 70 per cent in the current year,
said Mr Wolkenstein.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Yeltsin would use special powers: Russian president ready to
govern by decree to maintain reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, told the UK parliament yesterday
that he would use extraordinary powers if necessary to prevent any attempt
by 'anti-reformist adventurers' to turn the country from the path of
democracy and market reform.
He labelled potential coup members as 'leftovers from the old Communist
party and government elite, militant nationalists, incompetent collective
farm bosses and political adventurers'.
Mr Yeltsin then dismissed them contemptuously as 'ghosts of the past,
playing to a theatre of shadows'.
Speaking from the Royal Gallery in the House of Lords, a privilege which
symbolised the high profile given to his visit, he promised members of both
houses of parliament 'if necessary, I'll use the emergency powers given to
me by the people'. These powers allow Mr Yeltsin to govern by decree.
His visit to Westminster followed the signing on Monday of a friendship
treaty, which promised to usher in a new era of close political, economic
and military co-operation.
Yesterday, after lunching with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, Mr Yeltsin
said she had accepted his invitation to visit Russia.
Extolling Westminster's centuries-old practice of democracy, Mr Yeltsin
described himself as the 'representative of one of the very youngest
democracies'. He told legislators: 'One of our central problems is how to
achieve a functioning balance between the legislative, executive and
judicial institutions'.
Russia was looking for solutions in a new constitution to replace the
amended Soviet constitution still in force, he added.
Echoing words which were once the trademark of Lady Thatcher, the former
prime minister, Mr Yeltsin told parliament that 'there is no alternative' to
the painful economic reforms being undertaken by the Russian government.
His words were directed beyond Westminster to domestic critics of the
Russian government's attempt to impose tough monetary restrictions on
loss-making state enterprises and military industries. They drew an angry
response from the speaker of the Russian parliament. 'Any talk about
presidential rule . . . should be condemned as a move which would lead to .
. . an anti-constitutional, anti-state coup,' Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, an
outspoken critic of Mr Yeltsin, said in an interview with Channel Four
television.
Early next month Mr Yeltsin and many of the reformist ministers he brought
to London face a critical session of the Congress of Peoples Deputies which
is expected to demand the resignation of reformers and a partial return to
central control over the economy.
Yesterday evening Mr Yeltsin flew to Budapest to start his first official
visit to Hungary.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Higher raw materials prices add to fears on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP JUMP in the price of imported raw materials, reflecting the
devaluation of sterling in mid-September, has raised the spectre of higher
inflation in the UK.
Official figures yesterday showed that the prices of raw materials and fuels
used by UK manufacturers rose to their highest level for two years in
October.
Input prices rose 2 per cent on September, which took the year-on-year rate
of increase also to 2 per cent.
Economists fear that the higher cost of raw materials will flow through to
retail price inflation. They warned that manufacturers would not be able to
absorb higher import costs indefinitely, and would have to raise prices.
'We are seeing the first stages of an inflationary pick-up,' said Mr Nigel
Richardson, economist at SG Warburg Securities.
Until September, input prices had generally eased since July last year. This
helped push manufacturing output prices - sometimes referred to as core
inflation - to their lowest levels since the 1960s. But since September 16,
the pound has fallen sharply, particularly against the dollar in which most
raw materials and fuels are priced.
The Central Statistical Office figures showed that hard-pressed
manufacturers have so far absorbed the higher costs of imports resulting
from the weaker pound, frightened that raising prices in the recession would
further reduce sales.
The price of manufactured goods leaving UK factories rose by only 0.1 per
cent last month, taking the annual rate of increase to 3.3 per cent,
compared with 3.4 per cent in the year to September.
'We can take some confidence from the output price series, but that is a
lagging indicator and in time it will start to rise,' Mr Richardson said.
The Treasury said improved unit labour cost performance should help ease
some of the upward pressure on producer prices that inevitably follows a
fall in the exchange rate.

FT  11 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Warburg's claim to merchant banking excellence suddenly looks a little
hollow. Some fall in first half profits was to be expected, given the
difficult market environment. What comes as a surprise is that the bank has
pulled out of German leasing at a cost of Pounds 12m, only three years after
it went in. Warburg now sheepishly admits that its original decision to
enter the business was mistaken. Similarly the loss of perhaps Pounds 10m in
the bond market upheavals of May and September seems uncharacteristically
careless for an institution of such professional pretension. Warburg's
problems go beyond the cycle.
One explanation may be that its UK market share has peaked, while it has
still not reached critical mass in the international arena. The bank denies
rumours it was ever talking to JP Morgan. But some international partnership
might be a good idea, since expanding internationally alone is either slow
if attempted organically or expensive if done by acquisition. If the
temptation is to take greater risks on its own account, as Warburg seems to
have done in both leasing and bonds, justifiable doubts about the quality of
its earnings can be raised.
Supporters would say Warburg's undeniably strong position in the UK market
gives it the flavour of a recovery stock. Mercury Asset Management is also a
strong performer, especially after adjusting its Pounds 35m profit for the
one-off Pounds 4m charge against Isosceles. But MAM's result only serves to
underline Warburg's own recent lack of achievement in investment banking.
Its shares may not easily recoup yesterday's 9 per cent fall.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marrying piston and piston ring manufacturers is clearly a growing business.
Carmakers look increasingly to component suppliers to spread the load of
development costs and the supply of whole assemblies certainly helps. From
that point of view, putting T&amp;N's piston expertise together with Goetze's
ring manufacturing makes sense. It should help get T&amp;N products specified
for German manufacturers such as VW, where the company has had little luck
in the past.
However, the timing of the deal is more questionable. T&amp;N's management is
buying into Germany at a time when the economy, and particularly the car
market, is turning down. True, Goetze has plenty of business outside
Germany, but the whole European car industry will remain weak throughout
1993. So it is not yet clear that T&amp;N is buying when German assets are at
their cheapest.
Even if that is the case, the deal means a further cash outflow. Granted,
the staged nature of the payments lessens its impact, but the company has in
recent years spent heavily on acquisitions, research and capital expenditure
and is currently paying an uncovered dividend. Interestingly, that dividend
is up for consideration in the spring at the same time as the first payment
is due to be made. T&amp;N has left the door open for a placing to fund the
first stage. If the dividend is maintained and prospects are good it could
get the issue away easily. Yet if poor earnings force a cut, the company
would find the placing difficult just when it most needed it.

One can well understand UB's satisfaction at successfully netting CCA.
Australia's number one snacks business was one of the few big prizes left in
global snacks. The price looks keen by comparison with other international
food deals under negotiation, in part because Pepsico could always be ruled
out of the bidding on competition grounds. UB can now claim market
leadership over its big North American rival both in Europe and the Asia
Pacific region.
None of this, though, is necessarily going to impress UB shares. For all the
grand talk of strategic expansion, the company is essentially buying a
well-managed Australian operation with a useful Italian add-on. The Pounds
200m purchase price should be put in the context of UB's Pounds 1.7bn market
capitalisation, while the acquired sales represent a mere 5 per cent of the
group's total. CCA's future will be volume rather than margin-driven, with
benefits from integrating existing UB products for the longer term.
The key to the shares, which have risen 45 per cent in the last two months,
remains the extent to which Keebler can be knocked back into shape. So far
the measures announced with the interims seem to be clawing back market
share, though Keebler's second half profits are likely to be as
disappointing as the first. The risk is that the 1993 bounce currently being
discounted by investors is to a large extent dependent on factors outside
UB's control.

FT  11 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Water softener
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's missive from the water regulator will add to his reputation as a
reasonable sort. Mr Ian Byatt is committed to medium-term regulation and
allowing water companies to keep the fruits of efficiency. That was just
what the market wanted to hear. Still, the document offers little to help
the market make even an educated guess at the outcome of the 1994 review.
The next fight will be over how to value the industry, from which
appropriate return on capital will be calculated.
This could still be anything from Pounds 11bn, which is the market
capitalisation of the sector once net debt is added back, up to Pounds
100bn, the replacement value of water assets. On the basis of last year's
figures, the industry's return on capital could be anywhere between 10 per
cent and 1 per cent depending which approach is used. Equally, the regulator
has still not indicated what levels of dividend growth and interest cover he
thinks are necessary for water companies to fund capital investment.
Anglian's interim results were a timely reminder that some companies are
more of a hostage to the regulator than others. With few interests outside
the regulated business and a capital expenditure programme weighted heavily
towards the second half of the decade, Anglian badly needs a favourable
pricing formula post-1995. On a favourable reading of yesterday's document,
though, the company may have got the measure of the regulator. Efficiency
and high standards of service in the core business will evidently be
rewarded. Whether the rewards will be enough to maintain dividend growth
remains an open question.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Heseltine placates industry with offer of partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday held out an
olive branch to UK industry by offering it a partnership with government.
Addressing the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry at
Harrogate, Mr Heseltine said: 'Such a partnership is essential if we are to
succeed in the world marketplace.' Anything else would be 'an abdication of
national self-interest'.
Mr Heseltine refused to disclose details of financial assistance to industry
ahead of Mr Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement tomorrow. He hinted, however,
that the chancellor would be announcing help for exporters through increased
export credits.
He also announced that Lord Sainsbury, retired chairman of J. Sainsbury, the
supermarket group, would act as his adviser on deregulation and the fight
against red tape. CBI delegates, who had been bitterly critical of the
government earlier in the conference, seemed broadly satisfied with the
speech.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said: 'I think the open season on
government should be closed.' Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said:
'What we heard today was what we hoped to hear. He clarified what he saw as
his role.'
Earlier, Mr Heseltine had heard a barrage of criticism of government from
conference speakers.
Mr Neil Ashley of Amey Holdings, the construction group, said: 'Any
government that spends Pounds 70bn a year on social and unemployment
spending and only Pounds 2bn on roads is not over-endowed with vision'.
Mr Norman Sussmann of the British Clothing Industry Association asked: 'Is
the U-turn on the miners the first sign that the government is beginning to
recognise the importance of manufacturing industry?'
Mr Heseltine said: 'I have never subscribed to the view that manufacturing
industry doesn't matter. We built this nation's economy on it. Our principal
competitors thrive on it.' He added: 'We need to build the impact of
industry across Whitehall. This is a cultural change.'
Mr Heseltine also urged delegates not to grant high wages. 'Wage settlements
continue at a level that cannot be afforded,' he said. 'The message that the
CBI has a central role in getting a grip on wages, including in the board
room, cannot be overstated.'
Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, welcomed the pledge to ensure that
industry's needs were appreciated in Whitehall. But the real proof of the
government's new approach would come with the Autumn Statement, which had to
preserve capital spending programmes and permit flexibility in public
financing.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Savings seen in new VAT collection system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWITCH at the start of next year to new European Community rules for
collecting valued added tax will cost British companies Pounds 100m,
according to Customs and Excise.
But once companies have adjusted to the changes, there should be overall net
annual savings of Pounds 135m, Customs said yesterday.
The analysis by Customs of the costs and benefits of the new VAT system,
which comes into effect on January 1, marks the first stage in a publicity
programme to make business aware of the changes. Business organisations and
companies of all sizes have expressed concerns at the costs and complexity
of the new rules.
The new system of collecting VAT and collating trade statistics is necessary
because of the creation of the European single market and the removal of
customs checks at ports and border posts. Companies will file their own VAT
data and trade statistics to customs.
Doubts were cast yesterday on Customs' calculations. Accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick said it had calculated the changeover costs at Pounds 200m. It
doubted whether Customs had taken into account all internal costs involved
in upgrading companies' systems.
The move from border controls will mean that between 7m and 8m import and
export documents will no longer need filling in, an end to delays in
obtaining customs clearance, and costly bank guarantees to cover deferred
VAT payments will no longer be necessary.

So Peter Cohen has come home, at last, to the company of bankers who love
and respect him.
There is indeed a certain sense of deja vu in the re-emergence of the former
Shearson Lehman chairman - who left the American Express group amid such
acrimony two years ago - to run Edmond Safra's new securities business.
Not only has Cohen been friends with Safra for more than two decades, he is
also an old chum of Jeffrey Keil, president of the Republic banking unit.
The two go back to Cogan, Berlin, Weill and Levin, the firm that merged with
Hayden Stone and was the precursor of Amex's Shearson Lehman Hutton. Keil
left in 1973 to join Republic, but they kept up a close business
relationship - with Cohen leaping to Republic in 1978, before changing his
mind a year later to return to Shearson. 'We never really stopped working
together,' said a dewey-eyed Cohen.

The fact that Sir Peter Abeles, the buccaneering Australian tycoon who
founded TNT, missed the group's annual meeting should not come as a total
surprise. He lives a highly pressured existence.
Sir Peter is expected to recover in about a week, but the episode bears out
suggestions that he exhausted himself by working much too hard on trying to
solve TNT's intractable problems over the past two years.
More surprising was the announcement that Abeles is not going to spend his
retirement, after all, helping to sort out the problems of Ansett, the
airline jointly-owned by TNT and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. TNT says
that Sir Peter had decided that Ansett's return to modest operating profits
in the latest quarter meant the airline could safely be left in the hands of
Ken Cowley, Murdoch's top man in Australia, who is joint chairman. A more
likely explanation is that Ansett's owners may be nervous about Sir Peter's
swashbuckling approach to the airline's problems.

At first sight, Lawrence Klein, the 72-year-old Nobel economics
prize-winner, would not seem the most obvious person to advise China on how
to reform its economy. After all, Klein, author of The Keynesian Revolution
and founder of Wharton Econometrics, has been associated with the sorts of
economic policy and instruments which have not been an unqualified success
in Western economies.
By contrast, China's private sector is booming and the economy is growing at
an annual rate of 10 per cent plus. Now might not seem the best time for the
powers-to-be to start tinkering with the sort of micro-economic management
that has failed elsewhere.
However, China is no stranger to stop-go economic policies and Klein, who
has made eight trips to the country, is no novice on the country's problems.
Even fast-growing countries have to manage their growth, especially if this
involves dismantling the complex structures of socialist bureaucracy.
Econometric modellers may be out of fashion, but few industrialised nations
dare dismantle their economic models, however flawed.

The CBI showed a curious logic when choosing the speakers for its annual
conference yesterday. In the debate on corporate governance, the chief
proponent of the CBI's case was Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson.
Hanson's contribution to corporate governance is uncertain; it is run by two
elderly peers, one of whom - Lord White - is not on the board at all.
There then followed a debate on excellence in manufacturing, entitled
'competing with the world's best'. One of the main speakers was Fisons'
boss, Cedric Scroggs. Fisons, it may be recalled, has had its profits
slaughtered this year because it cannot manufacture some of its drugs to the
standards required by the US health authorities.

Whatever their current difficulties, one should never underestimate the
British royal family's pulling power with foreign leaders. Take Boris
Yeltsin's lunch with the Queen yesterday. It was the highlight of the
ex-construction worker's first official visit to London.
'We sat next to each other for two hours, and all the time we talked as if
we had known each other for years,' said a delighted Yeltsin afterwards.
Meanwhile, the Queen's agreement in principle to make her first state visit
to Russia set the royal seal of approval on the new Russia, and its first
democratically elected leader. No date has been fixed but Yeltsin promised,
'We won't have to wait too long'.
The Queen's acceptance was a personal triumph for Yeltsin, who, in the now
officially dead Soviet past, used to be the communist party boss in
Sverdlovsk. This was the city, then called Ekaterinaburg, where the Czar and
several of the Queen's other relatives were executed on Lenin's secret
orders.
It was that deadly act which made it impossible for the Queen to accept an
earlier invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev who, for all the west's approval
of perestroika, was still head of the Communist party and leader of the
Soviet state.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: A decline that emphasises depth of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARRY PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although the UK construction industry has recently gained an unenviable
credit and failure record, builders' merchants have long records of being
well-established and financially sound. Sadly the current recession is
destroying this reputation.
The Builders Merchants Federation (BMF), whose members include the vast
majority of bona fide builders' merchants, with a combined turnover of over
Pounds 5bn, produces an annual comprehensive profits and costs report based
on members' individual returns. The latest report for the year ending March
1992 contains some very disturbing results.
Turnover, already in decline in the previous year, shows a further fall of
7.6 per cent, excluding inflation. The dire statistic, however, is that 35.2
per cent of all merchants lost money, and of these over half traded
predominantly in the south-east.
The decline continues and the next report is likely to show that losses will
be much greater and more widespread.
Many merchants are facing difficulties in spite of strenuous cost-cutting
and staff reductions. If the trend is not halted in the very near future,
many merchants will disappear and their vital role in the distribution
chain, plus the credit facilities they provide will be severely and
permanently diminished. This will be to the serious detriment of the
industry and the country as a whole.

chairman,
profits &amp; costs committee, Builders Merchants Federation,

FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: UK government must face question of whether to
'monetise' debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN BRAZIER MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Spending dilemmas' (November 9), refers to the
'substantial easing' of monetary policy since September 16. Yet that has
occurred against a background of a precipitous decline in the annual growth
of the Bundesbank's main measure of money (M3) in Britain to 3 per cent at
the end of September. Seasonally adjusted lending in that month actually
fell.
The most important question the chancellor must address in Thursday's Autumn
Statement is whether the government should 'monetise' at least part of its
deficit.
The truth is that there is not enough capital in Britain to raise next
year's likely PSBR without sucking up savings that are badly needed in the
private sector. Even if base rates were to be reduced, such borrowing would
lead to an upward twist in the yield curve.
Yet to cut total spending plans in the teeth of a deep and worsening
recession would hardly promote recovery, nor would tax increases.
The danger we face is not a resurgence of inflation but a credit implosion.
Even the difficulties of negative equity in domestic housing pale besides
Britain's growing acreage of empty commercial property, ticking away at the
heart of our banking system, against which it is secured.
Many economists will argue that, even under such circumstances, no
responsible government should print money, for that is what monetisation, by
whatever means, amounts to. Yet from fiscal 1987 to 1990, a cumulative
Pounds 27bn public sector surplus did nothing to dampen runaway monetary
growth, precisely because it was used to repay debt rather than 'sterilise'
money. The counterpart of the same problem applies today.
On Thursday an announcement is needed that the deficit will be at most
partly funded, so that interest rates, long and short, can be brought down
and kept down until the money supply is restored to health.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: Time for UK to grasp opportunity in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER KNOWLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your article, 'Welcome Mr Yeltsin' (November 9), no greater
commitment could be signalled to Russia than to provide it with a Dollars
1bn loan. To date, very little has emanated either from the private sector,
Export Credits Guarantee Department or NCM credit agency. Surely the time is
right to rectify our position and to compete with our apparently braver
German and American cousins who are currently providing trade finance.
British companies would be delighted to sell their goods and services into
such an enormous market. Both NCM and ECGD could provide the Dollars 1bn
facility, with repayments made in oil. The British government now has an
opportunity to prove its commitment to UK industry,

FT  11 NOV 92 / A risky farewell to the nanny state: Leyla Boulton assesses
the progress of Russia's privatisation programme and its chances of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's mass privatisation programme was recently described by Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais as the main reason for an alleged coup plot by
conservatives to unseat the government when parliament meets in three weeks.
The cabinet, fighting for its survival ahead of the Congress of People's
Deputies on December 1, has promised to consult factory directors on
privatisation and other economic reforms. President Boris Yeltsin has been
negotiating a compromise to protect the thrust of his reforms from a
conservative opposition which Mr Chubais, the programme's author, accuses of
seeking to 'destroy privatisation'.
Despite the political hyperbole embraced by both the government and its
opponents, the question is not whether privatisation, an essential component
of attempts to build a market economy in Russia, will proceed, but whether
it can deliver the results expected of it.
The process is under way around the country: from Murmansk in the far north,
where the country's biggest trawler fleet is being advised by the US
investment bank, Salomon Bros, to the Urals industrial heartland, where the
40-year-old director of one of the biggest heavy engineering plants,
Uralmash, is planning how to run a private company.
The government has set itself the ambitious target of privatising more than
5,000 medium and large-scale enterprises, or up to half the country's
industrial potential, next year.
It has three goals: to make the transition to a market economy irreversible
by creating a class of property owners; to make enterprises more efficient
and curb their demand for endless cheap credits from the state; and to stop
factory directors appropriating the choicest bits of the state-owned
economy.
Far from opposing the reform, many enterprises hope privatisatsiya will
bring liberation from a cumbersome state bureaucracy which demands a lot but
gives little. At a meeting with the government last month in Togliatti, home
to the Avtovaz plant which makes Lada cars, directors of the country's 60
biggest enterprises spelt out their grievances.
Mr Viktor Korovin, the head of Uralmash, said he would be unable to sell
shares to the public for another year and a half. First, the government had
to free enterprises from a heavy burden of social spending on maintaining
hospitals, housing, kindergartens and shops for workers. 'The government has
yet to discuss what it is going to do about non-productive assets which are
in fact a form of hidden taxation on my enterprise,' he said.
Until he can transfer social facilities from his balance sheet to municipal
authorities, which will need state subsidies to run them, he fears the
burden they represent will scare off foreign investors.
Many enterprise directors still hope, however, that privatisation will
provide a quick fix of foreign investment, technology and know-how - without
requiring sweeping changes to the way their enterprises operate, or ceding
control to other managers.
The Babayev chocolate factory in Moscow, nationalised by the Bolsheviks
seven decades ago, sees privatisation as a way of attracting foreign
investors so it can import cocoa beans and machinery which the cash-strapped
state can no longer supply.
The Murmansk Trawler Fleet wants the freedom to manage its own affairs, and
a foreign partner to help renew its fleet and market its fish. 'Before, the
state even ordered our ships for us without asking whether we wanted them,'
complains Mr Yuri Prutkov, the fleet's manager.
Babayev and the Murmansk fleet are among thousands of state-owned
enterprises being registered as joint-stock companies, which are able to
sell shares to the public. The danger facing many of them is that they might
swap the domination of the state for that of the workforce.
About two-thirds of enterprises, in elections strongly influenced by the
managers' personal preference, have chosen an option which allows staff to
buy 51 per cent of the stock. The benefit for the managers is that they are
less likely to be voted out of office by their own workers than by an
outside investor seeking to maximise profits regardless of the number of
jobs this costs.
Mr Prutkov denies this option will prevent restructuring, arguing that it
will simply make the process less painful.
'Everybody will understand that if we don't conduct this painful operation
ourselves, then the enterprise will collapse,' he says, eyeing a list of
obsolete ships, accounting for a third of his fleet, which he would like to
dispose of because they cost more to operate than the revenues they
generate.
He does not say how many jobs will have to go, but he claims that a hiring
freeze will be enough to achieve his target. With two out of five votes on
the board of the joint-stock company being created, he believes that he will
secure the freedom to manage the enterprise as he sees fit. The other three
votes will be held respectively by a representative of the workforce, the
local privatisation committee and the local council - a line-up specified in
a decree by President Yeltsin but one that can be altered to make way for
outside investors.
The success of the privatisation campaign, in which the government has been
distributing vouchers enabling each citizen to obtain Rbs10,000 worth of
shares, will also depend on the development of a market infrastructure -
such as an efficient banking system and a bankruptcy mechanism. In these
areas in particular, foreign advice is at least as important as foreign
capital. The closest thing to a securities market in Murmansk is a sullen,
undernourished teenager sitting in a supermarket, with a sign saying 'I buy
vouchers' pinned to his chest.
On the eve of the planned start in January of share sales, the country does
not yet have a securities law to regulate its fledgling stock exchanges, let
alone a system of enforcing existing regulations.
In an attempt to protect small shareholders, the government is encouraging
the establishment of some 2,000 investment funds, which will spread
investment risk across a broad portfolio of shares for citizens who buy into
the funds with their vouchers. Later this month, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development hopes to stage the first ever auction of
shares. It has also teamed up with Credit Commercial de France to organise a
model investment fund.
But recognising the danger of relying on share sales alone to create
property owners, the government has also decided to allow people to exchange
their vouchers for more tangible assets such as hairdresser shops, trucks
and cows.
Given the formidable obstacles, the tight targets set by the government may
seem unrealistic. The privatisation programme will deliver its goal of
creating a market economy but not in the timespan allotted for it. This is
because change happens slowly in bureaucratic Russia.
The most effective way of getting anything done is to demand more than it is
realistic to achieve. In that sense, privatisation has already started to be
a success.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: Boom and bust policy, not workers, to blame for
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM MCCARTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With all the integrity of a cabinet minister, you blast both trade
unions and employers for failing to recognise the need for investment and
profit increases, citing Ford as an example ('CBI obfuscation'). How short
the memory is.
Every pay and conditions settlement within Ford during the last decade was
related to rationalisation and productivity improvements. During the same
period Ford achieved record profits on more than one occasion. Additionally,
investment in plant and people was at an all-time high.
So why the economic downturn with no apparent relief in sight? Without a job
you cannot afford to buy a car. If you have a job, but fear for it, you will
be more than reluctant to buy a car, especially as most cars are purchased
through finance agreements that require employment stability. This situation
cannot be addressed by micro-adjustments. Rather, there is an urgent need
for the government to provide a macro-economic framework.
The UK has some of Europe's best-equipped factories and they are lying idle.
These factories have received investment and are capable of high
productivity but, without the consumer, they are like engines without fuel.
And the only fuel on offer at present is hot air.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('CBI obfuscation', November 10) ignores the scale of
Britain's economic crisis and the damage it has inflicted on the motor
industry.
Instead of identifying that the market for cars has been entirely undermined
by boom and bust economic policy, you lay the blame on industry and trade
unions. The fact is that demand has plummeted in the last two years,
reflected in the fall in car sales to a 10-year low.
The two excellent pay increases mentioned for Ford workers in recent years
were a direct result of the achievements of those employees in the 1980s.
Ford plants in Britain are now most efficient, with lower unit costs than
any comparative European plant. Should these productivity gains not be
rewarded? Trade unions are not in the business of martyring their membership
as and when government policy fails, but of defending and improving living
standards of working people. Car workers, supported by their trade unions,
refuse to shoulder the burden of government economic mismanagement.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: Liffe will retain edge over DTB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HARDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must disagree with the assertion by Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) that
its clearing facilities will give it a competitive edge over Liffe
('Competition between Liffe and DTB intensifies', November 5). This
certainly does not show in existing business where, as your article states,
Liffe has a 67 to 70 per cent share of the bond futures market and the DTB
only 30 to 33 per cent.
The London Clearing House (LCH) clears Liffe and the other London futures
exchanges. LCH's real-time clearing system and cross-market risk management
and banking systems allow it routinely to handle volumes many times larger
than the DTB's - over 1m contracts were cleared in one day in September.
The breadth of Liffe's European bond contracts, and the margin offsets LCH
provides between them, will be a major advantage for the new 'Bobl' contract
Liffe is introducing.

Sir, I refer to Dominic Lawson's article, 'Conservatives sell their
birthright' (November 7), concerning the Leasehold Enfranchisement Act. I am
surprised someone with his background should be taking the side of the
feudal landlords, unless it has something to do with social climbing.
Most likely there is no country left in Europe where this archaic system is
still in existence. I assume that the vast tracts of land still owned by a
few families were either appropriated or gifted by some long since
discredited king or ruler. This system of handing down ancestral
acquisitions is hardly equitable in these days where nothing else is handed
down.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Economic war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC POLICY must come first, says Mr Bill Clinton, the US
president-elect. To prove the point, he has promised to create an economic
security council on the model of the national security council. Since
economic insecurity can hardly be desirable, who could possibly object to
the idea? But things are not that simple. Mr Clinton may harbour the
dangerous notion that the US is engaged in economic warfare with 'enemies'
such as Japan and the European Community.
What the economic security council would do remains obscure. Mr Vernon
Jordan, chairman of his transition team, has said that Mr Clinton himself
intends to chair the new council. Since Mr Clinton has also said that he
will focus on the economy 'like a laser beam', the council is presumably
intended to ensure presidential leverage over economic policy, along with
greater co-ordination of its disparate elements.
So far, so harmless, though it should be noted that the proposed council may
not improve co-ordination. The tensions between the national security
adviser and the secretary of state in previous administrations need only be
recalled.
More worrying are the connotations of the title. It might mean a greater
focus on domestic problems. But it might also mean that Mr Clinton views
economic policy as a war fought by peaceful means. If so, the idea would be
more than wrong. It could prove dangerously wrong.
Economic intercourse among market economies is not war. The foreigners with
whom Americans do business are their customers and suppliers, as well as
their competitors. The Americans who are presumably to be mobilised for the
fray are one another's competitors, not just fellow citizens. Economic life
is far more complicated than suggested by the myths of economic
nationalists.
Nor can a people can be mobilised for economic war, as American troops were
mobilised for the desert. When Americans go to work, they do so for
themselves, not for their country. Moreover, foreigners are not responsible
for making the American savings rate the lowest among leading industrial
countries or for impairing their performance at school.
Pursuit of the goal of 'economic security' might, in fact, be used to
justify the search for foreign scapegoats. But nobody would gain from such a
strategy. Superior co-ordination of economic policy would be one thing; an
American ministry for mercantilism quite another. Clarification is urgently
needed from Mr Clinton.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Euro-gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTION of Mr Bill Clinton as president of the United States may go
down in economic folklore as the event which finally switched both the US
dollar and the US economy into recovery mode. Yet Mr Clinton should be wary
of reading the wrong message from the markets. It is the lack of leadership
in Europe that is largely responsible for this shift in sentiment.
The dollar has certainly staged an impressive recovery. Since its record low
of DM1.35 in August, the dollar has climbed by 21 pfennigs and by 11.5 per
cent on a trade-weighted basis. This explains why sterling has recently
looked weak against the dollar while remaining relatively stable against the
D-Mark.
A dollar rally had to come - the currency has been grossly under-valued
because of the low level of US interest rates compared with European rates.
But it is doubtful whether the markets can yet feel confident that a rise in
real returns on US investments is in the pipeline. Mr Clinton's election may
boost confidence, but there is precious little sign that a strong US
recovery is underway. A dollar-boosting rise in US interest rates looks
unlikely until Mr Alan Greenspan is confident that the US financial sector
is in better shape. Nor does Mr Clinton have much room for fiscal manoeuvre.
A large fiscal package could raise long-term interest rates while the
promise of action may postpone investment as companies wait for tax breaks
to arrive.
It is in Germany and Europe where events and economic prospects appear to
have taken a turn for the worse. A sharp cut in German and continental
European interest rates has been inevitable for some time: the unknown has
been whether they would come soon or very soon. The Bundesbank is still
talking tough while the federal government vacillates. But day by day, the
west German economy steps nearer to recession.
The recent dollar rally reflects a belief that the Bundesbank is running out
of time. But it is also a product of a growing sense of European political
malaise.
The UK economy is also paralysed by this stultifying and confidence-sapping
gloom. But the British chancellor of the exchequer, as he prepares to
deliver tomorrow his autumn financial statement, has one advantage over his
continental partners. UK interest rates can fall faster than Germany's. They
should do so. In the short term, the authorities should be ready to tolerate
a further fall against the D-Mark.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Too many eggs in one basket: British pension funds may be
too dependent on equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Britain's Pounds 350bn company pension funds seek to repair the damage to
confidence caused by the year-old Maxwell scandal, are they ignoring a much
bigger danger that may be creeping up on them almost unnoticed?
Leading pensions experts are now becoming worried that pension fund trustees
are not sufficiently alert to the dangers of the current economic climate.
'Unless the UK and the rest of the world make a sharp recovery from
recession, the risks are real and imminent,' according to Mr Tim Gardener, a
leading consulting actuary.
To an extraordinary extent pension funds are now dependent on the health of
equity markets, in which they have nearly 85 per cent of their assets
(roughly two-thirds in the UK and one-third abroad).
More specifically, pension funds are sensitive to the growth of the
dividends of British listed companies. During the 1980s these dividends rose
remarkably, averaging increases of 14 per cent a year during the second half
of the decade, and effectively generating the huge pension scheme surpluses
which have come to be seen as normal.
But this growth collapsed to 5 1/2 per cent last year and could be slightly
negative for 1992. City analysts talk comfortingly of a recovery to 5 per
cent growth next year. But some pensions actuaries wonder what might happen
should the recession extend and deepen in 1993, which is scarcely a remote
possibility as problems spread to continental Europe and the danger grows of
a transatlantic trade war.
Mr Gardener, who heads the investment side of Mercer Fraser, one of the top
three firms of pension fund actuaries and consultants, warns that the next
big pension scandal could be caused by 'the combined effect of optimistic
actuarial assumptions and an inappropriate asset strategy'.
Some of his fears are shared by Mr Stephen Gooch at a rival firm, Clay &amp;
Partners. 'Some actuaries have moved rather too optimistically in their
assumptions,' he says. 'The situation could turn in the wrong direction
quite quickly.'
The crisis, if there is one, will develop through the interplay of three
obscure and technical characteristics of the UK corporate pensions industry.
The use of special actuarial valuation methods could rebound in certain
circumstances.
Widespread reliance on median fund benchmarks (in plain English, this means
that fund managers copy each others' spread of assets) has driven funds to
an unprecedented dependence on risky equities. Many British company schemes
are now comparatively mature, which means that they have large and imminent
obligations to pay out pensions, but may be receiving a proportionately
small flow of contributions from members in employment and sponsoring
companies.
According to Mr Gardener, the typical actuary is now valuing the assets of
pension funds 10 to 25 per cent higher than market prices. This is because
share portfolios are valued on the basis of assumed income growth. These
methods have served British pension funds splendidly in the past; for
example, they sailed through the 1987 stock market crash without even
blinking, because dividend growth continued strongly all the while.
Such actuarial valuations have been conducted on the basis of what were
thought to be prudent projections of nominal dividend growth rates of about
4 1/2 to 5 per cent a year. Until quite recently these assumptions proved in
practice to be too cautious in the short run, and much higher actual income
growth has led to the appearance of so-called 'surpluses'.
These are not piles of cash but only the theoretical result of somewhat
arbitrary guesses and calculations about the future. However, there have
been very real struggles between companies and workforces over the
'ownership' of these flights of actuarial fancy.
There have also been real effects on corporate behaviour, because the
surpluses have encouraged companies to cut contributions (many are still
enjoying complete 'holidays') and thereby boost their profits and dividends.
'Actuaries have had it easy for 10 years,' says Mr Bryn Davies, an
independent actuary who advises trade unions and local authorities. At the
same time, 'finance directors have become addicted to pension fund holidays.
They have come to regard them as permanent.'
Mr Davies calculates a surplus index based upon movements in dividends and
employee earnings. Although somewhat theoretical, it clearly shows that
schemes coming up for their normal three-year valuations are facing steadily
worsening conditions.
In fact a virtuous circle developed in the late 1980s - rising dividends led
to pension scheme surpluses which in turn encouraged higher dividends and so
on.
A possible nightmare scenario for the 1990s is that this could be reversed
into a disastrous vicious spiral in which profits and dividends chase each
other downwards as companies are forced to raise their pension
contributions, first to 'normal' levels and then to crisis proportions.
A more immediate concern for some actuaries is that 'discontinuance'
valuations are beginning to cause problems. The test here does not concern
projections of income and expenditure into the distant future, but whether a
scheme has enough assets at market values to meet its liabilities in respect
of past service should it be wound up tomorrow. In times of mass
redundancies and company collapses, these are far from theoretical
considerations.
As interest rates fall it is becoming more expensive for wound-up schemes to
buy insurance policies which will guarantee future pensions. Actuaries say
that unless equity market values improve soon the number of technically
insolvent funds will increase sharply.
In fact the stock market has bounced back since Black Wednesday, but overall
growth in share prices for the year so far has been modest and overseas
markets have been disappointing too.
'The ethos that equities are the only assets for pension funds is
erroneous,' argues one leading manager, whose portfolios have a roughly 70
per cent equity content, against the typical 83 per cent. He would prefer a
still lower equity exposure, but considers that the risks of departing from
conventional wisdom would be too uncomfortable both for his firm and for his
clients,the boards of trustees.
The prevalent median benchmark - fund managers are given a target of beating
the performance of the typical pension fund - means that asset allocation is
backward-looking. Instead of selling overvalued asset classes and buying
cheaper ones, fund managers are locked into assets which have performed well
in previous years but which they cannot sell because any switches would take
them too far away from the benchmark.
Mr Richard Fitzalan Howard is in charge of UK pension fund asset allocation
at Robert Fleming, a leading City of London manager. He reports that nearly
three-quarters of his clients set a median benchmark.
'An increasing number of clients are adopting customised benchmarks suitable
for their profiles,' he says. 'But it is taking quite a long time for this
to sink in.'
The maturity factor could mean that any pensions funding crisis would be
more difficult to handle than the last one in the mid-1970s, when pension
schemes typically had few immediate liabilities but a great many
contributing members, and could make substantial improvements to their
solvency through relatively affordable increases in contribution rates.
As Mr Gooch of Clays puts it: 'The size of pension fund assets is five times
bigger in real terms than in the 1970s. The impact of unexpected investment
setbacks will therefore be five times greater.'
According to Mr Gardener it is not uncommon these days to find a fund where
more than 50 per cent of liabilities relate to pensions currently in
payment. It will need a lot of cash year by year to meet these obligations.
If dividends fall it could experience some difficulties.
He considers that, whereas pension funds are currently configured to protect
their assets against the long-term risk of inflation, they are wide open to
the short-term risk of economic recession. 'The guns are facing the wrong
way,' he says.
In fact pension schemes that are immature can continue to stick quite safely
with equities, almost whatever happens. In the very long run, history shows
that equities give the best return. If there are temporary problems with
dividend growth, the problem can be adequately covered by juggling the
actuarial assumptions and the contribution rates.
But for the majority of schemes there is now a strong argument for
diversifying their assets. Essentially this means buying bonds. There will
be no shortage: the British government will be selling large quantities of
gilt-edged bonds over the next few years, and overseas the US and German
governments will be issuing great volumes too.
Fund managers will have to be given different benchmarks, probably involving
minimum, higher, exposures to bonds. At present, the average fund has a bare
11 per cent in bonds and perhaps this should go up to, say, 25 per cent,
which is roughly what the funds had at the beginning of the 1980s, and
compares with about 35 per cent at present for US pension funds.
Yet this is much easier said than done. It could imply dumping Pounds 35bn
of UK equities, with disastrous consequences for prices. Ideally the shift
would be managed through cash flow, but the growing maturity of the funds
means that cash flow is barely positive. Pension funds have manoeuvred
themselves into a position where they own more than 30 per cent of UK
equities. They may be helplessly stuck.
But perhaps, after all, there is really no problem. Pension funds endured
Britain's two uncomfortable years in the European exchange rate mechanism,
when bonds significantly outperformed equities, but fund managers made no
strategic adjustments. Now they have emerged into an altogether more
familiar climate of devaluation and a dash for recovery.
Given an improvement in the economy and a modest upturn in dividend growth,
the actuaries, trustees and fund managers can relax and pursue their former
objectives with renewed confidence.
But what if the recovery deepens? Over-optimism could be punished. It may be
that the people in the middle of the next big pensions scandal, in which
thousands of pensioners will be denied their reasonable expectations, will
not be fat and fraudulent financiers but honest and reasonable pension
scheme trustees who thought that it was safe and proper to do more or less
what everybody else did but in the end were caught looking in completely the
wrong direction.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Anglo-German priorities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl is doing his best to scotch fears, entertained in
1989-90 in some British government quarters, that he could become a
hectoring leader of a dominant united Germany. For the moment, the Federal
Republic's main problem - manifested by Mr Kohl's indecisiveness on
financing German unity, on international deployment of the Bundeswehr, or on
handling refugee inflows - is not strength, but weakness.
Perceptions of Mr John Major have changed, too. The European strategy of the
man who has proclaimed Britain's place 'at the very heart of Europe' has
become ensnared in a tangle of domestic politics.
These leaders of one very important and one less important European country
meet in Oxfordshire today at a time when both governments appear bereft of
direction. In the comely surroundings of Ditchley Park, there is a risk that
hesitation will shake hands with irresolution, and vacillation will sit down
with equivocation. To avoid this outcome, Mr Kohl and Mr Major must
rediscover common purpose, and ignite the flame of joint action, for the
good of their countries and their continent.
Much is at stake. The first small waves of a potential transatlantic trade
war are washing towards European shores. Mr Kohl's instinctive desire to
forge ahead with European integration may be undimmed. But the realities -
in the economic, social and psychological sphere - of Germany's great
challenge over unification are making his country look inwards. Germany's
persistence in following fiscal policies which indirectly export
unemployment to other EC countries could hardly be less communautaire. If,
partly because of the effects of these policies, Germany enters recession
before Britain has departed from its own, the pressures of parochialism will
increase in both countries. The economic downturn across the whole of Europe
provides one powerful reason why the Maastricht ratification process is in
disarray. A much worse result is that the rich EC is not living up to its
duty to help stabilise the poor and fragmented countries of the former
communist bloc.
In the bilateral field, Mr Major has mended some Anglo-German fences broken
by his predecessor. But the failures of communication and understanding
between the British and German monetary authorities during the events
preceding sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism underscored
the limits of their co-operation.
In three areas, Britain and Germany can use today's meeting to make headway.
Mr Major should persuade Mr Kohl to bring maximum pressure to bear on
President Francois Mitterrand to find a solution to the oilseeds quarrel
which is threatening the Uruguay Round. The two countries' defence ministers
should strain every sinew to find a sensible compromise over the future of
the European Fighter Aircraft, based on the plan for large cost savings
outlined by the aerospace industry. On policies towards Europe, Mr Kohl must
make clear to Mr Major that one of Britain's main aims - enlarging the
Community northwards and eastwards - could be endangered by UK prevarication
over ratifying Maastricht.
The British government probably realises that Anglo-German relations will
never grow into a source of European strength unless London can
simultaneously improve the quality of its links with Paris. Nonetheless,
Bonn and London have a compelling interest in working out priorities for
moving Europe forward. These will always involve difficult choices. But if
bilateral summit meetings become no more than a forum for airing platitudes,
governments should save themselves the expense of organising them.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Personal View: How to help industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LORD TOMBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The phrase 'industrial strategy' means very different things to different
people. To many industrialists it means simply a recognition of the
importance of industry to the economic well-being of the nation, and a
determination to conduct government business in a way which encourages
industry in its task of wealth creation.
To the Labour party it has traditionally meant government intervention in
industrial matters, often with undesirable results stemming from the lack of
familiarity of politicians and civil servants with the issues, but also from
the party's distrust of the activities of industrial management. This
distrust has stemmed in part from Labour's close relationship with the trade
unions but also from a belief that industrialists do not generally act in
the best interests of the nation. The more realistic attitude of the trade
unions in recent years has yet to influence the attitudes of Labour
politicians in a constructive way.
Be that as it may, Labour governments have usually had positive industrial
strategies, although sometimes interventionist and ill-conceived.
By contrast, Conservative governments have generally avoided any form of
industrial strategy, preferring to rely on market forces and the 'invisible
hand' of competition.
The Conservative party regards itself as the natural party of industry, and
many of its regulatory initiatives on labour law have been helpful. But in
general its policies have been dogma-based, and have contributed little of a
positive nature to the industrial base.
Indeed, ideological measures have sometimes been pursued in a way that has
harmed industry. Recent examples have been the attempt to maintain a fixed
exchange rate within the ERM at enormous cost in terms of employment,
bankruptcies and industrial capacity, and the precipitate way in which the
electricity supply industry was privatised with no regard to the need for an
energy policy which market forces are incapable of managing. The recent
ill-conceived pit-closure proposals were the inevitable result.
Happily, the traumatic events which led up to and followed the withdrawal of
the pound from the ERM may have induced a change of heart and a recognition
that governments are elected to serve the interests of the electors rather
than to pursue ideological ends.
But there is no evidence that the cabinet has come fully to terms with a
long-term strategy directed towards industrial prosperity. The simile which
seems best to describe recent economic measures is that of ministers playing
Monopoly in a locked room, with a secret rule book, while wearing ear muffs.
An industrial strategy need not demand vast disbursement of public funds on
pet projects - although it must be noted that such programmes as Alvey,
which spent Pounds 350m on fostering industry/university collaboration in
information technology, could qualify for the description of misguided and
expensive government intervention.
I would like to see the government make a commitment to an industrial
strategy which would go some way to closing the gap with overseas
competitors. This could begin with the following measures:
Subject every government measure - legislative, fiscal or regulatory - to
the question: 'Will this do anything for British industry?' If the answer is
negative or neutral the proposal should be reformulated to derive maximum
benefit.
Examine the ways in which government policies hamper British industry in
international markets. Export credit insurance premiums, for example, are
often three or four times as expensive as those in competitor countries. The
government claims that such measures distort the perfect market and other
nations should follow our example of theoretical purity. Well, they don't
and they won't, and in the meantime British industry is rendered
uncompetitive.
Start an intensive programme to convince politicians and civil servants of
the importance of industry. The educational background and tradition of
those groups will make the task a difficult one, but we should take heart
from the way the diplomatic service, with similar handicaps, has transformed
itself over the past 20 years. The support now available from overseas
missions to industry equals and often surpasses that available to
competitors. A vital factor in this transformation has been the linking of
career prospects with commercial postings and experience. Similar determined
action is needed in the wider civil service.
Make the DTI an important department with a heavyweight minister staying in
the post for the life of the parliament. And concentrate more of the general
management role of government in the DTI rather than, as at present, in the
dead hands of the Treasury.
Such measures would do much to restore the international competitiveness of
British industry and help correct the long-standing indifference of the
present government to the wealth-creating sector on which, ultimately, all
other activities depend. The author retired last month as chairman of
Rolls-Royce.

There is more than meets the eye to BBC2's second series of Troubleshooter
in which Sir John Harvey-Jones, former head of ICI, bustles around the
country acting as a one-man think tank for British business. This is saying
quite a lot since a good deal smacks you right in the eye. Last night in the
opening programme of the new batch of six, Sir John went back to the
companies he visited in his first series to see what had happened since. It
seems that Morgan cars, which most viewers remember best, did not relish
another meeting, so Sir John was reduced to a chat with one of the
distributors. This suggested that little had changed: production has risen
10 per cent (now they are building 11 cars a week]) but the customer waiting
list is still years.
This item, like those involving the former boss of Tri-ang toys, the family
which owns Copella apple juice (to Sir John's horror they have bought it
back), and the Churchill pottery firm, suggested that British industrialists
may lack the killer instinct when it comes to international business. Over
and over again we heard about people being happy, enjoying themselves,
trying to maintain contentment among the workforce. Plainly Sir John
believes that in the modern world the British must compete and succeed
internationally or die. Yet among many of those he visits the unspoken
sub-text - and this is where there is more than meets the eye, or ear, since
no one says this out loud - seems to be that if the price of international
success is for the British to acquire the national characteristics of the
Germans or the Japanese, perhaps we should forget it.
What is so remarkable about the Troubleshooter programmes is that they are
still out on their own. Given the significance attached to the recession,
the Gatt talks, unemployment, the EC and so on, you might have expected
television to be awash with programmes about the nuts and bolts of industry.
Instead Troubleshooter is virtually unique. Its great strength is that
although the subject matter is factual and serious the programmes, thanks
largely to the attractive personality of Sir John, are not only informative
but highly entertaining. Next week's, about the Double 2 shirt business, is
an eye-opener: the company appears to have a fortune tied up in bolts of
cloth, and to make countless designs. Why, then, are the British incapable
of matching American outfitters by offering three sleeve lengths in every
collar size, so that shirts actually fit? Annoyingly Sir John never asks.
Yet another programme, this time C4's Dispatches, has been proselytising the
'causal connection' theory which assumes that because rapists and child sex
abusers often look at magazines and videos depicting pornographic violence,
the magazines and videos are causing the violence. It would not concern me
greatly if they removed every example of violent pornography from the
shelves tomorrow since I find such images chilling and unpleasant. But the
notion that these things are 'causing' rapists to rape and abusers to abuse
seems batty, given mankind's long history of violence before the invention
of the glossy magazine and the videocassette.
Cordon bleu cooks often have lots of cookery books on their shelves but you
would not attribute their enthusiasm to the presence of the books; the
presence of the books obviously results from the enthusiasm. Ban the books
and the cooks would still cook. Engine drivers read magazines about trains
but would you conclude that the magazines caused the choice of career, or
that the job and the possession of the magazines stem from the same
predisposition? Millions of people buy train magazines and never drive a
train, just as millions buy violent pornography and never rape or abuse. Of
course those predisposed to rape or abuse will probably enjoy looking at
pictures of what they like, but that is not a causal connection.
The misconception is important because it sends programmes such as
Dispatches up blind alleys. So long as programmes and viewers are worrying
about the outward symbol - the magazine or videocassette - they are
overlooking the true cause inside men's heads, or within our social
arrangements. And how do I explain the success of commercials if magazines
and videos don't 'sell' pornographic violence? By the same argument: all
successful commercials appeal to a predisposition, whether to have clean
clothes or to get drunk.
There is a decided tendency to apologise for liking The Borrowers, BBC1's
new Sunday teatime serial. We are told that people do not watch television
in family groups any more, that this classic children's story cannot
possibly appeal to a generation raised on Nintendo and The Simpsons, that it
is all terribly twee and middle class and old fashioned, that the sheer
style of the thing cannot compete in a world of yoof graphics and house
music, that children no longer like being told stories, but only playing
computer games. Twaddle. Eat my shorts. The Borrowers is well wicked.
Anybody of any age who has a modicum of imagination and a taste for
narrative will adore it. Thanks to their quality of participation, computer
games may be addictive, but they are also mindless.
The Borrowers does what good fiction has always done: lifts you out of
yourself and transports you to another world, this time under the
floorboards of a country house where the seven-inch people live. As with any
good fiction you have to do some of the work, and that makes it all the more
enjoyable. Traditional entertainments such as pantomime, detective stories
and opera are more popular than ever, not less: why should Sunday teatime
serials be any different? Since this one has Ian Holm and Penelope Wilton as
the Borrower parents you would have to be mad to miss it.
News programmes get so set in their ways that the tiniest change looks, from
the inside, like violent revolution. But what ITN considers 'the biggest
revamp in the history of News At 10' may look like pretty small beer to the
viewer. The camera angle on Big Ben at the beginning is different, there are
lots of monitors behind the news reader's head, and Trevor McDonald presents
the first half on his own. Gosh. The really significant change on Monday was
the introduction of current affairs in the second half in place of news.
Poor Julia Somerville, reduced to a 'Hand-you-over' role, announced a report
on negative value mortgages and handed us over to Julian Manyon, late of
This Week, who then presented a mini version of This Week on the hard hit of
Huntingdon. With the threatened disappearance of current affairs in peak
hours once the new ITV franchises come into effect in January, this slot may
begin to look very valuable, but it is a questionable idea for those who
prefer their news programmes full of news. And what is news? In any daily
medium it should surely be the difference between the world yesterday and
the world today.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: Zeffirelli's 'Six Characters' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Franco Zeffirelli's production of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of
an Author is on a grand scale, which is how it should be. There is a huge
background of squares and rectangles taken from Mondrian, at times
strikingly illuminated. The music, while never obtrusive, is frequent and
varied. Above all, Zeffirelli has more than fulfilled Pirandello's direction
to include a lot of extras in the cast of actors. They add to the
excitability when everybody talks at once; they enhance the stillness when
almost everyone is quiet. There are some marvellous stage groupings.
None of which is to suggest that the production puts style ahead of
substance. Six Characters is far too good a play for that to be possible.
Rather the infusion of the style makes the play even better. I have always
been a Pirandello advocate. This performance should demonstrate beyond doubt
that Six Characters is one of the 20th-century masterpieces.
Zeffirelli has made one notable change from the original text. Instead of
having the actors initially rehearsing one Pirandello's earlier plays, The
Rules of the Game, he has substituted his last, The Giants of the Mountain,
by which time the master was past his best. The switch probably means more
to an Italian than to a British audience. It doesn't seem to me to matter
much either way.
For the rest, however, this is the essential Pirandello who raises questions
about illusion and reality, the difference between real life and what
happens on the stage and where the two shade into each other. Where Six
Characters excels is in drawing in the audience. The producer of the play in
rehearsal, and of the play in embryo, often directs from the front of the
stalls. Producer, actors and the family of six characters who come in from
the cold to tell their own story frequently stop to consult and argue with
each other. Six Characters is an inquiry into the nature, and limits, of
theatre.
The brilliance of the team playing in Zeffirelli's production by no means
prevents star performances. Benedetta Buccellato as the step-daughter is
unforgettable. She is not conventionally beautiful, but there is a style and
pride to her presence. Although she can suddenly flash a leg, drop a
garment, or let fly a torrent of abuse, she is sometimes even more
impressive when completely still.
Giorgia O'Brien has only about five minutes on stage as the dressmaker and
brothel-keeper, but she uses them to perfection, never trying to do too
much. Sergio Basile as the producer who is present throughout demonstrates a
superb Italian seriousness: a readiness to pick up what is new, learn from
it and refine it.
Such open-mindedness extends to the entire cast. Some of the best scenes are
when the actors are watching the characters and acknowledging that the
outsiders have something to teach. The scene where the father (Enrico Maria
Salerno) goes to the brothel and begins the formalities with the girl who
turns out to be his step-daughter is a dramatic gem. So is the way it is
then redone by the actors. Note the change in the accompanying music.
One complaint. The Italians seem to regard an interval as an excuse for a
siesta. It lasted a good 30 minutes. The production, sponsored by Olivetti
UK Ltd, is in Italian, but Pirandello can be almost as good in English.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: A Month in the Country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why Turgenev's A Month in the Country is not given here more often is a
mystery. Frederick Ashton's one-act ballet version has been a staple of
Covent Garden repertory since 1936, and deservedly so - but Turgenev's
five-act original is more marvellous yet. We have seen Lynn Seymour, Natalia
Makarova, Antoinette Sibley, Altynai Asylmuratova and others dance Natalia
Petrovna - but why have not Vanessa Redgrave or Maggie Smith acted her?
Natalia is a sophisticated 29-year-old wife who discovers love for the first
time in the person of her son's tutor, Beliaev, a 21-year-old student. She
is a quasi-comic Phaedra - torn between duty and erotic impulse, twice
caught in a compromising position with the wrong man.
This 'wrong man' - her 30-year-old devoted admirer, Rakitin - is the play's
most original character of all, an intelligent, honourable but ultimately
forceless man who embodies the effete chivalry of the old gentry. The many
conflicting loves and affections are interwoven with an acute social sense.
Isaiah Berlin has written that the play 'seems to me more radical in tone,
to contain more social protest, than any play by Ostrovsky or Chekhov, for
all the explicit social content of their dramatic works.' And the plot is
surrounded by a wealth of naturalistic detail that reflects Turgenev's
mastery of fiction and places A Month in the Country between Chekhov and
Balzac.
The new Watford staging, directed by John Dove, rattles through the play
with great ease. Few of its deeper psychological and social undercurrents
become apparent; several of the pointers to characterisation in the text
have not yet been realised. This is not a staging that brings new light on
the play and too much has been cut or surpressed to ensure that it lasts
just two hours and a half. Yet it proceeds so fluently that it holds its
audience. And its rapid fluctuation of mood and emotion is absorbing.
Emily Morgan is a febrile and volatile Natalia who really does seem 29 years
old. There is more constant conflict within the role than she yet shows; she
does not catch the qualities of laziness, basic good sense or sophistication
that the play's characters credit her with. But she is always so natural in
all she does do that you hang gratefully on her every line. A pity that John
McMurray - though his three sets are simple and elegant - has attired her in
near-dowdy costumes. Jonathan Coy, though too old to convince as a
30-year-old, catches the futility of Rakitin; but not his exquisite irony,
or the way his silence should dominate the final interview with Natalia's
husband. As the doctor, Shpigelsky - the play's third great role - Philip
Witchurch has the right unconventional cynicism (though without the brusque
joviality with which, in 1975-76, Timothy West made this character so
astonishing).
The most complete performance is that of Kate Byers as Vera. She has not yet
caught all the despair Vera feels on resigning Beliaev, she is wonderfully
artless and transparent; and the way she suddenly grows up is both startling
and convincing. Joe Duttine is ideally fresh and simple as Beliaev and the
way that David Sibley underlines Islayev's jealousy is the most original
feature of this staging.

Italian novelist Primo Levi was a member of that relatively small band of
people who were sent to Auschwitz by the Nazis and survived to bear witness
to the world. The terrible thing is that, 40 years after the event, he was
still so appalled by what he had seen and by the belief that it could, all
too easily, happen again that he killed himself. Primo Levi: The Memory Of
The Offence (8.10 BBC2) tells the story of his life using his own prose and
poetry and the memories of his friends.
Dispatches (9.00 C4) provides another unflattering story about the Germans,
this time during the cold war. It seems that East Germans wishing to escape
to the West but not wanting to risk the guns of the border guards could pay
Wolfgang Vogel. His fixer role appears to have been accepted in both East
and West Germany, but his deals meant that escapers often lost their houses
or spent considerable periods in prison.
Fatal Attraction (9.00 ITV) is one of those movies which achieved huge
success largely via a campaign of vilification. Feminists took exception to
the portrayal of a woman, during an affair, as predatory and hysterical.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: Messiaen's final 'Illuminations': Max Loppert attends
this posthumous premiere by the New York Philharmonic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first three performances of Olivier Messiaen's Eclairs sur l'au-dela . .
. were given last weekend, on three successive evenings. They formed the
first big 'special event' on the New York Philharmonic's 1992-93 schedule,
which has as its purpose a season-long celebration of the orchestra's 150
years of existence.
The composer died last April, aged 83. The premiere was, therefore,
posthumous - but it was not at all solemn. Instead, the occasion was
gripping and exhilarating throughout its course, by turns awesome and
exuberant in sound-quality and invention - continuously uplifting, indeed,
even to a non-believer in the Catholic faith that directly inspired all of
this composer's music.
Eleven movements and 70 minutes long, Eclairs sur l'au-dela . . . was
composed for a 128-strong orchestra, typically rich in percussion but
untypically lacking the solo piano and ondes Martenot, those Messiaen
hallmarks. The title can be translated as 'Illuminations of the Beyond . .
.'; in the formidably copious and detailed programme notes written for the
New York Philharmonic by Yvonne Loriod, the composer's widow and
pianist-muse, the work is described as a 'set of meditations on the Beyond .
. . In this work we find . . . the inward peace of the mystic, the
anticipation of his repose in the luminous tenderness of God'.
Before conducting it, Zubin Mehta, the orchestra's immediate past music
director (and instigator of the commission), told the audience of a letter
from Messiaen in which there was explained something of his vision of the
spiritual life after physical death, and of his conviction that he would
finally achieve an 'understanding of the invisible'.
From all this it is clear that, having completed the work only last year,
not long before his death, Messiaen consciously intended it as a 'final
statement'. Anticipatory thoughts of death are inevitably connected with
final thoughts of life; and musically the work seems to range across the
entire span of Messiaen's compositional creativity.
All the preoccupations are there: primarily, bird-song captured in music as
a celebration of faith; but also the chord-colours, the 'architectural'
approach to orchestral-writing and to formal construction, the devices of
repetition, block-building and superimposition used to create the illusion
of vast tracts of space and time suspended in sound; the oriental influences
on rhythm and texture; the sudden rapturous sweetness of melody in which
love, human as well as divine, is hymned (here in the fifth movement,
'Demeurer dans l'Amour', for strings).
As this might suggest, Eclairs sur l'au-dela brings to mind a large number
of previous Messiaen works - sometimes closely. In the already-mentioned
fifth movement, the opera St Francois is invoked. In the seventh ('Les Sept
Anges aux sept trompettes'), so are the mighty graded gong and tam-tam
climaxes of Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum. The ninth movement,
'Plusieurs Oiseaux des arbres de vie', displays its 'many birds' (25 in all,
from across the world) singing independently in woodwind voices above
triangle trills, in an ecstatic whirl that gloriously recalls, and
subtilises, almost every previous avian inspiration in the Messiaen
orchestral canon.
This might suggest, in turn, that Eclairs de l'au-dela is a tapestry of
self-quotation rather than an original composition. The effect is the
converse, the impression rather of radiant self-renewal. Once again, the
forging of a distinctively personal, coherent, and communicative musical
language - a musical 'whole world' - out of such disparate and (to this
particular non-Catholic listener) often unsympathetic elements comes to seem
one of our century's most monumental artistic achievements. There is
newness: it lies in the final-statement economy that marks every note, that
ordains the exact internal balance of parts, the pithy brevity of most of
the movements, the luminous spareness of so much of the scoring.
I heard the first and second performances. Neither was ideal. Though New
York has hosted its share of notable Messiaen events - Des Canyons, the
previous orchestral work, had its premiere here, in 1974 - a degree of
audience restlessness (particularly during the second performance) hinted at
an absence of familiarity with the Messiaen sound and substance. The Avery
Fisher Hall lacks the necessary acoustical resonance, and lends an unwelcome
edge to wind sound. (The Albert Hall should prove ideal: is a Prom
performance already planned?)
Mehta, though obviously a Messiaen devotee, had not rehearsed the score to a
state of complete Messiaen virtuosity. Radiance was missing from the string
tone, noble sonorousness from the brass; sections were not bound into
cohesive movements - indeed, patches of untidy ensemble led one to wonder
whether the players were still tethered at the stage of nervous
beat-counting.
And withal, it was a privilege to be there. Eclairs sur l'au-dela . . .
seems in its totality to sum up everything that made Messiaen not just the
dominant figure of French music in the 20th-century, but one of the original
voices, the vital forces, of all 20th-century music.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Management: Life's little headaches - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If life often seems to be the sort of headache which literally translates
itself into a pain in the head, the first step is to identify whether you
are being plagued by migraine, cluster or tension headaches.
For migraine sufferers, 60-70 per cent of whom are women and many of whom
have inherited their condition, onset is normally between the ages of 13 and
40. Intense, one-sided attacks of throbbing pain, associated with nausea,
vomiting, aversion to light and lack of appetite, can last anywhere from
four to 24 hours.
The cause of migraine is vascular - in other words, it is not caused by the
brain itself but by dilation of the cerebral vessels. Unlike other kinds of
headache, migraines generally worsen with physical exercise.
Before resorting to drugs you may want to try eliminating cured cheeses and
red wine from your diet - effective in up to 30 per cent of cases. You may
also want to try limiting your intake of chocolate, alcohol, highly
processed foods, as well as foods containing monosodium glutamate. Other
measures might include discontinuing the Pill, giving up smoking and using
stress management techniques.
The second type, cluster headaches, may be made up of a series of headaches
over weeks or months. Typically, the sufferer may experience very severe
headaches, usually localised around or behind the eye, lasting between 20
minutes and three hours. They nearly always occur on the same side of the
head within a series, and their cause, like migraine, is thought to be of
vascular origin. Up to 10 per cent of cluster headache sufferers develop a
chronic variety of attacks which endure for a year or more. Because of the
short duration of cluster headaches, standard analgesics may not be
suitable.
The third variety is the tension headache. During an episode of acute
stress, when adrenalin is percolating through your system, severe and
prolonged muscle contraction creates a band-like pressure sensation, like
wearing a hat that is too small. Associated symptoms may include
irritability, decreased sex drive and cravings for sweets. Solution for this
variety include: exercise, biofeedback, psychotherapy, nutritional
purification and relaxation.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Management: Time for a check-up - Perks / Rising medical
costs mean companies are taking a second look at private health insurance.
Continuing a series, Alan Pike looks at how policies are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Bupa can benefit almost every body in business, declares a newspaper
advertisement currently being run by Britain's largest private health care
group.
It depicts employees of a restaurant, publisher and construction, transport,
marine engineering and computer companies whose employers provide private
health benefits. All look in excellent health. This must be a terrific
relief to Bupa, because Britain's medical insurers are struggling to control
claims.
Rising private medical costs are a problem not only for health insurers but,
of course, for the customers who feel the effects in higher premiums. Often
these customers are not individuals but companies; many began offering
private medical insurance as a benefit to employees in far better business
circumstances than they now find themselves.
Insurers, aware that cost pressures in the recession are inevitably leading
to companies reconsidering every item of non-essential expenditure, are
stepping up efforts to project private health provision as an important
ingredient in all-round business efficiency, rather than a fringe perk. The
Bupa advertising campaign stresses this, declaring that healthier and
better-motivated staff equate to 'fewer days lost through illness, easier
work scheduling and increased profitability'.
Laing &amp; Buisson, the healthcare publisher and research organisation,
produced figures last month showing that there were 3.2m subscribers to
medical insurance in December 1991, in schemes covering 6.5m people or 11.4
per cent of the population. This was a drop of 0.6 per cent on the previous
year - a tiny fall but the first-ever since the 1970s.
The number of these subscribers in company schemes - 1.9m at December 1991 -
fell by 3 per cent over the same period. In view of the extent of the
recession, however, this drop is again a modest one and can be explained by
redundancies and company closures, rather than a more widespread abandonment
of health provision by employers.
The figures give the private health sector grounds for hoping that, if cost
containment can be improved, it may not lose too many corporate subscribers
as a result of the recession.
Company-provided schemes - some completely funded by employers, others with
a contribution from staff - were the fastest growing sector of private
medical insurance throughout the 1980s. They are also the most competitive
sector of the market - companies are more likely than private subscribers to
shop around and change insurers, a process being increased by a rising
number of brokers and other specialists entering the market.
The conventional image of health insurance as a benefit for senior staff
remains broadly accurate. Although some companies offer cover to all
employees, surveys show that private health insurance subscribers are still
overwhelmingly in the professional and managerial categories.
The tendency for companies to shop around and change insurers has kept the
corporate sector of health insurance more price competitive than the
individual one. Managers are also taking far more interest in what they get
for their money.
One effect of this can be to trade down to more restrictive policies.
Another - which is being encouraged by the insurers - is for corporate
clients to become involved in managed care arrangements.
Private Patients Plan (PPP), the second-biggest insurer, has pioneered this
approach with Pilkington, in its medical insurance scheme for 1,600 managers
and their families. Under managed care schemes, treatment takes place
whenever possible at a preferred-provider hospital - in the Pilkington case
the Fairfield in St Helens.
This guarantees the hospital a substantial volume of work, and gives the
insurer managing the scheme greater bargaining power over arrangements and
charges. It can, for example, ensure that, whenever possible, treatment is
carried out by cost-effective day surgery techniques rather than involving
unnecessary in-patient stays.
'The key to managed care is that we receive pre-notification that a patient
requires treatment,' says Wendy Brewer, manager of PPP's managed care
programmes. 'This means we are able to plan in advance to ensure that
treatment is provided in the most efficient way. It is the reverse of a
conventional insurance claim, where we have to start complaining after the
patient has left hospital if we are unhappy.'
Brewer says costs have gone down in each of the two years that the
Pilkington scheme, introduced in 1990, has operated. But a similar number of
cases have been treated and the company's managers are covered for the same
list of conditions as before.
Private medical fees are currently under investigation by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Brewer says the attitude of doctors at St Helen's
towards managed care has moved from one of initial suspicion to describing
the arrangements as 'not unreasonable'.
With the need to control costs the most important issue facing the private
medical sector, schemes of this sort are likely to grow. A consequence is
that managers in companies will need to take an increasingly active interest
in the precise health cover they provide, choosing from a growing range of
options.
Insurance is not, however, the only health provision that a company can make
for its employees. Some offer a range of occupational health and monitoring
facilities: workplace health promotion campaigns are likely to become a more
familiar feature with the introduction of the government's Health of the
Nation strategy to raise national health standards.
The Coronary Prevention Group is this month launching a big Heart and
Workplace Health Programme for 10,000 London Underground employees at all
levels of seniority. They will undergo a 45-minute series of tests, leading
to individual counselling and advice on healthy eating, smoking, exercise
and coping with stress.
Employers introducing this type of programme are undoubtedly serving the
national interest - Britain, with one of the world's worst coronary heart
attack death rates, lost more than 51m working days through heart disease
last year.
Health promotion specialists say such schemes can also serve companies'
interests. While medical insurance offers cover that many employees never
use, high-profile health promotion exercises involving an entire workforce
have immediate, visible impact and can bring swift benefits in goodwill and
improved morale.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: A brighter shade of green -
George Graham asks whether the Clinton-Gore team can protect both US jobs
and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the long months of the US presidential campaign, voters and observers
have been exposed to two sides of the environmental politics of Governor
Bill Clinton.
On one side stands the governor of Arkansas, who has made enough of an
effort to preserve the rivers and forests of his state to win the
endorsement of a number of environmentalist groups, but whose record on the
environment is by no means perfectly green - who has, in fact, consistently
shown a tendency to compromise with industry over questions of pollution.
On the other stands the candidate who selected as his vice-presidential
running mate Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, a leader in the Senate on
environmental questions and the painter, in his bestselling book 'Earth in
the Balance,' of an almost apocalyptic portrait of the consequences of
global warming, the degradation of the environment and untamed population
growth.
Now that Clinton is president-elect, due to take office in a little over two
months, many are now wondering which side will dominate in his
administration.
During the campaign, Clinton largely deferred on environmental questions to
his partner.
Their Republican opponents had initially planned to concentrate on
Arkansas's spotty environmental record and on the soiled waters of the White
River, polluted by wastes from the chicken farms that are the state's
economic base. Instead, they launched an attack on Gore as an environmental
extremist.
The attack was led by Vice-president Dan Quayle, who helped sell a good many
extra copies of his rival's book to those who rushed to check his slightly
stretched claim, made in the televised vice-presidential debate, that page
304 of 'Earth in the Balance' advocated a Dollars 100bn-a-year Global
Marshall Plan to safeguard the environment in third world countries.
But President George Bush joined in with a will, dubbing Gore 'the Ozone
Man' in his regular speeches on the campaign stump. Central to the attack
was the view that Gore, and by implication Clinton, were willing to
sacrifice jobs - be they in the timber industry of the Pacific northwest, by
protecting the habitat of the northern spotted owl, or in the automotive
plants of Michigan and Ohio, by demanding that carmakers increase the
average fuel efficiency of their cars from 27.5 to 40 miles per gallon - in
the interests of the environment.
Clinton, during his years in office, often compromised on environmental
issues in favour of jobs. Some Arkansas observers claim that one of the
formative events of his political life was a battle against Georgia-Pacific,
a big forestry products company, in his first term as governor.
The fight helped cost him re-election, and even his allies say that when he
won back the governorship two years later, he was a chastened and more
pragmatic politician.
And while Arkansas's environmental record is clearly not all bad, Clinton
took the opportunity of Earth Day in April to promise a greener approach in
the future.
'I've made the choice from time to time for jobs, because my state was a
poor one, without either enough jobs or enough federal help to clean up the
environment. But over the years, as I have worked in this area, I have come
to learn something that Bush and his advisers still don't understand: I've
come to reject the false choice between economic growth and environmental
protection,' he said.
It is widely believed that Gore, when he takes over the vice-presidency,
will assume general responsibility in the environmental area, but he has
muted some of his views during the campaign; indeed, he himself has in the
past put jobs before the environment, voting against the controversial
preservation of the snail darter, a small fish threatened by dam
construction in his native Tennessee.
Even a vice-president with less involvement in environmental policy would
help bring about a considerable change in the US, for Quayle has taken an
activist approach towards blocking and delaying the implementation of new
environmental regulations, especially those implementing the Clean Air Act,
that he believes damage US business competitivity.
If the new Clinton administration were simply to leave the Environmental
Protection Agency under the command of William Reilly, who was appointed by
Bush, the result would probably be a much more constrictive set of
regulations than Quayle has allowed through.
Among those who have been mentioned as possible replacements for Reilly are
Madeline Kunin, former governor of Vermont, Carol Browner, Florida's
environment secretary, Thomas Jorling, New York's conservation commissioner,
and Fred Krupp, director of the Environmental Defence Fund.
The first effects of the 1990 Clean Air Act became evident last week when
new, cleaner-burning petrol, blended with oxygenates, became compulsory in
39 metropolitan areas, in an effort to reduce levels of carbon monoxide,
especially concentrated in the winter. The new blended fuels cost more per
gallon, and yield lower mileage.
The EPA published a flurry of new clean air regulations in the week before
the election, covering nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-burning utilities,
pollutants from steel industry coke ovens, tests on car exhausts and an
innovative system to allow companies to sell their pollution rights if they
make faster progress in cutting their emissions than the law requires.
Many of these regulations are still subject to public comment and
alteration, leaving time and leeway for a Clinton administration to make its
own amendments. But even under the supervision of Gore, few expect the new
administration to seek a draconian toughening of the requirements, at a time
when its top priority is to put into effect some kind of job creation
package.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Water resources drying up in
EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth in the European Community will become constrained or made
much more expensive by lack of fresh water, according to a report* released
today by the European Commission.
The shortages will be most pronounced in Mediterranean countries, but
industrial and agricultural contamination of ground water could also lead to
constraints in northern European countries if present patterns of use are
maintained, it concludes.
The study of water resources, prepared for the European Commission's
Science, Research and Development directorate by Ecotec, a Birmingham-based
consultancy, gets its first public airing at a conference on EC industrial
and environmental policy today in Manchester. Its usefulness is that it
focuses on the quantity of water in Europe, where recent debate - and EC
directives - has focused on its quality. It provides a reminder that EC
countries will have to invest considerable sums just to keep water flowing,
before they begin to foot the bill for complying with new directives.
Lack of fresh water - water from the natural water system of lakes, rivers
and aquifers (water-bearing rocks or soil) - tends to be a local problem.
'Each year an average of more than 7,000 cubic metres per capita enters the
rivers and aquifers. It does not always arrive where and when it is needed,'
says the report.
Even when it does, between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of it leaks from
delivery pipes or evaporates, according to the study. Around 50 per cent of
water taken for irrigation is lost before it reaches the field. The result
is that the average cost of water in Europe - Ecu 0.66 per cubic metre - is
between two and three times the costs in the US and Japan. European costs
could rise further as countries comply to a greater degree with EC
directives.
The report identifies two groups of regions at risk. Metropolitan France,
Belgium, Netherlands and south-eastern England could face shortages because
of high population density and industrial development despite considerable
rainfall and plentiful large rivers. Portugal, southern and central Spain
and Italy, Greece and the Mediterranean islands might also have problems
because rainfall is low at the times of year when the demand from
agriculture and tourism is high.
The main weakness of the report is the same one that affects most studies of
water standards in Europe: the absence of reliable and comprehensive data on
pollution levels. The European Commission has so far not collated data on
whether its member countries are complying with its directive. Instead, the
report offers anecdotal evidence to argue that pollution from pesticides and
nitrates is a problem in all EC countries.
It argues too that water shortages will worsen as supplies are already
scarcest in the regions where demand for water is growing fastest,
particularly in Spain and Portugal.
The inevitable, costly solution for those areas facing future shortages is
investment in technology to reduce leakages, reuse industrial water and
clean wastewater.
The authors of the report believe the need for this investment offers a huge
opportunity for water treatment companies.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Bicycles speed up the pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cost and conviction are boosting the bicycle beyond the automobile as the
world's preferred mode of transportation, according to a recent study by the
Worldwatch Institute, an environmental think-tank.
Although there have always been more bikes than cars, 20 years ago it was
universally assumed that the automobile would surpass the bike as the
preferred vehicle. Between 1950 and 1969, world car output rose from 8m
vehicles to 23m.
Car companies prepared for large increases in production in North America,
Europe and the developing countries. But oil price hikes and mushrooming car
prices hit the car industry hard. Auto output in 1991 - 35m - was only
slightly greater than the 31m produced in 1979.
Bicycle production, 25m in 1969, surged with the environmental movement and
doubled by 1973. The economic reforms in China pushed demand for bikes ever
higher. Production increased there from 7m in 1976 to 40m by 1987. Last
year, world bicycle output was nearly 100m.
Lester Brown and Ed Ayres, authors of the study, urge more investment in
bike paths and improvement in bicycle accessories. Densely populated
industrial countries, like Japan and the Netherlands, have pioneered
bike-rail commuting arrangements. Japan has built vertical bicycle parking
facilities three-four stories high.
Traffic congestion has led to growing use of bikes in both developing and
industrialised nations. Messenger services use bikes through urban streets,
as do fast-food companies. In the US, more than 100 police departments have
bicycle squads. City officials, doing routine inspections or supervising
public services, use bikes to reduce costs.
'Historically, bicycling has suffered from unfriendly streets and has not
benefited from public initiatives nearly to the extent it might have,' the
report said. 'Where initiatives have occurred, bicycles have thrived.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Heseltine calls for new partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, on the last day of
the Confederation of British Industry's conference yesterday brushed aside
fears over his pledge to intervene in industry and called for a new
partnership to rebuild Britain's industrial base.
After listening to criticisms from delegates about the effect of government
policies on business, Mr Heseltine told the conference that the debate on
the real meaning of any partnership between the government and industry was
sterile. The only important factor was that any new climate of understanding
between the two sides produced positive results.
Avoiding comment on the detail of tomorrow's Autumn Statement, he stressed
that it would set in place the government's policies for stimulating
economic growth. The recession, he said, meant Britain needed clear, stable
policies, and not the 'quick fix' or short-term measures which had failed in
the past.
His responsibility, he told the conference, was to promote long-term,
effective assistance to business and he intended to ensure it was provided.
His ambition was to provide a business support network that was the best in
the world.
Mr Heseltine told a still-sceptical audience that the promotion of
industrial competitiveness was at the heart of the government's industrial
policy. He added: 'We need to build up the impact of industry across
Whitehall. That can only be done if we know what we are talking about. We
need facts, not assertions. We need to know what is happening in the
marketplace.'
Mr Heseltine said he had asked Mr Walter Eltis, his chief economic adviser,
to ask large companies for their views on the economy, adding: 'If such
information can inform or alert government then we should have it
available'.
Calling for tight control on industrial costs, Mr Heseltine said that wage
settlements at recent levels could not be afforded. Pay rises had
consistently run ahead of inflation, and the government and business had an
obligation to ensure that excessive pay rises were stopped to help Britain's
international competitiveness.
Speaking in the industrial policy debate, Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive
of Fisons, the pharmaceutical group, said: 'The much talked-of economic
recovery of manufacturing in the 1980s did not happen'. He feared another
large slice of manufacturing industry would be 'just wiped away in the early
1990s'.
Mr David Fyfe of Hickson International Fine Chemicals warned that British
industry could not be world-class unless it attracted some of the best
brains. Mr Keith Dutton of Medway Packaging said that although the UK was
the most patriotic of nations this patriotism did not extend to the purchase
of domestic products. 'UK customers are willing to switch to foreign
suppliers for a very small price advantage.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Conservatives given a rough ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST remarkable aspect of this year's CBI conference was the degree of
hostility levelled at a Tory government.
This was not a question of mere rhetoric from the CBI's leadership. The most
bitter criticism of the government came from the rank and file.
Yesterday's keynote speech by Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, was
interrupted four times by applause from the floor. One occasion was an
attack on the European Commission's inability to deliver a Gatt agreement.
The others were jokes at the expense of Mr Lamont, Mr Heseltine and the
government's conduct in the Matrix Churchill affair.
The chief target, besides the luckless chancellor, was the Treasury. Speaker
after speaker from the floor attacked the Treasury for incompetence and
inaccuracy in its forecasts. One suggested that just as Mrs Thatcher had
made her mark by taking on the trade unions, Mr Major might do the same by
sacking the Treasury.
In a more surprising reversal of conventional attitudes, there was support
for the plight of the miners. Mr Heseltine, one speaker said, had declared
his support for the Nottingham miners only weeks before the pit closures
were announced. 'With friends like that,' the speaker concluded, 'you must
know your enemy'.
There was applause for a delegate who savaged the government for 'setting
the miner an impossible target, having him meet it and then firing him when
he comes back above ground'.
The only target to rival the government in unpopularity was France. 'The
European Community', a delegate declared, 'is a creation of the French for
the French, run by the French'.
But it was to the UK government that the conference kept returning. The
underlying problem was succinctly put by Sir Peter Walters, chairman of
Midland Bank, on Monday.
He said surveys showed confidence among UK business people was low. 'But it
is not confidence in their own ability that is lacking. What is missing is
their confidence in any semblance of a coherent government economic policy
that addresses their needs.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Cadbury warns on boardroom best practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE BY companies to adopt standards of best practice in the boardroom
threatened to invoke increasing pressure for statutory regulation, Sir
Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the committee on corporate governance, said.
Sir Adrian warned that the drive towards improved standards of financial
reporting and accountability in the boardroom was not going to fade when the
economy picked up. He added: 'Hard times have had a part to play in putting
the matter on the public agenda, but the basic issue is one of trust.'
Sir Adrian said the committee's proposals were aimed at raising the level of
confidence in the way companies are run. He emphasised that if companies did
not take action themselves, 'others who understand business less well and
are more doctrinaire in their approach will surely do so'.
He said the CBI's agenda for industrial recovery stressed the need to
develop a more effective partnership between investors and industry,
supported by clear communication. That partnership required trust and
confidence in the way companies are run.
The draft report calls for boards to comply with a code of best practice and
for listed companies to include in their annual accounts a statement on the
extent of their compliance. Other recommendations include the creation of
separate audit committees and a strong, independent element on every board
of directors.
But Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, the conglomerate, and
chairman of the CBI's companies committee, spelled out a list of
reservations to the Cadbury proposals.
He said the CBI objected to the proposed Stock Exchange listing obligation
because it made a code of practice less capable of flexible change and
interpretation. The ultimate sanction of de-listing represented a draconian
measure and would prevent shareholders from selling shares.
Mr Michael Harding of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, queried whether
self-regulation could ever be strong enough to ensure high standards of
boardroom behaviour. He said 'the present regime of self-regulation by
discreet bodies with little or no contact with each other' was failing to
meet public expectations.

<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made some business
people marginally happier yesterday. As the conference centre emptied and
executives hastened to see whether their order books had slimmed over the
last two days, some stopped to chat about his message to industry.
'He said it very well,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands
Electricity. 'Almost prime ministerial, what he said about government
policy,' observed Mr Jeremy Woolridge, chairman of BE Wedge, Black Country
galvanisers.
Mr Chris Pennington, chairman of ABB Power, heavy electrical engineers in
Telford, Shropshire, said: 'We had no negative signals which would have
taken us further back.' Mr Woolridge added: 'We always had high
expect-ations. Now we want it to be shown in evidence.'
Mr Heseltine, of course, was constrained by the imminence of the Autumn
Statement. Still, said Mr Pennington, 'He tried to give pretty clear
indications - on export credits and that sort of thing'.
Mr Bill Good, chief executive of Sterling Tubes of Walsall, said: 'I'm
pleased with his attitude. The conviction is there. It's probably rhetoric
at the moment, but that's the first step.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Davies outlines recovery strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY is unlikely to be driven by a boost in consumer spending. It will
come rather from a revival of investment and an increase in exports, Mr
Howard Davies, CBI director-general, told the conference yesterday.
He drew together the elements of the policy package expected by employers
from the government.
'The argument for a new, more coherent strategy has been won. The need now
is to help the government to decide what to put in it,' said Mr Davies, who
called for:
A loosening of monetary conditions to speed the process of readjusting
personal balance sheets and reducing overhanging debt. 'We would like to see
one and preferably two points' off interest rates, he said.
Progress in creating a new framework of anti-inflation policy, meaning work
towards 'a more independent Bank of England'.
The green light for 'some talismanic projects' such as the extension to
London Underground's Jubilee Line as part of the government's undertaking to
protect capital programmes as far as possible in tomorrow's Autumn
Statement.
Tighter control of public-sector current expenditure, including a freeze on
the government's pay bill.
Hard thought from the government on investment allowances, capital gains tax
and the uniform business rate to help revive investment.
A commitment from the Department of Trade and Industry to make its support
for business 'as favourable, as positive and as excellent as those of the
best of our competitor countries'.
Mr Davies said the UK's economic strategy should be based on free trade, the
single market, low inflation, stable financial conditions and sound public
finances.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EC HARRIS has been made project manager for two City Challenge schemes in
Liverpool worth Pounds 22m.
The firm has been appointed client representative for the Liverpool
Institute for Performing Arts, one of the most high profile City Challenge
projects, which has the backing of Paul McCartney among others.
The Pounds 15m scheme is based around the redevelopment of Paul McCartney's
old school, which is 165 years old and has been empty for seven years.
The school will be devoted towards training for the entertainment industry
which will will include those who wish to specialise as performers. It will
accommodate 500 full time students and 2,000 part time students and is due
to open in September 1995.
Architects are being selected through a competition and will be appointed
shortly.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Office development in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHAL ASSOCIATES INC has started work on its eighth project in Japan, the
56-storey Rinku Gate North Tower, on the coastline of Osaka Bay.
Costing USDollars 439m (Pounds 290.7m), the 1.2m sq ft office tower will be
ready for occupation in September 1996. The podium will be constructed in
steel reinforced concrete and the tower itself will utilise a steel frame
clad in granite panels and aluminium curtain walling.
The tower is planned as the focal point of Rinku Town, a new urban
development being constructed on the coast at Osaka Bay, opposite the island
site of the new Kansai International Airport, where Schal Associates is also
constructing the control tower and administration building.
Construction of the tower is being undertaken by a joint venture team led by
the Japanese contractor Obayashi. Schal Associates is the only foreign
company in this team.
Founded in 1976, Schal Associates is a world leader in construction services
and currently one of Chicago's largest construction services companies. It
is also a subsidiary of the New York-based Bovis Inc, the US construction
arm of the P&amp;O Group.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Hospital projects won by LG Mouchel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LG MOUCHEL &amp; PARTNERS has been appointed to engineer two large hospitals in
the south of England.
Mouchel's Bath office has been appointed by the West Dorset General
Hospital's NHS Trust to undertake the civil and structural engineering on
the second phase of the Dorchester General Hospital.
Phase 2 of the hospital development will provide 350 additional beds in 15
wards and includes five operating theatres and facilities for other
specialist functions. The design of the Pounds 28.6m development started in
July and invitations to tender will be sent out in April 1994. Construction
is due to begin in November 1994 and should be completed by October 1997.
South West Thames Regional Health Authority has appointed Baker Martin
Mouchel, the firm's Southampton office, as the structural engineer to
develop and refurbish St Richards Hospital in Chichester.
The hospital has grown up over the last 40 years and the intention is that
the present facilities should be rationalised and that a sound basis should
be provided for future development of the site.
The appointment will therefore involve major refurbishment of some of the
buildings, the building of extensions to others and the construction of new
facilities. Roads and car parking facilities on site will be upgraded and
extended.
The project will be divided into a number of phases, the second of which is
the construction of a new nucleus hospital. The whole development is
expected to be completed in July 1997 at a cost of Pounds 28m.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major optimistic on Gatt outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW agreement on the further liberalisation of world trade should be
concluded 'in a matter of weeks at the outside,' Mr John Major, the prime
minister, told the Commons yesterday.
He reaffirmed that as holder of the presidency of the European Community,
Britain was pressing for the early re-opening of the Gatt (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations.
Mr Major said he hoped the EC and the US would quickly resolve their farm
trade dispute and the remaining aspects of the so-called Uruguay round ought
to be speedily determined.
In a clear reference to the difficulties caused by France he insisted that a
Gatt agreement was the first priority for international economies and 'no
persons, no single country should be permitted to stand in the way of it'.
Sir Peter Hordern, Tory MP for Horsham, urged the prime minister to ensure
that the drive for an agreement was not frustrated by Mr Mitterrand, the
French president, or Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission.
The prime minister acknowledged that the consequences of failure to conclude
a new Gatt round were 'too profound to contemplate'.
He stressed: 'I cannot myself accept that it is impossible to reach an
agreement that will be acceptable to the EC and the US, and that the moment
agreement is reached the Gatt round can be concluded in Geneva without
further delay'.
The prime minister refused to be drawn on whether an increase in national
insurance contributions will feature in the Autumn Statement.
Mr Tom Cox, Labour MP for Tooting, said such an increase would be 'another
broken election promise from an already totally disgraced and devalued prime
minister'.

FT  11 NOV 92 / People: Jim Tilson joins Arcon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor/Senator Richard Conroy, academic, politician, entrepreneur and the
man in the centre of an unprecedented Irish corporate saga this year, is
giving up more of his power at the natural resources company he founded.
Arcon International Resources, which until recently was called Conroy
Petroleum, has recruited Jim Tilson as chief operating officer. He will join
Arcon in the new year and has been set the task of bringing the company's
zinc-lead project at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, into development. Arcon hopes
it will be Ireland's first big base metals mine in 20 years' time.
Tilson, who is in his mid-50s, is a Northern Irishman with a wealth of
international mining experience. Conroy says he was chosen partly because of
his experience in managing the start-up of a Falconbridge nickel mine in
Manitoba, Canada.
In his student days at the Camborne School of Mines, Tilson was the winner
of the mining prize. Since early 1990 he has been manager, production and
technical services, to Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources, where he has been responsible for a substantial increase in gold
production.
At Arcon he will join a number of new directors, including Tony O'Reilly
junior, 25, recently brought back from the US to become the company's
executive director - planning and corporate development.
All this follows the bizarre events which saw Conroy and other directors
thrown off the board after he had upset two big shareholders by buying one
of Tony O'Reilly senior's oil companies. O'Reilly, Ireland's best-known
businessman, subsequently increased his stake to take his shareholding in
Arcon to 24.45 per cent and Conroy was reinstated.
Observers suggest that O'Reilly is hobbling Conroy, who previously ran the
company in autocratic style, by installing an executive committee to which
Conroy, still chairman and chief executive, has to report. But Conroy laughs
this off. 'As the company grows we need a professional structure and we are
putting in some strong people. I'm very happy with it.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / People: Draper bows out of Virgin Music
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Draper, Richard Branson's second cousin by marriage and the musical
ears of the Virgin Music Group, is leaving to pursue other interests -
chiefly classic car collecting and historic motor racing.
'I knew the day it was sold that I would go. I have never worked for anyone
else,' says 42-year-old Draper, whose discovery of Mike Oldfield's Tubular
Bells put the Virgin label on the map. Earlier this year, Thorn EMI paid
Pounds 510m for the group, which in 20 years grew into the world's fifth
largest record company.
Draper says that, while he ran the company for a decade until 1988, he had
gradually delegated more of the day-to-day operations to Ken Berry, though
he had retained the title of chairman until the takeover.
Indeed, he claims to have been keener on selling out than was his cousin. 'I
become disenchanted with the business two years ago.' Since he arrived from
university in South Africa in 1970 to join Virgin part-time, Draper says he
had seen the whole cycle of a company's growth and that 'enough was enough'.
After the Thorn EMI deal, he had 'chosen' the title of principal A&amp;R adviser
and stayed on because he was 'genuinely not sure' what would happen; he will
now leave when Thorn will let him go.
For the moment he will indulge his love of classic cars, and race with his
'great friend' Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. He says he fails to be
inspired by a lot of today's music, but that he may in time make a comeback.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Councils to suffer squeeze on
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's limits on local authority spending for next year will be
even more tightly drawn than the 'capping' regime operating this year.
The criteria for limiting council budgets will be set out in a statement by
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, towards the end of the month,
and will intensify the squeeze on local spending, as part of the
government's determination to keep council tax bills from rising too
steeply.
For spending in 1992-93, the regime put in place by the Department of the
Environment is based on both what had been spent in 1991-92 and the standard
spending assessment (SSA) - what the government thought the councils should
be spending in 1992-93.
That system will remain, but the percentage increases allowed will be
reduced.
The government's argument is that with a lower inflation rate expected for
1993-94 than for 1992-93, councils have less need to increase spending.
There is also ministerial concern that in the current year, even with the
strictness of the existing capping regime, actual local spending looks
likely to exceed the government limits of Pounds 41.8bn for England by just
over Pounds 1bn.
The transfer of further education spending away from local authorities to a
new funding council will make the capping arrangements particularly
difficult this year.
Councils who were spending less on further education than the government
estimate of what they needed to spend will find their budgets adjusted to
take account of what the government had assumed they should be spending
rather than what they actually spent. This could mean that they have to make
cuts in other services.
Local authorities are already insisting that they will need a government
grant to take account of the impact on their 1993-94 spending of pay deals
for groups such as the police which have already been agreed.
The local authority associations estimate that such pay deals will cost them
Pounds 228m in 1993-94, regardless of the public sector pay squeeze to be
announced tomorrow in the Autumn Statement.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster talks reach uncertain end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN six months of talks on Northern Ireland's political future ended
last night with the aspirations of unionists and nationalists far apart and
a last-minute failure to agree even an outline of areas of common agreement.
Negotiations broke up in Belfast with a joint statement saying there had
been no 'comprehensive accommodation in relation to the deep-seated and
long-standing problems'.
Nor was there a 'heads-of-agreement' document as hoped for last week by Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. He will make a statement to
MPs today.
Although the talks could restart next year, the collapse is a further blow
for British and Irish hopes that negotiations could bring movement after two
decades of failed political initiatives.
Possible straws of hope are the historic ground that was broken - notably
Ulster Unionists negotiating with Irish ministers in Dublin - and the fact
that channels of communication have been established and some mutual
suspicious broken.
Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, said: 'We will persevere
in our efforts to achieve progress through informal consultations.' Mr John
Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
said that for the first time ever there had been serious discussions on all
sides.
Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia who acted as
independent chairman, said the talks objectives were still 'achievable'.
Against that is the last minute procedural squabbling, apparently triggered
by the calling of a general election in the Irish republic, that delayed the
final plenary from Friday until yesterday.
But the costs in terms of discouraging investment in the province, and the
possible encouragement the latest setback might have given to those who
believe a solution requires resorting to violence, are incalculable.
Security forces believe the IRA is still potent. Loyalist paramilitaries
remain active.
The talks, which began in earnest in April after a brief session before the
UK general election, suggest a consensus is elusive. The circumstances were
propitious. Time was not a problem and media attention was scant. But, as
one Dublin official, admited, 'we have only recently begun to scratch at the
surface of the issues'.
Three areas were covered:
Government in the province. Unionists favour an elected Northern Ireland
assembly with powers devolved from Westminster. The SDLP want a system of
'commissioners' that would give nationalists a direct input into decision
making.
Relations between north and south. Unionists favoured consultative bodies;
the SDLP wanted them to have executive powers.
Replacements for the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Unionists wanted a more
loose deal, The SDLP and the Irish government wanted only a pact that could
'transcend' the original.
The most public arguments were over the Irish constitutional claim over the
north. The Democratic Unionist party wanted the articles withdrawn
unilaterally and has refused to talk in Dublin until they were.
Dublin, in turn, only said it 'could' - not 'would' - hold a referendum to
change its constitution.
The general election in Ireland has created a good excuse for a pause for
reflection. Unionists hope the opposition Fine Gael party will lead a new
coalition, since it is more amenable to immediate concessions on articles
two and three.
But the unionists should not expect to achieve that without some
reciprocity. And all sides have yet to show they can strike a deal.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Murdoch MacLennan, managing director of Associated Newspapers' main printing
operation, Harms-worth Quays, is to be the new managing director of the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail.
Apart from running the Scottish titles of Mirror Group Newspapers,
MacLennan, who is 43, will also be responsible for all MGN's printing
operations, and was yesterday appointed to the main board.
This appointment heralds the departure of Vic Horwood after 30 years with
the Mirror group. Two weeks ago Horwood was replaced as chief executive of
MGN by David Montgomery, former editor of Today, but remained chairman of
the Scottish Daily Record.
His departure further reduces the number of senior Mirror executives
surviving from Robert Maxwell era. Last week Alan Stephens resigned from his
position as company secretary. In June, Ernest Burrington stepped down as
MGN chairman and was replaced by Sir Robert Clark.
Speaking of Horwood's devotion to MGN, Sir Robert said: 'His special
contribution since Maxwell's death has helped MGN over a traumatic period.'
Mirror Group Newspapers also announced the appointment of James McColgan,
who recently retired as chief executive of Blue Circle Industries, as a
non-executive director.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Move to ease fears over coal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will try to ease the uncertainty over British Coal's new coal
contracts by stating whether it would be willing to see them concluded
before the results of its energy policy review are known.
The electricity industry is trying to pull together a five-year deal with
British Coal. But several companies are unwilling to commit themselves to a
deal while the review is in progress.
Although British Coal is negotiating with the power generators, these need
to secure long-term supply deals with the distribution companies in England
and Wales before the whole package can be agreed.
The government will make its view known in a Commons written answer from Mr
Tim Eggar, the energy minister, in the next few days. Talks on the contracts
must progress so that new terms can be in place by next April. But they must
leave room to accommodate extra coal deliveries if this is the effect of the
new policy, which will not become known until the new year.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, said yesterday that
National Power was looking into the possibility of signing long-term deals
with individual companies rather than waiting for an industry-wide
agreement.

<TEXT>
THE ITV network is running an unprecedented promotional campaign this
winter, worth an equivalent of Pounds 9m in airtime value, to increase its
market share, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Mr Malcolm Wall, chairman of the ITV marketing committee, told advertisers
yesterday that, for the first time, each ITV company will contribute 15 per
cent of its promotional airtime to a central network campaign.
A new drama may have a launch promotion equal to Pounds 1m in airtime value.
ITV is also considering advertising in other media.
The campaign is part of the move towards a more commercially competitive ITV
system which will begin in January, when the new ITV franchises begin and
Channel 4 starts selling its own advertising time.
ITV has had the greatest share of viewing every week this year apart from
the Olympic fortnight. It said it had beaten BBC1 by more than 10 percentage
points eight times.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Checkland to leave BBC early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, announced yesterday that
he is to hand over to Mr John Birt, his designated successor, at Christmas,
more than two months earlier than expected.
It had been believed that Sir Michael, angered by being given an extension
of only one year to his five-year contract by the BBC board of governors,
would stay until the end of his term. His contract was due to finish on
February 28.
Sir Michael said in a statement that he had suggested and agreed the
arrangement with Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, yesterday.
The news of Sir Michael's early departure comes three weeks after he made
extraordinary remarks about the BBC chairman and the board of governors at a
Royal Television Society symposium. The BBC director-general accused the
board of governors of getting too involved in the day-to-day running of the
corporation. He also called for a wider range of governors and ages.
The real controversy was caused when he said it was absurd for the BBC
chairman, who was given a second five-year term by the government, to be
leading the corporation into the next century at the age of 73. Mr Hussey is
now 69.
Sir Michael apologised later in the day.
Mr Hussey said the BBC owed Sir Michael a great debt for his dedication to
the corporation's interests. 'In his six years he has worked with courage,
determination and enthusiasm to ensure that the BBC understands the
challenges it faces.'

HER MAJESTY'S Inspectorate of Pollution, which must approve the
controversial new thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) before it can
start up, will be issuing a draft authorisation for public comment. The
authorisation is needed because Thorp will alter the emissions from the
Sellafield site.
Environmental lobbyists, who are trying to halt the new Pounds 1.8bn
facility built by British Nuclear Fuels, will be pressing Mr Michael Howard,
the environment secretary, to conduct a full hearing into the project.
Mr John Guinness, BNF's chairman, said last night that he still hoped to
receive authorisation for the start-up. However, he said the recent ruling
that BNF could not load the facility until the go-ahead had been given,
would cost the state-owned company Pounds 1m a week.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Renewal offer to MMI clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities unable to obtain insurance cover in the wake of the
problems of Municipal Mutual (MMI), the UK's ninth largest insurer, are to
be offered new facilities by Zurich Insurance. The giant Swiss company has
been in negotiations with MMI over the past month, Richard Lapper writes.
Up to 300 local authorities, whose policies come up for renewal between
October and the start of January, could be insured by Zurich. Some 31,000
individual policyholders are also being offered renewals by the Swiss
company.
MMI, which has incurred heavy losses on its liability business, withdrew
from the insurance market in September, leaving a number of local
authorities temporarily without insurance. MMI insured nine out of 10 local
councils but other UK companies have been reluctant to offer cover.
However, Mr Brian Wright, group chief executive, said talks with Zurich were
'going well'. MMI hopes to be able to transfer most of its business to the
Swiss company, which would also employ a large number of the 2,000 staff.
Zurich is understood to be reluctant to assume any liabilities arising on
policies already underwritten by MMI.
Mr Dennis White, chief executive of Zurich Insurance UK, said: 'There are
some complex issues involved which will yet need to be resolved but we are
making genuine progress.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Lamont's opportunity to save his chancellorship: The Autumn
Statement should mark the end of a difficult time for economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW, Mr Norman Lamont has a chance to retrieve his chancellorship.
His Autumn Statement will be more important than any of the previous
set-piece occasions during his two-year tenure of Number 11 Downing Street.
It will do much more than detail the government's spending plans for 1993-94
and the two subsequent years and present its forecast for the economy next
year. It should mark the end of a difficult rebalancing of policy since
Britain was forced to pull sterling out of the European exchange rate
mechanism eight weeks ago.
The hope is that, with a special package of measures to help lift the UK out
of recession and lower interest rates, the chancellor will revive business
and consumer confidence and point the way to renewed economic growth.
But Mr Lamont has a difficult course to steer. He will have to justify
cutting some spending programmes and entitlements in a recession. He must
hold out realistic hope of recovery and so provide an answer to fears in the
country and among increasingly fractious Tory backbenchers in Westminster
that the recession could turn into a slump. Last month's outcry about the
pit closure programme convinced the government of the political necessity of
shifting the emphasis of policy towards growth.
On the other hand, the government must stand by its recently announced
target of holding underlying inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent band
over the life of this parliament. Even though Britain is no longer subject
to ERM constraints, it cannot risk upsetting financial markets and causing
sterling to fall sharply.
While the Confederation of British Industry and much of the press have been
clamouring this week for radical action in the Autumn Statement, Whitehall
has been trying to deflate overblown expectations. 'A handful of measures'
was how one official described the special policy package that the
chancellor will disclose on Thursday to boost the economy.
Some of this may be presentational prudence. The government naturally wants
the package to create as favourable an impression as possible when
published. But Mr Lamont is by nature a cautious man. He has has always been
averse to giving the economy short-term artificial stimulus. He also sees
the Autumn Statement as part of a medium-term framework for policy to
encourage growth while taking no risks with rising prices.
Much of this year's Autumn Statement is well-known in broad outline. The
government will keep within its planning total of Pounds 244.5bn for
spending in 1993-94.
Priority will be given where possible to capital spending over current
spending. Public sector pay will be squeezed. One eyecatching project - the
Jubilee Line extension - seems certain to go ahead and should help
employment and morale in the south-east's depressed construction industry.
Barriers to private-sector involvement in infrastructure investment will be
brought down. Other elements of the special package will be targeted to give
support to housing and industry.
The commitment to growth, first articulated by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, three weeks ago is real enough. But the excitement about the
government's supposed 'U-turn' has tended to obscure an already substantial
relaxation of policy since Black Wednesday. Bank base rates have fallen by 2
percentage points while by yesterday sterling had devalued by 14 per cent,
when measured against the Bank of England's trade weighted index.
As Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has made clear,
the devaluation presents British industry with opportunities in export
markets but it also poses dangers for Britain. Speaking at the weekend on
BBC Television's On the Record programme, he recalled that the UK had in the
past always thrown away the competitive advantage of devaluation by letting
inflation erode it.
Assessing the likely inflationary impact of the devaluation is probably the
hardest economic judgment the chancellor must make this week. Economic
theory says a 14 per cent devaluation should result in a 14 per cent
increase in the price level over a number of years. The Treasury model of
the economy reckons that on average the competitiveness effect of
devaluation is lost within five years. But a growing number of City
economists are convinced that the economy is so weak that worries about
inflation should not act as a constraint on Mr Lamont.
In his latest assessment of the British economy, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK
economist of Goldman Sachs, said that inflation in Britain would probably
have turned negative by 1994 on pre-devaluation policy settings. He forecast
underlying inflation would be about 3 per cent by the end of next year in
spite of the large devaluation since September 16.
For the time being, the Treasury and Bank of England seem to share the City
view that there are no inflationary pressures in the economy. But how long
will this be the case?
Yesterday brought news of an unexpectedly sharp 2.5 per cent rise in
industry's non-seasonally ad-justed input prices in October; two-thirds of
the rise reflected higher imported goods costs. How quickly such increases
work through to the rest of the economy will depend on how far exporters,
manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers are forced to absorb costs to keep
markets.
With the slack in the economy, imported inflation could be absorbed for some
time and should not stand in the way of a further cut in interest rates
around the time of the Autumn Statement. But with sterling again weak, it is
unlikely that Mr Lamont will respond to appeals for a sharp cut of 2 points
in bank base rates from 8 per cent.
By the end of this week, the chancellor will have the spending part of his
fiscal policy for next year in place. Barring surprises, revenue decisions
will await the last of the spring budgets in March.
Between those two events, interest rates will again be the main instrument
for steering the economy. While financial markets anticipate a further
substantial easing of monetary policy in the months to come, Mr Lamont will
keep a watchful eye on prospective inflation so that he can meet his target.
Once Britain emerges from recession, UK official interest rates are likely
to be more volatile than in the past.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Pits would require 'months' to restart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 10 PITS earmarked for closure or already closed by British Coal would
need up to nine months of work before they could operate fully, Mr Doug
Bulmer, president of the British Association of Colliery Management, said
yesterday.
He told the Commons trade and industry committee some of the pits could be
re-opened quickly but in some cases six to nine months would be necessary
before equipment was fully operational. British Coal is undergoing a 90-day
consultation period with unions about the future of the pits.
Mr Bulmer called for the dismissal of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity regulator.
British Coal's decision to close 31 pits, announced last month, had not been
a surprise because of 'the way in which the power generation market has been
rigged against coal and in favour of gas', he said.
'It came as no surprise to the government or the electricity regulator and
we have provided documentary evidence of that. In our view the regulator
should be dismissed for dereliction of duty. We are being pushed out of the
power generation market, quite irrespective of our ability to get costs down
to compete with imported coal and other fuels.' Mr Bulmer said.
'Gas is to be burned in preference to coal, despite its higher price,
because of the way the electricity supply industry is organised,' he said.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Concession urged to boost collieries: What future for coal?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, sug-gested yesterday
that the bulk of the UK electricity market should be reserved for coal-based
power as a way of sustaining the UK coal industry.
This would involve clearing gas-fired and oil-fired power stations from the
'franchise' market in England and Wales, where regional electricity
companies have a monopoly to sell to households and small businesses.
This market accounts for 70 per cent of all power demand, but prices have
been fixed artificially high to help coal.
The company said clearing the franchise market would enable British Coal to
increase sales to National Power and PowerGen, its two main clients, from an
expected 30m tonnes a year for the four years from 1994, to up to 50m
tonnes.
In evidence to the Commons' trade and industry select committee, which is
inquiring into the economics of the coal industry, National Power said the
solution would have the advantage of subjecting the economies of combined
cycle gas turbines to the test of the market.
CCGTs would be restricted to the non-franchise market, which supplies large
customers and in which British Coal is unable to compete effectively.
Gas-fired power stations are a significant contributor to the decline of
coal demand, but their cost is the subject of considerable debate. Regional
electricity companies are able to pass on their costs to customers whether
or not they are economic.
Mr John Baker, National Power chief executive, said it was possible that
uneconomic CCGTs could displace 5m to 10m tonnes of coal a year. 'The
regional electricity companies cannot have it both ways. Either the CCGTs
are economic and they should fight in the fully contested part of the
market, or they are not economic, in which case they should not go ahead.'
In a six-page submission to the committee, National Power said it would
support a larger market for British Coal, above the 40m tonnes tentatively
agreed for next year and 30m thereafter. It believed there was room in the
market as a whole to accommodate 40m tonnes a year of British produced coal
on long term contracts.
National Power was also willing for transitional assistance to be given to
British produced coal providing it became competitive with world coal at the
end of the transition.
The government, it suggested, had three courses. It could either leave the
market to determine British coal's future, subsidise coal so that it is
offered for sale at world market prices, or require electricity consumers in
the franchise market to buy British Coal output. In the last case these
consumers would bear the additional costs, in effect continuing to pay a
coal levy through electricity bills as in recent years.

The government had constructed a crazy system and could alter it, he said.
Six Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in areas affected by threatened
pit closures have formulated plans to help miners and other workers find new
jobs.
The proposals include assistance with job searching, retraining, skill
assessment, and support in setting up businesses.
The six Tecs are in areas where 10 pits have been listed for closure after a
90-day consultation period. The government has made up to Pounds 75m
available to Tecs in areas hit by the pit closures.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Changes in partnership legislation proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTNERSHIPS comprising unlimited liability companies will be required to
file publicly available accounts after January 1995, according to a
consultative document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry
yesterday.
Legislation will be introduced after that date to include partnerships,
limited partnerships and unlimited companies in which the members are
limited companies. This will bring UK law into line with amendments to the
EC's fourth and seventh company law directives.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, who launched the
consultative document, said that the changes would affect very few British
partnerships because most were formed between people rather than limited
companies.
Most companies that form partnerships already include the partnership
accounts with their own annual accounts. Those that do not will have to do
so in future. If all the partner companies are abroad, the partnership may
have to make its accounts available on demand at its main office.
The document says there were 486,834 partnerships registered for value added
tax this year, 3,193 limited partnerships and 4,000 unlimited companies.
The DTI said it wanted to hear about the potential costs of compliance.
Comments on the document should be received by January 22.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Move to ease fears over coal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will try to ease the uncertainty over British Coal's new
long-term coal contracts by stating whether it would be willing to see them
concluded before the results of its energy policy review are known.
The electricity industry is trying to pull together a five-year deal with
British Coal, on which its future depends. But talks are stalled because
several companies are unwilling to commit themselves to a deal while the
review is in progress.
Although British Coal is negotiating with the power generators, these need
to secure long-term supply deals with the distribution companies in England
and Wales before the whole package can be agreed.
The government will make its view known in a Commons written answer from Mr
Tim Eggar, the energy minister, in the next few days. The answer will take
account of the fact that talks on the contracts must progress so that new
terms can be in place by next April when the current ones expire.
But they must leave room to accommodate extra coal deliveries if this is the
effect of the new policy, which will not become known until the new year.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, estimated yesterday that
the 12 regional electricity companies are equally divided between those
which are ready to sign new contracts, those which are not, and those which
are awaiting guidance.
He said National Power was looking into the possibility of signing long-term
deals with individual companies rather than waiting for an industry-wide
agreement. But it is likely the companies will be wary of committing
themselves if their competitors do not because they may forfeit competitive
advantage.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Anglian will make water meters compulsory for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN WATER plans to extend compulsory metering to all its customers. It
has already installed meters for industrial users and new houses.
The extension of the scheme is likely to start in 1994, and will take more
than 10 years.
Water companies already install meters for industrial users and all new
properties, while some companies have trial meter programmes in operation
for older properties. Anglian will be the first to move to compulsory
metering for all properties.
Ofwat, the water industry regulator, has supported metering as a way of
reducing consumption. But a compulsory programme is likely to be unpopular
with many customers.
Mr Alan Smith, group managing director, said households which were
compulsorily me-tered would not pay installation charges, which can total
Pounds 200. He said metering would make little difference to bills for
average households with average consumption, but bills would increase for
those who regularly washed cars and watered gardens.
Water companies have until the year 2000 to put new charging systems in
place to replace charges based on domestic rates. Some companies, especially
those in the south of England which have been affected by drought, are
likely to follow Anglian's lead.
Thames Water is in the process of metering all commercial users and may
meter large houses with gardens. It is unlikely to meter flats and houses
with joint supply.
South West Water yesterday reached agreement with Ofwat to restrict its
price rises to 11 percentage points above inflation, a reduction of 0.5
points, for 1993-94. This follows a request from Ofwat last month for the 10
water and sewage companies to hold back price rises by an average of 2
points.
Other than North West Water, which is appealing, all 10 have now agreed to a
reduction in price rises. Northumbrian Water was fined Pounds 1,500, plus
Pounds 937 costs yesterday by magistrates at Blyth, Northumberland, after
pleading guilty to causing a discharge of sewage effluent into controlled
water, the Seaton Burn. The prosecution was the tenth brought by the
National Rivers Authority against Northumbrian Water since 1989.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Ofwat warns on efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER COMPANIES which are inefficient will face tighter price controls in
future, the industry regulator Ofwat said yesterday.
Ofwat's consultation paper said it would look favourably on water companies
which controlled costs and had high standards of customer service when it
conducts its periodic review in 1994 - a wide-ranging assessment of the
industry's pricing structure.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said yesterday: 'I am concerned about
the rising level of water and sewerage bills.'
The water companies' 10-year modernisation programme to bring water
standards in England and Wales into line with European Community directives
could eventually cost about Pounds 45bn.
Ofwat's paper said the rate of price increases 'must bear some relationship
to the costs incurred but the relationship need not be a mechanical one.
Companies which are shown to be less efficient will be set tighter price
limits.'
The paper added that increases in water charges would allow water companies
to make a 'reasonable' return on capital and that it would not try to 'claw
back retrospectively any savings companies have made above the efficiency
targets initially assumed'.
Mr David Luffnam, finance director of Thames Water, said: 'There are a
number of positive things such as being able to retain efficiency gains for
a good period. But this is just one step towards the periodic review, and
the crunch clearly comes with the next part - the assumptions about what are
acceptable financial ratios.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Compulsory local tendering to widen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT intends to press ahead with plans to extend compulsory
competitive tendering of local-authority services to the white-collar
sector, but the procedure will be more flexible than previously announced.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said his department estimated that
tendering had generated cost savings of about 6 per cent for blue-collar
services 'while standards have in general been maintained or improved'.
He told the annual conference of the Association of County Councils at
Winchester, Hampshire: 'It is vital that we do not underestimate what can be
achieved in the white-collar services.'
However, three changes are to be made to the proposals set out in an earlier
consultation paper. Library support services are not to be subjected to CCT.
For construction-related services - architecture, engineering and property
management - the proportion of council spending to be subject to tendering
will be reduced from 100 per cent to 90 per cent.
For all services, the so-called 'double envelope' procedure, under which
councils were to be obliged to set a quality threshold and then determine
contracts on price alone, will be made voluntary.
Mr Howard said: 'Local authorities will be able to set in place their own
procedures for making judgments about the trade-off between quality and
cost. We do not want to lay down from on high the detailed rules underlying
(the) framework. We want to work with local government and other interested
parties in developing a system that will work well.'
For services not related to construction, the proportion of spending to be
subject to tendering will be as laid down in the consultation paper - 15 per
cent of spending for corporate and administrative services, 33 per cent for
legal services, 25 per cent for personnel and finance, and 80 per cent for
computing.
Councils will be required to publish accounts for each of their main areas
of work and will be obliged to set up a system of internal trading accounts.
Mr Howard also announced that a committee will be set up next year to advise
on the implications of new single-tier authorities for local-authority
employees.
He said he expected 90 per cent of local-government staff to be unaffected.
Support services for the police and fire services are to be put out to
tender, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, announced yesterday.
Tendering will apply to 40 per cent of the annual value of police vehicle
maintenance and repair and 90 per cent of the cleaning of police buildings.
The maintenance and repair of fire service vehicles will not be contracted
out immediately.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Exporters face a taxing time: Charles Batchelor on what new
VAT rules may cost businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOVE to new European Community rules for collecting Value Added Tax will
cost UK companies Pounds 100m, according to Customs and Excise.
The publication yesterday by Customs of a detailed cost-benefit analysis of
the far-reaching changes, which take effect in just seven weeks time with
the launch of the single European Market, has initially at least done little
to allay the fears. Business organisations have yet to see the basis for the
calculations but the initial response was one of extreme caution.
The 34-page analysis of the impact of the VAT changes estimates that the
cost to business of staff training and 'familiarisation' with the new system
will be Pounds 37m. The cost to the 30,000 companies which will have to
provide more detailed trade statistics of adapting information and computer
systems will be nearly Pounds 50m.
Against these are set annual savings from the elimination of export and
import documents of Pounds 175m, although the Pounds 40m annual running cost
of the new VAT system reduces the net annual saving to Pounds 135m.
The changeover also means that between 7m and 8m import and export documents
will no longer need to be filled in, delays in customs clearance will be
ended and expensive bank guarantees to cover deferred VAT payments will no
longer be necessary.
Customs and Excise acknowledges that changeover costs for the largest
companies - including the 1 per cent of companies which account for two
thirds of all UK international trade - will be considerable. Some have
quoted costs of up to Pounds 1m although Customs believes they will be able
to offset advantages they obtain from upgrading their information management
systems.
It also says it is aware of the difficulties facing small businesses but
identifying their costs, including the opportunity costs, is not always
easy. Many small businesses do not engage in international trade so they
will not be affected, but those that do may be less happy with the
calculations.
Morrisflex, a Northamptonshire-based manufacturer of rotary tools and
finishing machinery which exports a third of its Pounds 3m turnover, remains
unconvinced of the benefits. The company makes most of its shipments by
parcel post and air freight and so does not expect to make savings on the
removal of border formalities.
The extent of its export activity means it will have to fill in the more
detailed monthly trade statistics, but obtaining the VAT numbers of overseas
customers and putting them on its computer files is proving time-consuming,
says Mr Jeremy Theaker, the company secretary.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, said it had calculated the
changeover costs to business at Pounds 200m. At first sight Customs'
changeover estimate of Pounds 100m would appear only to cover the cost of
employing outside consultants and of updating computer equipment without
taking into account internal resource costs.
'We are extremely sceptical of the figure of Pounds 135m for annual savings,
given the detailed trade information companies will be required to provide,'
says Mr George Michie, partner responsible for the VAT changes. 'The more we
dig the higher the costs appear to be. It will only be when the system is up
and running that we see the true costs.'
In spite of the uncertainty and confusion at many UK businesses, Customs
believes they are better informed than many of their Continental
counterparts. Business people from the Netherlands have attended the
seminars Customs runs in the UK while requests have also come in from
continental Europe for copies of its Single Market Report, which regularly
updates progress on the VAT rules.
Customs authorities throughout the European Community have had to cope with
delays in the publication of EC directives to cover the tax changes.
Brussels has only just issued a final directive tidying up loose ends.
Legislation in other countries is even less advanced. Greece has decided to
push through all legislation and start an information campaign in the six
weeks before the January deadline.
If the proposed VAT changes look complicated now they could have been far
worse, according to senior customs officials. The governments of many other
countries have been slow to acknowledge the concerns of business, they said.
It may be poor consolation to businesses struggling to adapt to the new VAT
regime but proposals for a second changeover in 1997 seem increasingly in
doubt.
If the British government has its way there will be no second round of
changes to a full-blooded 'origin' system, where all goods are taxed at the
factory gate.
That is a welcome but distant relief to those companies struggling to cope
with what is already the biggest change in nearly 20 years in the taxation
of business.

FT  11 NOV 92 / NatWest to close 35 bank branches in West End
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to close 35 of its 90 branches in the West End
of London over the next five years and move their back-office work to two
processing centres. The reorganisation may serve as a model for branch
banking nationally.
About 300 of the 2,900 jobs in the West End are likely to be lost. The money
saved will be spent on redesigning remaining branches to allow more
interaction between staff and customers.
National Westminster said yesterday that there would be no compulsory
redundancies. The cuts will form part of national reductions. The bank wants
to lose 10,000 staff over the next two years.
The new design will allow more space for selling products such as
investments, mortgages and foreign currency. There will also be more space
for automatic teller machines in the open-plan branches.
The bank said the West End would be the first of its 22 regions to complete
the reorganisation. It was likely that a smaller proportion of branches
would be closed elsewhere.
The West End has a large number of branches dating from the merger of the
National Provincial and Westminster banks. The bank has about 2,500 branches
across the country, the largest branch network of any clearer.
All clearing banks are trying to reorganise branch networks to cut costs and
sell more products. They are attempting to reduce processing costs by
centralising functions such as cheque clearing.
National Westminster is allocating more staff to act as account managers to
ensure each customer has access to one. It opened a model new branch in
Victoria Street, London, 18 months ago which reverses the traditional
proportion of floorspace, giving customers more space than staff for the
first time.
Standard Chartered Plc will make 77 of its 1,000-strong UK banking staff
redundant by the end of the year. The bank said the redundancies would be
among operational staff in corporate banking.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Consumer group warns on rail sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of British Rail should be abandoned unless some serious
questions about the government's plans can be satisfactorily answered, the
National Consumer Council says in a report today.
The report is an embarrassment to the Department of Transport because the
council is government-funded and Lady Wilcox, who chairs it, is a member of
the prime minister's advisory committee on the Citizen's Charter.
Lady Wilcox said the council's own research showed that many rail passengers
were unhappy with BR, but it was not yet clear that privatisation was the
way to make train services better. 'My council says emphatically that unless
satisfactory answers are forthcoming to the questions they are asking, they
do not believe that privatisation of British Rail will be in consumers' best
interests.'
Among fears voiced by the council's report are:
Reductions in state subsidies could result in fewer trains and higher fares.
It is not clear how standards of frequency and punctuality will be enforced.
Passengers may lose benefits such as season tickets, travel cards, through
ticketing and national timetables.
Blame for service failures will be hard to establish once responsibility for
train operation and track ownership has been divided.
The council adds that train operators will be at a disadvantage to road
transport operators if, as envisaged, they have to pay Railtrack, the body
that will own the track after privatisation, a fee based on the number of
journeys they make. It suggests instead a flat-rate licence fee similar to
the road licence fee.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Inquiry head used to security issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Justice Scott, who will head the judicial inquiry into the Matrix
Churchill affair, is no stranger to dealing with sensitive issues involving
the security and intelligence services.
In 1983 as a newly appointed High Court judge, he presided over the case
brought by the government against The Guardian newspaper for return of a
confidential document leaked by Ms Sarah Tisdall, the former Foreign Office
clerk.
He ruled that the document should be returned on the grounds that it was
government property. Ms Tisdall was later convicted under the Official
Secrets Act and jailed for six months.
In 1987 he presided over the first Spycatcher hearings and refused the
government injunctions banning newspapers from publishing extracts of the
book by the former MI5 officer Mr Peter Wright.
It was this decision which established his reputation as a member of the
'liberal wing' of the judiciary, a reputation enhanced when he spoke out in
light of the Spycatcher case against the dangers of government legislation
on confidentiality.
He also has a reputation for being open-minded and pragmatic. In 1985,
agreeing to end a sequestration order that had deprived the South Wales area
of the National Union of Mineworkers of more than Pounds 700,000 of its
funds, he was not troubled by the union's failure to apologise for defying a
court order. 'The court's dignity,' he said, 'does not depend on or require
a public recantation, the sincerity of which, if offered, might in the
circumstances be open to question.'
Sir Richard Rashleigh Folliott Scott, 58, is one of three South African
members of the higher judiciary. He was educated at Cape Town University and
Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the English Bar in 1959. He
was chairman of the Bar in 1982 and as head of its race relations committee
was responsible for drawing up a code to end racial discrimination at the
Bar.
He was appointed a judge of the Chancery Division in 1983 and was promoted
to the Court of Appeal last year.
He will have wide ranging powers to request disclosure of confidentail
documents and subpoena witnesses.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Ministers warned to help probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS who refuse to give evidence to the judicial inquiry into the sale
of defence equipment to Iraq would be sacked, Mr John Major said in the
Commons yesterday.
The prime minister's warning came amid Labour allegations that the
government was engaged in a cover-up over the extent of ministers' knowledge
of the sale of defence equipment to Iraq in the run-up to the Gulf war.
The allegations were repeatedly denied by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, as the storm broke over what Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, called a 'murky and black business'.
Suspicions on the opposition benches were fuelled by unresolved doubts over
whether Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, could be compelled to give
evidence to the judicial inquiry to be conducted by Lord Justice Scott.
Mr Major came to the assistance of Sir Nicholas as he struggled to assure
opposition critics that members of the government would give evidence to the
tribunal if 'invited' to do so.
The attorney-general's protestations that it was inconceivable that
ministers would refuse to comply with a request from Lord Justice Scott were
brushed aside. After a whispered conversation with Mr Major, Sir Nicholas
said that, if necessary, the prime minister would order ministers to give
evidence.
Sir Nicholas stressed: 'If anybody sought not to attend, which I find
inconceivable, they would be unlikely to remain ministers for long if they
disobeyed such an order'.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for Fife North East, sought
clarification of the position if a former minister declined to give evidence
to the inquiry.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, replied that as the inquiry was not being
conducted by the House she thought it would have 'no authority' in the
matter.
Sir Nicholas rejected demands that it should be conducted under the terms of
the 1921 Tribunal of Inquiries Act so that Lord Justice Scott would have the
power to summon witnesses and cross-examine them under oath. He stressed
that the 1921 tribunal procedure had 'disadvantages,' including the fact
that it was likely to prevent any prosecutions being launched subsequently.
Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, said: 'Could there be a
greater contrast between the honour and integrity of the judge in this court
case and ministers who apparently were quite willing to send innocent people
to prison and whose record and reputation is such that they should consider
as quickly as possible - if they have any honour left - of resigning long
before this judicial inquiry begins?'
Mr Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East, angered Conservative MPs by
asking if the inquiry would be able to examine the alleged role of Mr Mark
Thatcher, son of the former prime minister.
He asked: 'Will the officers of MI5 and MI6 be under compulsion to tell the
inquiry whether they advised the former prime minister of her son's arms
dealings in this area and his own involvement in the shipment of munitions
to Iraq?' Miss Boothroyd told him: 'That is not a matter for the Speaker.'
In an exchange with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, the prime minister
referred to 'extraordinary stories' concerning the matter, and added 'they
must be clarified beyond any measure of doubt'.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: How UK helped the Iraqi war effort -
Waldegrave failed in his rearguard action against pressure from Clark and
Trefgarne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREVIOUSLY classified government documents released during the Matrix
Churchill trial reveal an aggressive determination by the Department of
Trade and Industry to support exports to Iraq in the three years prior to
the 1990 Gulf war.
Document after document shows the evolution of government policy on Iraq and
how Foreign Office minister Mr William Waldegrave fought an unsuccessful
rearguard action against pressure from Mr Alan Clark, trade minister, his
successor Lord Trefgarne, and at later stages against the Ministry of
Defence. One document catches the concern in a simple phrase when it says
that the intention of the paper is to discuss ways in which 'UK Ltd is
helping Iraq'.
And among the most revealing notes are plans for a ministerial meeting
convened by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in July 1990. The
meeting discussed a detailed review of policy on exports to Iran and Iraq.
The final outcome is not clear but machine tools continued to be exported
afterwards.
The documents also show that Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, was
kept informed about many sensitive exports, although at times it appears she
voiced concerns. One document suggests she may have been informed of
applications to supply equipment with a potential military role to Iran and
Iraq as early as February 1988.
The summary record of an inter-departmental committee (IDC) on defence sales
to Iran and Iraq dated February 24 1988 and marked 'confidential' carries
the note 'Advice to Prime Minister' and discusses the suitability of engines
for minelaying vessels.
The documents show a picture of civil servants across three Whitehall
departments almost casually discussing the extent to which the guidelines on
exporting arms to Iraq were ambiguous or circumventable.
The same February 1988 summary record refers to an export licence
application for two 9mm Browning pistols destined for Iraq. 'The IDC agreed
that this equipment was clearly lethal and therefore prohibited under our
embargo on lethal weaponry,' the document notes.
'However, MoD informed the IDC that, because the consignee was Saddam
Hussein's son, they intended to draw this application to the attention of
ministers.
The documents indicate a consistent picture of the Department of Trade and
Industry and, to a lesser extent, the Ministry of Defence champing at the
bit to grant licences while the Foreign Office sounded a note of caution.
As 1988 wore on, a logjam of licence applications for export of dual-use
equipment to Iraq and Iran built up. Decision-makers, meanwhile, pondered
the consequences as the ceasefire process between the Gulf war belligerents
continued.
This culminated in a strongly worded letter dated November 4, 1988, arguing
for a 'marginal relaxation of controls' from Mr Alan Clark, then minister
for trade, to Mr William Waldegrave, then Foreign Office minister.
The letter notes Mr Clark's concern about 'the large number of licence
applications for export of dual-use equipment to Iraq and Iran agreed at
official level but deferred by Ministers.' The goods were valued at more
than Pounds 5.6m for Iran and Pounds 3.1m for Iraq and included spare parts
for civil aircraft and helicopters, communications and transport equipment
and machine tools.
By this time, an element of departmental bickering had crept into some of
the correspondence. A memo dated September 30, 1988 and signed by Mr Stephen
Lillie, an official in the Middle East department of the Foreign Office,
notes that the DTI had requested 'retrospective clearance' from the Foreign
Office and MoD for 'an export licence already issued by the DTI to Matrix
Churchill for the temporary export of lathe equipment to the Baghdad Trade
Fair'.
By the beginning of February 1989, Foreign Office officials were assuring
themselves that the intelligence value of the Matrix Churchill contracts
would outweigh the potential implications for nuclear proliferation into
Iraq.
A detailed memo from Mr Lillie outlines intelligence information that
indicated Iraq's intention to use Matrix for the supply of munitions
factories in Iraq headed by Dr Safa Habobi, himself a director of the
Coventry company.
More alarming was the recognition that Dr Habobi was engaged in attempts to
acquire gas centrifuge technology for uranium enrichment in a procurement
network outside Matrix Churchill.
Stopping the Matrix exports, the memo concluded, would not prove an
effective obstacle to Iraq's objectives. 'Neither would it absolve Britain
morally from any involvement in this network, since all non-licensable
Matrix Churchill equipment would remain freely available to Iraq.'
A further important consideration was also vexing the Foreign Office, the
memo says. Refusal of the exports licence could force the closure of the
company. 'If this happened, we would lose our intelligence access to
Habobi's procurement network.'
The argument was powerful enough to persuade Mr Waldegrave to give his
recommendation that the licences be approved.
By September 1989, however, Mr Waldegrave recommended the refusal of further
Matrix Churchill licences, arguing that the intelligence considerations no
longer applied.
A DTI memo notes: 'In December 1988 Ministers agreed on a more flexible
interpretation of the guidelines to reflect a more relaxed approach to the
less sensitive items such as civil aircraft spares and machine tools.'
A DTI memo later that month noted that Lord Trefgarne agreed that the
Foreign Office view should be opposed.
A July 17 brief for the minister of defence procurement outlined how the
trade and industry secretary had succeeded in securing a ministerial meeting
to review policy on defence-related exports to Iran and Iraq two days later.
The meeting was to be chaired by the foreign secretary.
The paper outlines the expected stance of the Foreign Office, Treasury, and
the Ministry of Defence. The Foreign Office, it said, would 'shy away' from
removing the guidelines altogether, and the Treasury would focus on the
implications of further defence exports to Iraq on the critical state of its
finances.
By this time the policy had been long established. Increasing fear of public
exposure was growing throughout the late 1980s. As one memo recorded: 'The
Minister should be made aware of this unfolding situation, especially since
it could reach the Press . . . '

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Letter for the defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following was submitted to the court in evidence
FROM Alan Clark, then trade minister,
to William Waldegrave, minister of state, foreign and commonwealth affairs
End of the Gulf War:
Defence Sales Guidelines
I am concerned about the large number of licence applications for export of
dual use equipment to Iraq agreed at official level but deferred by
ministers. The goods concerned, totalling over Pounds 5.6m for Iran and
Pounds 3.1m for Iraq, include spare parts for civil aircraft and
helicopters, communications and transport equipment and machine tools.
Para 2 of the official's note enclosed with Geoffrey Howe's of 31 August
suggested: 'We can use discretion within the ministerial guidelines to adopt
a phased approach to borderline cases, relaxing control on a growing number
of categories as peace takes hold.' It would in my view be entirely
consistent with this policy to issue without further delay the licences
mentioned above. Not to do so will harm the efforts of British companies to
re-establish themselves in both markets and deny them industrially valuable
orders. Our international competitors are not so inhibited and this case for
continuing to apply a wide ranging unilateral UK embargo on defence sales is
now well-nigh impossible to justify to British firms. The ceasefire holds
and while I am aware that substantive peace negotiations have yet to get off
the ground, I doubt if it could seriously be argued that progress would be
affected by such a marginal relaxation of controls by the UK.
Apart from outstanding applications, there are important new orders to be
won if licences are available. A prime example is a Pounds 14m contract for
Westlands for refurbishment of two UK built Iranian hovercraft. This would
provide 120 man years work in a severly depressed sector of industry. The
work in the UK would take 18 months and the Iranians would meantime be
denied use of the craft - urgently needed for rehabilitation of Iran's
offshore oil industry. But Westlands will not get the contract without an
assurance of a re-export licence and the work may be lost to Australia or
the Soviet Union. Licence applications for this work have hitherto been
resisted on the basis that refurbishment would upset the strategic balance
in the Gulf. Continued denial of licences on these grounds would strain
credulity.
I hope that you and David Trefgarne can agree to the above proposals. I
recognise, of course, that whatever is agreed between us will require the
prime minister's approval in the light of her private secretary's letter of
2 September. I would not propose an announcement of any decision to issue
the outstanding licences but we should be prepared to explain our decision
if necessary and appropriate defensive briefing would need to be available
to meet possible criticism.
I am copying this letter to the prime minister and David Trefgarne.
This is important]

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Uncertainty about how much Customs knew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of the Matrix Churchill case raises questions about the
co-operation between Customs and Excise and other government departments
over the prosecution.
In particular, it remains unclear to what extent Customs was aware of the
'dirty washing' that would emerge from Whitehall before mounting the
prosecution.
Customs has had an independence since its early days of catching smugglers
on Cornish beaches. It is accountable only to the Treasury and able to bring
cases to court without reference to the director of public prosecutions.
The Matrix Churchill prosecution, some argue, is a demonstration of that
independence, as Customs pressed on with its case regardless of the
embarrassment caused to other government departments. But defendants and
others have questioned whether Customs was fully in the picture.
The official Customs explanation for the trial collapsing remains that
inconsistencies in evidence given by Mr Alan Clark before the trial and then
in the witness box meant the prosecution no longer had a case against the
three men from Matrix Churchill.
Its officials argue that the courtroom revelations - that ministers knew
from late 1987 onwards that the exports were for military use but approved
them to protect intelligence sources - were irrelevant to their case. The
prosecution failed on the one point only - the inconsistencies of Mr Clark's
evidence.
Others consider this view disingenuous. They argue that the case fell apart
as soon as evidence was produced showing ministers knew the exports were for
military use in 1987.
In June 1990, when Customs began its investigation after being tipped off by
its West German counterpart, the reaction from other parts of Whitehall -
particularly in the Department of Trade and Industry - was nervous. The
'dirty washing' memo was only one indication of the sensitivity of the
subject.
Customs yesterday insisted it had received full co-operation from other
departments and that all relevant documents had been produced.
But it could not confirm that the 500 documents which formed the basis of
the defence case had been shown to officials before September this year.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: CNC tools 'could make anything'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and German engineers said yesterday that it was impossible to
prevent equipment of the type sold by Matrix Churchill to Iraq from being
used for military purposes.
'Machine tools are general-purpose machines,' said Mr Michael Bright,
chairman of FMT, a Brighton company that was building equipment for Matrix
Churchill to fulfil Iraqi orders. 'They can be programmed to make anything.'
FMT's order was frozen when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
In spite of what is common knowledge among engineers, government documents
in 1988 show that export licences for machine tools were granted.
Departmental committees had determined the equipment consisted of 'civilian
items of general purpose not destined for a military end use'.
Iraq bought computer-controlled machine tools, usually called CNCs (computer
numerically controlled). They were of two types: CNC lathes, in which a
piece of metal revolves so that cutters shape it into a cylindrical object
such as a shell casing, or CNC machining centres, where the cutters move
around a stationary block to create, for example, gun parts.
Baghdad chose CNC machines because of their flexibility. In 1990, Matrix
Churchill sent engineers to Iraq to oversee a switch to making automotive
parts, said Mr Paul Henderson, formerly managing director of Matrix
Churchill.
But CNC machines are slower than equipment dedicated to making one item.
Iraq's solution was to buy a lot of machine tools: BSA, for example, sent 50
lathes valued at Pounds 6.9m. Iraq also ordered from Wickmann Bennett, a
Coventry manufacturer, 15 lathes for Pounds 11m and another 141 from Matrix
Churchill worth Pounds 19m. There were other Iraqi orders for German and
Swiss companies, said Mr Henderson.
BSA, Matrix Churchill and others then trained Iraqi engineers to programme
the machine tools. This meant that even if a machine tool began life making
car parts, a technicians could re-programme it using a computer keyboard and
simple instructions to make weapon parts.
'It's easy to say a machine tool is for one purpose and use it in another
way,' confirmed Mr Klaus Friedrich, export consultant at the VDMA, the
German manufacturing equipment association. 'To stop everything that might
be used by foreign armies, you would have to control the exports of 50 per
cent of industrial production.'
German machine-tool manufacturers were at the forefront of sales to Iraq.
Germany is Europe's biggest supplier of machine tools and the Iraqi embassy
in Bonn became the Iraqi government's buying office, according to Mr Bright.
'Most of the world machine tool industry was at the Iraqi embassy in Bonn,'
he said. In the late 1980s, motor car and truck manufacturers such as
Mercedes and General Motors were negotiating to set up plants in Iraq, he
said, 'and we were all quoting for the machine tools'.
Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA, argued that how the equipment was
eventually to be used was guesswork.
Germany has in the last two years clamped down on exports of flexible
manufacturing machinery. If there are any question marks over the possible
use of the equipment for military purposes, a licence must be obtained from
the Bundesausfuramt, the Federal Export Office, or the government.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Clarke denies knowledge of any policy to
supply arms to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE following account is highlights of an interview with Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the home secretary, on the BBC World at One programme yesterday.
Mr Clarke was asked by the reporter Mr Roger Currell why he had signed a
certificate apparently aimed at restricting the information available.
KC: Well, it's completely news to me that anything in these documents has
had any effect on the outcome of the trial. I woke up this morning to find
the Public Immunity Certificate being cited in a case which from my reading
of the newspapers had turned on the evidence given by Alan Clark. I did sign
a Public Immunity Certificate as I many times have after consulting with my
lawyers about the documents that we had and we made the usual claim for
public interest immunity for those categories of documents that aren't
disclosed to the courts.
I certainly didn't seek any immunity in order to conceal from the courts the
truth and I think this confused case has been reported in rather an
extraordinary fashion this morning. I have personally had nothing ever to do
with sales of weapons to the Iraqis and I haven't sought immunity for any
documents simply on the basis that they might prejudice a prosecution or be
helpful to the defence. I wouldn't dream of signing any such certificate.
Q: Did these papers not cover what was going on behind the scenes, involving
arms which were being sold to Iraq, the government's policy over that, the
embargo that was supposed to be in place?
KC: Well, quite honestly as we now talk I can't remember. I didn't ban them
on that basis. All I sought to withhold from the court was that category of
document which governments always seek to withhold from the court, including
for example, advice to ministers, and may well also have included, for
example, things relating to the work of the security services which
governments have always held back . . . All I know is I did not sign any
certificate authorising the withholding of documents because they were
embarrassing to the government.
Q: But it is being suggested that the government was trying to cover up its
secret policy which was to allow certain arms to be sold to Iraq in spite of
the embargo.
KC: Speaking for myself I know of no such secret policy. I was never
involved in any such secret policy. I have never signed any certificate
seeking to conceal any policy of the government.
Q: Do you accept, then, that as a result of this case it has now been shown
that the government was conniving to allow arms to be exported to Iraq when
it was publicly saying that there was an embargo.
KC: Well, I don't because I have not been following the progress of the
case. I have been reading this morning's newspapers which seem to be
implying that, but I know of no such policy and I don't believe that there
was such a policy. But, certainly, I have no involvement in that kind of
thing myself and I do not believe the vast majority of the members of the
government could answer that question.
Q: It's being suggested that even John Major may have misled the Commons.
KC: No, no, no, I can't answer. With the greatest respect, you're asking
things about which I know nothing. You're asking me about the dafter
allegations in this morning's newspapers. One thing I can say, I see the
cabinet's meant to have decided all kinds of things which I know perfectly
well the cabinet never did. I've never taken part in any discussions on this
kind of thing. I think it's highly unlikely John Major ever has either.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Fujimori out to win after redrawing rules: Sally Bowen looks
at Peru's forthcoming elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BEWILDERING array of logos will confront Peruvian voters on congressional
election day, November 22. Eighteen party symbols, including a ship's wheel,
clasped hands and a broom, will vie for the voter's preference. But other
long familiar symbols - the Apra star and United Left's flag - will be
notably absent.
For the Peruvian political panorama has greatly changed since President
Alberto Fujimori dissolved the previous congress and suspended the
constitution on April 5. He has adroitly redrawn the rules of the political
game and, ever a shrewd interpreter of the national mood, positioned himself
for what looks set to be a comfortable majority in his new, one-chamber
house.
September's spectacular capture and the consequent speedy sentencing of Mr
Abimael Guzman, leader of the Shining Path guerrilla movement, proved a
timely boost to Mr Fujimori's personal popularity. Mr Manuel Torrado,
political analyst at Datum, a leading Lima market consultancy, now gives the
Peruvian president an approval rating 'higher than any other head of state
in the world'.
Improvisation has been Mr Fujimori's strongest suit ever since his
unprecedented 1990 presidential victory, which broke every rule in the
election consultants' handbook. This time, he has resuscitated his original
but ineffectual 'Cambio (Change) 90' party and merged it with a group of
'independents' called 'New Majority' to form an official list.
The leader of this pro-government effort is Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, previously a
respected mines minister and head of the government's privatisation office.
His campaign advisers portray him as a successful entrepreneur and a
'provincial' made good. As a politician and potential leader of the future
congress, he looks naive and inarticulate.
But this, in today's Peru, is a virtue. Mr Yoshiyama's appeal to the
electorate is strongly reminiscent of the 1990 Fujimori message. His
running-mates are 'independents, pragmatists, technocrats' - above all,
non-politicians.
'Peruvians are rejecting the politics of the past,' says Mr Torrado. 'Voting
had become a product of despair, since hope had already been killed a
hundred times. There's no support for any pre-1990 politician.'
Aware of this, Peru's two most powerful traditional parties - claiming they
will not collaborate with a 'dictator' - have decided to boycott these
elections. They are former President Alan Garca's left-wing Apra party and
twice-president Fernando Belaunde's centrist Popular Action Party.  Between
them, they are thought still to command the backing of around a quarter of
all Peruvian voters.
Where will this sizeable chunk of votes end up? Probably in widespread
spoiling of ballot papers, opinion surveys indicate. But paradoxically, this
type of protest-voting will only bump up the final percentages for each
list, benefiting the 'official' party still further.
So far, Peruvians seem to be viewing the electoral process with resigned
apathy. Opposition criticism of Mr Fujimori has generally been muted as
politicians, reeling after months of unrelenting attack from a hostile
executive, struggle to depict themselves as constructive.
Among the established parties and individual members of the dissolved
congress reconciled to participation in next week's elections are the
Popular Christian Party headed by Ms Lourdes Flores Nano, a respected, young
lawyer; Mr Rafael Rey Rey, who entered politics in 1990 alongside
presidential candidate and author Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, who founded the
'Renewal Movement'; and former Aprista Mr Jose Barba Caballero, who has
broken party ranks to found his own 'Democratic Co-ordinator' movement.
Left-wingers are lightly sprinkled among other lists.
But Mr Fujimori looks unbeatable. His unabashed electioneering on behalf of
the official alliance - and overt warnings to the electorate that Peru will
be 'ungovernable' if he fails to secure a majority in the new congress -
seem already to have convinced upwards of a third of the Peruvian
population.
The unexpected discovery of a Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m) fiscal surplus has
permitted a carefully-timed relaxation of the government's austere economic
programme to permit spending on 'social' projects. Small-scale public works,
and more traditional presidential handouts, are finally reaching even Peru's
remotest areas.
These slight signs of economic reactivation, combined with a series of
unquestionable successes against the country's two guerrilla movements, seem
to have been enough to imbue the volatile Peruvian electorate with an
overdose of national optimism. But analysts fear that, even with the renewed
inflow of international funding expected in the wake of the elections,
expectations of a swift economic upturn may be dashed.
Whether the now rudderless Sendero Luminoso guerrillas prove strong enough
seriously to disrupt next week's elections is a final imponderable. Some
Sendero experts forecast the movement will seek to regroup and focus its
threats on municipal elections early next year, rather than on the
congressional polls.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Mexican budget set to cut inflation: Target is surplus of
1.7% of GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has sent Congress plans for a budget surplus next
year of 1.7 per cent of GDP, and is forecasting an inflation rate of 7 per
cent and growth of 3 per cent.
The tight budget, which is sure to be approved by the Congress, reflects the
government's determination to achieve single-digit inflation next year. At a
time of sluggish growth, it reveals the concerns over the financing of the
current account deficit in an uncertain international environment, and the
desire to put in place the conditions for sustained low-inflation growth in
time for the 1994 presidential election.
The government will run a budget surplus of 0.4 per cent of GDP this year,
but inflation will be around 11 per cent, and the current account deficit 6
per cent of GDP, according to official forecasts.
The high budget surplus reflects in part a change in definition of
government spending, which now excludes state bank credits to the private
sector. Under the definition used for this year's budget, the surplus would
have been 0.7 per cent of GDP.
The government said total spending next year would fall 0.2 per cent in real
terms, thanks in large part to an expected reduction on interest payments on
the public debt of 20.7 per cent compared to this year. While the government
expects to run a primary surplus of 4.8 per cent of GDP next year, spending
on social programmes, as defined by the government, will increase by 13.7
per cent.
The budget predicts a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP next
year.
The presidency said the budget was aimed at achieving four objectives: to
reduce inflation to 7 per cent, promote employment and achieve growth of 3
per cent, deepen structural reforms to make the economy more productive, and
promote social development by supporting needy sectors.
The main winners from the budget are education, health and rural
development, which have been granted 15.3, 12.8 and 9.3 per cent increases
in spending respectively. The president's anti-poverty programme also
receives a spending increase of of 4.7 per cent in real terms, to Dollars
2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn), although the increase is smaller than in past years.
The Bank of Mexico reported inflation at 0.7 per cent in October, bringing
the cumulative rate for the first 10 months to 9.5 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, has admitted that this
year's trade deficit is likely to be far larger than he estimated less than
three weeks ago. In a speech to businessmen on Monday, he also warned that
economic integration with Brazil was at risk.
Mr Cavallo said that he now expected a deficit of Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars
1.4bn in 1992, after forecasting last month a deficit of up to Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 645m). Argentina has not seen a trade deficit since 1981 and in 1991
ran a Dollars 3.87bn surplus.
Mr Cavallo had said a deficit was no cause for concern, as it would be
covered by capital inflows or would force an adjustment in the domestic
economy. However, last month he increased industry's protection from foreign
competition by trebling to 10 per cent a tax on nearly all imports, to try
to slow shipments from Brazil, Argentina's partner in the Mercosur trade
pact.
Mr Cavallo warned in his speech that economic instability in Brazil was
making integration impossible.

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE already fragile relations between Chile's civilian and military leaders
were shaken yesterday by the start of the country's first human rights trial
since the return of democracy in 1990.
Retired Gen Manuel Contreras, secret police chief during the bloodiest years
of Gen Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, has been charged with the murder of
Mr Orlando Letelier, a friend and foreign minister to the late Socialist
President Salvador Allende.
Mr Letelier and his American secretary, Mrs Ronnie Moffit, were blown up by
a car bomb in Washington in 1976.
The prosecution of Mr Contreras is seen by human rights groups as a symbolic
trial of those who masterminded the worst crimes of the dictatorship. More
than 2,300 people were executed for political reasons, died under torture or
'disappeared' during Gen Pinochet's 16-year rule.
Mr Letelier's remains were brought back to Chile last week and received a
state funeral, with President Patricio Aylwin and his entire cabinet in
attendance. Mr Letelier's son Pablo, a Socialist deputy in Congress, said he
hoped the Supreme Court would have the courage to administer justice.
Gen Pinochet's army is now being besieged on several fronts. It is trying to
block other investigations into past human rights abuses. Its intelligence
services have also been accused of tapping politicians' telephones.
The army has responded by detaining the army officer who leaked information
on its clandestine spying activities and prosecuting journalists for
sedition. The military have refused to give evidence before a congressional
committee investigating the spying charges.
These scandals are testing the limits of Chile's new democracy. The army
believes civilian leaders are breaking the tacit rules under which Gen
Pinochet agreed to relinquish power in the negotiated political transition.
Gen Pinochet warned recently that his army was a 'sleeping lion' which could
be aroused from its slumber if provoked too far.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Australia prepares for labour reform battle: Victorian
state-wide general strike shows weaknesses in union support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S trade union movement sent a powerful warning yesterday to
conservative political leaders planning radical reform of the country's
90-year-old centralised industrial relations system.
About half a million workers in Victoria, the second most populous state,
obeyed union calls for a 24-hour strike against reform legislation
introduced by the state's newly elected conservative government.
Mr Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, claimed that the strike
was a foretaste of the industrial chaos which would engulf the country if
the conservatives win the federal election due by June.
However, while the strike crippled the public service, it failed to stop
work at more than a handful of private-sector companies, suggesting that the
unions' ability to mobilise effective opposition is limited.
This weakness could be crucial to the conservative Liberal/National Party
coalition, which is drawing up plans for similar reforms in other states and
at federal level.
Mr John Hewson, the federal conservative leader, knows that winning the
election will depend partly on his ability to persuade voters that reform is
both necessary and achievable without undue pain.
Conservative officials claimed yesterday that the partial failure of the
strike shows that a determined government with a clear mandate could achieve
change without prolonged industrial disruption. Mr Jeff Kennett, the premier
of Victoria, said the strike was pointless in the face of the public support
for his proposals that was demonstrated by the landslide state election
victory over Labor in October.
But the conservatives face a more difficult task in demonstrating to a
sceptical workforce that their proposals to scrap nearly a century of
centralised control of the workplace are necessary.
Under the existing system, pay and conditions for about 80 per cent of
workers are governed by federal and state industrial relations commissions
with wide-ranging judicial powers. The commissions can order compulsory
arbitration of industrial disputes, and have the power to fine or imprison
workers and managers who refuse to accept judgments.
Traditionally, unions and employers briefed lawyers to appear before the
federal commission once a year to argue for or against an across-the-board
increase in wages for all workers. Most workers are also covered by
occupational 'awards' ensuring, for example, that plumbers of similar
experience receive comparable wages no matter where they work.
Until recently, the system paid little regard to productivity or individual
employers' ability to pay. It also discouraged profit-sharing and
performance-related pay, except for those managers exempt from award
conditions.
However, the system has begun to change in response to international
competitive pressures resulting from the gradual reduction of tariff
protection for Australian industry.
The annual basic wage case has been abandoned, the commissions have
redefined their role as protectors of minimum standards, and the number of
separate awards has been streamlined. For example, 388 job classifications
in the metals industry have been reduced to 14.
An element of productivity bargaining has been achieved by encouraging
employers to pay 'over award' rates to productive workers, and by amending
the legislation to allow limited bargaining at company or plant level.
Union rationalisation has cut the number of unions from 326 in 1986 to 250,
helping to streamline bargaining and reduce demarcation disputes between
unions. Moreover, the Labor government has negotiated a series of accords in
which the unions traded pay restraint for tax cuts and improvements in
government services such as medical care.
The result has been a 60 per cent fall in the number of industrial disputes
and a cut of 8 per cent in real unit labour costs since 1983. Big companies
such as National Australia Bank and Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) have been
quick to negotiate productivity agreements.
However, the changes are less popular with small and medium-sized
businesses, which account for the bulk of Australia's economy. Mr Ian
Spicer, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
says that most of the productivity agreements are 'quite un-inspiring'.
The chamber, which represents most smaller businesses, says genuine
productivity bargaining is hampered by a requirement that agreements must
not leave workers worse off and that this significantly reduces potential
gains for employers.
The commissions also retain the power to amend agreements and even block
them, as the federal commission did in a recent case involving Qantas
Airways.
The federal conservative coalition's proposals would encourage a decisive
shift to productivity bargaining by removing the power of the commissions to
vet agreements or order compulsory arbitration, except with the consent of
both employers and workers. The proposals would also end compulsory trade
union membership, and scrap the accord system, significantly reducing the
role of the trade unions in running the economy.
However, the coalition would enshrine minimum wages and conditions in law
and has stopped short of the Victorian government's proposals to ban holiday
bonuses and impose a cooling-off period on strikers.
The state government, backed by a big parliamentary majority, is unlikely to
back down, raising awkward questions about what the unions should do next,
especially when control of events passes from the Victorian unions to the
more moderate Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU).
Mr Martin Ferguson, ACTU president, describes the coalition's proposals as
'a return to the ratbag world of industrial relations,' but his most recent
attacks have been laced with indications that the unions may compromise.
'If there is a change of government at the next election, the ball is in the
coalition's court,' he said. 'The union movement will not pick an industrial
relations brawl. But if we are backed into a corner, there is the capacity
for (Australia) to lose everything we have achieved.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Tokyo claims machinery orders are rising
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in Japanese private sector investment in new machinery over the
last two years is close to bottoming out, government officials suggested
yesterday after reporting a 7.9 per cent increase in orders in September.
Yet the officials from the Economic Planning Agency warned that private
sector orders in the final three months of this year would be 11.2 per cent
down on the third quarter.
The increase in machinery orders was a welcome relief for Japan's political
leadership after a stream of statistics which have shown the economy is
still in fragile health. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, told a
meeting of the ruling Liberal Democratic party policymakers that it would
not take long before the economy bottomed out.
However, a supplementary budget which is central to the implementation of
the emergency public spending package announced in August is unlikely to be
debated soon by the Japanese Diet (parliament).
Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister for international trade and industry, said the
supplementary budget would only be debated towards the end of the 40-day
extraordinary session of the Diet which began on October 30.
Debate on the budget has been held up by the protracted and increasingly
intense political power struggle within the LDP and between it and the
opposition parties over the Tokyo Sagaw Kyubin bribery scandal.
The LDP yesterday moderated its stance in the dispute by agreeing in
principle that some of its leaders could be called to give evidence to a
parliamentary committee over their role in the affair.
However, the three main opposition parties are insisting they will not agree
to a detailed timetable for discussing the budget until it is clear which
LDP leaders will give evidence and whether they will appear as sworn
witnesses.
Mr Noboru Takeshita, the highly influential former prime minister, is top of
the list of leaders which the opposition wants to question.
Despite the delay to the budget, spending on public works is increasingly
rapidly. Starts on public construction programmes rose by 41.5 per cent to a
record monthly Y2.3bn (Pounds 12.2m) in September, according to the
construction ministry.
Much of the public works investment in the Y10,700bn package is being
financed by the so-called shadow budget, the Fiscal Investment and Loan
Programme, which is not subject to detailed scrutiny by parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S latest trade figures have eased concerns over the country's
ability to service its foreign debt, although economists have warned the
government not to loosen control over offshore borrowing.
Between 1989 and 1991, Indonesia's international debt rose by more than 40
per cent to about Dollars 80bn (Pounds 53bn) and donors warned of a
potential debt crisis.
At the start of 1992, Indonesia had a debt service ratio of 32 per cent of
export proceeds.
January to August trade figures, however, showed a 22.6 per cent
year-on-year rise in non-oil exports to Dollars 14bn, more than offsetting a
9 per cent decline in the value of oil and gas exports to Dollars 6.9bn in
the same period.
International debt, a third of which is owed by private companies, has been
held steady this year following a government decision in late-1991 to set a
ceiling on new borrowing. All offshore loans must now receive the approval
of a government committee.
The growth in exports will lower the debt service ratio, forecast by
economists to fall below 29 per cent by next year. It is also a sign that
new plant and machinery, imported on the back of foreign borrowing, is
coming on stream.
However, Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, a former finance minister and leading
businessman, recently warned the government not to relax its control over
debt.
Mr Djojohadikusumo described the current debt service ratio as critically
high and said it should be reduced to 25 per cent by 1997.
Bankers in Jakarta believe his warning has been sanctioned by government
ministers in an attempt to dissuade some private companies from embarking on
large-scale, ill-conceived, projects using offshore finance.

THE Rs35bn (Pounds 806m) Bombay securities market scandal yesterday claimed
its most prominent victim when Mr G. Ramaswamy, the attorney general,
resigned following intense public criticism of his role in the affair.
According to his aides, Mr Ramaswamy cited ill health as the reason for his
resignation. But it was widely believed in New Delhi last night that he had
quit because of attacks on his connections with Standard Chartered Bank, the
British-owned bank which has suffered heavy losses in the scandal.
Mr Ramaswamy's resignation could help Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister,
distance his government from the scandal at a critical moment. A
parliamentary committee looking into the affair is to examine key witnesses
in the next week, including Mr Harshad Mehta and Mr Bhupen Dalal, the
stockbrokers at the centre of the scandal.
At the end of the month, parliament is due to meet for the first time since
the summer, and opposition MPs plan to attack the government's handling of
the affair. Also, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank which has
published three reports on the scandal, is expected to release a fourth in
the near future.
Mr Ramaswamy is the third public figure to resign over the affair, which
erupted in April in the inter-bank securities trading market. He follows Mr
P. Chidambaram, the former commerce minister, who quit because of a small
investment in a scandal-tainted company, and Mr V. Krishnamurthy, a former
leading public sector industrialist and member of the government's planning
commission, who has been charged with corruption offences over alleged links
with Mr Mehta.
Mr Ramaswamy, who is 63 and has been attorney general since 1990, was
yesterday said to be in Madras, south India, and was not available for
comment. A government spokesman confirmed the attorney general had resigned
but offered no explanation.
Mr Ramaswamy made his name as one of India's toughest and most successful
lawyers and one who was never shy of promoting his own cause. 'I am
considered No 1,' he once told an interviewer. He frequently handled
sensitive political cases, including the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi,
the former prime minister.
His involvement in the securities scandal started with revelations that he
was granted a Rs150,000 unsecured overdraft facility by Standard Chartered.
Accusations followed that he had given legal advice to the bank about the
scandal.
Mr Ramaswamy and the bank denied there was anything untoward about the
overdraft, which has been repaid. They also denied that Mr Ramaswamy had
given the bank legal advice.
Mr Ramaswamy admits he had a visit from Mr Barry Northrop, the bank's
special representative for India and executive in charge of handling
Standard Chartered's involvement in the scandal, but says it was 'a courtesy
call.'
In a magazine interview last month, Mr Ramaswamy said: 'I swear I had
nothing to do with Standard Chartered Bank.' However, some of Mr Ramaswamy's
fellow lawyers are unconvinced and the Delhi High Court Bar Association has
started action to end his membership.

JORDAN'S state security court yesterday sentenced two MPs to 20 years in
prison with hard labour after being found guilty of belonging to an illegal
armed group which the court said had conspired to replace the Hashemite
monarchy with an Islamic state.
They are Mr Leith Shbeilat, the country's most popular MP and his friend and
colleague, Mr Ya'akub Qarrash.
Two merchants from Amman were also sentenced on the same charges for 10
years each.
All four sentences were commuted from the death penalty by Lt Col Yousef
Faouri, the presiding judge, who delivered the verdict in a
two-and-a-half-hour court session.
Amman was heavily policed during the sitting, with two army helicopters
circling to watch for demonstrations while troops and police cordoned a wide
perimeter around the court.
Mr Ishak Sarhan, a prominent member of the Moslem Brotherhood and member of
the appointed Upper House of parliament, said he was astonished at the
severity of the verdict.
'I am stunned and I don't think people will accept it,' he said outside the
court.
Mr Mazzin el Hadid, Mr Shbeilat's lawyer who was appointed by the court
after the original defence pulled out, said: 'The sentence is very harsh but
we respect the court's decision.'
The case against Mr Shbeilat and Mr Qarrash has been highly controversial
since the two MPs were arrested late in August.
Both men frequently voiced their Islamic fundamentalist beliefs and the
latter, in particular, was vocal in calling for democratic change and in
pursuing alleged government corruption.
One senior government source described the outcome of the case as 'a warning
from the regime to others who want to move too fast'.
The verdict must be authorised by Sharif Zeid ben Shaker, the prime
minister, before it takes effect.
Some Jordanians believe King Hussein, who celebrates his birthday on
Saturday, may intervene further to commute the sentence.

THAILAND'S civilian and military leaders have signalled a reluctance to
impose economic sanctions on Khmer Rouge guerrillas in neighbouring
Cambodia, one of the measures being considered by the United Nations in an
attempt to force the Khmer Rouge to comply with a Cambodian peace plan.
In Bangkok yesterday Mr Hun Sen, head of the Cambodian administration which
is still engaged in sporadic fighting against the Khmer Rouge, met Mr Chuan
Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, and told him that the cross-border trade
with Thailand was helping the defiant Khmer Rouge leadership.
But Mr Chuan said after the meeting: 'I told him we can't erect barbed wire
all along the border. . . People who live in the area are related so it is
impossible to stop their contacts.'
The Thai armed forces, which control the border zone and have profited from
commissions on the trade, are equally unenthusiastic about sanctions. They
say that the border is difficult to monitor and that the Khmer Rouge would
in any case be able to survive a blockade.
Gen Charan Kullavnijaya, secretary general of the Thai National Security
Council, this week dismissed the sanctions as 'western style of thinking.'
The Khmer Rouge is thought to earn at least Dollars 100m a year by selling
gems and timber from their strongholds in northern and western Cambodia to
Thai businessmen, who in turn sell oil and other supplies to the guerrillas.
UN officials and western diplomats are considering the imposition of
sanctions following the failure of the Khmer Rouge to comply with the peace
plan that they and the other Cambodian factions accepted in Paris a year
ago.
Thailand has announced that it would obey whatever decision is taken by the
UN Security Council at a meeting expected to be held later this month, but
the Thais are making it clear they consider sanctions undesirable and
impractical. While proponents of sanctions agree a blockade is unlikely to
be watertight, they think it possible to stop truck-loads of timber from
crossing the frontier.
Monitoring sanctions against the Khmer Rouge will be difficult because the
areas controlled by the four Cambodian factions are constantly shifting and
poorly defined.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Israel's biggest company seeks Dollars 180m financial aid

ISRAEL Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest company and flagship of
the important state-owned defence sector, has announced that it is seeking
Dollars 180m in emergency financial aid from the government following a
collapse in sales over the past six months, officials said yesterday.
The surprise move is an alarming sign for the government of the extent to
which Israel's military-based industries continue to be hit by falling
worldwide demand.
Until recently, IAI appeared to be secure, sustaining annual overseas sales
of Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 822m) - 17 per cent of Israel's industrial
exports.
Now IAI says it needs a Dollars 180m injection of loans and capital from the
government to stay afloat.
The company plans to cut its 17,000 workforce by 1,500 and wants to cut
wages by 10 per cent.
This follows demands from Israel Military Industries, another state-owned
arms-maker which makes the Uzi machine gun, for a Dollars 350m rescue
package. It plans a cut in its workforce by 40 per cent to 4,500.
IAI has suffered this year from falling orders from the Israeli defence
forces. But, ironically, its latest troubles are largely due to a slump in
civilian contracts, which it had built up to 20 per cent of export sales to
offset stagnating military demand.
A deal to make parts for the MD-12, a new McDonnell Douglas civilian
airliner, has been put on hold along with the aircraft itself.
A contract with Electra Aviation of the UK to convert 10 Boeing 747
passenger aircraft to cargo carriers has been cancelled, with IAI forced to
buy out the first aircraft on which it had already begun work.
Another contract with Dornier of Germany has been delayed.
Mr Doron Susslick, IAI's communications director, said the company lost
Dollars 18m in the first half of this year. In 1991, IAI had net profits of
Dollars 22m on sales of Dollars 1.6bn.
Workers at Bezeq, Israel's state-owned telecoms monopoly, have ended a
week-long strike called to protest at plans to allow private competition in
portable and international telephone services without any apparent
concession by the government.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Japan relaxes controls on share purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday relaxed controls on share purchases by
individual investors, but the announcement failed to revive turnover on a
still ailing Tokyo stock market.
Under new regulations, foreshadowed in emergency measures announced in
August, individual investors will be allowed to accumulate share holdings in
a chosen company by progressively investing a minimum of Y10,000 (Pounds 53)
with a securities house.
The ministry also said controls on employee share ownership schemes will be
eased, allowing members to change their monthly contributions at any time,
instead of the present once or twice a year. Also, these schemes will be
extended to include stocks traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market.
Japanese brokers hope the changes will encourage individuals to increase
their share purchases over the longer term, but said the measures were
unlikely to inspire an immediate leap in share trading. The Nikkei market
average rose a meagre 20.06 to 16,437.11 in thin trading.
The measures have been discussed for several years, but the finance ministry
quickened its consideration and signalled the rule changes when the Nikkei
average hit 14,301.49 in August.
Individual investors' enthusiasm for stock purchases has been cooled by the
collapse of prices since December 1989, and by a spate of securities
industry scandals last year, when leading brokers admitted that they
compensated corporate customers for trading losses.
The share of stocks held by individuals has fallen from 27.9 per cent of the
total in 1980 to 20.3 per cent last year. Sales of stock investment trusts,
preferred by individual investors, have fallen two thirds over the past two
years, while redemptions last year were more than four times higher than in
1989.
Officials at the Japan Securities Dealers' Association said individuals
would return to the market if the finance ministry agreed to tax breaks on
dividend income and capital gains.
The ministry has given no indication that it will soon provide those tax
breaks.
A separate securities industry body, the Conference for Securities
Associations, said a rise in individual investment would provide greater
liquidity in a market clogged by corporate cross-shareholdings that are
rarely traded.
The body advised Japanese companies to increase their dividend payments,
though falling profits this year have forced many companies to cut
dividends.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Chrysler to go to law against EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Eaton, chairman-elect of Chrysler, warned yesterday that the US
vehicle-maker planned to take legal action against the European Commission
in response to the Community's decision to impose a 10 per cent duty on
imports of diesel-engined Chrysler Voyager vehicles from Austria.
Mr Eaton, Chrysler vice-chairman who takes over as chairman from Mr Lee
Iacocca in January, said that Chrysler would also campaign in the US for
duties on European car imports to be increased to 10 per cent from the
present level of 2.5 per cent.
The US vehicle-maker has been angered by the EC decision to impose a 10 per
cent duty on Chrysler's Austrian-produced vehicles. The EC claims that the
Chrysler plant in Graz has breached its rules on state subsidies to the
automotive industry.
The plant called Eurostar, a 50/50 joint venture between Chrysler and
Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the Austrian engineering group, began production earlier
this year.
It is producing vehicles at the rate of around 26,000 a year (105 a day),
which will be increased to 40,000 a year (165 a day) from February, when a
second shift is introduced.
The EC decided last week to impose the 10 per cent duty on the Chryslers but
delayed implementation for two weeks until November 17 to allow the Austrian
government more time to claw back Ecu100m (Pounds 80m) in state aid to the
plant.
Mr Eaton said that under the terms of the original deal Austrian subsidies
were to amount to 33.3 per cent of the Sch5.6bn (Pounds 330m) investment in
the Eurostar plant.
Chrysler had agreed to allow this to be reduced to 22 per cent, but this had
still not satisfied the Commission.
'I am enraged about the treatment we are getting,' said Mr Eaton in an
interview in London. 'Ideally we would like the investment refunded and we
will close the plant down and pull out of manufacturing in Europe.'
'I will work hard to get the same treatment for European vehicles in the US
as we are getting in Europe. Raising the import duty in the US from 2.5 to
10 per cent would give us a level playing field.'
Mr Eaton said that it was much more expensive to build the Chrysler vehicles
in Europe than in the US. The imposition of the 10 per cent duty meant that
the project 'no longer made financial sense'.
Mr Gerhard Waas, an official in the Austrian Economics Ministry responsible
for multilateral economic ties, said last week that the ministry believed
that 'the legal grounds for a punitive tariff are insufficient - and EC
competition rules are not valid here, because we are not a Community
member.'
Mr Waas said the EC and Austria were only a few percentage points apart on
the level of allowable state subsidies. He said he believed it was still
possible to reach a compromise.

FT  11 NOV 92 / World Trade News: EC stirs export credit hornets' nest -
Plans to end government monopolies will run into flak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is poised to stir a hornets' nest across Europe's
insurance industry with plans to transfer short-term export credit
activities from government agencies into private hands.
For exporters, the reforms are likely to mean higher insurance premiums. For
insurers, the critical worry will be getting reinsurance. The Commission has
become entangled in disputes about where responsibility for reform should
lie and how to proceed.
Plans to put short-term export credit insurance for marketable risk into the
hands of private insurers have been in preparation by the Commission's
external affairs directorate (DG1) for almost a year.
In recent months, the competition secretariat (DG4) has taken up the
running, causing confusion about who is responsible for reform and delaying
implementation. DG4 argues that, as long as government agencies provide
commercial credit risk insurance, private sector competitors will remain
unfairly disadvantaged.
In a draft communication circulated inside DG4 officials complain that
Ecu3.24bn (Pounds 2.59bn) are spent each year by EC member states to support
their exporters, accounting for about 10 per cent of total state aid to
industry. All export aid, they argue, 'is contrary to the spirit of the
single market, where exporters and export credit insurers are in competition
with one another on an equal basis.'
They pinpoint six chief factors which distort competition between private
and public export credit insurers and hinder the growth of private sector
insurers:
State guarantees: these allow state insurers to borrow on the capital
markets more cheaply than private competitors and relieve insurers of
pressure to reinsure their exposure.
No obligation to hold proper reserves: this imposes additional financial
costs on private insurers.
Tax exemptions: these help both state insurers and those operating with
state support.
Subsidies and capital funding: these can include compensation for operating
losses, loans on favourable terms, no charges for use of public assets, or
failure to recover claims.
Regulation: public sector export credit insurers are often exempt from
regulatory rules applying to private insurers.
Free use of infrastructure: the draft communication singles out free access
to privileged information.
Officials, saying these distortions are incompatible with obligations under
the Treaty of Rome, are preparing a 'communication' that outlaws them
wherever an insurance risk is 'marketable.'
Export insurers across Europe have differing opinions on what risks are
marketable and what are not.
In Germany, Hermes, the government-backed export credit agency, insists
there should be 'a rather limited scope for marketable risk,' excluding
political risk and for a maximum credit term of 12 months. The argument has
particular force: Hermes claims that German reinsurers such as Allianz and
Munich Reinsurance are not ready to cover risk outside this scope. It
saysthat insurers like NCM, the Dutch private sector credit insurer, active
in the UK as well as Holland, and Coface in France have already absorbed a
great deal of Europe's private reinsurance capacity. Small insurers such as
Portugal or Greece would find themselves with very limited access to
reinsurance facilities. 'It's a matter of reinsurance capacity,' Hermes
says.
These claims are serious as Allianz and Munich Re are important reinsurers
not only in Germany but throughout Europe. However, there may be an element
of bluff: from pole position in something of a seller's market, they may
simply be signalling that reinsurance premiums are likely to go up.
Hermes would anyway face a painful transition, as would state-controlled
insurers in Belgium and Denmark, and smaller insurers in southern European
countries such as Greece and Portugal. Germany's private insurers, such as
Guerling and Algemeine Kreditversicherung, are tiny.
The 40-year legacy of offering a single export credit premium rate for all
countries means insurers have no experience of country risk assessment. That
single-rate system is to be replaced in 1993 with five risk categories; a
decision that will provide better risk guidelines to insurers and promote
the emergence of private sector insurance.
German industry, already nervous about the implications of abandoning a
fixed-rate premium system that guaranteed cheap cover in risky but important
markets in eastern and central Europe, has echoed German insurers' concerns.
Mr Harald Muller at the BDI, the country's leading industry organisation,
warns that rapid changes 'would harm not only German companies, but other
European companies too, especially when competing against Japanese and US
companies.'
He says that the worst affected would be Germany's small companies, which
find it easier to go to a single state-owned insurer for all of their export
credit needs.
The easiest transition is likely to be in the UK, where NCM last year
acquired from Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department control of the
country's short-term export insurance business.
In many ways, Commission reformers are watching the experience of NCM, in
providing commercial and political risk cover and in obtaining private
sector reinsurance, as a possible model for reform across the EC.
The Commission is expected to decide within the coming weeks how best to
proceed with privatisation. It is still unclear whether the speedier DG4
route, which will give member states six months to comply with a
communication which could be issued in a matter of weeks, will be preferred
over DG1's proposal for a directive. The latter is the lengthier route,
since the directive would need to be ratified by the EC council of
ministers.

<TEXT>
MR RAY MACSHARRY last night withdrew his resignation as the European
Commission's farm trade negotiator after burying his differences with Mr
Jacques Delors, commission president.
The move came as worldwide pressure grew to avert an EC-US trade war and to
bring about an accord on world trade reforms.
Mr MacSharry, the Irish commissioner in charge of EC agriculture, angrily
relinquished his role as farm trade negotiator last week. He accused Mr
Delors of undermining his position in talks with the US, while Mr Delors and
France suggested Mr MacSharry was exceeding his mandate.
Their differences were put aside in Brussels talks aimed at avoiding open
conflict at a full meeting of the commission today.
The commissioners were instructed by EC foreign ministers on Monday to end
their row. Mr Delors risked isolation, with most of the 16-member commission
favouring an urgent resumption of talks with the US.
Mr MacSharry confirmed last night that he would be resuming talks with the
US on their dispute over European subsidies to oilseeds farmers which has
blocked a Uruguay Round accord on broad world trade reforms.
Yesterday negotiators from more than 50 countries, meeting in Geneva,
appealed to the EC and the US to settle their differences. They mandated Mr
Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, to intervene.
Downing Street last night welcomed Mr MacSharry's return as a helpful sign.
The trade talks will be a priority when Mr John Major meets German
chancellor Helmut Kohl today.

</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is determined to fight to revive its programme of
radical economic reform - and believes it has the full support of President
Boris Yeltsin.
This would mean a showdown between Mr Yeltsin and the increasingly powerful
anti-government forces before the Congress of People's Deputies opens on
December 1.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, is working on a short-term
crisis programme for the economy, designed to safeguard the faltering reform
programme. It is intended to fulfil his promise made last month to tighten
monetary policy - in opposition to the interventionist programme being urged
on Mr Yeltsin by Civic Union, the powerful centrist bloc.
Civic Union's programme, presented to Mr Yeltsin last week together with
demands for substantial cabinet changes, calls for price controls -
including a freeze on the prices of energy and some basic consumer goods as
well as many raw materials - and control of wages and pensions.
Mr Yeltsin was said yesterday by cabinet insiders to have rejected making
substantial concessions to Civic Union, and had decided instead to support
the government's efforts to get the failing economic programme back on
track.
Any deals with the International Monetary Fund on a standby agreement or
with the Paris Club of western banks on a rescheduling of Russia's Dollars
70bn-Dollars 80bn debt are likely to fall victim to the power struggle.
Substantive discussions with the IMF on a standby agreement are not expected
to start until next year - though ministers hope to have a standby agreement
by April 1993.
The government and its policies remain vulnerable, especially to
hyperinflation. Internal figures show inflation running at 25 per cent a
month and rising. Production continues to fall, and there is as yet no
effective control of the extension of credits from the Central Bank.
However, pressure from Civic Union and the extreme left and right organised
in the National Salvation Front has united cabinet ministers and
presidential advisers into an increasingly determined group.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Sarajevo refugees begin exodus: UN distances itself from Red
Cross evacuation in response to fears about ethnic cleansing allegations

<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 Moslem and Croat refugees yesterday began a hazardous
journey from Sarajevo to Split, the Croatian port, after being trapped for
more than seven months by a Serbian siege of the Bosnian capital.
As a convoy of 14 Red Cross buses carried the women and children from the
capital, many of the passengers wept, waving desperately at friends and
families left to an uncertain future in the devastated city.
As darkness fell the convoy of overloaded buses was stranded in freezing
cold after being halted at a Serb roadblock, according to UN peace-keepers.
But the convoy was allowed to move on after being halted for only a few
hours at the Serb checkpoint. It later reached its overnight destination in
Croatian-held Kiseljak 30km away.
Plans to evacuate Serb refugees in another convoy north to Belgrade were
disrupted by transport difficulties. Only one bus left and hundreds of
people, many of them elderly were stranded in freezing weather at the
departure point.
An estimated 6,000 people are due to leave the city during the next few
days.
The United Nations has distanced itself from the evacuation because of fears
of being seen to assist the Serb policy of ethnic cleansing. Humanitarian
officials also fear that the evacuation is only the beginning of a mass
exodus from the city to escape death from exposure or starvation.
The civilian evacuation may pave the way for Serb fighters to seize Sarajevo
despite a pledge made yesterday in Sarajevo by military officers
representing the warring parties in Bosnia that they would observe a fresh
ceasefire.
The announcement coincided with reports of continued fierce fighting near
the strategically important Croat-held city of Mostar, 75 miles to the
south. Heavy fighting broke out east of Mostar on Sunday with an offensive
by the HVO, the Bosnian Croat army. Serb forces retaliated by shelling
Mostar and the Dubrovnik area of Croatia. An aid convoy had to turn back on
Monday.
Radio in Belgrade yesterday said 20 Serbs were killed and 100 injured. The
setbacks experienced by the Serb forces may explain their willingness to
sign another ceasefire pledge to take effect throughout Bosnia at midnight.
The agreement emerged from the mixed military working group meeting under UN
auspices in Sarajevo, but was greeted with scepticism.
Bosnia's Moslem-led government has rejected an offer by Mr Radovan Karadzic,
Bosnian Serb leader, of peace in return for land he has seized - nearly
three-quarters of the republic.

GREECE plans to sell majority holdings in two state-owned oil refineries in
the next few months as the government tries to speed up its much-delayed
privatisation programme.
The two refineries, which account for 40 per cent of Greece's refining
capacity, will be offered separately to international bidders. Goldman
Sachs, the US investment bank, is acting as financial adviser.
More than two years have passed since parliament approved the privatisation
of state utilities and transport companies. But disposals have been delayed,
for political and practical reasons.
It was only recently that Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, managed
to overcome opposition to privatisation from one faction of the governing
New Democracy party.
Meanwhile, international accountants were called in to audit large state
enterprises which had produced incomplete balance sheets in recent years.
This proved more time-consuming than expected, reportedly because of the
old-fashioned book-keeping methods in Greek public administration.
With mounting interest payments due on the public debt in 1993-94, the
government is anxious to secure as much extra revenue as possible. It hopes
to raise more than Dr200bn (Pounds 633m) from the sale of a 35 per cent
stake in OTE, the state telecoms monopoly.

<TEXT>
MADRID has backed away from plans to impose stiff strike rules on Spain's
trade unions, allowing the Socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez to reach its first agreement with union leaders since a crippling
one-day general strike in December 1988.
The Spanish parliament yesterday began a rubber-stamp debate on a
controversial strike law after the government and unions agreed on Monday to
a law which will define 17 sectors in which minimum services have to be
maintained during a strike.
To get the agreement signed, the government was forced to drop clauses which
would automatically have led to the dismissal of strikers who did not
provide the minimum services.
The government feared further alienating the unions in the run-up to a
general election which must be held by next October. With many unpopular
measures already imposed this year - including cuts in unemployment benefit
and direct and indirect tax increases - the government's own polls show the
Socialist party would lose up to 20 of its 175 seats in parliament if an
election were held now.
That would rob it of the bare majority it has in parliament and the prospect
is already testing party unity. Liberal ministers prefer coalition to
relaxing a tough economic convergence programme.

FT  11 NOV 92 / IG Metall clouds Bonn's hopes for solidarity pact
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leadership of IG Metall, Germany's most influential trade union,
yesterday refused further discussion of engineering employers' proposals to
renegotiate pay deals in the east or revise agreements on shorter working
hours in the west.
The decision, taken at a board meeting, will cloud hopes for an historic
'solidarity pact' between government, employers and unions aimed at helping
economic recovery in the former East Germany.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the engineering union president, said that if
employers or government truly wanted to stop de-industrialisation in the
east they should not argue with the union over pay restrictions.
'They must instead work with IG Metall to change economic and finance
policy,' he said. If employers wanted to renegotiate existing pay and hours
deals they would have to approach regional union branches. But, he stressed,
'IG Metall is not prepared to accept cuts in east German agreements'.
Under existing deals, basic wages for mechanical and electrical engineers in
the east are due to rise to match those in the west by April 1994. The
working week in western Germany, now 37 hours, will be cut by an hour next
year and fall to 35 hours in 1995.
Employers in most industries, backed by the government, argue that a
fundamental change of direction in pay and conditions agreements is
essential if the east is to build firm economic foundations and if western
industry is to remain competitive.
Mr Steinkuhler recently raised expectations for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
proposed solidarity pact with a conditional offer to accept pay settlements
for the next five years which covered only increases in inflation.
However, the outright rejection of the employers' proposals on eastern pay
and western hours demonstrates that union resistance to the establishment
concept of 'solidarity' remains unaltered. IG Metall, with 4m members,
traditionally sets the broad outlines of German union policy. West German
inflation in October was revised down to 3.7 per cent from a provisional 3.8
per cent, according to the Federal Statistics Office.
Output from German electrical and electronics factories fell by a real 4.3
per cent in the first nine months of this year, the ZVEI industry
association said yesterday.
Almost 20,000 jobs were lost, a record 50,000 workers were on short-time
during October, and capacity utilisation fell from 84.5 per cent in January
to less than 83 per cent.
The industry could expect only a slight improvement next year, depending on
recovery in export markets and tighter controls over costs.

<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday came a step closer to establishing a
central agency which would authorise new biotechnology and high technology
medicines.
Internal market ministers reached broad agreement on a system for
authorising new pharmaceutical products in the EC.
However, final agreement on a pan-European system - aimed at reducing delays
and confusion caused by multiple authorisation - will have to wait, because
Denmark is concerned that EC proposals may conflict with its own strict laws
on drugs derived from biotechnology.
The highly political question of where to site a European medicines agency
has also been deferred. It will be added to a list of unresolved problems
about the location of newly created EC agencies to be decided at December's
Edinburgh summit.
The bulk of new pharmaceuticals will still be approved at national level,
but it should be possible to market a product approved in one EC country
elsewhere without having to repeat the authorisation procedure.
Reuter adds: Ministers broke a deadlock yesterday by agreeing how to protect
cultural treasures once border controls disappear. EC officials and
diplomats said internal market ministers agreed in principle on a
two-pronged strategy - export certificates for treasures leaving the EC, and
procedures for returning treasures that have been taken illegally from one
EC country to another.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Delors to rescue of 'unlovely' treaty

IT WOULD be a mistake to renegotiate the Maastricht treaty, even though the
document had blemishes and would not win a 'beauty contest', Mr Jacques
Delors, the European Commission president, , said yesterday.
'If it (Maastricht) were undermined, we would need two, three or four years
to get a result that would probably have less dynamism and attraction,' he
said.
In a rousing speech to the first congress of a pan-European Socialist
grouping, Mr Delors said that 'declarations of interpretation' were possible
on concepts such as European citizenship if this would help the process of
ratifying the treaty in certain countries. 'But if tomorrow we had to have
an a la carte menu, then we would really have no Community at all,' he said.
There was no need to feel despair at the state of the European Community, Mr
Delors insisted, citing the achievements since 1985 in launching the Twelve
on the road to a single market. The EC's history was dotted with periods of
stagnation as well as periods of progress, and it had always been marked by
tension between adherents of the federal and inter-governmental schools of
thought.
'The Maastricht treaty is a compromise between these two streams of
thought,' he said.
The EC, national governments and national parliaments had all been guilty of
keeping the public in the dark about European developments, and more had to
be done to make the EC's workings transparent. 'It is necessary to have
clear and more direct support from the people to make this next leap forward
to European union,' he said.
Mr Delors added that the EC had to be more than an 'economic space' and
needed to have its own political personality. Already, the EC was regarded
as a major power by outsiders, he said, citing the Gatt trade negotiations.
The EC had also to be strengthened before it could be enlarged to embrace
new members. 'We need a solid house in order to bring in new guests, or new
members,' he said. 'If the house is not solid, it will be blown away by
enlargement.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / OECD presses Germany to ease rates of interest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY came under renewed pressure to ease interest rates yesterday from
its European partners in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development.
A meeting of senior finance officials, called to debate why the long awaited
economic recovery has not arrived, agreed that long-term rates in Europe may
continue to come down on the likelihood of lower inflation. They also
recommended that OECD members should ease fiscal policy to stimulate growth.
Governments should at the same time give firm promises to toughen fiscal
policy again when growth takes off, said Mr Bernard Molitor, the German
Economics Ministry director, who chaired the meeting. He stressed the OECD
still stuck to its strategy of price stability and reducing budget deficits.
The scope for German interest rate cuts was the subject of 'much debate',
said Mr Molitor, with several governments emphasising the promotion of
European business confidence that a reduction in borrowing costs could
bring.
The meeting confirmed the downgrading of OECD growth forecasts, but
predicted that inflation would continue to fall. Unemployment would start to
ease in 1994 after stabilising at an average of slightly more than 8 per
cent next year.
Accordingly, the OECD expects average growth in gross domestic product to
reach about 1.5 per cent this year, down from earlier forecasts of 1.8 per
cent. There should be a continued small recovery, about 2 per cent in 1993,
rising to 3 per cent in 1994, said Mr Molitor.
Earlier forecasts had underestimated the deflationary drag caused by the
ending of the market booms in the late 1980s and subsequent cautious lending
by banks. Even the latest lower forecasts had a big margin of error due to
blows to economic confidence inflicted by the currency market turmoil,
growth in government budget deficits and deadlocked negotiations on world
trade rules, he warned.
Mr Kumi Shigehara, head of the OECD's economic department, predicted that
average inflation would fall to 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994, the lowest
level since the 1960s, which compares with 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to
September.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Finland to forge firmer EC ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND wants to establish EC links involving 'economic, social and security
co-operation' as part of its effort to join the Community by the mid-1990s,
Mr Mauno Koivisto, the country's president, said yesterday.
He told the Financial Times during a visit to London that EC membership was
a natural consequence of Finland's long-term policy of pursuing western
integration.
Finland is applying for EC membership along with most of the other members
of the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
The president admitted that one important factor behind his country's desire
to join was Finland's fear of isolation as the EC expanded: 'In people's
minds, they see the danger that other Efta countries would have a greater
role in European integration.'
Mr Koivisto later told a lunch at the Finnish-British Trade Guild that his
country wanted to advance beyond membership of the European Economic Area
(EEA), the free-trade area between the EC and Efta due to come into effect
at the beginning of 1993.
In terms of the opening of Finland to outside competition, Mr Koivisto said
that the economic implications of EEA membership were more important than
those of joining the Community.
The main difference was in the political sphere. 'The EEA agreement does not
give us full rights to sit at the table at which decisions intimately
affecting us are made. Membership would return to us a lot of the
sovereignty that we shall lose as a result of the EEA agreement.'
Mr Koivisto said he supported the floating of the Finnish markka in
September, which led to a large effective devaluation after heavy selling
pressure.
Although the markka had not been overvalued, the strength of 'market
forces', coupled with Finland's lack of substantial foreign exchange
reserves, were the main reasons behind the decision, he said.
Finland decided not to activate foreign central bank credit lines to support
the markka because the fight on the currency market had already been lost,
Mr Koivisto said.
Finnish exporters had subsequently gained in competitiveness, and were using
the devaluation as an opportunity to expand the range of goods sold abroad.
Some sectors of Finnish industry were suffering from 'overheating', in spite
of the general effects of recession on the economy, as a devaluation of
about 20 per cent now coincided with an inflation rate of only 3 per cent,
the president said.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Support for impeachment in French blood scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S MAIN opposition parties yesterday supported President Francois
Mitterrand's suggestion that parliament should open an impeachment procedure
to clear up the question of ministerial responsibility in what one newspaper
has dubbed the 'Bloodgate' scandal.
Mr Mitterrand announced on Monday night that he would shortly propose a
constitutional reform package, partly because the existing parliamentary
impeachment procedure was an inappropriate way of dealing with the
allegations that Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist party leader and former
prime minister, and two other former ministers were culpable in the
transmitting of HIV-infected blood to more than 1,000 haemophiliacs in the
mid-1980s.
But for the time being, impeachment involving the possible trial of the
former ministers before a 'high court of justice' composed of 24 senators
and deputies, was the only way of settling the affair, the president said.
Mr Charles Millon, leader of the centre-right UDF party, proposed that the
national assembly should elect its representatives on the high court next
week.
Last month the national assembly's steering committee rejected impeachment
demands from the opposition. But the president's intervention has changed
sentiment within the governing Socialist party. This is now anxious to clear
its name and that of Mr Fabius.
By contrast, opposition leaders were generally suspicious of Mr Mitterrand's
announcement that, before the end of this month, he would also propose
changes to limit the term in office of future presidents, to strengthen the
judiciary's independence, and to alter the balance between the executive and
legislature.
Some suggested that, in coming with up such reforms after 11 years in
office, Mr Mitterrand was only trying to distract attention from the blood
contamination affair.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Efta group 'could play role in Emu': Bundesbank economist
spells  out ideas on monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE top economist at the German Bundesbank, Mr Otmar Issing, yesterday
suggested that European monetary union (Emu) could go ahead with an inner
core of European Community countries and a number of new members from the
existing Efta group.
He suggested that such a 'deepening' process involving only some of the EC
member states need not be inherently contradictory to the process of
'enlarging' the Community.
At the same time he urged what would appear to be a third tier of EC
adherence to accommodate the emerging democracies of eastern Europe - by
allowing them greater access to the EC market without full membership.
Mr Issing, who is a full member of the Bundesbank's governing council and
directorate, spelt out his ideas at a seminar on Europe organised by the
ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Bonn.
His ideas do not reflect current German government policy. However, they do
reflect the intellectual thinking about the long-term future of the EC
taking place in the highest levels of the Bonn administration, faced with
the growing uncertainty over the Maastricht treaty and European political
and monetary union.
He warned against greater institutional integration of the EC - known as
'deepening' - leading to more protectionism, by reinforcing the common rules
of key sectors such as agriculture, industry, energy and steel, at the
expense of outside competitors. That would lead to a form of 'fortress
Europe,' he said.
However, a deepening, in the form of monetary union involving only those
member states capable of meeting the EC economic convergence criteria of
strictly controlled inflation, public borrowing and budget deficits, could
be seen as a move to 'preserve the existence of the Community'.
On the one hand, that might mean the expulsion of the non-participating
states from the 'centre of gravity' of the EC.
On the other, by bringing in new member states capable of joining the
monetary union straightaway (Mr Issing did not identify the obvious two,
Austria and Switzerland), a new inner core of integrated states could be
created.
He said that such a core group could provide 'adequate internal stability'.
As far as eastern Europe was concerned, he said it was essential not to
exclude such countries as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but it was
equally impossible for them to fulfil the full EC membership criteria in the
near future.

FT  11 NOV 92 / EC struggles to keep Maastricht train on rails: The actions
of Britain have pointed up an uncomfortable truth about the pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will want some straight answers when he meets Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, at Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire today. Mindful of
the need to avoid reopening wounds in Anglo-German relations, Mr Kohl will
seek to establish when exactly the British government intends to ratify the
Maastricht treaty on European political and economic union.
So far, British pronouncements have been Delphic. Having promised to push
the Maastricht bill through the House of Commons by the end of the year or
early in January, Mr Major last week bowed to pressure from Tory
Euro-sceptics and agreed to postpone ratification until after a second
Danish referendum, probably next May.
President Francois Mitterrand's outburst on French television on Monday
night against British shilly-shallying merely echoed what many senior
officials in Brussels and other capitals are saying privately.
However irritated Mr Major will be at Mr Mitterrand's remarks, he will
attach far higher priority to the views of Mr Kohl. For whatever the
Chancellor's domestic difficulties, he is best placed to give a lead to the
Community which recently has been lurching from crisis to crisis, in the
view of a senior EC official.
By restoring a link between parliamentary approval of Maastricht to a
resolution of Danish demands for exemptions from the treaty, Mr Major upset
plenty of allies. These include officials in Bonn who are still feeling sore
after the furore over whether the Bundesbank forced sterling out of the
exchange rate mechanism.
Yet, in ordering a delay as the price of winning over Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr
Major has highlighted a truth which many EC partners have been prone to
forget: without a resolution of Danish demands for 'legally binding'
exemptions from Maastricht, there can be no second Danish referendum, and
therefore no treaty (since it requires ratification by all 12 EC members to
come into force).
The huffing and puffing which greeted Denmark's rejection of the treaty last
June obscured this truth. Member states agreed first in Oslo and later in
New York to early Maastricht ratification by all members, with the mutineers
from Denmark coming on board last.
The new British delay changes this logic. What ought to have been a balance
of 11 states against one on Maastricht ratification has changed into a 'race
to be last'. Hence, the new alliance of convenience between the UK and
Denmark which emerged on Monday at the meeting of EC foreign ministers in
Brussels.
The aim is two-fold: the avoidance of a messy divorce between the EC and the
Danes, and the early settlement of the Danish question by the Edinburgh
summit next month so as to proceed with other EC business, notably
enlargement negotiations with Finland, Sweden and Austria.
Both British and Danish officials argue that the price of a Danish divorce
would be the end of Maastricht - and a new treaty. Mr Major is likely to
point out politely to Mr Kohl that such a new treaty may well fall short of
the scope of Maastricht, particularly its provisions for political and
monetary union. As one UK official mused this week: it is far from clear
whether Mr Kohl could secure Bundestag approval for a treaty which provided
for the irrevocable linking of exchange rates on the lines of Maastricht.
Similarly, Mr Major will seek to appeal to the chancellor's interest in
enlarging the Community, to pull in richer members such as Austria which
will help redress the EC's tilt to the south and push it more to the east.
At the moment, enlargement negotiations are tied to a resolution of the
Delors II budget package and ratification of Maastricht by all member
states. But the delay in ratification has created uncertainty about the
entire enlargement timetable - and the planned review of Maastricht in 1996.
Already Belgium, which inherits the rotating EC presidency in July 1993, has
voiced complaints that there are two main priorities - enlargement talks and
implementation of the provisions of Maastricht - which appear jeopardised by
Denmark's and Britain's delays. 'Enlargement is going to be the next big
row,' says one EC official.
Faced with the unpleasant fact of a dual Anglo-Danish problem, several EC
leaders are tempted to throw up their hands. Already there is mischievous
talk in Brussels about scrapping Maastricht and trying to negotiate a new
deal among 10 states committed to some kind of European union. So far, it is
low-level talk; the intention remains to try to settle differences at
Edinburgh on December 11-12.
But that summit agenda is already looking very crowded. In the next five
weeks, the crucial bargains must be struck if the future of Maastricht is to
be settled. The question for Mr Kohl is whether he chooses to take a
confrontational line like Mr Mitterrand on Monday night, or whether he
plumps, in the words of one UK official, for 'intelligent flexibility'. No
one can yet be sure which way he will jump.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Looser curbs discussed on eve of Iraqi invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST THREE weeks before Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait on August 2
1990, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, called a meeting of senior
British ministers to consider the relaxation of restrictions on
defence-related sales to Iraq.
The meeting on July 19 1990 was the culmination of more than two years of
Whitehall battles over guidelines set out in 1985 by the then foreign
secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to prevent Britain arming either side in the
Iran-Iraq war. Its conclusions, and background papers prepared beforehand,
may prove one of the most fertile areas of investigation for the judicial
inquiry set up yesterday by Lord Justice Scott.
As a confidential Ministry of Defence background paper re-veals, the issue
of machine tool sales to Iraq was at the heart of the meeting. The paper,
dated July 17 1990, says ministers had five days earlier been issued with
intelligence assessments of Iraq's 'strategic weapons programme'.
Until then senior ministers might have claimed they were unaware of many of
the detailed decisions taken by officials and more junior ministers which
had allowed sales of sophisticated arms manufacturing equipment to Iraq over
the previous two years. But on July 19, the government papers suggest, the
issue was being discussed at the very top of the government.
Last night Downing Street said Mr John Major, then chancellor, had not
attended. But the papers make clear that a Treasury minister was
represented.
A cabinet office paper prepared for the meeting outlined a series of
options. One favoured the status quo while another called for a formal
relaxation of the rules. The third, strongly favoured by the MoD, suggested
outright abolition of the special restrictions. Previously, the Department
of Trade and Industry had fought tenaciously and, usually successfully, for
the the loosest possible interpretation of the rules.
By June 1990 Mr Nicholas Ridley, trade and industry secretary, decided to
formalise the status quo. He wrote to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime
minister, to request the high-level review. Mr Hurd was chosen to chair it.
Mr Ridley was forced to resign from the cabinet over some remarks on Europe
five days before the meeting.
The outcome is not documented in the mass of secret government papers which
emerged this week from the collapse of the court case against machine tool
manufacturers Matrix Churchill. In the event, any decisions made were
quickly overtaken by the much tighter regime imposed after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
A DIPLOMATIC row simmered between Britain and France yesterday following a
sharp reply by Mr John Major to President Francois Mitterrand's criticism of
the UK's new timetable for the ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Answering Mr Mitterrand's attack on the slowness with which the British
government intended to proceed with ratification, Mr Major issued a vigorous
warning that the timing was a matter for the UK, and not for its EC
partners.
The prime minister told MPs he had written to Mr Mitterrand giving his
views.
He added: 'I am quite prepared to state publicly that the passage of the
Maastricht bill is a matter for the British parliament and for the British
government.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, also rejected the French criticism
yesterday, at the launch of a government pamphlet which explains the treaty.
'A treaty delayed is better than a treaty destroyed or lost,' Mr Hurd said.
The treaty would in Britain undergo more detailed scrutiny than in any other
EC state. Britain had always made clear to its EC partners that this would
take a long time, he said. It was natural enough that countries which had
already ratified the treaty felt a certain amount of anxiety. But Mr Hurd
said that, in spite of that anxiety, there was a feeling that the treaty
would be ratified.
Mr Major's linking of the French president's remarks on Maastricht with the
need to prevent a trade war, was seen at Westminster as a veiled suggestion
that Mr Mitterrand was trying to use ratification as a diversion from
France's stubborn refusal to make further concessions to the US in the
Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Mr Mitterrand last night reiterated his frustration at the British intention
to delay ratification until at least next May, allegedly until after the
result of the second Danish referendum.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian
prime minister, the French president said: 'Everyone should accept his
responsibilities. We have all signed this treaty. It is now necessary to put
it in place.
'One can well understand that the British government needs a bit of time to
deal with its own problems, but one cannot hinder the process (of
ratification) that is already under way.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is also likely to voice his concern at the
consequences of Britain's delayed timetable when he meets Mr Major at a
bilateral summit at Ditchley Park, near Oxford, today.
A main worry for the German leader is the threat of a delay in talks with
new applicants for European Community membership, strongly backed by Britain
and Germany, and due to begin on January 1.
They include Austria, Finland and Sweden, which have already applied, and
Norway and Switzerland, which are expected to do so. Mr Kohl would like
those talks to go ahead regardless of the delay in ratification, but other
EC members seem likely to block them until ratification is completed, thus
undermining one of the top priorities of the British EC presidency.
However, Mr Kohl, anxious to preserve his good personal relations with the
prime minister, is unlikely to attack Mr Major openly for his decision to
postpone the Maastricht ratification process.
German officials recognise it is a question for each individual member state
to decide.
Mr Kohl will also throw his weight behind any initiative Mr Major is ready
to take to reach a settlement between the EC and the US in the trade talks.
Mr Major also had talks in London yesterday with Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch
prime minister, who made it clear that he too had strong reservations about
the British policy on ratification.
The official British line was that Mr Lubbers had expressed 'no complaints
or recriminations against the British position'. But outside 10 Downing
Street, Mr Lubbers told Dutch television that he did not understand what
Britain was doing and that he was disappointed with its position on the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Judicial inquiry ordered into Iraqi defence contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR acted yesterday to quell the mounting furore over the Matrix
Churchill affair by ordering an independent judicial inquiry into
allegations that ministers colluded to break government guidelines on
defence trade with Iraq up to the invasion of Kuwait.
But his pledge of full co-operation with the inquiry failed to weaken the
storm created by the release of some 500 pages of secret Whitehall documents
on Monday after the collapse of the trial of three directors of the
Midlands-based machine tool company accused of making illegal sales to Iraq.
In a letter to the prime minister last night, Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, dismissed his response as inadequate and demanded a public tribunal
of inquiry where ministers can be called to testify on oath.
Backbenchers of all parties expressed anger that four government ministers
had invoked 'public interest' immunities to suppress the publication of
government papers. They claimed the action was equivalent to 'sacrificing'
the businessmen to long terms in prison in order to defend dubious national
security interests.
The classified documents appear to show that a policy change in 1988,
relaxing the policy on sales of defence related equipment to Iraq, was still
in force within weeks of Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
One Ministry of Defence paper - written after the invasion - draws an
unnamed minister's attention 'to the way in which 'UK Ltd' is helping Iraq,
often unwillingly but sometimes not, to set up a major indigenous arms
industry'.
Another internal Foreign Office paper criticised as 'disingenuous' the
Department of Trade and Industry's official 'line' to journalists that there
was no evidence machine tools exported to Iraq were being used for military
purposes.
At question-time, Mr Smith said the chief concern was that equipment was
sold which could have been used against British troops and that 'a secret
change of policy' had taken place which had been concealed from the public
and the Commons.
Mr Smith asked the prime minister: 'Do you recall assuring the House in
January 1991 that 'for some considerable time we have not supplied arms to
Iraq'?
'How do you reconcile that with the revelation in the government's documents
produced at the Matrix Churchill trial that as late as July 27 1990 - only
six days before the invasion of Kuwait - machine tools known to be intended
to make fuses for missiles and artillery shells were supplied to Iraq?'
Mr Major replied: 'As you know from 1985 until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
the government operated under guidelines first set out by the then foreign
secretary, Lord Howe. Since the invasion we have operated and continue to
operate the full embargo.'
Last night, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, tabled a sharply
critical motion, citing three occasions when Mr Major, his predecessor, Lady
Thatcher, and, Mr John Redwood, then a trade minister, allegedly gave
misleading answers about the Matrix Churchill case or breaches of the policy
on sales of defence-related equipment.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, released a letter from Mr
Major, dated December 6, 1990, in which the prime minister claimed 'machine
tools . . . are not lethal'.
His letter implied that alongside the guidelines against sales of
defence-related equipment, government approval for granting export licences
took into account the need not to prejudice British industry and jobs.
Formally announcing the inquiry yesterday, Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney
general, attempted to assure the Commons that Lord Justice Scott, the judge
appointed to head the investigation, would have access to all departmental
papers and the right to call ministers.
It would be up to the judge to hold public proceedings if he so chose. His
report and evidence, where it did not breach national security, would be
published.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Hurd aims to dispel Maastricht 'myths'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is spending about a ha'penny per head of the electorate in
its campaign to persuade the British people that Maastricht is good for
them.
It has spent Pounds 125,000 publishing 250,000 copies of a pamphlet called
Britain in Europe. The publication is designed to dispel the 'Euromyths and
Euro-monsters', Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday.
A further 250,000 copies will be printed if demand is enough, taking the
total cost to Pounds 163,000.
The pamphlet is being distributed to MPs, MEPs, libraries, universities and
various agencies. It explains how the European Community works, what the
Single Market is and what changes the treaty will bring.
The cost of the pamphlet's launch compares with the Pounds 3m cost of the
government's campaign in September to explain its council tax. Then, a
leaflet was delivered to 20m households.
Mr Hurd said the government had considered distributing the pamphlet to all
households but this had been ruled out.
A Foreign Office official said cabinet convention meant the government could
not be seen to be advertising what was not yet official policy, but cost had
also been a factor.
'Some might argue that a universal mailshot would not be good value for
money,' the official added.
The Danish government, in the run-up to its referendum on Maastricht, sent
pamphlets to all 2.33m Danish households. It also distributed free 500,000
copies of the Maastricht treaty.
Copies can be obtained by writing to Freepost, PO Box 1992, Burgess Hill,
West Sussex, RH15 8QY, or by ringing 0800 778866

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab says it will need capital
injection soon

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile says it will need a capital injection from its
owners, Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, within the next three
months.
The group says the injection, added to the cost-cutting measures which it
announced on Monday and the planned launch of its new model next year,
should guarantee its return to profitability.
'These three measures combined will ensure that we do not need to return to
our owners for further help,' a spokesman said. He declined to quantify the
injection, but indicated that both Saab-Scania and GM had agreed to it.
In June 1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr5.5bn (Dollars 924m) into Saab,
but the contribution this time is not expected to be so large.
On Monday Saab announced 2,000 job losses as part of a wide-ranging
cost-cutting programme to save SKr2bn.
It also disclosed a loss of SKr1.3bn for the first nine months, and said it
was heading for a deficit of at least SKr2bn for the full year, its fourth
consecutive year of losses.

<TEXT>
OVERALL tax revenues in Germany next year will be DM10bn (Dollars 6.5bn)
less than forecast, because of the downturn in the economy, Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister, reported yesterday.
The fall in income for the central government budget amounts to DM6.7bn,
according to the figures published by the finance ministry. The sum will now
have to be added to the net borrowing requirement. Instead of a budget
deficit of DM38bn, it is now forecast at DM44bn, with the DM700m gap to be
met by increased income from other sources, including privatisation.
The government seeks savings in next year's budget. The ruling coalition
parties yesterday proposed a one per cent cut in all public service
personnel, as part of the 'solidarity pact' between central government, the
16 federal states, local government, trade unions and industry.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 2: 'Against all the odds, we're still on
track' - Profile of the prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARL BILDT, Sweden's 43-year-old prime minister, is thriving under the
pressures of office. He towers over his coalition party colleagues despite a
crushing workload. No nook or cranny of government activity seems free from
his close interest.
So far, his government has held together with few public differences. That
is quite an achievement. Mr Bildt's Moderate party may provide most of the
ideological dynamic but it must compromise with its Liberal, Centre party
and Christian Democratic partners.
At moments during the September crisis strains did emerge between them at
least temporarily, but no minister has so far had to resign. Public opinion
surveys suggest all the coalition parties have lost ground electorally but
Mr Bildt says he expected to be in a much worst position after 12 months in
office.
'Against all the odds, we are still on track,' he told the Financial Times
in an interview. He feels 'more comfortable in a funny sort of way' as prime
minister than he believes Britain's John Major does at the moment even
though his government lacks an overall parliamentary majority.
Mr Bildt is more than just a domestic-oriented politician. Perhaps only the
late Olof Palme among post-war Swedish leaders has had such a consuming
interest in international affairs. Today Mr Bildt has become a familiar
figure on the circuit of western European capitals as he prepares the way
for Sweden's entry into the European Community.
It is Mr Bildt's German connection in particular that could prove the most
important for the success of his country's forthcoming EC entry
negotiations. The Swedish prime minister was the only foreign guest at
Helmut Kohl's 10th anniversary in power party in Bonn in September. The
German Chancellor is said to treat Mr Bildt like a son and at the event
described him as a major European statesman.
Certainly Mr Bildt's unequivocal enthusiasm for the Maastricht concept of
European monetary and political union must be music to Mr Kohl's ears. He
wants to ensure Sweden becomes a full member of the European Community.
Making up for 35 years' absence from the EC, the country must be ready to
join its 'inner core'.
'Our European policy aims to give Sweden a place at the heart of European
co-operation,' Mr Bildt told parliament last month. 'It is of vital interest
for us that current European co-operation is intensified.
'The EC needs to regain momentum and enlargement next year is one of the
best ways of doing this,' he argues. Enlargement - in his opinion - is
necessary as an important signal to central and eastern Europe that the EC
is not going to be 'a closed shop' but 'open to all the democracies of
Europe as envisaged in the Treaty of Rome'.
Using the idealistic language that most European prime ministers rarely
employ, Mr Bildt still speaks about the EC with the eloquence and the
passion of a first love affair. What particularly concerns him is the need
for the EC to face up to the challenge of the turmoil in the eastern Europe.
He believes there is 'no other institution or mechanism' than the 'emerging
European union' that can ensure 'stability and prosperity to all of Europe'.
'We cannot live in a Europe that is half stable, secure and prosperous and
half unstable, conflict-ridden and increasingly economically desperate,' he
argues. If the ideal of the European Union fails, then Mr Bildt believes
this would 'play into the hands of those increasingly strong red-brown
forces of aggressive nationalism and surviving communism'.
Mr Bildt is taking his campaign every Monday to Sweden's small towns and
villages, explaining the merits of EC entry to the doubters. He remains
confident there will be a Yes vote in the country's national referendum in
1994 on the entry terms.
He is also optimistic that the four-party coalition will survive at least
until the September 1994 general election. He believes the turbulent events
of this September have not blown his government off course but reinforced
its general sense of direction through co-operation with the Social
Democrats.
But he is worried about the predicted size of the budget deficit by 1993-94
when it looks set to make up as much as 10 per cent of Sweden's gross
national product. 'The planned levels of spending and taxation are
unsustainable,' he admits. This means Sweden is only at the start not the
end of painful public expenditure cuts.
Over the coming years Mr Bildt sees Sweden's famous 'welfare state' being
transformed in phases into a 'welfare market'.
Registered unemployment will rise to levels not seen in the country since
the early 1930s but he does not believe that his political opponents will be
able to exploit this as an electoral advantage. 'One of the merits of our
agreements with the Social Democrats is that we have tied them into the
consequences as well,' he explains.
Cool under pressure, Mr Bildt continues to be a man with few self-doubts. He
believes the current of history in Sweden is moving in his party's direction
after more than half a century of Social Democratic hegemony. In the shift
of systems Sweden will grow more individualistic, dynamic, pluralist and
open. He believes the objective of a high growth-low inflation country is
realisable over the next few years.
A believer in the 'strong state' and 'political leader- ship', Mr Bildt
wants to make Sweden a more vigorous market economy. That means taking
'more, not fewer' political decisions.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 2: The state comes first - Profile of
Ingvar Carlsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INGVAR CARLSSON may only be the leader of Sweden's main opposition Social
Democratic party but he acts and thinks nowadays very much as if he was
still prime minister, writes Robert Taylor.
His decision to suspend partisan politics in September and lead his party
into the negotiation of two separate crisis agreements with the government
to save the krona and improve corporate competitiveness was unprecedented,
as the Social Democrats put the national interest before their own party
advantage.
In opposition since his party lost the September 1991 general election, Mr
Carlsson does not believe in opposing the government for its own sake.
Moreover, he has no wish to draw up shopping lists of alluring promises to
win votes. 'We need to promise less and deliver more,' he explains. 'We must
not be populist.'
Resisting the temptation of instant opposition can be a difficult strategy
to follow. Most of the party's active members would like nothing better than
to fight an unrestrained campaign to wreck Mr Bildt's shaky coalition
government. But Mr Carlsson insists the Social Democrats must be
responsible. 'I could not have looked other Swedes in the face on the bus if
I had refused to co-operate with the government in September,' he says.
Whatever private grumbling there might have been in the party's ranks over
this, nobody of substance has publicly attacked his decision.
Indeed, the unity of the Social Democrats is astonishing, with no signs of
left- wing dissent with the leadership's strategy. Only some trade union
leaders have voiced criticism about the loss of two days' statutory paid
holiday, an issue Mr Carlsson plays down in view of the crisis.
In taking such a high-minded position and making deals with his party's
enemies, he can point to a long tradition of Social Democratic government
from September 1932. The burdens of continuous office (except from September
1976 to September 1982) have shaped the ethos of Swedish social democracy
for a long time.
A similar refusal by the party to seek short-term popularity at the
government's expense can be seen in the Social Democratic attitude to the
issue of Sweden's European Community membership negotiations. Mr Carlsson's
policy on the European Community differs from the views of most of his
party's supporters, who are now very hostile to EC entry.
As the prime minister who formally presented Sweden's EC membership
application on July 1 last year, he is not going to abandon his pro-EC
position to exploit the national mood of disillusionment.
But Mr Carlsson emphasises the Social Democrats will organise their own Yes
to the EC campaign when Sweden's referendum on entry is held which he hopes
will be in the spring or early summer of 1994, a few months before Sweden's
next general election in September that year.
'My argument for joining the EC is very different from that of Carl
Bildt's,' he says. Mr Carlsson wants to strengthen the forces of the
democratic left in the Community so that it will give a much higher policy
priority to dealing with the curse of mass unemployment.
However, he has no ideological difficulties in accepting the need for
economic and monetary union. The old shibboleths of neutrality no longer
appear to concern the Social Democrats either. Mr Carlsson and his party may
dislike the 'neo-liberal' tone of much of the EC but this has not led them
to question its present evolution. What they hope to see with Swedish entry
is a strengthening of the social dimension of the Community.
Mr Carlsson may lack charisma, but he never sought high office. A modest and
decent man, he took over the premiership after the murder of Olof Palme in
February 1986, mainly out of a keen sense of duty. During the last 18 months
of his minority government between February 1990 and September 1991 he
directed Sweden onto a new course as he accepted the need to speed up the
country's transformation into a social market economy despite increasing
economic troubles.
The Social Democrats suffered disastrously in the public opinion polls,
dropping to an approval rating of under 30 per cent in early 1991. The party
recovered some ground by the general election in the autumn though it polled
only 37.6 per cent, its poorest result since 1928.
However, the Social Democrats appear once more to be riding high. The latest
opinion surveys suggest the party has about 47.5 per cent support, an
extraordinary revival in its political fortunes.
This would probably be enough for the party to form its own majority
government if repeated in the 1994 general election. But Mr Carlsson is
realist enough to accept his party may have to find a partner at least in
parliament if not in a coalition if it hopes to govern again in two years'
time.
The former Communists - now called the Left party - look set to fall below
the 4 per cent voting hurdle needed in the general election and lose their
parliamentary seats but Mr Carlsson has not seen them as a junior partner
for some time. Instead, he hankers after an alliance with the Liberals or
the Centre.
The ideology of Social Democracy may be going through an intellectual
reappraisal in Europe and the crisis of identity has even affected Sweden.
Its party's links with the trade unions have weakened with the abandonment
of their collective affiliation to local branches and many institutions of
the Swedish labour movement, such as its publishing house and its insurance
business, have known better days. But with 400,000 individual members (more
than belong to the British Labour party), the Swedish Social Democrats are
far from being a spent force.
Indeed, this autumn's financial troubles underlined what many observers have
often suspected: that in or out of office it is impossible to govern Sweden
without the full-hearted consent of its Social Democratic party.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 5: Gaps in
information on markets - Richard Waters investigates the treasury operations
of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE darkest hours for bank treasurers have traditionally come from big bets
that went wrong. They have been the bets of individual traders who have been
allowed to exceed their trading limits, leading to losses like that in
Lloyds Bank's foreign exchange department in Lugarno in the 1970s. Or they
have been the bets of entire banks, such as Midland's disastrous punt on UK
interest rates three years ago.
Now, there is another kind of loss just waiting to happen. It stems from the
difficulties of managing the increasingly complex financial exposures that
banks face, largely as a result of their involvement in a broad range of
derivative markets - markets which were created, ironically, to help banks,
corporate treasurers and institutional investors manage their exposures
better.
The Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' club, carried
out extensive interviews with 63 of the biggest players in these markets
earlier this year - 55 of them banks. Its conclusion, published earlier this
month: there are serious gaps in the information about and understanding of
the new financial markets. 'Market participants, their self-regulatory
bodies and central banks should set a high priority on deepening and
broadening collective understanding of these markets,' it says.
The extent to which banks have moved to limit their exposures varies from
institution to institution. 'Some are more cognizant of the risks than
others,' says the BIS. 'There is no single agreed best practice and, at many
firms, significant gaps remain between the desired capabilities of risk
management systems and the systems actually in operation, reflecting in most
cases the significant costs involved in implementing them.'
To operate effectively in the markets requires a 'substantial and continuous
investment in people and systems', it adds.
Most banks have now isolated risk management as a separate discipline within
their treasury departments. Barclays, for instance, divides its treasury
into liquidity management, capital funding and risk management.
According to the BIS, most also treat risk management as a senior management
concern. But many differences in approach and style remain. Some, for
instance, try to control all risks centrally - an expensive and difficult
process to follow. Others prefer to leave it to managers responsible for
particular geographic or product areas.
The hefty spending by banks on risk management has been put to the test in
recent months - and, judging by the grumbling from some senior bankers, has
been found wanting. The volatility in European financial markets caused by
pressures within the European exchange rate mechanism was greater than had
been allowed for in some banks' risk management models.
A still more serious problem was the lack of liquidity in many markets as
the crisis deepened in mid-September: any bank that was trying to hedge its
exposures as it went along was suddenly faced with an inability to trade
until the dust had settled. That greater liquidity risk is one of the
biggest new exposures faced by bank treasurers.
Others that are highlighted by the BIS include settlement risk (the danger
that a clearing house will fail) and credit risk (the growth of off-balance
sheet business makes it more difficult for banks to assess the
credit-worthiness of their counterparties in financial markets).
Concern about credit has led to increasing concentration in the markets, as
treasurers have chosen to deal only with highly-rated counterparties. That
concentration could itself potentially cause problems, since the failure or
withdrawal of any big financial institution from the market would have far
greater impact on banks at large.
It is as well to remember, though, that while new risks have emerged, the
old ones remain. Adam &amp; Co, a small Scottish bank, lost Pounds 21m - twice
its capital - earlier this year from ill-judged speculation by two of its
foreign exchange traders in currency futures. The traders hid the true
picture from their managers and took ever-bigger risks in an attempt to make
good the losses. The markets may have changed, but the risks remain the
same.
Meanwhile, recent sharp swings in currency markets have posed other problems
for the treasurers of banks operating internationally. As currencies move,
so the value of assets denominated in foreign currencies move when
translated back into each bank's domestic currency. That can cause problems
for any bank whose capital base does not match the currency composition of
its assets.
The long-anticipated rise of the US dollar potentially causes the biggest
problems. Any non-US bank with substantial dollar assets has seen its
balance sheet inflate, in domestic currency terms, as the dollar has risen.
Against sterling, for instance, the dollar jumped from Dollars 2 to the
pound in the summer to around Dollars 1.53.
If banks do not also have a substantial part of their capital in dollars,
then their all-important capital/asset ratio will have declined.
Matching capital to assets to prevent this risk may not be easy to do. Most
foreign banks' dollar capital counts only as 'tier 2' under the Basle
capital adequacy accord, and the rules stipulate that tier 2 capital cannot
exceed tier 1. So, while the rise of the dollar may have inflated tier 2
capital, it will have done little for the top tier, potentially causing
banks a problem.
This can be an expensive risk to cover. Simply buying dollars to include in
tier 1 causes tax problems. One alternative, explored by Barclays and
National Westminster, has been the use of dollar-denominated preference
shares which would count as tier 2 but would be convertible into tier 1 when
needed by the bank. Both banks have filed shelf registrations in the US to
issue such instruments, though neither has yet done so.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 4: Focus on draft
legislation - Taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAFT LEGISLATION and newly-emerging corporate practices have increased the
demand for advice on the tax implications on treasury management to
unprecedented levels in the past few years.
Emma Lubbock, lead partner in the capital markets group of Price Waterhouse,
the accountancy firm, says there has been tremendous recent change. 'It is a
very exciting and rather uncertain time at the moment,' she says. 'Lots of
companies are focusing on the area now.'
In the UK, attention is particularly concentrated on two proposed changes to
the law concerning treasury management activities being prepared by the
Inland Revenue:
The taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses; and
The taxation of financial instruments.
In addition, there are a number of draft EC directives which have
implications for corporate treasurers, including the parent-subsidiary
directive concerning the payment of interest between groups of companies.
More widely, there are emerging trends in the location and structure of
corporate treasury departments in response to variations in tax incentives
across national borders.
Ms Lubbock gives prime attention to the Revenue's planned changes to the
taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses. 'It is one of the most
significant changes in recent years,' she says.
Over the years, tax legislation has fallen behind developments in financial
and risk management techniques. The Revenue launched an extensive
consultation exercise to rectify some of the contradictions on foreign
exchange instruments which ended in January last year.
A number of significant changes were introduced as a result, and now
practitioners are waiting for the draft legislation with full details, which
is timetabled to be included in next spring's finance bill. It could thus
come into force during 1993.
In essence, the legislation would subject to corporation tax gains and
losses on foreign exchange differences incurred on capital borrowings
overseas.
At present, any realised gains can be taxed but losses cannot be offset
against them. 'There has been a huge black hole created by the anomalies,'
says Ms Lubbock. 'Foreign investors just think the UK system is daft. It is
so illogical.'
The case settled in 1989 against Woolworth, the high street retailer, raised
just one instance of the problems with the present position. The company
borrowed SFr50m (Dollars 36m) in two loans in 1971 and 1972 to be repaid
after five years.
Exchange transactions gave rise to a loss of Pounds 11.4m, which the company
claimed as a deduction in computing its profits. The courts found in favour
of the Inland Revenue, which argued that the losses were on capital account
 -even though the loan was to generate short-term cash to stock the
retailer's shelves before Christmas - and hence not allowable.
Ms Lubbock argues that the mooted changes 'will not be universally
welcomed'. Not only will new difficulties emerge from the legislation, but
many companies have structured their operations in the light of existing
rules. 'In 200 years' time, the changes may be for the better,' she says.
In the rather shorter term until the full details of the new law are
released, Price Waterhouse is advising its clients to avoid committing
themselves to long-term structures which are likely to be affected.
The second crucial legislative change concerns financial instruments for
hedging interest rate risks, which do not at present qualify for tax relief.
The proposals will tax payments and receipts of these instruments as income.
The proposed changes are taking longer to emerge than was originally
expected, and draft legislation appears to have been pushed beyond
Christmas, so that it may not appear in the Finance Bill until 1994.
Meanwhile, in the European Community, Ms Lubbock says legal changes are
likely to be somewhat slower. While rapid progress is being made on the
harmonisation of value-added tax, reform of direct taxes - including those
on corporations - is moving at a far slower pace.
Some fundamental change in location and practice is also taking place
against the backdrop of tax restrictions. 'People are thinking about
European regional structures and management across borders,' says Ms
Lubbock.
She stresses moves towards the centralisation of treasury functions, the
enhancement of treasury as a separate specialist function, and the emergence
of offshore operations.
Historically, treasury management was left to the finance director, who
often delegated the job to local subsidiaries in different countries, each
using its own banks with little co-ordination.
Now, she argues, the development of better systems, the emergence of more
sophisticated treasurers and the need to achieve cost-savings, is making its
mark. 'If you ignore the tax problems, they may wipe you out,' she says.
Tax incentives for headquarters' operations including treasury management
have led a number of companies to establish offices in Belgium and the
Dublin docks.
Other popular locations include Luxembourg, which recently introduced a new
holding company tax regime, and the Netherlands, where legislation is
amenable to long-term financing operations.
She is more sceptical of the use of true offshore tax havens, such as the
Cayman Islands. While there may be no tax levied in the location, payments
made into the location are likely to be taxed at source. The only exception
is when there are double taxation treaties - which is rarely the case for
these locations.
Ms Lubbock says there may need to be different structures to reflect the tax
implications of the different roles of treasury departments: day-to-day
management on one hand, and long-term financing needs on the other.
But she also recognises the importance of pragmatism. 'Tax planning is
great, but you've got to do something that is acceptable to the people and
the culture of the firm,' she says. 'It has to make commercial sense.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 4: A long, hard look
at controls - Ways of managing the risk managers, assessed by Simon London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE currency trading losses which hit Allied Lyons two years ago caused many
UK companies to take a long, hard look at the risks and controls on their
own treasury operations. While most finance directors vigorously denied that
the scale of losses could be repeated at their company, the episode opened a
wider debate about the best way to manage the risk managers.
The most obvious division is between companies which organise treasury as a
cost centre and those which see treasury as a discreet profit centre -
making a visible contribution to the bottom line.
Among the best-known profit-centred treasuries is Abbey National Treasury
Services (Ants), which was set up as a separate limited company when the
former building society converted to public status. Last year Ants made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 62m.
A common objection to the profit centre approach, though, is that the
'profit' contribution of a treasury operation can be subjective.
'What is the market cost of foreign exchange to a Courtaulds subsidiary? The
whole issue of transfer pricing of treasury products within a group like
ours is highly subjective,' commented Mr James Wrangham, Courtaulds
treasurer. Partly for this reason, the Courtaulds treasury is organised as a
'limited profit centre' which aims only to cover its costs.
Another contention is that it is easier to set the right culture within the
treasury team if the department is organised as a cost centre which provides
a service to the rest of the group. Otherwise, it is argued, treasury can
become an internal monopoly, more concerned with its own profits than its
contribution to the group.
But the decision whether to make treasury a cost centre or a profit centre
is by no means the end of the risk control process. A profit-centred
treasury will not necessarily engage in speculative risk-taking. Equally, a
cost-centred treasury can still make significant losses if it is allowed to
trade in an uncontrolled manner.
However treasury is organised, then, risk control starts much higher in the
company hierarchy - ideally at main board level. For example, both the
treasury and operating subsidiaries are set clear objectives which reflect
the company's broader attitude towards risk. For example, some companies -
Courtaulds among them - have a policy that all known cash flows should be
hedged. But it does not encourage forward hedging of anticipated cash flows,
which it sees as a speculative activity. Subsidiaries are under orders to be
as risk averse as possible, so anticipated cash flows which experience shows
may never materialise - due to slippage in large contracts, for example -
are not hedged.
This attitude is not the rule, however. A survey by Touche Ross Management
Consultants found only 15 per cent of large companies held to a policy of
hedging all known cash flows. The majority hedge selectively, depending on
the perceived risks. This is an area where the distinction between hedging
and speculating is by no means clear-cut. For example, companies which hedge
cash flows selectively must decide what to hedge and what to leave
uncovered. There is clearly an element of taking-a-view on the direction of
the markets in this decision-making.
When a company has set broad policy guidelines, though, lines of reporting
and conventional financial controls become vital. A big treasury operation
such as Tate &amp; Lyle, for example, measures all its outstanding positions
daily, has a specialist back-office to handle trade confirmations, and
tape-records all dealers' telephone conversations just like a small bank.
Volume of hedging greatly in excess of the amount of underlying cash flow is
a sure sign of speculative trading. Setting position limits for dealers is
an obvious place to start. These often limit the size of individual
transactions and include cumulative limits for each dealer and the treasury
team as a whole. Many treasuries also have counterparty limits to minimise
the risk of default if a bank or securities firm fails.
Tate &amp; Lyle is an example of a company which runs its treasury as a profit
centre, but with the aim of increasing management control rather than
encouraging speculation. As a commodities-based company, T &amp; L already has
something of a trading culture and its foreign exchange dealers are allowed
to trade within tightly defined limits. The aim is to sharpen the dealers'
sensitivity to market movements.
Controls often extend to the types of financial instruments a treasury
operation is authorised to use. Allied Lyons' involvement in writing
currency options - which left it open to unlimited risk when the currency
market turned against it - is an example of the risks that can arise from
certain types of transaction.
But different instruments offer different balance of risk and reward to the
company. Buying a currency forward offers a cast-iron guarantee of the rate
at which a cash flow can be exchanged. But if the market moves in the
company's favour, any potential rewards are lost. Using currency options
presents a different risk-reward profile - and a different cash cost for
buying the instrument. Leaving cash flow completely unhedged produces a
different result again.
One positive result of the Allied Lyons affair is a greater degree of
disclosure by companies of exactly what their treasury management policies
are. An increasing number of annual reports contain a passage on treasury
policy - including which instruments are used and which cash flows are
hedged. This level of disclosure could, in itself, act as a management
control by making treasury publicly accountable.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 4: Cash is now
definitely king - Liquidity management is at the heart of the treasurer's
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In the end, accounting and investment all comes back to cash. Whereas
manufacturing profits is relatively easy, cash flow is the most difficult
parameter to adjust in a company's accounts.'
Terry Smith, Accounting for Growth
IF EVER there was doubt on the matter, cash is now definitely king. The
recession has forced investors to look carefully at the cash flow of
companies. Companies have responded by improving cash flow and squeezing
working capital.
For company treasurers, this means getting back to basics. For all the
attractions of derivative financial products and the lure of the capital
markets, liquidity management is at the heart of the treasurer's role. This
is unlikely to change. Indeed, as the economy pulls out of recession, the
cash position of many companies is, if anything, likely to worsen.
There have been hard lessons along the way. Polly Peck reported a Pounds
160m pre-tax profit in its last full year of existence, but a glance at the
cash flow statement showed ballooning indebtedness. Thankfully, new
accounting standards have laid down strict guidelines for company cash-flow
statements. Armed with comparable information for all UK companies - and the
hard lessons of recession - investors are not likely to ignore the role of
cash.
Financial Reporting Standard 1 (FRS1), which came into effect this year,
makes some significant advances over earlier 'flow of funds' statement -
which often simply involved a new presentation of information found
elsewhere in the accounts. FRS1 demands new information and makes sure that
companies show cash flow separated into five distinct areas: operating
activities, return on investments and servicing of finance, investing
activities, financing and tax. It also strictly defines cash or cash
equivalents as instruments with a maturity date of less than three months.
Some companies are going even further than FRS1 to show the real nuts and
bolts of cash flow. Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, is including a
cash statement in its report and accounts which follows the form of its
internal management accounts.
The accounting standards may have changed, but the essence of cash
management within companies is the same as ever. The foundation of cash
management is the cash-flow forecast, done annually by most companies and
then honed by monthly and weekly forecasts. Really efficient cash management
involves monitoring daily flows, so there is no unnecessary use of overdraft
facilities, for example, while surplus cash is sitting elsewhere in the
business.
Perhaps the biggest policy issue for companies is whether cash management
should be centralised within group treasury or devolved to operating
subsidiaries. Like the decision whether to organise the treasury as a cost
centre or profit centre, the choice is usually a matter of corporate
culture. The cost savings of having a centralised cash management operation
must to be measured against the risk that cash management disciplines will
be lost in operating subsidiaries.
Companies overcome the problem in a variety of ways. The most common
approach is to ensure the treasury treats operating subsidiaries as if it
were a commercial bank - charging them at cost of funds for credit and
giving credit when the current account is in surplus.
The recession, though, has brought new challenges. The pressure on companies
to squeeze working capital is intense. This is beyond the remit of the
treasurer alone, involving real operating efficiencies such as reducing the
turnover of stock, and collecting debts earlier.
Other than the mechanics of monitoring cash flow, the treasurers' key
concern is to have external finance available to cope with an unexpected
cash squeeze. For such unforeseen eventualities, secure bank credit lines
are the answer.
This is one reason why complex multi-option banking facilities are out of
favour with many corporate treasurers. The structure, which involves a core
committed loan facility topped up by an uncommitted panel of lenders, left
some companies - Laura Ashley is the best example - starved of funds when
they most needed an injection of cash.
The recession has also brought some hard lessons for companies with a pile
of surplus cash to manage. The deteriorating credit quality of banks -
although the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
belongs perhaps in a different category - has raised the issue of
counterparty risk to a prominence undreamed of few years ago.
For example, many corporate treasurers invested spare cash in variable rate
notes issued by financial institutions. The notes carry a long maturity but
were 're-marketed' or auctioned every three months to offer investors a cash
proxy. This worked well until the credit quality of some issuers was called
into question. Then the re-marketing process seized up because sellers
unable to find buyers and the notes became relatively illiquid.
Against this, lower interest rates mean that simply holding cash on deposit
is a less attractive option. Cash-rich companies such as Associated British
Foods, which has a long-standing cash pile of around Pounds 500m, will have
to work hard to prevent lower interest rates translating into sharply lower
profits.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 3: Vital tool in
minimising costs - The proportion of swaps linked to new issues has been
declining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 4,000bn global swaps market has become a vital tool for
corporate treasurers in minimising funding costs and managing exposure.
The availability of interest rate, currency - and now commodity - swaps to
hedge exposure or match assets and liabilities has been an important factor
in changing attitudes to corporate treasury management.
'It is no longer acceptable for companies to attribute poor performance or
results to market movements,' according to one commodity swaps trader.
A swap agreement is an exchange of liabilities between two (or more)
counter-parties. Although many swap market participants are keen to point
out that the market is used for hedging and not speculation, decisions over
swap transactions often require a view on the market. But a decision not to
use such instruments also expresses a view on market movements.
In the case of interest rate swaps, for example, if a treasurer believes
interest rates are rising, he may wish to swap floating-rate for fixed-rate
liabilities.
A swap agreement is often linked to a financing in the debt markets, since
the form in which a particular company can most easily raise funds is not
necessarily best suited to the company's needs. For example, a German firm
may be able to raise relatively cheap funds in D-Marks, while it requires
dollars to fund a subsidiary in the US. If it can find a US firm that
requires D-Mark funds, the two can swap their liability payments to their
mutual advantage.
But the proportion of swaps linked to new issues has been declining, due to
the erosion of arbitrage opportunities as disparities between markets break
down.
In earlier years, because retail investors, once the mainstay of the
Eurobond market, were unsophisticated in assessing the value of bonds,
companies could often issue fixed-rate bonds and swap the proceeds into
floating-rate funds at a level substantially below the London interbank
offered rate. Increasing participation by sophisticated institutional
investors has contributed to a narrowing of swap spreads.
In addition, the growing sophistication of swap dealers themselves means
that any opportunities are swiftly arbitraged. 'By its nature, arbitrage
removes the pricing gap that was its raison d'etre. I don't believe there
will be a return to the sort of arbitrage opportunities available in the
past,' according to Mr Malcolm Basing of Swiss Bank Corporation, who chairs
the International Swap Dealers Association.
Swap spreads - the differential between the yield on the government bond and
on the comparable swap - have been at historically tight levels for some
time, making it almost impossible for most borrowers to swap fixed-rate
funds, except at margins often well above Libor.
However, tight swap spreads are also a function of present views on interest
rates, and of supply and demand, so changes in market trends can prompt a
widening of spreads. For example, US dollar swaps spreads recently widened
sharply, as a result of a change of view on US interest rates, now at a
cyclical low. Expectations that US rates are set to rise soon prompted a
sudden proliferation of fixed-rate payers - that is, counterparties keen to
lock in fixed-rate funds while interest rates are low. This created
attractive swap opportunities for companies wishing to obtain floating rate
funding.
Similarly, the recent fall in UK interest rates prompted a rash of activity
in the sterling swaps market, as companies switched floating-rate
liabilities into fixed-rate liabilities.
New techniques allow companies to tailor transactions to their precise
needs. For example, some companies have swapped into floating-rate while at
the same time buying caps, which limit the risk of rising interest rates.
Attitudes in the corporate treasury are also shaped by the nature of a
company's core business. For example, if a business is highly negatively
correlated with interest rate movements, such as in the building industry,
there is a strong need to protect the business from rising interest rates.
On the other hand, the company may be less concerned about benefiting from
falling interest rates, since the business itself is likely to flourish in a
low interest rate environment.
A business less vulnerable to interest rate movements may be more determined
to benefit from falling interest rates, and so may keep a higher proportion
of its borrowings in floating-rate form.
While the proportion of new issue business has waned, new participants have
entered the market, as a broader range of companies became familiar with
swap market techniques.
Companies, which used to be concerned merely with finding cheaper ways of
raising primary debt, are much more attuned these days to the ongoing
management of their liabilities, and frequently use the swap market to
adjust their interest rate exposure.
'The advantage of the swap market is that it allows you to adjust exposure
profiles without having to undo the underlying transactions,' said Mr John
Grout, director of Treasury at Cadbury Schweppes.
Similar techniques using commodities now allow oil companies - or transport
companies which need to consume large amounts of oil - to reduce their
exposure to price changes. The size of the commodity swap market has grown,
according to estimates, from Dollars 3bn in 1988 to Dollars 10bn before
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and is now believed to total Dollars
40bn. As much as 80 per cent of commodity swaps business is believed to
consist of oil-related transactions.
The market in short-dated currency swaps is also very active. Many companies
use the market to hedge themselves, when day-to-day transactions create
currency exposure. For the most part, though, companies do not hedge
translation exposure, a practice which is not always viewed favourably by
shareholders.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 3: New openings for
finance - Tracy Corrigan looks at funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CORPORATES have traditionally relied heavily for funding on the
well-developed UK stock market. When stock market conditions prove
unfavourable, as they have recently, or when companies want to borrow
long-term funds for capital investment, the options available may prove
rather narrow.
Unlike some other markets, there is not a developed UK domestic corporate
bond market. While there is a small, expensive but accessible market for
very long-dated secured funding, unsecured funds must generally be raised in
the international capital markets or from banks.
Only the largest, top-rated companies can be sure of accessing the
international bond markets when they need funds. They do not depend on the
health of any single market, since their credits are acceptable in a wide
range of currencies, and they can then swap the proceeds into the currency
required.
Bond financings ran at record levels for the first half of this year. In the
past few years, bond markets have mostly flourished, allowing companies,
especially in the US, to refinance expensive debt acquired during the 1980s,
often through takeover activity.
But the collapse of European bond markets following the Danish rejection of
Maastricht in the June referendum prompted a change of sentiment among
investors. Subsequently, the availability of investment funds for corporate
bonds has come under further threat. Heavy losses in the foreign exchange
market in September by central banks attempting to prop up their currencies
has left a number of European sovereign borrowers with higher funding needs.
These sovereign borrowers could squeeze out corporate borrowers, which are
normally weaker credits. The expectation of higher volume has already caused
yield spreads for sovereign paper to widen, relative to the comparative
government bond market. This has also pushed out corporate bond yields.
Corporate borrowers are finding new opportunities, however, in the Euro
medium-term note (MTN) market, which is expanding rapidly.
Outstanding paper in the Euro MTN market rose from Dollars 13bn at the end
of 1990 to Dollars 28bn at the end of 1991, according to Webster's Database.
By the end of this year, it could reach Dollars 50bn.
The flexibility of the MTN market - which works on a principle of matching
issuers' and investors' needs - has proved appealing to corporate borrowers.
Although they still make up a relatively small part of the market, they are
a key target for banks keen to increase the size of the market.
The borderline between Eurobonds and Euro MTNs has become increasingly
vague, as more borrowers set up Euro MTN programmes under which bonds and
notes can be issued. The advantage for the borrower is that such a structure
creates substantial cost savings.
For weaker credits, the stringent demands for strong ratings in public bond
markets have edged some borrowers to the private placement market. While
interest from Japanese leasing companies, the mainstay of the market in the
1980s, has dried up due to the problems in the Japanese financial system,
interest from US institutions has grown. An increasing number of UK
companies have issued debt in the US market under the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission's rule 144a, which allows unlisted securities to be traded by
authorised institutions such as insurance companies. These institutional
investors are hungry for high-yielding corporate paper, as a result of the
demise of the US junk bond market combined with the climate of low US
interest rates.
After a strong start to the year, allowing companies an opportunity to
rebuild their capital base, equity markets have also become more difficult
to access, again, especially for weaker credits. For example, GPA, the Irish
aircraft leasing group, was forced to cancel its Dollars 800m international
equity offering, when it became clear that there was insufficient investor
demand, due to concerns about the company's future. Some large, successful
deals, such as Wellcome's sale of 288m shares, absorbed surplus demand,
leaving weaker names to struggle.
The syndicated loans market is in a period of long-term decline. The volume
of syndicated loans in the first half of the year amounted to Dollars 164bn
in the first six months, 32 per cent down on the first half of 1991,
according to Euromoney.
Banks are under pressure to conserve capital to meet new capital adequacy
requirements under the Basle accord, which come into force in January 1993.
The nature of the capital requirements, which gives a zero-risk weighting to
sovereign debt, has further discouraged corporate lending. A number of
recent bad experiences have made banks increasingly wary of lending to
companies which could face financial difficulties.
Companies themselves are increasingly wary of taking on too much short-term
bank debt, having seen the fate of a number of companies which relied too
heavily on short-term financing. In addition, more expensive pricing has
deterred companies from setting up large facilities which they may not need
to use. Many companies are not renewing cheap Multi-Option Facilities (MOFs)
set up in the mid-1980s, since pricing has become prohibitive.
However, in some cases syndicated transactions are being replaced by
bilateral agreements (direct lending by a single bank to a company). This
trend has been exaggerated by a growing desire among companies to create
stronger banking relationships.
The general rule seems to be that plenty of financing is available to those
borrowers who do not need it. The lack of a domestic corporate bond market
allowing smaller or weaker credits to raise funds from domestic
institutions, and of a credible banking market, means that many companies
have to rely on expensive and uncertain short-term financing.

finds favour - Sara Webb examines banking relationships during a recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHAT A difference a recession can make. While the 1980s were characterised
by cheap and easy access to bank loans, the early 1990s will probably be
remembered by UK corporate treasurers as a time of high borrowing costs and
tighter credit. With the change in the economic climate, many companies are
being forced to re-examine their banking relationships and the scale of
their bank borrowings.
Looking back on the 1980s, many corporate treasurers would agree that they
were spoilt for funds. The banks competed fiercely for new business, with
the result that companies were able to borrow at very fine margins. Indeed,
the low pricing on loans and standby credit facilities often encouraged
companies to set up credit facilities exceeding the amount they actually
required.
One of the most popular forms of borrowing was the Mof - or multi-option
facility - which was prevalent in the late 1980s. A Mof consists of two
parts: a committed portion (or backstop) where a bank syndicate is committed
to lend at an agreed margin over the London interbank offered rate, as well
as an uncommitted part (called the tender panel) where the banks compete to
lend money, usually over the short term.
Competition between the banks was so great that companies could obtain
financing at margins of between  1/16 to  1/8 of a percentage point over
Libor. 'There were plenty of corporate treasurers who thought it was a
wonderfully cheap way to obtain money even if they didn't need the funds at
the time,' reflects one UK banker.
However, times have changed. For a start, the pricing on loans has increased
substantially since the late 1980s as the international capital adequacy
requirements agreed by the Basle Committee have forced international banks
to adopt a more selective approach to lending. A rash of corporate disasters
 -including such names as Polly Peck, Brent Walker and the Maxwell empire -
has prompted bankers to pay closer attention to the creditworthiness of
their customers. Many banks are now placing more emphasis on their loan
covenants, with the inclusion of tighter financial ratios - particularly
those concerning interest cover and gearing.
Average spreads on new loans have risen from about 50-60 basis points in
1989-1990 to around 80 basis points in 1992, according to the recent OECD
report, Financial Market Trends, June 1992. Bankers claim that the overall
pricing - including spreads and fees - has risen two to three times since
the 1980s.
The increase in pricing has forced corporate treasurers to consider two
points: whether they need to replace in full those loans and credit
facilities approaching maturity, and whether there are cheaper ways of
obtaining bank loans.
On the first point, bankers agree that many companies borrowed far more
money than they needed when the pricing on loans was low. 'In many cases,
the companies didn't need the money, they just did Mofs because they were so
cheap. Companies often borrowed between 30-70 per cent more than they
needed, so when they come to renegotiate the credit facilities, they are
likely to borrow far less,' says one banker. Another adds: 'We've seen
plenty of companies scaling back their borrowings as their Mofs mature -
after all, they ask themselves 'Why spend that amount on borrowing when we
don't need it?' '
In addition, the debate among corporate treasurers and their bankers is now
more likely to focus on the advantages of bilateral loans over syndicated
credits. Several companies have chosen to refinance their borrowings using a
series of bilateral loans.
BP and Reckitt &amp; Colman have followed this route: when BP refinanced its
borrowings last year, it cut back the amount of the loans and the number of
banks involved.
Choosing the bilateral route can mean a lower overall borrowing cost for the
company. One banker cites the following example: 'We were approached by a
company which wanted to refinance its loans. The company told each of its
relationship banks to quote their terms for a three-year loan of between
Dollars 50m-100m. It then borrowed from those banks which offered the most
favourable pricing, so that instead of setting up a large syndicated credit,
it had a series of bilateral loans, where each of the participating banks
had a separate bank agreement and where the pricing varied slightly from
bank to bank.'
'The bilateral route continues to be attractive to companies because it
gives them much more clout over their banks and they can get finer terms
that way,' says one of the European banks in London.
In addition to obtaining finer pricing, some companies see the bilateral
route as a way of spreading out the debt maturity dates. 'With a syndicated
credit you have one loan and one maturity date - but not every company wants
to have Dollars 500m maturing on the same day. Instead they may prefer to
have bilateral loans which mature in stages,' points out one UK banker,
although he adds that the borrower needs to have a well-organised treasury
department to deal with the administration of a complex array of loans.
Bilateral loans do have their disadvantages. It can prove much more
difficult to raise a large amount in total using a series of bilaterals.
Bankers argue that if a company needs to borrow a large amount all in one
go, the syndicated loans market still provides the easiest means of doing
so, but while pricing remains high, the level of corporate borrowing is
likely to remain relatively subdued.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 2: In search of full
protection - Katharine Campbell on new products to help manage risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST corporate treasurers are by now at least broadly familiar with the
staple building blocks of treasury risk management - with forward rate
agreements (FRAs), swaps, caps, and foreign currency options.
So the trick for banks is to devise new combinations of the standard
instruments - approaching the elusive goal of the ideal risk management
product which is, roughly, full insurance protection, at no cost, with
maximum flexibility.
Below are some of the new products available: FRA's are now widely accepted
as one of the most powerful ways of hedging interest rate risk, so it is no
surprise that bankers have experimented with a similar concept applied to
the world of foreign exchange. Generically known as Safes, or synthetic
agreements for forward foreign exchange, these products were first applied
in the interbank market some years ago to reduce settlement risk. Treasurers
are just getting interested, says Perry Power, director and head of risk
management at Mitsubishi Finance International in London.
There are two types of Safe, the exchange rate agreement or ERA which
protects the purchaser against a change in the forward foreign exchange
spread; and the forward exchange agreement (FXA) which protects against a
change in the spot rate as well as the forward spread.
Suppose the pound is trading at Dollars 1.55 against the dollar for spot
delivery two days from now, and a treasurer wishing to buy pounds for
dollars in a month's time is quoted a spread of 65 points, meaning a rate of
Dollars 1.5435. It may not fit into his strategy to do an outright forward -
he may, for instance, as is often the case with FRA users, be hedging a
contingent liability. With an ERA or FXA he can protect the spread without
exchanging principle, and without using up bank credit lines and so on.
With an ERA he could lock into a spread, say for three months starting in
one month's time. Traditionally that same effect could only be achieved by a
so-called forward forward, buying pounds for dollars in four months' time
and selling pounds for dollars in three months.
An FXA is more like an outright forward. The treasurer gets or gives the
difference between the FXA rate agreed for, say, an outright 3-month rate in
one month's time and the actual 3-month rate in a month. So if the 3-month
outright is at Dollars 1.55, and the 3-month FXA was Dollars 1.5435, he gets
or gives the difference, depending on whether he is a buyer or seller of
pounds.
Differential or 'diff' swaps are designed to exploit the inverse
relationship between two yield curves - until recently for instance between
the negatively sloped D-Mark curve and the positive US dollar interest rate
curve.
A US dollar-based investor could index the coupon of his dollar floating
rate note to D-Mark rates. So instead of receiving, say, a coupon paying low
dollar Libor rates, he can still receive dollars, but calculated instead
using the D-Mark Libor rate - 8.5 per cent, say, minus a spread of 2 per
cent. The investor hence incurs no foreign exchange risk, but pays a
premium, included within the 2 per cent deducted. The FRN issuer, meanwhile,
will not want to incur a D-Mark liability, and so enters into a swap with an
intermediary bank - which assumes the foreign exchange rate risk on the
differential between US dollar Libor and D-Mark Libor.
Another play on the yield curve: the investor hopes US dollar rates will not
rise as quickly as the yield curve suggests or that D-Marks will not fall as
quickly. If everything happens as the yield curve predicts, he gets no net
saving - and runs the risk that rates move higher in the US and lower in
Germany than expected, market moves that would actually cost him money.
A newish twist among an array of interest rate products is the swap where
Libor is set in arrears, a product well suited to an environment with a
steeply positive yield curve, as has been seen in the US. It is used by
borrowers of fixed rate dollars who are swapping back into floating rate for
a portion of the term to take advantage of short-term rates. The
libor-in-arrears swap gives added exposure to variable rates. Normally
interest payments on a swap, as on other instruments, are set in advance and
paid in arrears, whereas in this case they are set in arrears as well. So,
if the interest period falls quarterly, and interest is due between March 31
and June 30, a treasurer would make the three-monthly payment on June 30 at
the Libor rate on that day rather than at Libor on March 31. This
essentially appeals to those who do not believe that rates will rise over
the term of the swap as much as the slope of the yield curve implies. 'It is
not a structure for the timid,' explains John Walker of J C Rathbone
Associates, the financial risk consultants.
Another product J C Rathbone, among others, has been developing recently is
the combination of a fixed rate swap with a floor. This is a risk-averse
structure that will work with either a positive or negative yield curve.
Essentially, it offers borrowers the chance to fix a rate but also to
benefit if rates stay the same or fall. The procedure, in a recent example,
would be for the treasurer to fix his 5-year dollar borrowing cost at 6.05
per cent, and simultaneously to buy a floor 50 basis points below that, at
5.5 per cent. This would cost 3.14 per cent, says Mr Walker. Current 6-month
Libor is 3.56 per cent, so he is giving up 2.5 per cent immediately, but,
because of the floor, he will achieve a reduced cost of borrowing if rates
fail to rise up to 5.5 per cent.
For instance, if in the first six months rates stay the same, he will
receive an immediate rebate of 1.99 per cent; if at the next payment date
interest rates have edged up to 4 per cent, he still receives 1.55 per cent
back.
Another dimension of flexibility is that, if he wants to avoid paying the
premium upfront, he may negotiate with the provider of the instrument to pay
the premium over time, thus increasing the fixed rate by 0.72 per cent.
The danger is rates rise more quickly than implied by the shape of the yield
curve, in which case the borrower will not recover his premium - though he
remains protected by the swap which will have increased in value.
With a negative yield curve, the process is similar, except the treasurer
gets his benefit not immediately, but when rates start to go down.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 2: Gut feeling
guides decisions - After Black Wednesday, James Blitz looks at foreign
exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK treasury managers whose companies trade overseas, the world has
suddenly become a more uncertain place.
Until the autumn of this year, corporate treasurers with a large exposure to
foreign currencies could afford to be relatively relaxed about the pound's
exchange rate against the D-Mark and the dollar.
Importers, for example, knew that sterling's membership of the exchange rate
mechanism meant that the pound could not fall below DM2.7780 against the
D-Mark. Europe's moves towards economic and monetary union also reduced
exchange rate volatility as the continent's economies appeared set on
convergence.
And then there was Black Wednesday.
Sterling's suspension from the ERM on September 16 was the climax of the
worst currency crisis for decades, and was followed by a 19 per cent
devaluation against the D-Mark. Now, a 2 or 3 pfennig fluctuation in the
sterling-D-Mark rate, which would have been deemed unusual a few months ago,
is seen as normal. And the forecasts for the pound's exchange rate next year
look gloomy: some City economists predict a fall to Dollars 1.20 and DM2.30.
According to Mr Les Halpin, a director of N P Record Treasury Management in
Windsor, Berkshire, the floating pound is a hazard for companies which trade
overseas. 'People are suddenly much more aware of the risks,' he says. 'The
dealings and profits which a company has at any moment can be wiped out in
hours, let alone days.'
More and more treasury managers are now asking how they can hedge their
currency exposure. A survey by the management consultants Touche Ross,
showed that 85 per cent of companies had selective hedging cover last year.
Interest has grown even more sharply in recent months. 'We advise 25 of the
FT-SE 100 companies, and quite a large number have increased their hedging
activity since Black Wednesday,' says Mr Derek Ross, a Touche Ross partner.
Who should do the hedging? And how should it be carried out? Treasury
managers need to consider a number of factors.
First, they must decide what kind of exposure they have to currencies.
Specialists divide the risks into two categories.
Companies with 'transactional' exposure make sales in foreign currencies or
have foreign currency borrowing or investment. These are seen as the prime
candidates for currency hedging because fluctuations in exchange rates give
rise to real gains and losses in cash terms, and have a direct impact on the
profit and loss account.
Those with 'translation' exposure have a more difficult judgment to make.
The risk to these companies arises when amounts fixed in foreign currencies
are given sterling equivalents for accounting purposes. This can change
sterling reported values such as consolidated net wealth, altering a
company's borrowing capacity or ability to make dividend payments.
Second, they must decide what kind of hedging instruments to use.
By taking out a forward contract, a company locks itself into exchanging
cash at a given rate at a fixed moment in the future.
The advantage of these contracts is that they minimise risk, and the company
ignores any potential losses or gains that would be accrued if, in the
meantime, sterling changes its rate.
According to Mr Ross, some companies find it particularly attractive to take
out these fixed contracts at the moment because UK interest rates have
fallen below those in Germany. This means that companies with D-Mark
payables will get more D-Marks for each pound. 'In certain cases this can
prove very attractive,' says Mr Ross.
Alternatively, a company buys options. This effectively allows it to place a
bet on currency movements by paying a premium to a bank. If an exchange rate
moves in an unfavourable direction, the bank is obliged to sell currencies
at a more favourable rate.
In the wake of the recent currency crisis, however, option premiums have
shot up. 'We find that our customers are keener on taking out options now,'
says Mr Halpin, 'but the banks have had problems with options underwriting
and premiums have become more expensive.'
Corporate treasurers must also decide when to manage the currency exposure
themselves or farm it out to specialist advisers.
In-house management gives treasurers more security over funds. But foreign
exchange management is a highly technical and growing business, and analysts
say that it can pose problems for the uninitiated.
'It's very important that treasury managers are not seen to be operating in
a black box,' says Mr Ross. 'Decisions need to be taken in line with the
changing nature of the business, and in a manner that is comprehensible to
executive board members.'
Whatever a corporate treasurer decides, he or she needs to bear in mind that
currency hedging can only provide a short-term breather in the event that
exchange rates are permanently realigned.
If, as some economists believe, sterling is undervalued against the D-Mark
and should rebound next year, then treasurers can happily hedge the exposure
over the next few difficult months.
But if sterling's recent devaluation is not reversed, and the currency stays
at around DM2.40, treasurers and board members may be faced with the need to
radically restructure their businesses. Companies may need to find new sales
markets and new sources of capital stock. A few may have to close their
businesses altogether.
Unfortunately, in Britain's current political and economic climate, even the
most experienced economists are uncertain where the pound will be in a month
let alone a year. For treasury managers, the decision on how to respond to
the pound's devaluation may be down to gut feelings as much as anything
else.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management: From back room to
mainstream - The treasury function has come to be recognised by companies
big and small as a vital component in financial planning and control.
However, the debate about whether the department should be run as a cost or
a profit centre continues

CORPORATE treasury management, once the domain of back-office boffins, has
come to be recognised as a vital part of a company's financial structure.
Responsibilities range from handling relations with the company's banks and
arranging cash transmissions to hedging exposure in foreign currencies and
raising outside finance. Depending on the size of the company, these
dealings may be handled by anyone from the chairman to the company
secretary, but Mr Derek Ross, a partner at accountants Touche Ross,
estimates a company needs to consider hiring a full-time treasurer when
turnover reaches Pounds 200m to Pounds 250m.
Even in small companies without an identifiable treasury operation, the
treasury function exists. At large companies such as BP, the treasury
operation is the size of a small bank.
The loss of Pounds 150m on foreign exchange dealings by the treasury
department of Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, proved a vivid
reminder of the danger of losing control of corporate treasury operations.
The Allied-Lyons debacle helped start a trend for greater integration of
treasury operations, with stronger ties to the main board of the company.
Greater efforts are being made by many to keep the treasurer in the
mainstream, with large groups, such as BP and Unilever, putting line
managers in charge of treasury operations. The job of the treasurer is to
'keep the company's options open, so it can launch a new product or open a
new factory,' believes Mr Gerald Leahy, director-general of the Association
of Corporate Treasurers.
Recessionary pressures have also reinforced the importance of strong
treasury operations, with funding or liquidity difficulties threatening to
bring many companies down. Mr Leahy, believes the recession has re-focused
attention on the core role of the treasurer: 'If there is no cash, there is
no business,' he points out.
Large, top-rated companies can still gain financing in the public bond
markets, but there has been a shift away from some of the complex structures
used for funding in the 1980s, such as multi-option facilities and puttable
convertible bonds, as companies try to rebuild banking relationships.
Banks themselves, however, are strapped for cash, and have become
increasingly cautious about corporate lending, following a series of huge
losses on the Canary Wharf development in London Docklands, the Maxwell
empire and elsewhere. Pressure on bank capital, owing to the imposition next
year of new capital adequacy standards by the Basle committee on bank
supervision, a grouping of international bank regulators, has further
constrained lending. The structure of the capital requirements, which
requires smaller amounts of capital to be set aside for sovereign than for
corporate loans, has also discouraged lending to companies.
'Until the banks get back to lending money again, we may not have a recovery
(from recession in the UK),' Mr Leahy observes. 'Medium- and smaller-sized
companies are being crucified. Entrepreneurial companies which were
encouraged to borrow money through bank credit lines and overdrafts during
the 1980s are now being told to repay.'
The practice of recalling funds from over-extended companies, which borrowed
heavily in the credit boom of the 1980s, effectively putting them out of
business, has, indeed, become increasingly common. In addition, many viable
businesses have come under threat, as a result of the withdrawal of banks
from the market. Many foreign banks have, for example, pulled out of the UK
market, after offering aggressive rates to gain business in the 1980s and
some of these bank lines have proved difficult to replace.
Many corporate treasurers now take a dim view of bankers' attitudes, though
when banks were competing for their business at cut-throat rates in the
1980s, treasurers were keen to squeeze the last basis point from a deal.
Many companies have now established stronger lines of communication with
their bankers, so that the bank can be kept informed of any potential
cash-flow problems.
Greater attention to bank relationships, and an unwillingness to rely too
much on short-term debt, are among the ways in which companies have become
more risk-sensitive. Company treasurers have also become more concerned
about credit risk. While some companies have suffered because of their own
declining credit-worthiness, other companies have begun to focus on their
own exposure to credit risk. In the swaps market, companies are paying more
attention to the counterparty risk of agreements with lower-rated banks.
They are also more careful about which banks they lend money to, in the form
of bank deposits, following the collapse of BCCI last year.
More importantly, there is now a strong focus on how companies control their
own financial risks. Now that company boards are paying greater attention to
treasury policy, careful consideration is being given to a wide range of
issues, such as how to define risk, what constitutes speculation, and what
qualifies as hedging.
Company boards are no longer content to leave treasury to the experts.
Experience has shown that it is important for senior management to be aware
of the risks the treasury is running, and the nature and purpose of deals.
Equally, treasury managers are learning how to see their financing
techniques in the context of the company's overall balance sheet.
Auditors themselves are learning to come to grips with the complex financial
products now routinely used in treasury management.
The debate about whether a treasury department should be run as a cost
centre or a profit centre also continues, though opinion appears to be
moving against the profit-centre approach. Many treasurers are dubious about
how objective any analysis of profitability can be, since other parts of the
group are obliged to process financial transactions through the treasury.
Another argument is that a cost-centre approach can create a more
speculative culture, closer to a bank trading room, which is inappropriate
for what is essentially a service for other parts of the company. However,
the argument between the profit-centre and cost-centre approach should not
be allowed to obscure the fact that a cost-centre treasury can lose as much
money as a profit-centre, if controls are inadequate.
The application of stringent controls has become more urgent as a result of
the increasing use of complex derivative products by companies. The losses
at Allied Lyons stemmed from the unusual practice of writing currency
options, which can lead to unlimited losses. Usually, only banks, which
manage their risks on a continuous basis, take on that sort of exposure. But
most treasurers of large companies buy options and are involved in swap
transactions, often with complex 'bells and whistles' attached.
Concern about practices within treasury departments has also reached
institutional investors in companies' shares, since treasury practices can
have substantial impact on company profitability. The head of Prudential
Portfolio Managers (PPM), one of the largest institutional investors in the
UK stock market, recently called for greater disclosure of corporate
treasury policies in companies' accounts. A working party is being set up by
the ACT, involving the Association of British Insurers, the National
Association of Pension Funds and the Accounting Standards Board, to develop
guidelines on the appropriate levels of disclosure of corporate treasury
management activities.
Mr Hugh Jenkins, of PPM, complained that, in the accounts of many of the
largest listed companies, reports on corporate treasury matters are 'minimal
in most cases', even though the report and accounts is the correct medium
for such disclosure.
Only a few UK companies, including RTZ and Courtaulds, describe their
treasury activities, including interest rate and currency exposure
management policies, in any detail.
The greater degree of interest in treasury matters, coupled with a broader
understanding, is widely seen as a positive development for the treasury
management business.
'The sophistication of financial management techniques will challenge
further the abilities of company directors to keep up with developments in
areas such as treasury management and information technology,' Mr Roger
Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, wrote in a recent article in the
FT. It is a challenge which, not before time, company directors and others
are now trying to meet.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 4: A name to remember - Profile of
Procordia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the food and pharmaceutical conglomerate, remains one of the few
bright lights on Sweden's gloomy industrial scene. Its financial performance
is impressive and its outlook promising, writes Robert Taylor.
It had been expected that the Swedish state would sell off its 40.4 per cent
voting shares and 34.2 per cent equity in Procordia this autumn but a
sluggish bourse and the turmoil on the currency markets in September
compelled a postponement.
The national agreement between the Swedish government and the Social
Democrats includes a moratorium on the planned privatisation of the
country's 35 state-dominated enterprises, but this does not apply to
Procordia. Mr Jan Ekberg, the company's president, hopes that the sale of
the state's shares in Procordia can go ahead next spring.
If successful, the launch could help to complete the transformation of
Procordia into one of Europe's leading corporate players in both the growing
food and pharmaceutical markets.
Much will depend, however, on what happens to Volvo over the coming months.
The troubled auto giant remains - with the state - the joint dominant
shareowner of Procordia with 45 per cent of its voting rights and 39.5 per
cent of the equity.
Earlier this year Mr Pehr G y l l e n h a m m a r, Volvo's charismatic
executive chairman, tried in a highly public power bid to take over the
whole of Procordia but he was rebuffed by the Swedish government. It would
not take much for Volvo to lift its stake to half that of the company in the
event of flotation.
Volvo - which is believed to be losing money at a rate of SKr2bn a year at
the moment - could gain majority control of Procordia in order to use its
resources as a necessary financial support to prop up its ailing auto
division rather than to boost the long-term future of its food and
pharmaceuticals. Such an outcome would be a setback to Procordia's long-term
plans.
But Mr Jan Ekberg, the company's newly appointed chief executive, insists:
'If we run Procordia in a professional manner, Volvo will support it and be
satisfied. How Volvo behaves will depend very much on how we manage.'
As one of the key figures who drew up the strategy that transformed
Procordia in the late 1980s from being a rather unwieldy state monolith into
a commercially successful enterprise, Mr Ekberg is keen to trumpet the
achievements of the company over the past eight years. This involved
deliberately focusing on niche products in a number of limited business
areas for sale and distribution in global markets.
'Our aim is to achieve market leadership in all the niches where we
operate,' he explains.
The most lucrative activity is pharmaceuticals. In the first half of this
year alone Kabi Pharmacia enjoyed an 11 per cent improvement in its
operating income to SKr1.391bn and a 15 per cent boost in sales to SKr6.7bn.
Its profits (after financial items) almost doubled to SKr4.197bn last year
from SKr2.282bn in 1989.
But Procordia's achievement in its food and beverage activities looks
impressive, too. Operating income went up by 16 per cent to S K r 1 4 1 m
for the first six months in its food division and sales rose by 1 per cent
to SKr2.739bn. Sweden's hot summer boosted the company's beer, water and
soft drink sales by 6 per cent to SKr2.227bn in the first half of the year,
while its operating income shot up by 35 per cent to SKr145m.
The only troubled business area is biotechnology, where operating income
dropped to only SKr42m in the first six months from SKr66m for the same
period of 1991 and sales also stagnated at SKr908m, down from SKr918m.
Over the past eight years, Procordia has gone through considerable
structural change. 'In that time we have sold off around 100 companies and
acquired up to 50 in health care and consumer products,' explains Mr Ekberg.
The pace has not lessened much in 1992 either. This September Procordia
purchased for SKr1.37bn Swedish Match, the world's largest manufacturer of
matches and disposable cigarette lighters from an international consortium
led by Citicorp Venture Capital.
At the same time, divestments have continued. The company sold off its sugar
production facilities to Danisco, the Danish group and its 7 per cent stake
in Freia Marabou, the chocolate company, for NKr450m.
Procordia's long-term aim is to concentrate ever more on pharmaceuticals and
food. Mr Ekberg stresses the connections between the two core business areas
as he sees the distinction between people as patients and consumers breaking
down. In future the sick will be able to exercise more personal choice than
now in acquiring health care products while at the same time more emphasis
will go into making foods of higher nutritional value.
At present, Procordia has little name recognition outside the Nordic region.
But this looks set to change during the 1990s. As the company grows apace in
an integrated European market, it should be able to establish a clear sense
of identity elsewhere alongside other blue-chip Swedish companies such as
Volvo, Electrolux and Ericsson, which have already done so many years ago.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 4: Investor gets busy - The core of the
Wallenberg family empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Investor, Sweden's largest investment company and the core of the
Wallenberg family's industrial empire, has made an impressive start this
year in its role as a diversified industrial holding company, since the
merger of the 'old' Investor with its investment twin Providentia .
At a time when most of corporate Sweden is either reporting plummeting
profits and even losses, Investor's performance underlines just how
impressively the Wallenbergs have managed to prosper during recession.
The new investment company has current assets totalling SKr80bn and an
influential SKr22bn share portfolio. No wonder Investor agreed to a 22 per
cent increase in its dividend to SKr5.25 per share this year.
Investor's strategic holdings are a roll-call of Sweden's leading blue-chip
companies. They include Astra, the highly successful pharmaceuticals group;
Stora, Europe's largest forestry company; Asea, the engineering giant; SKF,
the world's largest roller bearing maker; the telecommunications company
Ericsson; Electrolux, the white goods manufacturer as well as Atlas Copco,
Europe's largest air compressor company. It also has a wide range of
interests in banking, hotels, civil aviation, television, newspapers and
trading.
In February last year Investor and Providentia acquired for SKr12.8bn all
the outstanding shares in Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace
group. This gave them access to an operating business generating cash. As Mr
Claes Dahlback, Investor's chief executive, explains: 'As an investment
company - with a high net worth discount on the Swedish stock exchange - it
was nearly impossible for Investor to raise risk capital through new share
issues. The step to a diversified industrial holding company changed this.'
The finance companies sold their controlling stakes in the dairy equipment
company Alfa Laval to Tetra Pak and Skandia, the insurance company to raise
capital towards the 100 per cent acquisition of Saab-Scania. But half the
acquisition was financed through a SKr6.5bn issue of convertible debentures.
The 'new' Investor is going to be one of the most powerful players on
Sweden's corporate scene during the 1990s with an increasingly high
international profile, though at present it is consolidating. The company
hopes to increase foreign ownership of its capital stock from a current 5
per cent to between 15 and 20 per cent within five years.
The emergence of the Investor represents a crucial strategic shift by one of
the world's oldest industrial dynasties as it seeks to strengthen its
position in a more open competitive global economy after the removal of the
regulations and controls that protected its position for more than 50 years.
By creating one single investment company at the heart of their industrial
federation, the Wallenbergs are seeking to enhance their power and influence
on international markets while at the same time tightening control of their
most vital assets at home. 'We have built up a defensive position over the
past two years but it will form the base for an offensive in the 1990s,'
says Mr Dahlback.
Investor has launched a new international investment strategy under the
direction of Mr Jacob Wallenberg, the 36-year-old son of the present head of
the family, Peter. He represents the fifth generation in a family that has
played a dominant role in Sweden's corporate life since its industrial
revolution at the end of the last century.
'You will see an expansion in our strategic holdings in the years ahead. Our
assets will grow. We will be making foreign acquisitions but some of our
companies will be trimmed down,' explains Mr Dahlback.
The breadth and strength of the Wallenberg empire is based on a distinctive
sense of family obligation.
'I believe you should only do what you know something about,' he explains.
'I am an industrialist by training, not a financier.' Peter also remembers
the wise advice he received as a young man from his family seniors. 'Stay
out of property, they told me. Don't touch oil. You have to play the ball
where it lies on the field - my father Marcus used to say'.
Like them, he believes the Wallenberg interest must remain at the heart of
Sweden's manufacturing industry. During the booming 1980s the family did not
join in the rush into real estate speculation or plunge into new unchartered
sectors such as electronics and high technology.
Instead, the Wallenbergs launched an active stock market trading strategy
combined with an industrial acquisitions offensive first in Sweden and
increasingly after 1986 in western Europe.
The results nearly 10 years later have been staggering. The value of the
Wallenberg stock portfolio has climbed from SKr900m in 1980 to over SKr18bn.
Not only did Peter take full advantage of the bourse boom of the 1980s but
he showed some grit and flair in fending off threats to his position from a
number of potential raiders.
'My attention is focused on the company balance sheets. I'm looking at them
all the time for sparks that catch my eye but I'm a hands-off manager and
not involved in the detail,' he explains.
At the same time Peter encouraged the expansion of the key companies in the
Wallenberg empire. Stora, the forestry group, is the example that he likes
to give. Its expansion was devised and directed from Investor's office in
Stockholm's banking district. First it bought Billerud, Papyrus and Swedish
Match at home and last year 15 per cent of Korsnas. In 1990 it acquired the
German industrial giant Feldmuhle Nobel.
But Asea's highly successful merger with the Swiss engineering group
Brown-Boveri made in the autumn of 1987 and the aggressive acquisitions of
Electrolux after 1986 with the purchase of Zanussi in Italy and White in the
US were also crucial developments in the growth of the Wallenberg interest
in Europe.
The dynamic changes of the 1980s transformed Investor. Mr Dahlback recalls
the company he joined nearly 20 years ago as staid and sleepy. He likens it
to the 'sacristry of an old cathedral'. Now he says it is a 'humming
workshop' with over 70 mainly young brokers and finance experts on the
payroll.
The Wallenbergs seem pragmatic about their future intentions. 'In terms of
our ownership, we will always face difficult alternatives,' Peter admits.
'We can sell, keep what we have or buy. There is no single solution. We have
to make our decisions depending on circumstances as they arise.'
But the creation of the new Investor suggests Jacob Wallenberg and his
cousin Marcus will inherit a formidable industrial federation after Peter
goes that will continue to flourish despite more open competitive
conditions, just as the family did for so long behind Sweden's protective
walls.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 4: Aviation free-for-all - Christopher
Brown-Humes on change in the air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT comes to airline deregulation, the Swedes do not do things by
halves. Within the space of a few months a highly protected domestic market,
which gave Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) a virtual monopoly, has given
way to an environment characterised by increasingly fierce competition.
'Sweden is now the most deregulated and open market for civil aviation in
Europe,' says Mr Mats Odell, minister of transport and communication.
Liberalisation formally took effect on July 1 and Mr Odell takes
satisfaction from the results it has already produced. There were those who
thought SAS had such a strong position that opening the market up would have
only a limited impact. 'We have proved the sceptics wrong,' he says.
There has certainly been no shortage of companies applying for, and getting,
concessions to operate on domestic routes in direct competition with SAS.
Transwede, Malmo Aviation, Golden Air and Avia are among the companies now
posing a direct challenge to the Scandinavian national carrier and its
majority-owned subsidiary, Linjeflyg.
The presence of the newcomers has already made itself felt on pricing. Fares
have come down by 10 to 40 per cent. 'Even the threat of competition has
reduced prices on routes where competition is still not a reality,' says Mr
Odell.
For instance, on the Stockholm-Malmo route which Transwede and Malmo
Aviation operate in competition with SAS, the economy return fare has been
cut from SKr1,000 to SKr700 since the competition emerged.
One of the keys to the deregulation success, Mr Odell believes, has been the
re-opening of Bromma, Stockholm's city airport, which has given the new
companies access to peak-time slots which they might otherwise not have had.
This airport can handle much smaller aircraft than the main Stockholm
airport at Arlanda used by SAS. In addition, SAS has been prevented from
using Bromma as a centre for its intra-Nordic traffic.
One of the dangers of the deregulation process, though, is that remote
communities in the north of the country will lose their air services because
they are no longer viable. Mr Odell is determined that this will not happen
and promises that in the last resort the state will ensure these vital
services continue.
SAS purports not to be worried by the arrival of rival carriers, although it
admits that the competition has been fierce. 'When the domestic market was
opened up we expected our share of the domestic market to fall to 70 per
cent from 97 per cent,' says Mr Lennart Svantemark, SAS vice-president of
foreign affairs. It is not down to the 70 per cent level yet, but it is
already less than 90 per cent.
There is a broader European context to the changes in the domestic market,
because the government is anxious to ensure there are slim pickings for
foreign carriers, as and when they are permitted access to the Swedish
market.
Liberalisation of the EC airline market takes another big step forward in
1993, with an immediate impact on SAS's operations out of Denmark. But it
will not be long before foreign carriers get the chance to fly between two
points in Sweden as an extension of existing services.
SAS does not expect to lose market share as a result of European
deregulation, but it does foresee increased pressure on pricing. It points
out that it is already used to competition from other national carriers,
such as Lufthansa and British Airways, to and from the Scandinavian market.
Nevertheless, the carrier has no doubt that it needs both size and
efficiency to compete in the new, more competitive conditions.
That is why, on the one hand, it is pursuing ever closer ties with Swissair
and Austrian Airlines, through the so-called European Quality Alliance
(EQA). Many believe that this will eventually end in a full-blown merger
with one or both airlines.
On the other hand, it has launched a determined efficiency drive, which has
reduced costs by 20 per cent over the last two years with the loss of 3,500
jobs. There is a further plan to increase efficiency by 8 per cent a year
over the next three years.
The evidence suggests the group is managing to survive the dual challenges
of deregulation and recession. It returned to profit in the first six months
of this year, turning round 1991's first half SKr1.02bn loss into a SKr502m
profit. Whether all the smaller airlines now operating within the Swedish
market survive is another matter.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Party chief faces tough task: The new boss of Italy's
Christian Democrats must try to reconcile old guard and reformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMOVERS have been busy hauling away files from the Christian Democrat's
headquarters in an imposing 16th century palace in the centre of Rome. The
old guard has been emptying offices, making way for Mr Mino Martinazzoli,
the new party secretary.
In less than a month this 61-year-old lawyer, former justice minister and
amateur poet, has imposed a more sober style. Fewer courtiers are to be
found murmuring into cellular telephones, fewer chauffeur-driven cars are
permanently parked outside. His team is smaller, pays less heed to the
various party factions and is more eclectic. It includes a one-time
conscientious objector and the party's first woman president, Rosa Russo
Jervolino, the minister of education.
Throughout Italy's post-war political history, the secretaries of the ruling
parties have consistently orchestrated the making and breaking of
governments. The Christian Democrat secretary, as leader of the party
winning the most votes, has also been the apex of the system of
'soto-governo'. This has meant control of the nominations and decisions in
the civil service, regional/local government, the boards of state companies
and banks and management of the main state television channel. Such control,
where favours were exchanged and votes gathered, interlocked the interests
of party and state (the former always taking precedence).
The circumstances confronting Mr Martinazzoli are wholly different. New
political alliances are in the air; a financial crisis is forcing the
parties to slim down their organisations; electoral reform is on the way and
the incestuous relationship between the parties and the state apparatus is
being forcibly untangled by a wave of corruption investigations.
As a party, the Christian Democrats urgently need renovation like the
Socialists, their long-standing partners in government. Indeed their
problems only differ in degree and timing: the Socialists have yet to change
the discredited leadership of Mr Bettino Craxi and are even more besmirched
by the odour of corruption.
Founded in 1942, the party owed its strength to the backing of the Vatican
(and the US) during the Cold War as an inter-class anti-communist front and
the charismatic early leadership of Mr Alcide De Gasperi. Gradually its
rationale became reduced to the exercise of power through men like Mr Giulio
Andreotti, who was prime minister seven times, and the intricate balancing
of power factions headed by the various 'barons' and their accolytes.
The party failed to adjust to the end of the Cold War, miscalculated
discontent over corruption and failed to see the challenge in the north from
the populist Lombard League.
The party's share of the vote fell to 29 per cent in April. Though still
easily the largest single party with 206 of the 630 seats in the chamber of
deputies, it has lost much of its legitimacy as the natural party of power.
Moreover, a gap of as much as 15 percentage points has opened up between
party support in the north and the south, where the vote has held through
traditional patronage and mafia links. The latest polls suggest the party
would get only 20 per cent in the north, half that of the League.
Mr Martinazzoli, who had been anticipating retirement, is one of the few
senior Christian Democrats with a clean reputation. He also comes from the
northern city of Brescia and the recovery of the north with a clean up of
the party's structure there is a priority. This entails changing both the
way the party is funded (ending kick-backs on public contracts) its
behaviour and policies.
The most coherent platform is propounded by Mr Mario Segni, leader of the
referendum movement. He combines the best of the party's Catholic ethical
tradition with a strong reformist bent and is by far the Christian
Democrat's most attractive asset. The old guard refused to accept him as the
new leader, and Mr Segni was wary about pushing himself forward, aware his
political career could be undermined by taking on a party he could not
reform properly.
This leaves the uncharismatic Mr Martinazzoli with an old guard sniping from
the side-lines terrified of losing their privileges, and the reformists
under Mr Segni continually threatening to leave. Mr Martinazzoli can
probably rely on the old guard being further discredited by the countrywide
investigations of magistrates into political corruption. But the party is
too conditioned by over four decades of soto-governo to change overnight,
and Mr Martinazzoli may not have the ability to retain the loyalty and
contain the ambitions of the likes of Mr Segni.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown warns on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday served notice that
his party could withdraw its support for the government over Maastricht if
ministers fail to show, 'the urgency necessary' to get the treaty ratified
'as soon as possible'.
Mr Ashdown accepted the bill's committee stage would not be completed before
the Spring. But in a letter to Mr John Major he signalled that Liberal
Democrats may withdraw support if the treaty is delayed much beyond April -
in order to wait for the second Danish referendum on Maastricht - for the
third reading.
Support of 19 Liberal Democrat MPs last week saved Mr Major from defeat. Mr
Ashdown says he would still have voted with the government if he had known
Euro-sceptics were told the third reading would be after the Danish poll.
But his letter hints at some irritation over the concession.
He called for Mr Major to clear up the confusion over whether the second
Danish referendum and the third reading were interdependent, in order to,
'counter the growing suspicion. . . that your leadership at this crucial
stage on Europe is failing.'
Separately, the Liberal Democrats yesterday reversed their general election
pledge to raise income tax to finance extra education spending and a
recovery package.
Unveiling Liberal Democrat plans for economic recovery ahead of tomorrow's
Autumn Statement, Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said: 'I
would be reluctant to impose a general tax increase in the current, even
deeper, state of recession.'
But he defended the pledges made during the election, saying: 'We don't
think what we said at the general election was a mistake. Indeed had it been
done, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now.'
Liberal Democrats promised in April not to implement the new lower 20p tax
band and to increase the basic rate of income tax by 1p. That would have
helped finance an extra Pounds 4bn of public investment and boost education
expenditure.
The recovery package announced yesterday included a 'large and immediate'
increase in public investment.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: HL&amp;H tumbles 51% on fall in
consumer spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE deteriorating state of the South African economy and the country's
severe drought saw attributable earnings at Hunt Leuchars &amp; Hepburn (HL&amp;H),
the industrial company in the Rembrandt group, fall by 51 per cent in the
six months to end-September, compared with the same period a year earlier.
Turnover rose marginally to R331.9m (Dollars 114.4m) from R325.7m, but
pre-tax profits fell to R33.1m from R48.05m. Attributable profits dropped to
R23.6m from R47.8m due to a sharp turnround in income from associated
companies where losses of R1.8m were incurred against profits of R12.1m in
1991.
Mr Neil Morris, chief executive, described the results as 'very
disappointing', saying all the companies were affected by the continuing
decline in consumer spending.
Of the subsidiaries, Robertsons increased its contribution to attributable
profits to 62 per cent from 31 per cent in 1991.
However Transvaal Sugar's performance was hit by the drought and expects it
will only produce 140,000 tonnes of sugar this season compared with 220,000
in 1991/2. Its contribution to profits dropped to 34 per cent from 36 per
cent.
Mr Morris said the two associates, Rainbow Chickens and HL&amp;H Timbers,
performed unsatisfactorily. Rainbow recorded attributable losses of R18.9m
against profits of R5.7m. Rainbow's share of HL&amp;H earnings fell to a
negative contribution of 32 per cent against a 9 per cent contribution in
1991. HL&amp;H Timber suffered from local demand sinking to its lowest level in
20 years.
Mr Morris said although trading conditions in the short term were expected
to remain difficult, second-half earnings should improve, based on the
continued good performance of Robertsons, the expectation of a return to
profitability at Rainbow and an improvement in the timber operations.
Overall earnings for the year to March are likely to be below those of the
1992 financial year.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart improves 24% in third
quarter
</HEADLINE>

   By NIKKI TAIT and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in sales terms, yesterday kept up
its recession-beating progress, with a 24 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 437.8m after tax.
The increase was scored on sales up by 28.7 per cent at Dollars 13.7bn, and
translated into a 22.6 per cent improvement in earnings per share, at 38
cents.
The Arkansas-based discount retailer has now posted sales of Dollars 38.4bn
for the first nine months of the year, compared with Dollars 30.2bn in the
same period of 1991, with after-tax profits reaching Dollars 1.24bn, against
Dollars 1.01bn.
That progress, said Mr David Glass, the company's chief executive, should
position the company well 'to meet our objectives for the approaching
holiday selling season and the balance of the year'.
In part, Wal-Mart's growth comes from an aggressive store opening programme,
although same-store sales growth has also been running at double-digit rates
in the first 10 months of 1992.
During the third quarter alone, the group opened 50 new Wal-Mart outlets -
closing one - and 10 Sam's Clubs, the chain of no-frills but ultra-cheap
warehouse clubs.
International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, the US fragrances group, will take a
pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m in the fourth quarter and full-year for
consolidating its European production facilities, and a pre-tax charge of
about Dollars 32m in the first three quarters as a result of adopting new
accounting standards, AP-DJ reports.

FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Timing the key to taking VAW
private - Up to 49 per cent of the German aluminium company may be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAW Aluminium of Germany is being prepared for the private sector. Its
parent, VIAG, the large holding company which also has chemical and energy
interests, was itself privatised in 1988.
Mr Jochen Schirner, chairman of VAW's management board, says VIAG is
preparing to sell up to 49 per cent of the aluminium company. However,
although the determination to float VAW is strong, the timing is obscure.
Not only will the move have to wait until the uncertainties surrounding the
German economy are removed and stock markets show more signs of strength, it
will also depend on the speed at which VAW reshapes itself.
In the past, Mr Schirner points out, size was the only thing that
differentiated between aluminium companies. They were integrated companies
and 'everything and anything to do with aluminium was their business'. He
insists, however, that 'the time for this approach has passed'.
VAW's board aims to emphasise the group's distinctive character. 'We want to
become an aluminium company with our own contours,' Mr Schirner says. The
idea is to gain the greatest benefits from being based in one of the world's
strongest industrial markets - Germany - and in central Europe.
At the same time, 'we cannot tackle the whole aluminium business. We still
have a number of operations that are not core businesses and we must decide
whether to develop them into bigger units or to go into joint ventures or to
place them outside VAW.'
Most of the present core businesses are of a size which would enable them to
stand alone and be competitive, Mr Schirner suggests. The smelter division
has a turnover of DM1.3bn (Dollars 850m); the rolled products division,
DM1.5bn; and the flexible packaging operations, DM0.8bn.
The casting division also has a DM0.8bn turnover but, because of minority
interests, VAW does not get 100 per cent.
The extrusions division, with a DM0.5bn turnover, is subject to review,
because the market might change dramatically. Car companies are interested
in a new construction concept under which vehicles are based on an aluminium
'spaceframe' - a skeleton-like metal frame to which other components can be
bonded.
Aluminium spaceframes are likely to be made from extrusions but, as Mr
Schirner points out, they will be very different from the extrusions
currently supplied to the construction market. 'We are in permanent
discussions with the big German motor companies,' Mr Schirner reveals. 'They
want to see the whole picture from us: for example, will there be enough
aluminium available if they switch; who will recycle the aluminium in cars,
and so on.'
He insists that there would be no aluminium shortage. While 'all-aluminium'
cars would at first require more new metal to be produced, the industry
would ensure that each individual alloy was carefully recycled. Eventually,
about 90 per cent of the aluminium used in cars would be recycled.
The trend to more aluminium in cars might also have an impact on VAW's
rolled products division. But, Mr Schirner points out, 'it will be well
beyond the year 2000 before this is big business for our industry.'
VAW has been investing heavily in its core businesses. It is mid-way through
a DM1bn expansion at Aluminium Norf in Germany, which it owns jointly with
Alcan of Canada. By late 1994 this will boost the plant's capacity from
650,000 tonnes to 1.4m tonnes of sheet, aimed particularly at Europe's
fast-growing aluminium beverage can market.
Mr Schirner points out that while aluminium production is moving to those
areas of the world which can provide low-cost energy, and preferably
environmentally friendly, renewable hydro-electric power, the markets for
rolled products are regional. So 'Europe is Norf's market'.
In keeping with the aluminium production trend, VAW is technical manager and
member of the five-strong consortium which has just brought the Dollars 1bn
Alouette smelter on stream in Quebec. The company will have one-fifth of
Alouette's output of 215,000 tonnes a year and this, together with the
expansion at the Tomago smelter in Australia, in which it has a 12 per cent
stake, will take VAW's own annual capacity to nearly 500,000 tonnes.
Mr Schirner admits there are serious long-term questions about VAW's
smelters in Germany, which some analysts suggest have the highest costs in
the world. He says these smelters give the company an advantage, however.
'We get very defined qualities of metal from our smelters - each slab has a
defined quality, it is not commodity aluminium. We make slabs very close to
rolled products and make alloys from liquid metal. It is not just a cost
question. It also enables us to react quickly to changing customer demands.'
VAW's spending is expected to continue at a high level. It has a DM3.7bn
programme prepared, but Mr Schirner says part of this depends on the board
giving final approval to some divisional plans.
VIAG recently injected DM150m of new capital into VAW to help finance
projects just completed and to keep the balance sheet in good shape. Last
year VAW benefited from Germany's temporary reunification boom. Mr Schirner
says business is now more difficult but there is a 'good chance' that 1992
net profits will match last year's DM80m.

PROCORDIA, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical group, increased profits by 8
per cent in the first nine months to SKr3.33bn (Dollars 554.62m) from
SKr3.08bn.
The group benefited from a big increase in net interest income, as a result
of the high level of Swedish interest rates, and a strong performance from
its Kabi Pharmacia unit. Sales and operating income climbed 1 per cent to
SKr29.16bn and SKr2.98bn respectively.
Kabi Pharmacia improved operating income by 17 per cent to SKr1.94bn, while
sales surged 13 per cent to SKr9.71bn. The acquisition of the Italian group
Pierrel accounted for 7 per cent of the increase. However, sales dipped in
the third quarter after health-care authorities in some of the group's key
markets cut their expenditure.
Pharmacia Biotech fared badly, with operating income down 37 per cent at
SKr49m. The company blamed falling exchange rates in important markets.
Income at Procordia Invest fell 51 per cent to SKr180m, mainly because its
involvement in hotels has produced heavy losses.

<TEXT>
Mr Nigel Balcombe, chairman of USM-quoted International Communication &amp;
Data, has resigned from the board because he faces a long period of
convalescence after major abdominal surgery in October.
The leaking of the news of the consequent boardroom shuffle meant that the
company's interim results - due to be released today - had to be announced
to the Stock Exchange last night.
Pre-tax profits at the group, which provides names, addresses and
information to the direct marketing/direct mail industry, fell to just
Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 404,000) on lower turnover of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds
3.96m) for the six months to August 31.
However, Mr Daniel Unger, who was chairman from 1983 to 1989 and who has now
stepped up from non-executive director to interim chairman, said that 'a
good first quarter' was offset by a 'hard' second when turnover was down 9
per cent on last time. He added that the second half was 'always by far the
better half'.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: VSEL rises 15.6% to Pounds 25.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL Consortium, the Barrow-based builder of the Trident nuclear submarines,
yesterday reported improved profits as a mounting cash pile led to higher
interest earnings.
Pre-tax profits increased by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 25.9m in the six months
to September 30. This was slightly ahead of market expectations and the
shares gained 19p to 488p.
Profits increased despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 256m to Pounds
234m. Turnover is set to continue to fall for some years as a result of the
company's plan to reduce its workforce from its level of nearly 17,000 three
years ago to close to 7,000.
This is due to falling defence orders following the end of the cold war and
the government's Options for Change defence review.
More than Pounds 50m of cash was generated during the period, and net cash
in-creased to Pounds 160m. Interest receivable increased from Pounds 4.1m to
Pounds 7m.
The first Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, is now 90 per cent complete and
is due to be delivered next year. The firm order for the fourth boat was
confirmed in July.
VSEL is studying a number of approaches from potential buyers of the Cammell
Laird yard in Birkenhead, which it put up for sale 18 months ago. Mr Noel
Davies, chief executive, said the chances of finding a buyer wanting to
continue to build ships were 'petering out'.
VSEL's small non-defence businesses, acquired to widen the company's
experience, were making progress and recently won contracts worth Pounds
3.5m from British Gas and an oil company.
Earnings increased 10 per cent to 44p while the interim dividend is raised
12.5 per cent to 9p.
COMMENT
VSEL's obvious weaknesses mean it is never likely to be a stock market
favourite. It is a defence stock with a single customer, the Ministry of
Defence, and it builds environmentally unfriendly nuclear submarines. But
management seems to be succeeding in its awesome task of reducing the
workforce by more than half, and telling workers in advance, without ruining
the motivation of those who remain. Despite murmurs of further defence cuts
in the Autumn State-ment, Trident must be safe and the second batch of
Trafalgar submarines, where the contracts will not be awarded before 1994,
are still too far out to offer any cost savings. Forecast profits this year
of Pounds 54m put the shares on just over 5 times, with a yield of close to
8. VSEL's cash-flow, and the fact that most of the profits from Trident are
yet to come, suggest the dividend is more than safe and make the shares an
interesting option for income funds.

FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Peabody sues Costain over Dollars 200m coal
mining deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEABODY Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK
conglomerate, has filed a lawsuit in Missouri, seeking to have its proposed
Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) purchase of Costain's Australian coal mining
business enforced by the US courts.
Costain, the UK construction group which initially had agreed to sell the
business to Peabody, on Monday announced it had accepted a higher offer from
Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Altus has agreed to pay Dollars 245m for the mining business and Costain's
remaining Australian commercial property interests which had not been
included in the deal with Peabody.
Peabody, in a lawsuit filed in the St Louis circuit court, claims that
Costain has been guilty of 'bad faith and breach of written obligations.'
It asks that Costain be made to abide by the terms of the original
agreement, and an injunction placed on the sale to Altus. If specific
performance of the agreement is not awarded, it wants damages to be
determined at a jury trial.
The law suit alleges that the UK construction group granted Peabody
exclusive negotiating rights when the initial purchase discussions took
place. It says that the agreement specifically provided that 'Costain . . .
would not solicit any competing bids and that Costain would use its good
faith efforts to consummate the transaction'.
The law suit says that Costain ' . . . expressly acknowledged and agreed
that money damages would not be an adequate remedy if it breached the
agreement,'
Exclusive negotiating rights according to Peabody were initially granted
until September 21. However, in mid-September, Mr Peter Costain, chief
executive of the UK construction group, orally agreed to extend this period
as long as good faith negotiations were going on.
The company alleges that around October 16, Goldman Sachs, advising Costain,
told it that a third party had offered Dollars 210m for the coal operation.
Peabody, told Goldman that it had an exclusivity agreement and would not
increase its Dollars 200m offer.
The third party - subsequently shown to be Altus - was then said to have
raised its offer to Dollars 220m, but Peabody again claims to have told
Costain that it was acting in bad faith, violating the exclusivity
agreement. On October 20, Peabody and Costain signed the Dollars 200m sale
agreement.
Mr Costain expressed surprise that proceedings were being brought in the US
courts given that the original agreement had been with a UK subsidiary of
Hanson.
He said: 'We remain totally confident of our position that we have acted in
the best interests of our shareholders as permitted by the purchase
agreement and that we have lived up to all the terms and conditions of the
agreement.
'We will therefore vigorously defend our position.'

FT  11 NOV 92 / Management: Safety network spreads like fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a frosty, damp November night, a tanker loaded with flammable chemicals
slews off the road and bursts into flames at Seal Sands, the chemical and
petrochemical industry complex at the mouth of the River Tees.
A gatehouse attendant at one of the sites edging the road grabs the
telephone and rings Cleveland county fire brigade headquarters at Hartlepool
to raise the alarm.
At one time, this would have been the prelude to a long, laborious
ring-around, as the emergency services tried to alert the various companies
which make Teesside the UK's largest concentration of hazardous industry.
Engaged phone lines, problems in finding the right person to inform and
possible misunderstandings of technical information were all potential
pitfalls in communicating vitally important messages to staff responsible
for safety.
But now, thanks to a personal computer and telex network launched yesterday,
information and advice on accidents and emissions can be relayed within a
maximum of two minutes, and often within seconds, to Teesside sites handling
hazardous materials. They, in turn, can relay information back as fast,
using the same system, to fire brigade HQ, which will then disseminate it
via the network to other hazard sites, including chemical and petrochemical
manufacturers and storage companies and Hartlepool nuclear power station.
The system includes information on wind speed, the risks posed by the
accident or emission and details of substances released, including the name
by which they are known on individual sites and their standard
categorisation.
Designed to be easy to use, it is intended to maximise speed and scope of
information, while minimising the ambiguity and timewasting which, in the
worst case, could cause serious injury or even loss of life.
The new Pounds 125,000 Cleveland Chemical Alarm System was designed by
British Telecommunications and paid for by 14 hazard-related companies on
the network, which also includes Cleveland Police.
The 14 include ICI, Tioxide, Phillips Petroleum, British Rail and BASF.
Other Teesside companies have expressed interest in joining the network,
which can be easily expanded.
The new system replaces a less sophisticated telex and printer network
introduced by Cleveland fire brigade and Teesside industry in 1981. The old
network, although a vast improvement on the ring-around technique, was much
slower, and sent information only in one direction, from the fire brigade to
industry.
BT claims the new network, which combines PCs, fast, dedicated telex lines
and specially-written software, to be a world first and hopes to market it
for other similar petrochemical complexes.

FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Beith reverses election pledge to
increase taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrat party yesterday reversed its general election pledge to
raise income tax to finance extra education spending and a recovery package,
saying that the recession was now too deep to justify an increase.
Unveiling Liberal Democrat plans for economic recovery ahead of tomorrow's
Autumn Statement, Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said: 'I
would be reluctant to impose a general tax increase in the current, even
deeper, state of recession.'
But he defended the pledges made during the election, saying: 'We don't
think what we said at the general election was a mistake. Indeed had it been
done, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now.'
Mr Beith added: 'The Treasury's obsession with keeping the public
expenditure total set last year (Pounds 244.5bn) is both dogmatic and
dangerous. Instead of a large boost to investment programmes, the government
is promising little more than maintaining capital spending at levels already
planned.'
Mr Beith's comments followed Labour's decision to put on ice its 'shadow
budget,' set out during the election, which included lifting the ceiling on
National Insurance contributions.
Liberal Democrats promised in April not to implement the new lower 20p tax
band and to increase the basic rate of income tax by 1p. That would have
helped finance an extra Pounds 4bn of public investment and boost education
expenditure.
The recovery package announced yesterday says that since the election, 'the
economic outlook has deteriorated, and confidence has slumped. This suggests
that a more ambitious package would be appropriate, funded purely by
borrowing.'
The package does not, however, specify what public sector borrowing
requirement would be appropriate.
The package included a 'large and immediate' increase in public investment
in transport and public buildings', temporary cuts in the uniform business
rate for ailing businesses, extra training programmes, and help for mortgage
lenders and housing associations to start up 'mortgage-to-rent' schemes.
Liberal Democrats also back an independent Bank of England to boost
confidence in financial markets, giving scope for interest rate cuts and
increased borrowing.
Mr Beith and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday
that MPs should, like other public-sector workers, get a zero or very small
pay rise next year.

work

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government yesterday said it would award the work to build the
colony's four-berth ninth container terminal (CT9) to three of the four
consortia who bid for it.
Officials said the decision to approach three groups to build CT9 - which is
estimated to cost around HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 843m) - reflected the need
to have the terminal operational by mid-1995.
Yesterday's announcement took many of the bidders unawares. However, one of
the successful applicants was critical of the government's inability to
chose a clear winner.
The government wants all three consortia to share the cost of building CT9
but, on completion, for Hongkong International Terminals (HIT) and Modern
Terminals Limited (MTL) to share two berths and for the Jardine Matheson-led
Tsing Yi consortium to operate the other two berths.
The Tsing Yi consortium, which includes Sea-Land as operator, said the
government's offer was different from the one it has expressed interest in.
It said it was now considering the implications of the offer. MTL was also
considering the government's offer.
The bidding for CT9 has occasioned one of the most acrimonious fights for
preferment that Hong Kong has witnessed for many years. Jardine was pitted
against Hutchison Whampoa, which controls HIT, and MTL, owned by mainland
Chinese interests and Peninsular and Orient Steam Navigation.
At stake was the right to own a slice of infrastructure through which much
of China's trade with the rest of the world passes. By 1995 the port is
expected to handle 8m TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), up from 6m in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of the Italian government unveiling privatisation plans within
the next two weeks is encouraging heavy speculation in the shares of those
state-controlled companies already quoted on the bourse.
Yesterday the Milan stock exchange authorities had to suspend dealings
temporarily in no fewer than nine quoted stocks controlled by the state
because their price had risen above the 10 per cent ceiling permitted in a
session.
Speculative interest has heightened following the leak last Friday of a
highly sensitive document outlining the government's plans and naming
companies and financial institutions in line for privatisation. The leak
forced the government to deny plans were so finalised. However, the stock
market seems unconvinced especially as the government is committed to
revealing its plans by November 19.
Particular attention yesterday focused on the state-held banks and financial
institutions, considered the easiest to sell off.
Credito Italiano, the sixth largest commercial bank, was the first to have
it shares temporarily suspended after quotations had risen nearly 20 per
cent. On Monday, the state holding company IRI approved the sale of its
entire 67 per cent stake in Credito. Other shares suspended included Banca
di Roma and Banca Fideuram, and the Assitalia insurance group.
The Party of the Democratic Left (former communists) yesterday called for a
parliamentary debate on privatisation. 'We are not against privatisation but
we are concerned by the (government's) confused and disorganised approach
which also fails to address the whole question of industrial policy,' a
spokesman said. A similar statement came from the CGIL, largest of the three
main union confederations.

The French and Italian governments agreed yesterday to pour FFr5.4bn (Pounds
640m) into SGS-Thomson, their jointly controlled semiconductor manufacturer,
over the next five years.
The 'recapitalisation' and provision of additional R&amp;D funding of Europe's
only remaining independent chip-maker was agreed at the Franco-Italian
government summit yesterday.
The additional French funds for SGS-Thomson will be channelled through the
three state shareholders - Thomson CSF, CEA-Industrie and France Telecom.
IRI, the Italian state holding company, holds a 45 per cent share in the
company, with the remaining 5 per cent held by the latter's high technology
subsidiary, Finmeccanica. However, it is more likely that the bulk of the
Italian funds will be funneled through ENEA, the state nuclear and
alternative energy research institute.
This would make ENEA a shareholder in the venture and mean that Italy is
emulating an ownership similar to that of France.
France has been pressing Italy, which is trying to restrain its ballooning
public deficit, to find more money for SGS-Thomson since September when the
French government brought in CEA-Industrie, the industrial arm of its
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, and France Telecom to help Thomson-CSF
out.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (7): Clouds of suspicion
 -Chemicals must fight to clear their name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHEMICALS industry is not loved. Spectacular accidents and continuing
attacks by environmentalists have knocked the sector's reputation. If the
industry fails to respond to environmental pressure, both in performance and
public relations, it risks being legislated to extinction, at least in
populated areas of the developed world.
'The chemical industry is blamed for most of the world's environmental
difficulties. It has most to gain and farthest to go,' says Mr David
Buzzelli, corporate director for environment, health, and safety at Dow
Chemical.
Chemical companies have some real environmental problems and some problems
of public perception, argues Mr Michael Eckstut at management consultants,
Booz-Allen. The problem is that the perception is reality. The industry must
recognise both, he says.
The industry certainly has an image problem. Unfavourable opinions in the US
about the chemicals sector increased between 1980 and 1990 from 40 per cent
to 58 per cent, according to Mr Roger Hirl, president and chief executive
officer of the Occidental Chemical Corporation. Meanwhile, favourable
opinions slumped from 30 per cent to 14 per cent.
Mr Hirl told the International Council of Chemical Associations' conference
this year: 'We have many of the most energy-efficient, highest technology
and environmentally sound facilities in the world. But we ignored the shift
taking place in what people were thinking about the industry. We failed to
see ourselves through the eyes of the public.'
The image of the industry is important because it affects its freedom to
operate. Companies are concerned that environmental legislation - not always
necessarily justified - may threaten companies ability to compete.
'Failure to improve both performance and image will be very expensive,' says
Mr Buzzelli at Dow Chemical. 'Planning approvals for investment will be
refused, making sites uneconomic so the companies themselves close the
factories. Plants will be driven further from employees and markets, adding
further costs.'
The chemicals sector could follow the nuclear industry and be legislated to
the point of economic unviability, warns Mr Ernie Deavenport, president of
Eastman Chemical Company.
Already, the three chemicals giants, BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, are warning
that the cost of domestic environmental legislation threatens to cripple the
German industry by reducing competitiveness.
The chemical industry has recognised it cannot improve its environmental
image until companies have improved their environmental performance. It is
trying to clean up its act. In 1988, the US Chemical Manufacturers'
Association set up a programme in the US called responsible care. The
initiative, originally invented by the Canadian industry, now involves 175
US companies.
Responsible care calls for chemical companies to 'demonstrate their
commitment to improvement of all aspects of their performance which relates
to health, safety and the environment'.
'We've moved from a period of denial to a period of dialogue. The next stage
is to deliver on our promises,' says Mr Hirl.
'This is not a public relations programme, a PR solution to a PR problem.
Responsible care is nothing less than a cultural revolution for the way we
are going to do things in our industry.' Companies, many for the first time,
are now trying to measure their emissions' effect on air, land and water.
German companies have been doing this for some time, but British and French
groups are now joining in.
Chris Hampson, executive director at ICI with responsibility for the
environment, says the need for measurement is vital, so that improvement can
actually be demonstrated.
This year, Imperial Chemicals Industries, BP Chemicals and Rhone-Poulenc all
published their emissions for the first time. The formats were not always
similar, and there were omissions in parts of the data, but it was a brave
step in the right direction.
The groups have also publicly set targets for themselves. ICI plans to
reduce its wastes by 50 per cent by 1995. Rhone-Poulenc has promised to
halve its effluent and solid wastes by 1995 and and cut them by 65 per cent
by the year 2000. BP Chemicals has promised to slash hydrocarbon air
emissions by half and water emissions by two-thirds by 1997. And Dow
Chemical in Europe has promised to reduce the emissions of 56 compounds to
air and water between 1988 and 1995. Mr Buzzelli at Dow Chemical says such
promises are important to avoid government legislation creating
time-consuming and expensive regulations that may not be as effective as
voluntary measures.
The cultural revolution implied by responsible care comes both from the top
of organisations as well as from employees who share the concerns of the
general public. Many chemical companies now have board members responsible
for health, safety and the environment.
However, in spite of the rhetoric, implementation is not always easy. Mr
Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals' manager for health, safety and the environment,
explains:
'Not everyone in this company is in favour of reducing emissions. There are
manufacturing guys who prefer to keep costs low. They still exist. Bob
Horton, our previous chairman, said 25 per cent of employees did not believe
what we were saying about the environment. But we are working on them with
internal and external pressures.'
Much has already been achieved by the industry. BASF of Germany, for
example, claims it has reduced its effluent load into the Rhine by 95 per
cent since 1973. Air emissions are down between 80 and 85 per cent during
the same period.
But can the industry afford to continue to invest, particularly during a
recession when all chemicals groups' earnings are suffering? Improvements do
not come cheap. BASF spent D-Mark 500m between 1988 and 1992 on capital
projects to reduce pollution, according to Dr Wolfgang Jentzsch, BASF deputy
chairman.
The group plans to spend D-Mark 900m between 1990 and 1994 on environmental
capital projects, while between 1992 and 1996 it will spend as much as
D-Mark 1.6bn.
Mr Eckstut at Booz-Allen says companies are recognising that waste
management is an opportunity to reduce costs. By reducing waste production
in the first place, yield can be improved and disposal costs reduced.
However, the industry is beginning to flinch from the costs of
environmentalism. It proves relatively inexpensive to reduce 80 per cent of
emissions, says Mr Eckstut. But it can cost substantial sums to reduce the
last 10-15 per cent.
Many groups are already spending 20 to 30 per cent of their capital
expenditure on environmental measures.
That, he says, is hard to swallow, especially when capital spending is being
slashed. The operating costs of environmental equipment are also high.
'We are swallowing hard right now. Times are tough but we are staying with
it,' says Mr Buzzelli at Dow Chemical. 'We are on track because by not doing
it we put our business in peril.'
Although the burden of environmental improvement is expensive, the cost of
not investing is even more so. The cost of not communicating the improvement
effectively could prove terminal. The future success of the industry is
dependent upon its credibility with the public.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (8): Look for a silver
lining - An industry where recycling strengthens the bottom line

A CHEEKY-LOOKING dog examines the bone someone has placed on a fragment of
aluminium foil. Our pooch picks up the bone, drops it into a bowl
conveniently placed alongside and then sets off with foil in mouth, leaping
over household obstacles such as vacuum cleaners and outstretched human legs
on its way to the kitchen sink. One paw starts the tap running to clean a
trace of blood off the foil and then the dog is off to a garbage container.
It drops the foil into the bin which also contains empty aluminium drinks
cans.
You've guessed. This is a television commercial. It is the most successful
ever run by Reynolds Metals, the biggest producer of aluminium foil in the
US.
The message is entertaining but clear. It says the aluminium industry wants
its foil back, as long as it is clean; the industry will take back foil for
recycling with aluminium cans and pay for the privilege.
Mr Jeremiah Sheehan, Reynolds' executive vice president, consumer and
packaging products, admits that it is not as commercially necessary for the
industry to recycle foil as beverage cans - in the US only 200m lbs of
aluminium is used annually for consumer foil, plus a similar quantity for
food and other containers, compared with 4bn lbs used for cans.
'But recycling helps to identify foil as a 'green' product,' he points out.
It gives foil an edge over competitive products such as plastics.
Reynolds began by testing foil recycling in 1991 in five US cities:
Richmond, its home town in Virginia; Baltimore; Tampa; San Francisco; and
Seattle. Already one in 10 households in these test areas is recycling foil
regularly. The campaign has been extended this year to cover half the US and
in 1993 about 70 per cent of the States will be covered.
And, following the industry dictum that it's best to catch recyclers young,
Reynolds has had 2,100 schools competing to build the biggest ball of foil
in a 'Great Balls of Foil' competition for cash prizes.
Last year Reynolds paid recyclers Dollars 128m for about 240,000 tonnes of
consumer-generated aluminium (mostly cans). Mr Sheehan says Reynolds'
campaign 'already has lifted both the foil market and Reynolds' sales.'
Across the Atlantic in the UK a similar campaign is about to be mounted.
In the UK nearly 40 per cent of aluminium used in packaging (including
beverage cans) goes into foil and about 50,000 tonnes of aluminium foil
packaging, worth roughly Pounds 15m, is thrown away every year.
To recapture at least some of this, an Aluminium Foil Recycling Campaign
(AFRC) has been started by foil converters Alcan Ekco Packaging, Bowater
Foil and Paper Products and William Garfield, all members of the Aluminium
Foil Container Manufacturers Association, with British Alcan Consumer
Products. They plan to establish the first 50 local authority aluminium foil
recycling schemes in 1993.
AFRC says that, although foil is as recyclable as aluminium drinks cans, it
has different re-melt requirements and needs a different recovery
infrastructure. So five pilot schemes are being tested - in Cambridge,
Coventry, Leeds, Sheffield and Perth - which will demonstrate to local
authorities how foil collection can fit into the different types of
recycling schemes commonly run in the UK.
The aim, wherever possible, is to retain the charity benefit tradition of
saving clean aluminium foil but to integrate this with efficient recycling
practice by joining local authority schemes. Three of the pilot schemes have
charities emptying foil 'banks' on local authority and supermarket sites, in
return for ownership of the foil. Foil is sorted and loosely compacted by
the charities and then collected by an existing secondary (scrap) aluminium
industry transport system, led by Cookson Aluminium, to be re-melted. The
price for foil in this system is currently Dollars 350 a tonne.
There is, of course, more to this campaign for the industry than a
willingness to contribute to charity. The aluminium foil packaging producers
have in mind various pieces of legislation which threaten to have a
tremendous impact on the packaging market. For example, the 1990 UK
Environment Protection Act required all local authorities to produce
recycling plans by August this year saying how they would meet the target of
50 per cent recovery of recyclable materials from the waste stream by the
year 2,000.
Meanwhile, the European Community, judging by its draft directive on
packaging waste, seems likely to set a 60 per cent target for the recovery
and handling of all used packaging materials - and the responsibility for
achieving this level falls largely on the producer industries.
Apart from helping the producers promote the image of aluminium as a 'green'
metal, recycled aluminium of any kind provides the industry with cheap raw
material. Manufacturing new aluminium takes a great deal of energy - an
average-sized, modern primary aluminium smelter consumes as much electricity
as a town of 500,000 people - but the metal 'stores' that energy. It can
take 5 per cent of the original energy to make used aluminium as good as
new.
Estimates vary but the industry probably turned 5m tonnes of scrap back into
useable aluminium last year. That compares with production of new material
totalling about 15m tonnes. Growth in demand for scrap or secondary metal is
growing at 5.5 per cent a year or nearly twice the rate for primary metal.
Already as much as 70 per cent of the aluminium used in electrical
engineering, building and transport is re-used. Aluminium automotive
castings are almost entirely made from scrap metal.
The industry is working hard to get back as many aluminium beverage cans as
possible for recycling - more than 63 per cent of cans are recycled in the
US while the European average has moved up to 21 per cent and the European
industry has set a target of recycling half of all beverage cans by the
mid-1990s.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (6): Dilemmas of the
overloaded dustbin - John Thornhill studies Europe's waste mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE peoples of the European Community emptied 50m tonnes of rubbish into
their dustbins last year. Although this represents a mere fraction of the
waste created by industry, the public is far more aware of it because it is
on the doorstep.
Over the past few years politicians have responded to the clamours of the
increasingly vocal environmental lobby by introducing laws to limit the
amount of waste produced, or at least encourage its re-use and recycling.
But the problem all legislators face is a simple one: what gets thrown away
is not worth very much. If it were otherwise it would be unlikely to be
thrown away in the first place.
In order to reduce the amount of domestic waste governments are therefore
faced with a choice. Either they mandate industrial companies and local
authorities to collect and re-use the material; or they rely on tweaking
market mechanisms to increase the inherent value of waste and thereby
stimulate its re-use. This could be done, for example, by raising the cost
of landfill sites to encourage more recycling or imposing duties or levies
on packages.
The problems created by these two approaches are common to all debates about
the virtues of economic regulation versus free-market liberalism.
The first approach - most aggressively pursued in Germany through the
introduction of its Duales System Deutschland (DSD) - has led to industry
collecting a vast mountain of waste without having the capacity to reprocess
it. This has created an environmental perversity whereby large quantities of
waste have been expensively collected and exported - either being dumped in
other countries' landfill sites or seeping on to foreign markets at zero
cost destroying the fragile economics of indigenous recycling schemes.
The supporters of the DSD argue that such distortions are only likely to be
a temporary phenomenon. If a steady source of supply is created demand will
inevitably follow, they argue. In some areas the effects of this argument
are bearing fruit: four giant paper mills are already under construction in
Germany to soak up the glut of waste paper.
But the DSD's critics argue that such approaches are only likely to lead to
a 'second Common Agricultural Policy'. Production will be stimulated while
demand is ignored at enormous economic - and environmental - cost to
Europe's consumers.
Yet the obstacles created when waste management is left entirely to the free
market can prove insurmountable and can be illustrated by the difficulties
faced by the polystyrene food packaging recycling plant officially opened in
July by Linpac, the UK plastics group.
Mr David Eggleston, Linpac's environmental manager, says such plants are
vital if the UK is to increase its rate of recycling but their existence is
crucially dependent on the government introducing market-based incentives.
The plant, which has the capacity to recycle 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes of waste
a year, is testing the technical and commercial viability of recycling
plastic containers but in the existing market conditions it is uneconomic.
The government 'must encourage the consumption of recycled materials of all
kinds at prices which make recycling economically viable,' he says.
The UK government has hesitated in introducing sweeping environmental
initiatives, waiting for the European Commission to finalise the details of
its directive on the avoidance of packaging waste.
This summer, the EC published its far-reaching proposals aimed at
harmonising environmental laws across the Continent. However, it is likely
that it will take another two years before its modified principles become
enshrined in national laws.
Its hierarchy of preferred solutions is: minimisation of the packaging used
in particular products, followed by recovery and recycling, with final
disposal in landfill sites remaining as a last resort.
The directive sets a stiff target that within 10 years of implementation 90
per cent of all packaging waste by weight should be removed before it
reaches the waste stream with 60 per cent of each packaging material being
recycled.
It expects that within five years of implementation the member states will
have set up appropriate systems to collect packaging waste from the
consumer, enabling them to ensure that it is effectively re-used or
'recovered'.
Perhaps inevitably, the directive has come under fire both from industry,
which argues that some of its provisions are too onerous, and
environmentalists, who argue that they are too lax.
Suggestions for limiting the average amount of waste produced by each person
in the EC which appeared in early drafts of the directive were dropped by
the time the final version was published - much to the chagrin of groups
such as Greenpeace.
The environmental group argues that the prevention priorities have
effectively been 'lobbied away' by industry with disposal becoming the main
focus of legislative activity. 'The net result today is that the waste
management hierarchy has been turned upside down,' it says.
But at the heart of the debate on packaging waste is a fundamental and
irreconcilable difference between the industry and environmental
campaigners. Companies want to sell more packaging; environmentalists want
them to sell less.
In a free market economy, packaging companies cannot be expected voluntarily
to contribute to a lessening of demand for the products on which their
prosperity depends. Conversely, however, they clearly appreciate both the
economic and environmental sense of reducing the amount of material they use
to the minimum.
The clearest instance of this conflict is apparent in discussions concerning
refillable containers. For many years, environmental campaigning groups,
such as Friends of the Earth, have campaigned to promote the use of packages
which can be re-used and re-filled.
But although many of these schemes make clear sense in an ideal world,
industry argues that they often do not conform to contradictory consumer
desires in the real one. So, for example, although many shoppers profess to
care about the environment, they are unlikely to appreciate queuing in a
busy supermarket to refill milk bottles from a 'steel cow' dispenser - even
assuming high standards of hygiene could be guaranteed.
Ultimately it will be the shopper who will decide environmental priorities
by assessing the relative attractions and costs of particular forms of
packaging when buying a product.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (5): Unexploded bombs -
Tighter rules give insurers a headache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
BRITISH INSURERS are reappraising the potential dangers of claims for
environmental pollution in the light of shifts in the legal situation at
home and the experience of the US industry, where large chunks of the
insurance industry could be brought to the brink of insolvency by
multi-billion dollar claims.
But the change may be too little and too late according to critics who
suggest pollution claims could be catastrophic for the UK industry.
The exposure of UK insurers to pollution is principally through public
liability policies, which cover the policyholder against any damage a third
party might suffer because of pollution which results from his actions.
Historically insurers have faced very few pollution claims. Philip Bell,
liability insurance manager with Sun Alliance, which sells 15 to 20 per cent
of public liability policies, says his company receives fewer than 100 a
year.
Although Sun Alliance has 'a couple of million pound claims in the pipeline'
most claims are very much smaller. 'The sort of thing that normally happens
is that a chimney will belch out dust which will damage cars in an adjacent
car park,' says Mr Bell.
However, the establishment of a more rigorous regime of pollution control
and remediation in the UK is a cause for concern. In the past two years a
raft of new legislation has radically redefined the liabilities faced by
operators and owners of polluted sites.
The 1990 Environmental Protection Act and 1991 Water Resources Act establish
a legal framework in which the occupiers of a site are liable for the cost
of clean up irrespective of fault. Under this legislation bankers
foreclosing on a loan to a property company could become liable for the cost
of cleaning up contamination.
In a recent case Leeds City Council ordered more than 600 householders to
pay the Pounds 5m bill needed to clean up asbestos contamination from their
houses, even though this had been caused by an asbestos factory which closed
in 1958. Moves by the European Community are expected to reinforce this
trend towards strict liability.
UK government plans to make more information about pollution available to
the public through the register of contaminated land could also trigger
court actions. The value of land identified as contaminated on the register
is likely to fall. Mr Brian Street, a specialist with ECS Underwriting in
London, says the new law will 'greatly increase the power of pressure groups
to bring civil proceedings. It will cause all hell to let loose.'
In the face of these threats British insurers moved to restrict coverage
last April. After advice from the Association of British Insurers, most
companies changed the wordings of public liability policies to exclude
coverage for gradual pollution. The new policies restrict coverage to 'a
sudden, identifiable, unintended and unexpected incident which takes place
in its entirety at a specific time and place during the period of
insurance'.
Even so, insurers are still liable for claims made on policies written in
the past. Most policies were written on what insurers call an 'occurrence'
wording in which the relevant policy for a claim is the one which covers the
year when the event occurred. US courts have also ruled that policyholders
can claim on all their insurance policies stretching back to the original
point at which pollution is deemed to have begun. Much of the multi-billion
bill for US pollution clean-up, therefore, could ultimately fall on
insurance companies who sold policies in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.
Mr Randolph Fields, a lawyer who has developed a thriving business in
researching insurance coverages, is confident he can locate the coverage.
Recalling that the UK industry underwrote unrestricted pollution liability
coverage in 'carte blanche' fashion between 1930 and 1990, he warned of
liabilities of 'catastrophic proportions".
British insurers tend to minimise the problem. In a memo to its members sent
on October 13, the liability and accident committee of the Association of
British Insurers, the industry's trade association, described Mr Fields'
arguments as 'somewhat alarmist'.
The ABI said it could 'prove difficult' for the policyholder to provide
proof that insurance was in force at the particular time the incident was
alleged to have taken place.
'Neither insurers nor policyholders might have kept documentation for the
full period in question,' added the ABI.
Another worrying possibility is that British courts might begin to interpret
the wordings of public liability policies in a broader way than insurers
originally intended. In the US, for example, most legal opinions have ruled
that clean-ups ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency under the
so-called Superfund legislation constitute insured damages under the terms
of comprehensive general liability policies. Insurers can be presented with
cost of environmental clean-up.
'I can't see a UK court going out of its way to interpret the policies
totally against the written word,' says Mr Philip Bell, liability manager of
Sun Alliance. Mr Bell dismisses the possibility that UK courts may interpret
the wordings of public liability policies so that they cover the cost of
ordered clean-up of contaminated sites from public liability policies.
Certainly insurers who now offer pollution cover are taking no chances. A
handful of insurers, including American International Group, Zurich
Insurance, the Chemical Industries Association and ECS Underwriting, offer
insurance against the risk of gradual pollution. ECS last month introduced a
policy to include the recovery of costs for the clean-up of an operator's
own site.
Underwriting is highly selective. Claims must be made within the period of
the policy. But all the companies make the policies dependent on the
implementation of an environmental audit of the site to be insured.
Subsequently policyholders are obliged to maintain a rigorous system of risk
control and prevention.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (2): Down in the dumps -
UK landfillers face a tougher regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK waste management industry will pass a watershed next March when
disposal operators must decide whether to continue running their landfill
sites.
Those who prefer to surrender their licences will be able to avoid liability
for any environmental problems that subsequently surface; those who don't,
will be held responsible for a site until the end of its life or until it is
sold.
The new rules, which flow from the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, should
weed out the cowboy operators. Not only will this begin to clean up the
image of an industry that has long been tarnished by disreputable operators
 -in theory, it should also reduce capacity, giving a shot in the arm to a
sector that has fallen dramatically in investors' esteem.
For quoted companies this respite from the effects of recession comes not a
moment too soon.
Having gone into the economic downturn with observers saying they would be
recession proof (since there would always be a need to dispose of rubbish)
many waste companies have reached this point in the cycle suffering from a
severe mauling.
Not only has the recession reduced the amount of industrial and household
refuse, but many companies have chosen to store rather than dispose of the
more expensive low volume, high value wastes, in order to conserve cash.
And, perhaps as a result, the downturn in volumes has exposed over-ambitious
and weak managements which moved too quickly in the late 1980s to acquire
assets.
In particular, the waste sector underestimated the depths to which the
construction industry could sink in the UK, depriving companies of their
bread and butter business.
The malaise in the sector was typified by the profits warning from Leigh
Interests in September. The shares which had been standing at 226p, have
since fallen to 140p in spite of a claim by the chairman that second half
profits would be substantially ahead of the first half.
Likewise Caird Group, one of the more acquisitive groups in the late 1980s,
suffered from a sharp increase in interest in its first half and has found
trading conditions tougher since the interims.
What is more, there has been an almost complete freeze in corporate activity
in the UK. Tarmac, for example, has had no joy finding a buyer for its
Econowaste subsidiary at Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m. It has already passed a
target date when it wanted to have sold the subsidiary and may have to
accept a much lower price.
The industry is anxiously awaiting the sale as a signal about latest
valuations of landfill. The one exception is Waste Management International,
the UK quoted arm of Waste Management of the US, which has been quietly
buying companies in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia.
Like many City fads, however, the hype surrounding waste management
companies was overdone when the sector was in favour.
By the same token, the gloom now hanging over the sector may appear more
impenetrable than it really is. Grounds for optimism include:
the environmental legislation: over the next five years laws in Europe will
inexorably tighten. They are already tightening in the UK as a result of the
1990 EPA; France has enacted a new comprehensive waste law which is likely
to lead to the closure of 6,500 landfills; Italy is likely to put its first
comprehensive waste law before parliament next year and will receive
valuable support with the return to Rome of Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the
former environment commissioner; Germany's rules are already in place.
the new legislation from the Environmental Protection Agency is starting to
bite, even though the UK EPA's birth was delayed. It has already increased
the cost of disposal, particularly of the most toxic industrial wastes, and
is reducing competition. Again, while some confusion exists over the
requirements of European Community regulations and those arising from
national and even local government regulators, the trend is clearly in the
direction of favouring the supplier of high class services.
the UK government's urgent wish for control of waste to pass into the hands
of the private sector. While many local authorities may be better placed
than outsiders to tender for business, there is nevertheless a strong move
towards more basic waste management passing into private hands.
the duty of care for waste which has already started to play into the hands
of reputable operators. Companies producing waste are now responsible for
ensuring that a licensed carrier handles his waste and that it ends up in a
licensed landfill site.
some of the enthusiasm for waste companies sprang from the expectation of
higher landfill prices. Undoubtedly they will rise - the cost of disposal in
the UK is a sixth of the cost in Germany. The question is when. Some
observers say the UK disposal is cheaper than in continental Europe because
we still allow co-disposal of liquids and solid waste, the so-called
practice of dilute and disperse. A more accurate assessment would, however,
suggest the UK is cheaper because it still has a large amount of licensed
landfill.
There are, however, some equally strong reasons for short-term pessimism
about the future of the waste sector:
some fund managers would not touch waste companies, even the most reputable,
because of a fear of environmental liability;
the cost of making new landfill is rising sharply. The application process
is becoming longer and since lastApril new sites have had to ensure that
proper precautions are taken to control liquid leaching and gas emission.
This inevitably puts new operators - or operators of new sites - at a
disadvantage compared with operators of older sites who do not need to
recover the same investment costs. Some observers of the waste industry
believe it could be five years before operators of old and new sites are
competing on a level playing field.
While the waste sector seems to be bound to resume growth, investors will
need a long term view.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (4): A multi-disciplinary
field - Advisers must be chosen with care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE managing director in search of an environmental policy deserves some
sympathy. Changing legislation, pressure from customers and from public
opinion, and the company's own plans to expand - all these can suddenly put
environmental management high in the board's priorities.
Once environmental questions have caught the board's attention, the problems
can seem worrying and urgent. Breaches of pollution regulation can bring
high penalties, sometimes the threat of criminal proceedings against
directors, and perhaps worst of all, hard-to-tackle hostility from public
and pressure groups. Or long-planned acquisitions can be suddenly
jeopardised by uncertainty about the liabilities they might bring.
However, recognising a need for environmental planning is not the same as
knowing how to go about it. The European eco-auditing proposals and the
British standard BS7750 of environmental management offer some guidance to
adopting a management system, but generalisation is hard as regulation, the
risk of environmental disaster and competitive pressures vary enormously
between industries.
However, it is possible to give a few tips on the main questions to ask when
setting up an environmental strategy, whether with outside help or not.
First, how to pick an adviser. Many companies will lack in-house expertise
on regulation or 'green' technology, or energy efficiency measures, but
reaching for outside advice is now straightforward.
Although environmental management is a new discipline, particularly in
Europe, it has already spawned a horde of consultants, accountants, lawyers
and bankers. UK industry directories alone list more than 2,000 consultants.
Many advisers say they have identified environmental management and risk
assessment as areas of fast expansion in the 1990s, perhaps compensating
them for the shrunken financial and conveyancing markets.
According to Mr Allan Rickmann, head of the environmental arm of Willis
Corroon, the insurance broker, it is essential because of the subject's
newness to find out the relevant experience of the company and the
directors.
Relevant experience is important - many are just beginning to build up
client lists and the learning curve can be frustrating. Their expertise may
well have been drawn from one of several categories:
Skill in helping win local planning permission for new sites or production
processes, which often depends on detailed plans for leaving surrounding
areas - down to the last species of grass - in good condition.
Scientific research, sometimes in government departments, which may have
equipped them with highly specialised technical skills that may translate
poorly to the wider industrial arena.
Legal expertise. Many law firms have moved quickly to offer advice on the
possible liability that could come with changes in legislation, such as the
EC packaging directives, the UK's proposed register of contaminated land,
legal requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments, or EC proposals on
civil liability for waste.
Engineering. Information about their previous clients in similar industries,
particularly abroad, is important, as techniques change fast, both to comply
with rules and to seize commercial opportunities from them. Companies in the
US, with around a decade longer exposure to wide-ranging environmental
legislation, may have already pinpointed the best techniques.
Management consultancy. It is important to identify whether they have the
legal or technical skills to solve specific problems, or whether they are
more equipped to conduct an overall survey of production.
A large part of environmental management is about assessing risks and
minimising them, such as the risk of a tank rupturing, inadequate backup or
warning systems that could lead to leakages or uncontrolled emissions. Even
if managers think they are complying fully with rules, they need to be alert
to outside sentiment - public criticism of a competitor and heightened
public scrutiny of the industry, or simply whether a government minister
lives nearby.
Many advisers, particularly management consultants, urge a more wide-ranging
approach to environmental management than simple compliance with regulation,
however. Their mantras have become 'thinking proactively' and 'communicating
the environmental strategy through all levels of the company',
The arguments are similar to the now-familiar ones on the importance of high
quality at every stage of production and distribution. Many of the benefits
that companies and consultants say have been achieved from environmental
management systems derive from improvements in efficiency and production of
less waste, or from improvements to the product.
But it is important to calculate the benefits as well as the cost to the
company of investment in environmental techniques. Another principle much
favoured by consultants is that 'it is cheaper to rethink production overall
and reduce the level of emissions rather than to add end-of-pipe filters or
scrubbers to clean up' are useful starting points for inquiry but that
comparison will be different for every company.
If there is one consolation for the troubled managing director it is that
environmental management is likely to become easier even if the penalties
for getting it wrong increase.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (3): Accountants' cash in
 -Environmental audits are big business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMIDST much kicking and shoving, environmental consultants are jostling for
the fast-growing but increasingly competitive green market.
As insults are traded about the ability of individuals and companies to
carry out the best job, the industry is still trying to make clear its
definitions and lay down standards in response to concerns over the quality
of service being delivered.
In the meantime, business is coming under increasing public, political and
legislative pressure to pay serious attention to environmental auditing,
with mixed results.
Environmental audits have become big business. The latest edition of the
directory of environmental consultants published tomorrow by Environmental
Data Services (Ends), based in London, says the total market for consultancy
in the UK was about Pounds 400m this year.
That was generated by 339 mainstream firms, representing 9,000 professional
staff working on 19,000 separate contracts. More than 1,200 of these
contracts - or 6.4 per cent - covered environmental auditing alone.
It is difficult to draw comparisons with the past because much of the data
is being collected for the first time. But the growth has been rapid. There
were only 125 environmental consultants in the first edition of the
directory in 1989, and 225 in the 1990 version. Most firms are expecting
business to escalate rapidly.
That growth, particularly at a time of recession, is encouraging many new
entrants. Ends estimates that more than 1,000 firms claim to be
environmental consultants of sorts. Alongside the traditional players such
as Arthur D Little, a host of boutiques have sprung up. At least three of
the leading accountancy firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Touche Ross, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand - have established special units.
That has led to some barbed comments between the competition: What is the
quality of the smaller firms? Do the accountants have the appropriate
skills? Are the non-accountants too focused on technical rather than
managerial and rigorous sampling aspects of the audit?
There is still also ambivalence about future growth in the consulting
industry. Demand for services is not without its difficulties. While
contracts may prove lucrative in the short-term, auditors may in the future
run the risk of being sued if they fail to unearth or highlight the
significance of potential environmental liabilities such as site clean-up
costs forced on their clients at great expense.
Yet this competition has to be put in perspective. Most companies still do
not have environmental audits. Companies who audit tend to do it
irregularly, on only parts of their operations, and entrust the job to
in-house staff. When audits do take place, very few of the findings make it
into the public domain where they could be more objectively scrutinised.
There are exceptions. The chemical industry and some of the other sectors
often regarded as more environmentally harmful have long conducted audits of
sorts, not only to ensure compliance with regulations but for solid
commercial reasons: recycling saves vast amounts of money.
More recently, public pressure, good practice guidelines and existing and
prospective legislation has begun to have a more wide-ranging impact. The
100 Group of leading finance directors produced one set of guidelines
earlier this year.
BS7750, the British standard on environmental management systems, is perhaps
the document most widely quoted by companies. Among its recommendations is
that businesses should produce a publicly available environmental policy,
specify targets and conduct regular internal environmental audits.
Many point with some concern to the EC's eco-audit requirements, which most
companies still regard suspiciously even after intensive lobbying to dilute
their power. When initially proposed in 1990, the eco-audit was to be a
mandatory scrutiny of environmental facets of all activities in many
industries, which would culminate in publication of the results.
Over time, it has been diluted so that compliance is entirely voluntary, and
need not cover all a company's site. There is still the requirement for
external verification of audits, and the corporate fear that the proposals
will ultimately become mandatory.
In the meantime, the level of disclosure and reliability of environmental
reports remains disappointing. A survey in September by Company Reporting,
an Edinburgh-based organisation that monitors the annual accounts of UK
companies, concluded that most green information provided is disappointingly
thin.
From a sample of 570 companies, only one third disclosed any environmental
information.
There are some notable exceptions. Body Shop has probably gone further than
most British companies, with a detailed audit. The company has also publicly
called for the eco-audit requirement to be made compulsory. Even so, its
verification report conducted by Arthur D Little is limited in scope. Most
other companies are far less advanced.
RTZ is one company which proudly highlights its environmental achievements
with a published statement on green policies. But it sees little prospect of
making public the results of internal audits in the short-term. It also
questions the ability of external auditors to do better than its own staff,
or to be told how often audits should be conducted.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (1): A torrent of
legislation - Growing acceptance of the need for environmental policies has
lowered the tensions between 'green' campaigners and industry. Public
attention now focuses more on compliance with new regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX

<TEXT>
PRESSURE on industry to improve its environmental performance is entering a
new phase. In the past two decades, in response to growing public interest
in 'green' issues, the US and the European Community have passed at an
unprecedented rate a raft of new regulations ordering businesses to clean up
the environment.
The broad acceptance of the need for environmental policy by governments and
businesses has taken some of the heat out of the traditional confrontations
between 'green' pressure groups and industry, and public attention is now
focusing more on compliance with the new rules. For their part, businesses
are increasingly investigating whether environmental improvements could
prove to be a commercial opportunity as well as a cost.
The scope of environmental regulation now in place or shortly to be passed,
ranging from local to international, is now considerable and is the main
factor causing companies to pay more attention to the environment, according
to consultants' surveys.
The number of international agreements has risen sharply: between 1948 and
1970, governments signed only nine international treaties, mainly on oil
pollution, but since 1970 there have been 32 international treaties and 13
European Conventions, according to consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton.
The definitions of who is liable for the costs of cleaning up are also
widening. Under the 'polluter pays' principle accepted internationally at
the Rio Earth Summit in June, many environmental costs are now being passed
back to companies. The EC is currently discussing new rules on civil
liability for waste which could be as wideranging as some US legislation,
imposing strict liability - regardless of fault or negligence - and joint
and several liability, meaning that the 'deepest pockets' could shoulder
most of the costs.
Like the UK's proposed contaminated land register these rules could act
retrospectively, saddling companies with costs for environmental damage
committed many years in the past, even if the present owners or management
were not responsible.
There is a growing emphasis on improving levels of compliance with
regulation - the European Commission has acknowledged that its failure to
enforce its 200-odd directives equally across member countries could hinder
the operation of the single market, and EC countries last week agreed to set
up a European network of inspectors.
Penalties for infringement are also becoming harsher. The UK's 1990
Environmental Protection Act holds the producer of waste legally responsible
for its safe handling and disposal, and breach of the rules can result in
criminal charges against the senior management.
The scope of this regulation, and the competitive changes it is provoking in
many industries, means that more companies are beginning to make
environmental management part of their overall management strategy. To avoid
penalties - and the accompanying risk of damaging publicity - and to avoid
being left behind by competitors, companies may need to scrutinise their
production from 'cradle to grave': the source of raw materials, the impact
of the factory on its surroundings, the amount and type of energy consumed,
the effluents poured down pipes or on to the ground, emissions through the
chimneys and the final disposal of waste. That is before considering whether
the product itself is 'green' enough or whether customers will demand
changes.
To encourage companies to look at environmental management systematically,
the EC is discussing plans for ecoauditing - full, published, standardised
figures on a company's impact on the environment - and the UK has begun
trials of the new BS7750 standard of environmental management.
However, while many companies' intentions are good, in practice
environmental management can be patchy. KPMG Management Consulting, an arm
of the international accountancy firm, which recently conducted a survey of
environmental management in the top 100 companies in the UK, US and Canada,
concluded that 'most comments (in annual reports) were token efforts
demonstrating that the company was aware of the environment as an issue and
(gave) some broad promises of future actions'.
It added that 'in all three countries very few companies had used external
consultants to conduct an independent environmental audit'.
Unsurprisingly, formal environmental policies are most common in industries
such as national utilities, oil and gas and chemicals which have been
environmentally regulated for longest, while tourism and motor companies are
only just beginning to publish plans, and financial services companies
rarely mention the issues, according to a June 1991 survey by Touche Ross,
the accountancy and consultancy firm.
For some companies, environmental management can bring commercial
opportunities, as well as safety from penalties. The Confederation of
British Industry, in its response to the Rio Earth Summit in June, has been
adamant that there are 'real benefits to the business of sound environmental
performance'.
Investment in 'green technology' ahead of competitors can bring a
competitive advantage, as seen in the race between US oil companies to
reformulate petrol and diesel to meet the US Clean Air Act deadlines of
1994-98, and the research spending of motor companies on catalytic
converters and 'lean-burn' engines to reduce emissions.
Other companies find that the best way of reducing the level of waste,
emissions and discharges is to use raw materials and energy more efficiently
in production, leading to lower costs.
A booming waste management industry has also grown up to take advantage of
the rising costs of getting rid of waste, as it becomes harder to get
regulatory permission for emissions or discharges from factories, or to open
new landfills and incinerators.
But although some of the army of consultants and advisers appear to regard
it as axiomatic that investment in environmental management leads to a
competitive advantage, that is not true in all cases. In the UK water
industry, EC directives have resulted in at least Pounds 15bn of the
decade-long capital spending programme of some Pounds 45bn, but as the
companies are regional companies it is hard to argue they have gained
revenue.
The CBI has also suggested that some environmental legislation has been
'unrealistic' and a handicap to businesses, not an opportunity.
Mr Paul Beatley, a Paris-based consultant with Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, says
that it is right at least to ask whether environmental programmes really
benefit companies in the long run, despite the costs, although adding that
in his experience they do.
However, the question of the benefits of environmental spending is one that
is asked increasingly frequently - as the full costs of cleaning up the
environment have started to become clear.
The European Commission estimates that complying with directives - excluding
the considerable costs of the nuclear power industry and water supply -
costs member countries between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of GDP a year. In
its June 1991 study Touche Ross said that on the basis of 150 environmental
audits, European companies were spending around 4 per cent of turnover on
environmental measures. This appeared to be nearly double US figures,
although it emphasised that comparison is hard.
There are signs that growing awareness of the costs is slowing the pace of
new legislation - the US currently has a moratorium on new environmental
legislation, and EC countries are stressing the need for more realism about
the economic impact of proposals.
Governments are also favouring 'financial instruments' such as taxes or
permits for industrial emissions instead of more regulation for dealing with
environmental problems. At the Rio Earth Summit in June, the main solution
proposed to the threat of global warming from the emission of 'greenhouse
gases' such as carbon dioxide was energy or carbon taxes, possibly combined
with taxes on vehicles.
The costs of a carbon tax would undeniably be great, even if it was made
fiscally neutral by lowering other taxes - the European Commission estimates
that it could cut 0.07 per cent off EC real GDP growth in the first 13 years
after introduction. But the advantages of financial instruments - both for
governments and for businesses - are that the costs are more readily
foreseen and their investment can be better planned.
The new mood of realism about the costs and limitations of environmental
regulation may well benefit the environment, as standards of industrial
compliance rise. It may also help environmental management progress further
from present standards, as businesses become better able to judge the impact
of environmental regulation on their markets and to spot opportunities and
shape their strategies accordingly.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (16): New ideas improve an
old system - The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER technology has long been at the forefront of change in the
operation of the US banking industry.
From the introduction of the first automated teller machines (ATMs) in the
1970s through to the widespread introduction of the 'debit card' over the
past decade, computer systems have been instrumental to maintaining the
breathtaking pace of change in what is - by its very nature - a somewhat
conservative industry.
In spite of all this change, however, most US banking customers still prefer
to do some things the old way. One might be forgiven for thinking, for
example, that the growth of interest in EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)
and consumer debit cards would have started to make the banking industry a
great deal more paperless.
But that would be to ignore the familiarity and friendliness of the cheque.
According to the financial services division of computer giant IBM, around
50bn personal and business cheques are processed by the US banking system
every year and there is no sign of a significant decline in the use of
cheques.
For this reason, the banks are taking another look at the way they handle
cheques. The cheques are often proofed manually and then added up, using
elderly 10-key adding machines before being finally entered into the bank's
main computer system.
IBM, for example, has developed what it calls a 'proof of deposit' system
based on image processing and optical character recognition technology.
It operates by first scanning all the cheques into an image-processing
system and storing an electronic image of each cheque and then using optical
character recognition (OCR) software to read the details of the transaction
represented by the cheque.
IBM claims that its ImagePlus High-Performance (HPTS) Proof-of-Deposit (POD)
system is able to read and record more than half of the handwritten and
machine-printed dollar amounts that appear on image-captured cheque faces.
It is also supposed to balance deposits automatically and identify illegible
amounts and route them to a keyboard operator who can look at the on-screen
image of the paperwork concerned and correct it accordingly.
The IBM system has been undergoing extensive trials at big North American
banks in recent months and the company expects to start shipping it in
December.
Among the institutions involved in these trials were the Royal Bank of
Canada, Key Bank, Mellon Bank and the Bank of America.
'Longer term, image (processing technology) has the potential to give the
entire industry a higher quality level for its customers,' says Mr Gil
Arbuckle, a senior vice-president and cheque services manager at Mellon Bank
Corporation in Pittsburgh.
According to Mr Bill Gee, manager of the Royal Bank of Canada's item
processing services in systems and technology, this kind of technology is
vital to his organisation's long-term strategy. 'Proof of deposit is our
focus today,' he says.
'(These systems) allow us to invest in a platform on which we can build new
image applications and offer new customer services in the years ahead.'
Cost savings and productivity improvements can come from all parts of the
cheque-handling process. Most North American banks, for example, send
customers back the originals of their processed cheques once they have been
deposited through the banking system.
These used cheques are generally sent out with bank statements - and must be
physically sorted and enclosed with the bank statements in envelopes with
which they are sent out.
Using image-processing, an electronic image of the cheques can be stored
with the bank statement information and printed out along with the bank
statement when it is prepared.
Image processing also offers the US banking industry other gains - helping
them to handle all manner of paperwork without paper. It could be used to
handle mortgage loan processing, credit card billing inquiries, commercial
lending, mutual funds management, trust management and letters of credit.
The beauty of this technology is that it offers banks a 'halfway house'
between entirely automated, paperless operation - which many customers are
still not entirely comfortable with - and the inefficient, over-staffed,
paper-laden systems of old.
When using image processing systems, paper still plays a vital role in
getting information about financial transactions to the banks. But once a
paper document arrives at the bank, it immediately becomes a computer image
that can be passed around the corner or around the world electronically in
an instant.
This not only means that the banks have greater flexibility in how they
handle documents, it also means that the work represented by those documents
need not necessarily be handled at the place where the documents are
physically stored.
If one branch or department is over-burdened with financial documents to
process, another can help out by having the electronic image of those
documents sent over a wide area network or leased line. The work can then be
completed by the other department and sent back to the place it came from.
Finally, image processing could make life a lot easier for bank customers.
If, for example, a bank held a sample signature, a colour photograph or even
a spoken voice sample as part of its worldwide database, any customer from
any of that bank's branches worldwide could prove who they were easily and
carry out more complex transactions than would normally be allowed from a
foreign branch office.
Such a system also improves security for the bank - as it is much harder to
forge a face, voice and signature than it is to forge the signature by
itself.

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank is spending Pounds 20m in the current year to get
a comprehensive dedicated computer communications system up and running.
Olivetti is installing more than 1,000 network controllers at NatWest -
these controllers offer a high degree of communication in retail banking
applications.
The controllers summon personal account data via the bank's network.
To develop its nationwide branch server network, the bank is using systems
from Symicron Computer Communications of Eltham. Mr John Tilbrook,
Symicron's chairman, says: 'It was imperative for the bank to 'marry' its
existing network to the application needs at branch level. This demanded
full flexibility of communications options.'
The installed NatWest solution involves a combination of Symicron's products
for open systems interconnection (OSI), System Network Architecture (SNA)
and Unix TCP/IP communications. More details on the Symicron system are
available on 081-857-5577.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (14): Starting from scratch -
The new Bank of Edinburgh is consolidating client information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Edinburgh, a start-up bank funded by venture capital, intends
get away from the traditional banking services which restrict clients to a
set of pre-defined product offerings. Instead it wants to tailor packages of
banking services to meet its clients' individual needs.
In order to do so, it is installing a computer system imported from Canada.
The system is novel in UK banking terms in two ways. It is sufficiently
flexible to cope with individually tailored packages for clients. It also
runs on a personal computer network.
According to operations director Mr Sandy Macdonald, the bank has tried to
move the parameters of retail banking. Most banks today offer products:
mortgages, higher interest accounts, 60-day notice accounts, and personal
loans, are some examples. These products are the parameter for storing
customer information on the computer systems.
But on the Bank of Edinburgh system, the data is structured so that the
customer is considered as a single account. It stores customer information
under their name, combined with a unique customer number.
Every piece of business that the customer does with the bank is registered
as a sub-set of that account: under the customer's name there might be three
sub-sets, say, one for normal instant access, one for 90 days notice and
another for a loan.
The system can also consolidate a client's entire banking data on to a
single statement. So instead of getting separate statements for their higher
interest and cheque accounts, the client gets one statement showing both
accounts.
'The system is geared towards the relationship between the bank and the
customer,' says Mr Macdonald. 'No matter how many accounts a customer has,
we treat them as a whole, and at any time we can see that customer's
relationship with the bank,' he says.
The system is also able to break down information. For example, a
solicitor's partnership might wish some items to be broken down to help it
manage its own internal cost allocations.
'As long as you can identify the date, time and nature of the transaction,
you can begin to start grouping things together . . . Possibly the reason
why it has not been done before is because the descriptions have not been
good enough,' says Mr Macdonald.
For example, bank statements will usually show that a cheque was paid in,
but not where it was from. 'We believe the manner in which we will use the
transaction codes will be more flexible,' says Mr Macdonald.
Software for the system was developed by Canadian banking software
specialist Prologic, working with the Richmond Savings Bank in Vancouver.
It is based on Prologic's own fourth generation language (4GL) software,
known as Probe. The 4GL language is generally considered to be more flexible
and easier to work with than older computer languages such as Cobol.
The Richmond Savings Bank installation now has 350 PCs in 10 branch offices,
all linked across telecommunications lines. It handles 600,000 accounts and
processes 115,000 client transactions a day. It is claimed that a PC in a
branch can retrieve information from the database in three seconds.
The software was adapted to handle UK banking regulations by the
Bristol-based software house Apak. A deal was arranged between Apak and the
Bank of Edinburgh, whereby Apak would refine the system to meet the bank's
requirements, but Apak would keep the intellectual property rights. It hopes
to sell the product in other parts of Europe.
The Bank of Edinburgh system, which is now installed, is much smaller than
the Vancouver one. It has only seven 386 PC terminals, and two 486 PCs
acting as file servers: one runs the network and the other stores the
customer accounts database.
This is expected to be sufficient to handle early requirements for the bank.
Its strategy is to expand by acquisition, and it is currently bidding for
the Heart of England building society. Assuming the acquisition is
successful, others could follow.
Any acquired building societies will be able to continue using their own
systems, but will also be able to gain flexibility by linking up to the
bank's system if they wish to. As it is built on industry-standard software
and hardware, this should not be difficult.
The Bank of Edinburgh's system achieves a goal that many other retail banks
worldwide are aiming for. According to Mr Paul Stockton, a banking
specialist with Hoskyns Consulting, the banks today are looking to improve
customer service but also want to ensure remain profitable.
One issue that many are looking at is market segmentation. The large banks
need large numbers of customers, and the only way they feel they can service
that mass market is with standardised products.
Personalised service of the type by the Bank of Edinburgh is a way to
attract the higher value personal and business customers, says Mr Stockton.
'People now expect more from banking and all the banks are looking at market
segments and niches' he says.
Many, such as the large UK high street banks, are constrained by older,
monolithic mainframe systems, developed many years ago for a different type
of banking market. All are making huge investments in new customer-oriented
databases. But the huge investments required mean the process has taken a
long time.
Start-up operations such as the Bank of Edinburgh, have the luxury of being
able to design systems from scratch. Another example is the Midland Bank's
telephone banking subsidiary, First Direct. At First Direct, bank staff sit
at computer terminals with all the information about a customer at their
fingertips.
Mr Macdonald stresses that the Bank of Edinburgh is not aiming to imitate
First Direct. It does not have access to the wider range of banking
services, such as cash point machines, that First Direct can obtain from
Midland; therefore, it is clearly positioning itself at the high value
market segment, which its own technology can adequately serve.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (13): Open strategy for
survival - Profile of Winter Partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a staggering period of expansion and prosperity in the mid-1980s,
international financial institutions face a tough time in the current world
recession.
Expansion plans have been postponed, especially those for information
technology, and even the usually recession-proof software industry has found
it hard to maintain the heady growth of a decade ago.
The world recession has coincided with a sea change in the structure of the
computer industry - with leaders such as IBM and DEC laying off staff and
their customers looking for ways to reduce costs. The trend towards
downsizing and open systems is fundamental to this change.
The Swiss-based banking software supplier Winter Partners sees open systems
as the best way to survive in tight market conditions. It started work on
moving its main software packages to open systems in 1989 and expects to
deliver the first results next year.
The development would have been achieved faster, had it not been for the
company strategy of extending the scope of its packages, at the same time as
broadening its potential market by taking the software to other computer
systems.
'We have a two-pronged approach: firstly, we are moving the products to Unix
platforms for open systems; and secondly, we are introducing more functions
to meet the needs of our customers,' says Mr Keith Williams, general manager
of Winter Partners' UK-based IBS-90 division.
'This is essential in the current market conditions, which are the worst I
have ever known. Although we are still selling systems, we are seeing
volumes between 30 and 40 per cent off - which I believe is typical in the
rest of the industry,' Mr Williams says.
With software installed in 400 sites across 35 countries, Winter Partners
has shown that it is possible, however, to ride the ups and downs of
international finance by spreading its net wide.
Founded in 1970, Winter Partners is a privately-held Swiss software company,
with a minority interest held by Electrowatt AG. In its last financial year
Winter Partners reported total gross revenues of SFr36m, (Dollars 26.4m)
earned from selling banking software packages and management consultancy.
Revenues are split evenly between the two areas  - although, in most cases,
the consultancy effort is linked to Winter Partners own products.
Winter Partners sells three different software packages:
Bancos, a package for private banks, sold mainly in Switzerland and mainland
Europe;
RIBS, a package for building specialised applications such as portfolio
management, again sold mainly in Europe;
IBS-90, the company's flagship package which covers all aspects of
international banking and sold worldwide.
Development work on IBS-90 is carried out in the UK - including the effort
to move the software to Unix-based open hardware.
The UK connection is the result of an important acquisition and the company
was virtually unknown in the UK until April 1987 when it took over Arbat, a
leading UK banking software company.
The surprise takeover pushed Winter Partners into the headlines and
increased its international profile. After steady growth through the 1970s,
Winter Partners started its expansion phase with the aim of becoming a world
player in the banking software market in 1980.
Since then, it has achieved a strong position in its European 'home' market
and in the Far East. In 1990, it expanded once more, this time into the US
market. It now has offices in most big banking centres including the UK,
Singapore, Hong Kong and the US.
Its customers include 50 of the world's top 200 financial institutions with
names such as Barclays Bank, Kleinwort Benson, the Bank of England and
National Westminster Bank at the top of the list.
Winter Partners has also taken up the challenge of the emerging market in
the former eastern bloc countries of Europe and has sold its software to
five banks in Hungary and one in Poland.
The takeover of Arbat in 1987 brought Winter Partners a valuable prize -
Arbat's International Banking System (IBS) software package, which runs on
DEC's VAX minicomputer. The scalability of the DEC VAX has let Winter
Partners to sell its software into a wide range of financial institutions.
In April 1990, Winter signed a co-operative marketing agreement with DEC to
promote a re-vamped package under its current name IBS-90.
Over the past two years Winter Partners has invested an average of 30 per
cent of its revenues in continued development of the package.
More importantly, it recognised the opportunity presented by emerging open
systems hardware and embarked on a project to re-write the IBS-90 software
to exploit this. The UK development team is re-writing the IBS-90 modules in
the 'C' programming language, which is closely associated with open Unix
systems. Once all the program code has been converted, it will be simple to
tailor it to a specific Unix system.
The package consists of a large number of modules which can be used to build
an 'integrated' system for the international wholesale banking business. It
covers front and back office operations, in addition to providing management
information statistics and analyses.
It includes modules to handle everything from treasury exposure management,
through foreign exchange, to interest rate swaps and marketable securities.
There are also modules to handle commercial lending and credit control and
business development analysis.
IBS-90 can link to the Swift network.
Winter Partners expects the first sales of the open version of IBS-90 to go
its traditional market based on DEC minicomputers. DEC is committed to
making its DEC VAX range compatible with emerging open systems and Winter
Partners' long-established relationship with DEC will stand it in good
stead.
'But we will not be limited to just DEC as we are now,' says Mr Williams.
'Now the programs are nearly all converted to 'C', we can look for a broader
market - depending on what choice our customers make.'
By the third quarter of next year, when the first open IBS-90 packages are
scheduled to be installed, times might not be quite so hard. But, whatever
happens, the growth of open systems as the basis for future applications
software, will give Winter Partners an important new market to sell into.

 -Worries over breaches of security take centre stage

<TEXT>
A UK bank, coping with short staff over the Christmas holidays, recently
gave a supervisor one of the two passwords needed to transfer funds
overseas. The other password was stuck to the side of the personal computer
the supervisor used. Within minutes he had transferred Pounds 2.5m overseas.
Within hours he was on a plane, following it.
This is the kind of incident computer security aims to prevent. Most
breaches of security are far less glamorous. Power failure is the biggest
single cause, according to a recent survey of IT security by the NCC. Poor
software, not diligent hackers, is another big cause of problems.
Malicious or not, risks to computer systems are increasing.  More
transactions formerly made on paper are now being handled electronically.
At the same time the trend to make computer use universal is increasing the
number of people that can gain access and do damage to computers.
The move towards distributed computing and away from centralised control on
mainframe computers, adds to the hazards. 'Every time someone tags on to a
network legitimately they can theoretically hack on further,' says Mr Andrew
Mulholland, marketing director of BICC Information Systems and Services, a
company which specialises in networking.
The danger is clear. How many breaches of security have taken place in the
past is less so. Banks and other financial institutions are reluctant to
admit to breaches of security.
In its 1991 Survey of IT Security Failures and Breaches, the NCC estimates
the cost of physical security breaches such as power failures, thefts of
equipment and fires, to be as much as Pounds 100m annually for finance
organisations. Breaches in logical security, such as faulty software or
software viruses, total at least Pounds 35m, it says.
The financial community uses various techniques to protect itself against
such losses. The Bankers Automated Clearing Service (Bacs), for example, is
protected from unauthorised access on two levels, says Mr Cyril Bloch,
managing director of Telesmart, a UK company providing software products to
work with Bacs.
A password generator controls access to the network, automatically creating
a new password each time a user enters their pin number. The password lasts
only as long as the transaction.
This is combined with authentication. Users are issued a set of keys which
generate an authenticator which appears at the beginning and end of each
file, helping to protect the file from corruption when it is being
transmitted. Files can also be encrypted so that even if someone does break
into a file being transferred, the data will be in code.
Another technique now gaining currency is biometrics. A biometric is a
measured value which identifies a person. It could be a fingerprint, a
signature or even a retinal scan which has been analysed and given a unique
identifier. 'The difference between a biometric and a password is that a
password can be stolen. A biometric can't,' says Mr Jim Copson, a product
manager for IBM's banking business.
Non repudiation has also become a feature of some systems. This allows the
organisation to trace precisely via its computer system who was responsible
for a particular transaction.
Security is like insurance; the more an organisation has to lose from a
breach of security, the more it will spend to counteract that risk. For this
reason more financial organisations are looking for ways to assess their
risk.
Some have developed software packages which look at the various aspects of
risk.
The larger clearing banks who are exposed to greater risks have evolved
higher levels of security. Smaller organisations with older, less well
developed systems, tend to be more exposed, says Mr Clark.
The trend towards the use of local area networks and distributed computing
systems which take power away from the centre pose new security problems.
'We only want some of the people to have some of the information some of the
time,' says BICC's Mr Mulholland.
Most networks are designed to allow for maximum spread of information. To
counter this, BICC advises its customers to think about information domains.
Instead of sending all data all the way around a network, it should be
limited to a particular group of workstations. This means creating
workgroups and controlling the flow of information.
'The security of the information itself is not the only issue,' says Mr
Colin Williams, marketing director of Gandalf Digital Communications, a
supplier of networking equipment. 'People are realising that there is real
risk in security of operation as well.'
Many companies are developing standby systems to take over when the primary
system fails. It may mean using services from both British Telecom and
Mercury, so that if one is interrupted, the other may not be.
Advances in technology tend to multiply security risks and in the rush to
use them, security considerations are pushed to the rear. But some advances
will also help to increase security. The use of frame relay and cell relay
technologies in networks is one example.
These make it more difficult to pull useful data off a network because small
segments of data are routed over a network and not reassembled until they
reach the end point.
Similarly, as the cost of biometrics continues to fall, they will be used
more widely. As electronic data exchange becomes more common, techniques
such as biometrics which are now limited to banks will move into the
commercial sector, says IBM's Mr Copson.
But, says Mr Chris Hook, deputy principal consultant at the IT security
division of the NCC. 'you can have as many passwords and encryptions as you
like. They're no good if you don't keep the keys safe'.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (9): Forecasting failure -
Economic models need to be improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC models have won few awards, and plenty of wooden spoons, in Britain
over the past few years.
When it comes to predicting how economies work, few economists are happy
unless they have at their finger tips a computerised model - sets of
software which link economic variables such as inflation and manufacturing
output.
Unhappily, in recent years the models have left much to be desired,
especially in Britain where most have had a dismal record in forecasting the
longest recession for 50 years. But while one reaction is to ditch the
models and rely on intuitive methods to project economic patterns, there is
a strong interest in trying to improve on the models.
In the UK, about 10 big economic institutions run their own models of how
the economy is supposed to work. These include the Treasury, the Bank of
England and other non-government organisations such as the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London Business School.
Copies or variants of these models are used in a large number of smaller
forecasting groups, either in the City of London or in academic
establishments.
But economic models are essentially tools which must be supplemented by the
skills and reasoning process of the economists in charge of them.
Models usually comprise several hundred mathematical equations linking a few
dozen specific economic factors according to statistical correlations
applied previously or to economic theory.
Using the links between all the equations in the model, an economist would
hope to be able to infer how different combinations of economic events
pushed demand or spending in specific directions, and thus trace the
possible path of the economy as a whole.
Most economic models are based on the mathematical relationships between
such variables as consumer spending and interest rates that have been shown
to apply in the past. They operate reasonably smoothly in economic
conditions similar to those which have happened already.
But Britain in the past few years has experienced a peculiar combination of
circumstances. These have included the high costs of servicing the large
debts run up by consumers and businesses in the late 1980s, entry into a
fixed system of exchange rates, high European interest rates sparked by
German unification and a slowing world economy.
That partly explains why hardly any UK economist was able to give reasonable
advance warning of the seriousness of the recession, even though by early
1991 a small group of City and academic groups had woken up sufficiently to
what was happening to be predicting a lengthy period of decline.
In this environment, many groups of economists are taking a hard look at the
construction of their models and how they are used. Among the different
initiatives are those to:
Stop using models. Mr Peter Warburton, UK economist at investment bank
Robert Fleming, says he realised three years ago that the monetary slowdown
sparked by the high debts of late 1980s were making current models useless.
Mr Warburton abandoned his economic model which he had worked on since the
mid-1980s and relied instead on his own reasoning power and judgments.
Perhaps because of this decision Mr Warburton has had more success than most
in predicting the dire straits that the economy has fallen into. Plug holes
in the existing models. Mr Leo Doyle, econometrician at Kleinwort Benson
investment group used this approach in the late 1980s when reasoning that
the Treasury model - a copy of which he was using - did not cover
sufficiently areas such as the impact of debt on corporate balance sheets.
He therefore introduced new equations into the model which Kleinwort Benson
has subsequently used, taking into account the impact of debt by both
consumers and businesses on levels of spending and demand. He also worked
into the model the effect of falls in asset prices particularly houses on
confidence patterns and consumption. As a result of these changes, Kleinwort
Benson has been one of the leaders in the UK in predicting that the
recession would be lengthy.
Simplify equations in the existing software. One approach has been to use
vector auto-regressive (VAR) models, which use fewer variables than most
conventional models. They rely less on economic theory more on relatively
straightforward statistical projections based on past data. The UK branch of
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is using VAR models. It reckons they
are showing promise.
Artificial intelligence. One relatively new idea is to match human intuition
with the powers of computers. This boils down to extracting from top
economists the kinds of rules and judgments they use when thinking about
economic events and putting these in a form that a computer can understand.
This computer is then linked to standard economic models to provide
projections about economic events that are derived from the model's view of
the economy mixed in with human skills. The Henley Centre and London
Business School are among several research groups experimenting with this
approach.
Add more intuition. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club , a forecasting group which
uses the Treasury model, attempts to come up with a number of outside
judgments derived from industry representatives when providing an opinion
about the future. It starts with a description of the economy as mapped out
by the model and adds opinions obtained from economists working in specific
fields. Item's approach is a useful step towards formalising the interaction
between the model and outside judgments which is a key part of any
forecasting procedure.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (11): Service still friendly
 -IT helps building societies look after customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK AUSTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's building societies are proud of the friendly image they have
managed to hang on to, in spite of embracing much of the selling culture of
modern retail banking.
Nor does this image seem to have been hampered by their enthusiastic
adoption of technology. The building societies have the only nationally
branded ATM network, Link, and their branches have long had counter-top
terminals, whereas most banks have yet to install them.
A cynic might say what keeps the service friendly is time it still takes to
update a passbook on the terminal, leaving plenty of time to chat with the
teller. But the main benefit is that a customer can go into any branch of
his or her building society and make a withdrawal or a status (balance)
enquiry with a passbook. Unlike the banks, the societies have central
customer databases, even if many are still account-based rather than
customer oriented.
'The building societies are the most sophisticated users of branch systems,'
says Mr Nigel Croisdale, director of ICL Financial Services Division, whose
Omnia Branch retail banking system is aimed largely at the building society
market.
But the recession and the collapse in the housing market, bringing a drop in
mortgage lending and a rise in bad debts, has forced the societies to
reassess IT and business strategies. The era of diversification into new
product lines has given way to one of renewed concentration on the core
savings and loans business.
Technology can be used to improve customer service and hence to maintain or
increase market share. And while the building societies' cost/income ratios
are generally better than those of banks, they are now looking to reduce
costs and increase productivity. IT can help achieve this, as long as IT
expenditure itself does not get out of hand.
Mr Paul Finch, associate director with Computer Management Group (CMG), says
the current climate has meant that the 'naturally conservative' building
societies are looking harder at IT spending. Some are 'lean and mean' on the
IT side, he says, but others have fat to be trimmed.
Unlike the banks, building societies have stuck to a 'do-it-yourself'
approach to IT, says Mr Finch. 'They are reluctant to spend money on outside
expertise or to delegate project management.'
IT strategy has to be driven by business strategy, Mr Kevin Southwood,
marketing director at Northern Rock, says, 'but some institutions fail in
their IT strategy because they don't have a well-defined business strategy,
or because they change it every six months,' he says.
The business strategy at Northern Rock is to go for high growth, calling for
speed and flexibility in product development. 'If I want to launch a new
fixed rate mortgage I need to be able to get it out to the branches
tomorrow, not in a fortnight,' says Mr Southwood.
This flexibility has been achieved through core systems re-engineering, he
says, while cost effectiveness has been improved by basic office automation.
People, says Mr Southwood, sometimes re-engineer systems unnecessarily
because they confuse systems problems with office automation problems.
Northern Rock has systems people attached to each business department, such
as mortgages or investments, and this, says Mr Southwood, 'helps enormously
in the understanding and management of systems.' This reorganisation of
staff took place three years ago and has, he says, 'brought spectacular
benefits in terms of getting things right first time - it has dramatically
changed our project times'.
The Woolwich is another believer in in-house systems development, partly as
a result of its bad experience in the 1980s when it had considerable trouble
modifying an integrated accounting package from Hogan Systems.
Mr Ray Scotter, general manager of information services at the Woolwich,
admits that the economic downturn has brought a drive to cut costs, in IT as
elsewhere. There is, he thinks, 'some scope for reining in costs without
significantly impacting the business side'. New development projects will be
more closely questioned, as will costs and resources on the operations side.
But although the scope of development activity may be reduced, IT remains
central to the Woolwich's business priority of improving customer services.
'We have to focus on providing good quality IT support for the staff in the
branches,' says Mr Scotter.
A big project for the next 12-18 months will be a radical overhaul of the
Woolwich's branch systems. Being one of the first societies to have put
online systems in all its branches, much of the equipment is due for
replacement. The present mix of IBM dumb terminals supplemented by
standalone PCs will be replaced by PCs running under local area networks
(LANs).
Keeping up its levels of IT investment is the Leeds Permanent which has
undertaken some big IT projects in the past couple of years. It has
installed a new branch system based on a network of Olivetti PCs at a cost
of Pounds 25m, and a new mortgage system in the form of a Pounds 10m Unisys
UFSS package.
Mr George Scarlett, head of computer systems and services at the Leeds,
describes the developments at branch level as 'a phase of empowerment' -
providing more systems support and allowing staff to perform functions
previously carried out at head office. Conversely, the Leeds is also looking
at taking out of the branch those administrative functions that do not
affect customer service.
Projects in the pipeline at the Leeds include a prototype for a new front
end system with a graphical user interface (GUI) to run on PCs in the
branches, which is due to be rolled out next year.
Business strategy may vary from one society to another, but Mr Croisdale at
ICL thinks one thing links those who are successful in their IT strategies:
'The most successful IT users are those where the top management takes a
hands-on interest in the success of IT projects.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (7): Structural obstacles
litter the route - The London insurance market approaches  change at varying
speeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX YEARS after 'big bang' and long after other city financial institutions
have changed their working practices, the London insurance market is slowly
beginning to embrace new technology. But the pace of change has been uneven.
Larger insurance brokers - professional insurance buyers - and insurance
companies have backed the changes which they believe will radically increase
the efficiency of the London insurance market and improve its ability to
compete against European and North American rivals.
'Insurance is like any other business in that nothing focuses the mind more
than the prospect of losing clients and making losses,' explains Mr Max
Taylor, chairman of the board of Limnet, a London market network which links
up underwriters and brokers from all sectors of the London market.
Supporters of new technology have been forced to tackle an array of
structural and cultural obstacles. The London insurance market is highly
fragmented, divided by function, market specialisation and business
organisation.
Brokers who buy insurance on behalf of commercial clients have no direct
community of interest with underwriters. Underwriters of traditional marine
insurance sometimes see their interests as quite distinct from reinsurers or
insurers of large commercial risks.
Insurance companies, whose branches or divisions, are members of the
Institute of London Underwriters (for marine business) or the London
Insurance and Reinsurance Markets Association (for non-marine business), do
not always see eye to eye with syndicates at Lloyd's of London.
Above all there are few big players, who have the economic weight within the
market to force through changes. Lloyd's consists of more than 279
syndicates managed by about 100 agency groups and the ILU and Lirma each has
more than 100 members.
This is in sharp contrast to the structure of the retail market's structure,
where new technology has been introduced rapidly and thoroughly.
Huge supermarket chains have been able to use their economic muscle to force
suppliers to adopt computerisation, says Mr Tim Taylor, of IBM which
supplies hardware and systems support to the London Insurance Market Network
(Limnet). Many underwriters have a small business mentality. 'People are
jealous of their own independence,' says Mr Taylor.
Lloyd's, the ILU and Lirma agreed to develop common market standards for
electronic communication in 1987. However, given the market's fragmentation,
progress has inevitably been uneven. It has been most comprehensive in
backroom operations farthest removed from the markets' day to day trading
activities.
Limnet's 'signing and accounting messages' application handles the cash flow
transactions that follow the placement of a risk. Brokers and underwriters
deal with all these accounting transactions via centralised market bureaux -
such as the Lloyd's Policy Signing Office.
These act as financial clearing houses. Virtually all these transactions -
some 28m a year - are now handled electronically across Limnet.
In transactions affecting the day to day business of placing business and
handling claims, progress has been understandably slower. However, both ILU
and Lirma companies now process more than half their claims electronically,
while some individual brokers handle a much higher proportion.
Willis, for example, processes more than 80 per cent of the claims it deals
with over the electronic system. Even the Lloyd's market, where three
separate claims offices were unified in July, hopes to launch a pilot scheme
at the end of next March.
Ms Jenny Shaw, executive director of Willis Corroon Group information
systems division, says that the average time it takes to pay claims has been
reduced five weeks to between two to three weeks.
This has yielded important savings for Willis which has been able to handle
the huge volume of extra claims emerging from the London insurance market's
recent heavy losses without having to take on extra staff.
Ms Anne Waite, divisional director of Willis Corroon's marine division, says
that the system has helped staff avoid mistakes and improve the consistency
of its data.
Progress in electronic placing of risks by brokers has been much less rapid.
This is partially because many underwriters are only just beginning to
understand how the EPS system can support the more complex face-to-face
negotiations which are such an important part of business in the London
market.
The bulk of the more than 200 risks placed electronically since the system
came on stream in April have been for insurances such as personal accident
policies, in which terms and conditions tend to be standard. In the
insurance of more complex risks, electronic trading supports rather than
replaces face-to-face negotiations.
For example, Mr Richard McFarlane, international property broker with Willis
Corroon, recently spent up to 20 hours in talks with two 'lead' underwriters
to agree on a large portion of the insurance of an Australasian power plant.
These 'lead' underwriters examined a range of details about the risk,
ranging from the geology of the area where the plant was located, to the
cost of alternative power supplies, before agreeing a premium rate.
Once these matters were agreed, support from a 'following market' - made up
of more than a dozen other insurers - was gathered electronically. The
ability to trade in this way saved the brokers and underwriters time and
money.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (6): Traditionalists addicted
to paper and ink - Lloyd's underwriters take their time over computerisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERWRITERS at the 300 year old Lloyd's of London insurance market are
overcoming their scepticism about new new technology but the journey from
traditional methods of trading to the electronic marketplace is proving
painfully slow.
Little progress has been made so far in either placing business or in
processing claims electronically. And brokers perceive Lloyd's to be lagging
behind its rivals in the company market. Yet there is a growing realisation
among the market's underwriters that new technology must be embraced.
A Lloyd's syndicate was one of the first insurers to underwrite a risk
electronically when the electronic placing support (EPS) initiative came on
stream in the London market earlier this year.
So far, though, only 20 agencies of the 100 or so managing syndicates
trading in the market this year have equipped their syndicates to trade
electronically via the a system called electronic placing support.
Many older underwriters have yet to overcome their fear of new technology.
Only a handful of personal accident and reinsurance deals have been placed
electronically up to now.
Mr Terry Hayday, the chairman of the Lloyd's Network Steering Group which
co-ordinates the activities of Limnet at Lloyd's, explains that electronic
placement has always been designed to support rather than replace the
traditional face to face negotiations between underwriters and brokers.
'We are well aware that the penny has only just dropped that electronic
support means just what it says,' says Mr Hayday.
Even so, there is widespread scepticism on the market, especially among
underwriters whose main business is underwriting more complex individual
risks.
'It is not going very far. I'm a bit cynical about it The market as a whole
seems to be labouring with it,' says Mr Mark Bodkin, an underwriter with one
of the market's biggest syndicates, Cater Allen 190.
'It is not really relevant for the business we underwrite. We require a lot
of information. You can get far more out of a broker than you can from black
and white numbers on a screen,' adds Mr Bodkin.
Mr Hayday accepts that the initiative has been launched at a bad time, with
many syndicates hard-pressed for cash. Even though connection costs have
fallen over the past few months, Mr Hayday accepts that underwriters 'are
naturally understandably reluctant to commit themselves until they know what
the volumes going through the system will be.
'In today's environment where there is great emphasis on cost cutting it is
difficult to persuade people. For a number of people whose syndicates may
not be around next year it is not the highest priority.'
Lloyd's has made less progress in another area of electronic trading, that
of claims processing. Insurance companies who are members of the Institute
of London Underwriters and London Insurance and Reinsurance Market
Association are already processing more than 50 per cent of their claims
payments electronically.
By contrast the Lloyd's market has only just begun to rationalise its
existing paper-based claims handling systems.
Until July this year, claims that were paid by the market's marine,
non-marine and aviation underwriters were all processed by separate offices.
The recently established unified claims office has yet to introduce an
electronic claims system, although it is launching a pilot scheme at the end
of next March and, at present, it envisages the introduction of a full scale
system in 1994.
More progress has been made in a third EDI application, for processing
reinsurance recoveries.
Underwriters are probably more optimistic about Lloyd's possibilities in
this area than any other. Mr Richard Holliday, of syndicate 40, for example,
believes that the LORS system will greatly add to the market's efficiency
and bring immediate benefits to individual underwriters.
'The cost of generating reinsurance recoveries will fall. At the moment
there are mountains of reinsurance credit and debit notes floating around,'
says Mr Holliday. 'The new system will help with cash flow.'
In spite of the doubts, though, everyone recognises that Lloyd's must come
to terms with new technology. 'I think there is an awareness that we have to
wake up to new technology,' he adds.
Mr Phillip Davies, of the Octavian Agency, whose syndicates have been among
those linking up to the electronic placing support system, summarises the
mood.
He says that his underwriters regularly check the system but rarely find any
business is being offered. 'It's is a bit like when fax machines started.
Somebody had to start getting them.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (8): The process is
irreversible - Motor trading sets the pace for instant data swapping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON REYNOLDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Karl Benz built the first motor car in 1885, a law was already in place
in the UK requiring that a person should walk, carrying a red flag, in front
of any car. The UK insurance business has historically had its own red flag
for technological developments - an in-built suspicion. However, in the last
five years this attitude has changed, radically in some cases.
Some people within insurance have seen the need for the application of
computers beyond just word processing or use of the odd spreadsheet. They
have worked hard to promote electronic data interchange (EDI), and several
initiatives have made progress in this direction.
Electronic trading is the future for insurance, and it is likely that within
the next few years the passage of insurance transaction information over
computer networks will be as ubiquitous and unremarkable as the use of a
motor car to get from A to B.
Electronic trading of insurance requires the sending of standardised,
structured information securely between the parties involved in the
transaction - client, broker and insurer.
Current initiatives aim to allow insurance quote, proposal, policy, claims,
adjustment, renewal, accounting and other administration information to flow
over networks between brokers and insurers. Limnet is one such initiative
which involves the London insurance market.
Within the UK there are parallel initiatives in the electronic trading of
personal lines insurance - motor, household and life - and in commercial
lines. As Mr Mike Anstee, director of electronic marketing at London &amp;
Edinburgh Insurance, says: 'It is imperative for the market that we get EDI
moving to get rid of both paper flows and the duplicate entry of data.'
Motor business has forced the pace. A large boost to electronic trading was
given by the Automobile Association, a leading motor insurance broker which
is part of the BROKERNET EDI community comprising insurers, brokers, and
International Network Services (INS) - the operator of the network over
which the information flows.
BROKERNET initially developed EDI standards for motor insurance, and the
momentum required for the widespread adoption of these standards came
largely because of the volume of business done by the AA. In September 1992
INS saw a flow across the network of around 400,000 electronic documents of
a dozen different types. Around half of this flow involved 'new business'
motor insurance transactions.
Mr Colin Billinge, director of INS, argues that there are two encouraging
signs. Firstly, initial resistance to the setting of standards has been
overcome. Secondly, the phrase 'electronic trading' has become accepted
within the insurance industry. Standards are vital to EDI but as Mr Billinge
points out, 'standards for data interchange does not imply standardised
insurance products'.
Several electronic trading 'communities' are up and running. Systems
companies such as Policy Master, Quotel, Misys, and North Park provide
software for brokers' personal computers. The total number of computer
terminals running such software has been estimated at around 8,000. Networks
such as those operated by INS and IBM link to the insurers' computer
systems.
These systems allow a client to walk into a broker, see a motor quote,
choose a policy, have a proposal and a cover note printed off, and for the
information to be sent down the wire to the insurer. Account reconciliation
between insurer and broker is also available.
The next step is for EDI links to handle 'mid-term adjustments' (for
instance, when a client changes car or address), renewals, and claims. EDI
would then, for example, allow a broker to follow the progress of a claim by
linking in to the relevant insurer's internal computer system.
Household insurance is also in line for the EDI treatment, with the initial
round of standards' definitions in train. In the life insurance sector
electronic systems are still largely centred around videotext technology.
However, developments here were boosted by the formation in early 1991 of
The Exchange, a company funded by 20 leading UK insurers aimed at promoting
electronic trading of many products - life insurance, mortgages and related
products, pensions and annuities, investments and savings, health insurance.
The Exchange has made much progress in bringing together interested parties.
Commercial lines of insurance are less 'off-the-shelf' than personal lines,
and this is reflected in the gradual and coherent approach taken to the
electronic trading of these classes.
More than 20 leading insurers and brokers set up a commercial lines market
initiative (CLMI) in 1990. Following much development work a company, CLMI
Ltd, was launched in August 1992. Mr Peter Foreman, managing director of Sun
Alliance International, announced at the launch that accounting would be the
first EDI priority, then electronic mail, claims and eventually the
presentation of risk packages, at least in the easily rated classes of
business.
Mr Alan Waring, electronic marketing manager at Sun Alliance International,
says that the two core objectives behind CLMI are increased efficiency and
reduced costs. He adds: 'It was decided that managers within the insurance
business would dictate progress rather than be led by the computer systems
houses.'
Early CLMI feasibility studies looking at data and work flows were followed
by more detailed work in four areas - business requirements, technical
requirements, data standards, organisation and funding.
Mr Mike Anstee says CLMI has 'come a long way quite quickly considering what
we are trying to do'. In April this year a CLMI report recommended progress
in three phases.
Firstly, the formation of CLMI and the election of a board. Secondly, the
introduction of facilities for premium accounting, claims administration,
electronic mail, and the presentation of simple risk packages. These phases
are now under way. The third phase, envisaged as being two or three years
away, is introduction of EDI facilities for quotations, policy wording and
renewals.
Mr Waring argues that the element of competitive difference between insurers
must remain. The necessary setting of data standards required by EDI must
not introduce inflexibility in products. The first phases of CLMI deal with
practical solutions to backroom efficiency problems. For the next phase, 'it
is necessary to work out how far the industry wants to introduce networking
for trading'.
Commercial insurers deal with more underwriting criteria than those in
personal lines. If products become totally price-driven it will be more
difficult to provide value added service.
Mr Waring calls on the industry to address the question: how will a UK-wide
network affect the shape and size of the commercial lines market?
While EDI provides a tremendous amount of benefit in cost and efficiency
terms, its use as a trading tool has to be assessed keeping in mind the
potential to change the structure of the way business is done.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (5): Markets start to
multiply - Cheap technology means trading is becoming fragmented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER thought of setting up your own stock market? Thanks to advances in
information technology, it has never been cheaper - as evidenced by a
proliferation of new trading systems, each fighting for a share of turnover
in the international equity markets.
The new wave of technology poses some difficult questions for policy makers,
however. Do the users of stock markets - investors and companies wanting to
raise capital - benefit from competition or are their interests harmed by
the resulting fragmentation of stock market trading? Is computing power
actually reducing or distorting competition in stock markets, for instance
by allowing some big broker-dealers effectively to run their own private
markets?
That technology has brought down the cost of running a market is shown by
the plans of Tradepoint, a company seeking to raise Dollars 11m to finance a
trading system to take on the London Stock Exchange. The annual running
costs of Tradepoint will amount to around Dollars 5m, says Mr Peter Bennett,
chief executive and himself a former director of the London exchange. That
means, to break even, the system needs to capture just 1.5 per cent of
institutional share trading in London, he estimates.
Compare that with the London exchange, which has cut back on staff in the
past two years yet still faced running and costs of Pounds 170m last year.
Of course, the exchange does not only run a trading system: for instance, it
sells information, settles share trades and acts as a regulator of share
issues. But, faced with having to work with the technology it already has,
rather than being able to start afresh, the exchange's technology costs are
inevitably higher than its newer rivals.
It operates with six different mainframe computer types and eight different
programming languages. It employs eight separate networks using four
different protocols and 11 suppliers. This - and the weight of its history
and regulatory responsibilities - means the exchange looks slow to react to
technological change compared with its faster-footed rivals.
It faces one other big handicap: being owned by broker-dealers, it is under
pressure to develop trading systems which benefit broker-dealers. Yet
technological development should make it easier for investors to trade
directly, cutting out the middlemen altogether.
Apart from Tradepoint, the exchange's rivals include Instinet, the
Reuters-owned trading system which has built considerable market share in
the US but has yet to develop a strong following in Europe.
Both systems are intended to bring institutional investors into contact with
each other, allowing them to trade directly and so by-pass the costs of
intermediaries such as broker-dealers and stock exchanges. Both recognise,
though, that active traders are needed to make their markets function, and
so try to harness the risk-taking of broker-dealers to provide a more
continuous market.
Bringing investors together in this way is, technologically speaking, fairly
simple. Tradepoint's system, which uses software developed by the Vancouver
Stock Exchange, routes investors' buy or sell orders on to a central order
board; other investors can then deal against these orders at will.
Tradepoint also plans periodic computer auctions of less-actively traded
stocks. Instinet, on the other hand, allows users to negotiate over price
before reaching a deal.
This growing competition in the European equities market already has its
parallel in the US. The New York Stock Exchange has been under attack for
some years, as evidenced by the fall in its market share of equity trading
in the US. It remains the centre for trading in NYSE-listed stocks, but a
number of alternative trading systems have discovered a profitable niche
operating around the market's fringes.
This technological revolution poses one of the most difficult questions for
stock markets and the policy makers responsible for them. Is it beneficial
to fragment trading in this way, or has technology made markets less
efficient for investors? Exchanges complain that, outside their markets,
trading is often done by reference to their market prices: yet because these
trades are not brought to the market, they cannot influence the central
market price, making the central market itself less efficient.
Arguably, such fragmentation started taking place in London, even before the
advent of systems such as Tradepoint. Big securities houses, such as BZW,
have developed systems for capturing and feeding orders through to their
in-house market makers, who promise to trade at the 'best price' available.
In effect, these houses are already running their own private markets. Stock
market regulators have allowed technology to shape the markets in this way,
so are unlikely to to try to prevent further fragmentation.
The launch of new trading systems - and a move by London and continental
exchanges, to fight back with their own new technology - will mean a
proliferation of trading screens in brokers' and investors' offices.
Instinet and Tradepoint add to this diversity.
Not all are likely to survive. By definition, markets are only successful if
they attract enough trading activity to make other traders want to use them.
Those that do not establish this critical mass will wither away as traders
focus their attention on the marketplaces where the action is. For those
electronic markets that win, the future could be very profitable indeed.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (4): The customer now comes
first - Retail banks are employing contractors to sort out their IT
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUTTS Bank clings assiduously to the frock coat and royal family image that
befits a 300-year-old bastion of the English establishment. Customers need
Pounds 70,000 a year to open an account and, once they have done so, claim
the famous red leather chequebook holder.
The atmosphere projected by Coutts seems a world away from hole-in-the-wall
cash machines and computer driven funds transfer networks. But Coutts knows
its 40,000 wealthy customers expect more than a quaint uniform and
impeccable social connections.
Foreign exchange - in serious sums - is a common preoccupation of Coutts
account holders. The bank's 30 exclusive branches handle some 1,200 sterling
transactions every day. These involve amounts large enough to be extremely
sensitive to slight variations in exchange rates.
Until this year, foreign exchange transactions required confirmation with
Coutts head office and extensive manual intervention. Although customer
disquiet has not been in evidence, since 1988 the bank has been trying to
automate a large part of this process and tidy up its service. A
heavily-adapted software package from McDonnell Douglas, International
Banking System (IBS), was brought in and applied to the task of pushing most
foreign exchange work out to the branches.
In terms of customer service, the Pounds 700,000 project has allowed Coutts
to concentrate on what it is best at. The personal touch is what
differentiates Coutts from High Street banks such as its parent NatWest. Now
the branch staff have greater autonomy over straightforward deals and
foreign exchange specialists are only called in for the tricky minority of
transactions.
Replacing administrative chores with keystrokes has eliminated a lot of
donkey work, leaving Coutts people with more time to attend to its
well-heeled customers.
The choice of IBS was a mark of Coutts' independence. NatWest runs IBM
mainframes, but Coutts is happy to stick with Digital Equipment hardware.
McDonnell Douglas makes hardware, but Coutts was only interested in its
software offering.
It saw IBS as a system that could be drastically changed to meet localised
needs. McDonnell Douglas' willingness to co-operate is a clear sign of its
steady drift out of the hardware sector. The erstwhile box-maker is keen to
establish a new image as a flexible systems house that can supply
appropriate programs to run on whatever hardware platform suits the user.
This is a trend that suits the finance sector with its multiplicity of
systems. No one IT supplier can meet the needs of a large bank and the days
of computer companies presuming to dictate the agenda of financial
institutions are well over.
Barclays Bank keeps its branch network running with a wide range of computer
and banking equipment. For the past four years this catalogue of gadgets,
ranging from bomb detectors to ATMs, has been maintained by one IT supplier.
Barclays appointed Olivetti to take over the task of dealing with 200
separate maintenance contracts in a deal initially worth Pounds 56m.
The policy has worked, and Barclays has just renewed the arrangement with a
Pounds 100m contract that takes it up to 1997. Mr Brian Newman, a senior
purchasing manager with Barclays, says Barclay's is now down to 20
sub-contractors for branch automation, all dealt with by Olivetti. Barclays
signs the cheque and gets on with its primary concern of retail banking.
Going to one IT company to manage branch systems has not committed Barclays
to one source of computers and software. Quite the opposite. Like McDonnell
Douglas, Olivetti has learnt to co-exist with whatever equipment the
customer installs. Mr Newman perceives a neat irony in this. 'Ironically,
Olivetti have won relatively few IT contracts during the life of the branch
automation arrangement,' he says.
Building societies have become indistinguishable from banks in retail
services and hard-headed IT strategies. The National &amp; Provincial is buying
in software from financial systems giants and commissioning adventurous work
from small development shops.
N&amp;P is trying to galvanise its senior executives with a Pounds 300,000 suite
of software from NCR. The idea, feted in IT industry jargon as groupware, is
to encourage live pooling of the management process. Familiar PCs run the
NCR Co-operation program across 60 desks.
A graphics-based front-end encourages directors to break away from their
secretaries and share decisions with colleagues through the key-board. N&amp;P
used The Software Partnership, a 100 strong systems house in Cheshire, to
pull its Max telephone banking package together. The Software Partnership is
in business to promote Architect, a software tool written with the banking
sector in mind.
Architect, says The Software Partnership's marketing director Mr Nigel
Walsh, 'can connect any device or network into the bank's financial
products'. It provides a formal framework for programmers working on a
project and automates much of the time-consuming coding process. For Pounds
500,000 N&amp;P got Architect, the hardware to run a telephone banking system,
and a result that its marketing department thought would appeal to younger
customers.
The Marlborough Stirling Group (MSG), a Cheltenham-based software house, is
dedicated entirely to financial advice programming. It installs packages
that guide bank staff through financial counselling with the customer.
Unlike large systems houses MSG has stuck to the one niche, employing its
own actuaries and legal experts. MSG charges between Pounds 100,000 and
Pounds 750,000 per institution.
Banks and building societies have recognised the value of an IT consultancy
with a dedicated knowledge base. After eight years in business MSG, counts
the Bristol &amp; West building society and Allied Irish Bank among its clients.
For them, MSG represents a practical answer to a specific problem. And there
is no danger of a small consultancy trying to expand its involvement and
lecture to the entire business.
Persuading the notoriously opinionated IT industry to work to the customer's
blueprint has never been easy. In the past large suppliers were all too keen
to elevate IT as an end in itself.
But financial institutions have found that by confining contractors within
strict project guidelines they can reclaim the high ground of policy making
and get back to banking. It is one innovation that will certainly benefit
the customer.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (2): IT put firmly in its
place - Wholesale Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE Information Technology directors of financial institutions, money is
now a serious subject.
Since the stock market crash of 1987, the advance of IT has stalled. Too
many organisations believed competitive advantage was the only goal worth
achieving and the route to that goal lay in signing up for ambitious and
often unproven systems. Vast outlays on state-of-the-art dealing rooms
looked a poor investment when banks started sacking dealers by the hundred.
Developments were still needed, but the emphasis was on cutting IT spending.
Ambitions have been curtailed, but IT can still prove a powerful weapon in
the competitive trading battle. If the order of the day is
cost-consciousness, some institutions have learned to use their bedrock of
IT experience as a revenue earner.
At Barclays Bank expertise in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has proved
attractive to third parties. The bank has spent Pounds 4m on establishing
Barclays Trading Master. This is a service that allows corporates to
out-source receivables and payables.
Messages are received in industry standard EDI format and full settlement is
achieved via Barclays' Cheshire computer centre. The need for customer
intervention is eliminated.
For Barclays, this kind of service has more promise than high-profile
adventures in the retail banking sector. 'Issues like smart-cards are on the
back-burner now,' says Mr Tim Earles, Barclays senior product manager for
EDI. 'We want to reduce overheads for corporate customers, to take that
responsibility off them.'
Of the 1m UK businesses Barclays has identified, so far only 5,000 are using
EDI. The aim is to establish a global EDI infrastructure that reduces the
administration burden for clients while keeping Barclays' computer
operations busy. The Trading Master software was written internally in
conjunction with systems house EDS.
Mr Ranald Bain, director of financial services at EDS, is familiar with the
drive to squeeze every last penny of value out of an IT infrastructure. As a
prominent third party contractor, his company stands to benefit. But Mr Bain
has words of caution. 'It can't just be about costs. Its got to be cost
allied to service quality and value.'
Mr Julian Wood, a City IT consultant and visiting lecturer on banking at the
City University Business School, has seen institutions vent their anger on
the IT department after technology spending failed to yield proportionate
results. However, he thinks the vengeful mood has had its day. 'That's given
way to a more mature level of understanding. Money's definitely tighter and
the renewal cycle has expanded. But physical factors like relocation will
still demand new IT projects.'
City dealers go out looking for new dealing rooms, but they have become
cautious. Telerate, the market data feed company that ventured into dealing
room software to manipulate price information, is well aware of the sea
change that came after the 1987 crash.
'In the roaring '80s they bought everything on the market. Now they want to
fit the products to their needs,' says Mr Bruno de la Riviere, Telerate's
regional manager for systems and markets. He has just sold a 48-position
trading room to merchant bank Schroders for around Pounds 750,000. It was no
easy deal, he says. From the first contact with the customer to securing a
signature on the contract took over 12 months.
It would never have happened in the old days, when banks set up shop in
purpose-built high-tech offices and clamoured for any new technology that
would put them one month ahead of the pack.
In the post-deregulation euphoria that swelled the coffers of financial
technology outfits there would have been no question of building the entire
dealing room for client approval before receiving payment. But that is what
Telerate had to do to before Schroders would accept its Trading Room Product
(TRP).
'We're a live dealing room. We didn't want to install a new system and go
through software testing on site. I wasn't happy doing that unless I could
see the whole system up and running. It had to be right and then installed
over one weekend.'
Mr Lester Gray, head of treasury support at Schroders, recognises that IT
enthusiasm went too far during the mid-1980s, but is keen to distance
Schroders from these excesses. 'We never got caught up in keeping up with
the Joneses.'
Mr Gray got what he wanted, a treasury dealing room using digital data feeds
that allow his staff to mix, match and manipulate information from different
market data providers. He is reluctant to admit to driving too hard a
bargain, stressing the need for banks to maintain a cordial relationship
with suppliers.
But one technical watershed has played a critical role in returning power to
the customer. Open systems - enabling the running of software across a range
of hardware platforms without worrying about compatibility - is important to
the IT industry. And open systems has actually delivered on its promise.
This means Schroders was able to concentrate on software, the real tool its
dealers would work with. In a recent speech to an international banking
conference in Brussels, Mr Shigenori Nagata of the Nomura Bank research
institute was cynical about the workings of the computer industry. Pointing
out that only 20 per cent of Nomura's IT costs went on developing systems to
support the business, Mr Nagata blamed the large number of proprietary
systems used at Nomura for its inability to reduce the size of operations
and the large number of in-house experts needed to keep diverse systems
running.
He concluded that cost efficiency would come 'via the route of
standardisation'. The policy of standardising equipment within one bank was
not enough. 'Only the application of industry standards will provide full
satisfaction,' he said.
Nomura has discovered that the era of competitive advantage through unique
IT projects was no more than an excuse for suppliers to write their own
script. Adventurous developments will continue, but with the IT industry put
firmly in its place.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (3): Light at the end of the
tunnel - While operation of Taurus is at last in sight, ETC is moving
rapidly ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE ABILITY to do a deal always runs ahead of secure settlement and the
custody function.' This comment, from Mr John Griffin, director of business
administration at GT, the fund management group, sums up the frustrations of
trading in international equity markets.
Capital may move more readily across borders, but the infrastructure needed
to support such capital flows is still under development.
The emerging markets of Latin America or Asia provide the biggest headaches.
most have been concerned more with attracting foreign capital than with
worrying about how to modernise their settlement and payment systems. The
financial scandal that engulfed India this year is a direct result of an
inadequate settlement system, although in the money markets rather than the
stock market itself.
The emerging markets are not alone. A number of more developed countries,
among them the UK, still function on antiquated stock market settlement
arrangements. The huge growth in financial markets in the 1980s prompted a
concentration on 'front-end' trading systems, with too little attention
given to automating what happened after a trade had been struck. Until these
national systems have been revamped, links between domestic stock markets,
making international securities investing easier, will remain a long way
off.
The slow progress on London's paperless system, Taurus, could soon yield
results. After over a decade, the system has at last entered the early
stages of testing and is scheduled for some time from next September
onwards. But while London enters the final lap in the development of Taurus,
it is worth remembering that at least one back-office activity is being
automated with the minimum of fuss.
Trade confirmation is one of the main steps in the process that starts with
a stock market trade and ends with cash and shares changing hands.
Confirmation of the details of a trade usually travels by telex or fax. At
the end of 1991, a group of investment institutions, led by Fidelity, the
Boston-based fund management group, decided the process should be automated.
Just a year later, electronic trade confirmation (known as ETC) is a
reality. Two systems, developed by the London Stock Exchange and Thomson,
have been launched, while a third, from the International Securities Markets
Association, is due before the end of the year. All conform to the same
standards and links between the three are planned for next year.
It is all a far cry from Taurus. Leaving aside the scale and technical
complexity of each project (Taurus is in a league of its own), the
comparison is instructive.
Taurus is a political compromise, designed to square the conflicting demands
of its many users - brokers, registrars, banks, investors and listed
companies. No wonder that each of these groups has at times sounded
unenthusiastic about the final design: you can't please all of the people
all of the time.
ETC, on the other hand, is a solution to a specific problem, prompted by a
particular group of financial institutions. There is no whiff of political
compromise about the project - custodian banks, who have asked to be
admitted to the system, have so far been left on the outside.
The first priority is to complete the system and get it accepted by brokers
and investors, says Mr Chris Smith of Fidelity. That involves building the
links between the three competing systems, and extending the concept around
the world (the initial ETC project is intended for investors in Europe).
Another big difference is that Taurus represents an attempt to use
technology in order to preserve the status quo, while ETC looks ready to
overturn it.
Taurus was designed in many ways to mimic the existing structure of the
share transfer system. Registrars, for instance, retain a central role,
maintaining details of shareholdings for the vast bulk of shareholders (they
will become known as 'company account controllers'). Only when rolling
settlement comes into operation - when all stock market trades are settled a
set number of days after they have been agreed, probably five - will the
nature of share settlement change markedly.
The extent to which ETC alters the relationships between stock market
participants is difficult to predict. Ostensibly, the system is being built
to serve a limited function, replacing existing communication methods with a
more efficient one.
However, by putting institutional investors on the same communication
network, it could in theory provide the basis for greater direct contact
between them, in the process by-passing traditional stock market
intermediaries such as brokers and custodians. This is the clearest example
so far of the way in which technology is changing the boundaries between
different intermediaries in the securities markets.
Meanwhile, Taurus seems at last to be within reach. Barring unforeseen
technical problems, the biggest threat to the successful implementation of
Taurus is the attitude of listed companies. Each company must ask its
shareholders' permission to 'dematerialise', or make the switch to the new
system.
Enthusiasm has been lacking on the part of listed companies for the system
so far - fears that Taurus will make it more difficult to identify the
beneficial holders of a company's shares have not subsided. Many also
believe that, after all the delays, the technology will have to prove itself
before companies make the switch.
Marks &amp; Spencer has been the most open in voicing this sentiment, but others
feel the same. 'I sense a reluctance,' says Mr John Watson, the Taurus
project director. 'Companies are saying 'we can't see it and touch it'.
That's an inevitable reaction - but it's one we are gradually overcoming, I
think.'
The reluctance of companies to join could extend the phase-in period of
Taurus, leaving the City in the expensive position of running an electronic
settlement system and, in parallel, the existing paper-based one. That will
eventually leave listed companies paying larger bills for share
registration, says Mr Watson. 'Companies need an effective registration
sector - and they're putting it's costs up.'
It will be a great irony if, having struggled for so long to get agreement
on and then build Taurus, the Stock Exchange fails to persuade many listed
companies to use it.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (1): New search for value -
The pressures of deregulation, growing competition and rapid technological
change are forcing senior managers to look carefully at their IT budgets.
Alan Cane finds that the financial community is demanding more for its money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE world's big financial institutions may have killed off the computing
'dinosaurs' - huge projects which promised to integrate every aspect of
their businesses - but they still have to learn how to exploit information
technology (IT) for survival and growth.
A decade ago Dr Eckart Van Hooven, then head of Deutsche Bank, told a
conference a price had to be paid to move into the new world of electronic
banking, adding: 'If the price means giving up the identity of the banking
profession as we know it today, then for me the price is too high.'
But in spite of predictions that technology would eliminate distinctions
between financial institutions, they have remained separate in culture,
management style and business strategy. And for most, it is the cost of the
technology that seems too high.
The dinosaur projects, epitomised by Anacomp's ill-fated integrated banking
system or Midland Bank's cancelled 'Megabank' project, were creatures of the
1980's, nurtured in those balmier days when money was seemingly no barrier
to attempts to scale the technological heights.
Today, a more realistic regime prevails. The pressures of deregulation,
increased competition and technology changing at an unprecedented rate are
forcing senior managers to examine their investments in IT more carefully.
Expectations of the technology are rising, but budgets are under close
scrutiny. There is also a new understanding that technology is a moving
target and that standards laid down in mega-projects are impossible to
enforce.
A survey of IT operating costs in Europe carried out by Andersen Consulting
shows that the rise in IT operating costs is set to continue. It suggests
these costs are rising at an overall rate of 21 per cent a year, compared to
5 per cent for other non-interest costs.
Andersen says: 'The dramatic 30 per cent growth in capital expenditure
between 1988 and 1989 has faltered slightly but there is commitment to the
next wave of massive investment in technology'. It warns, however, that the
economic justification for large scale expenditure on IT is becoming
increasingly difficult. Unit costs have not been reduced; revenue generation
has not been adequately improved.
Suppliers of computing equipment are keenly aware of the pressure on IT
budgets.
Mr Roger Bellass, managing director of Tandem's UK subsidiary, says the
total amount spent on computing equipment by the financial community has
fallen: 'Institutions are looking closely at the cost of ownership.' Tandem
is one of a number of companies that supplies banks with equipment for
'mission-critical' applications, where computer failure has an immediate
consequence in terms of money lost or customers angered.
Mr Robin Stainer, Andersen Consulting's retail banking specialist says that
senior managers are determined to achieve better control of their
technology. While at one stage IT was seen as a black art, an understanding
of the potential and pitfalls of computing is now recognised as an important
component of a financial specialist's skills.
Three main issues now dominate thinking about IT in finance: downsizing,
security and out-sourcing. All are a consequence of the increasing power and
falling cost of today's microelectronic technology. All are concerned with
keeping a cap on costs and achieving value for money.
Downsizing implies the substitution of low cost networks of small computers
for large and expensive mainframes. The financial services business has
traditionally been built around mainframes with huge processing power and
the capacity to handle a database of millions of accounts.
'Client-server' is the name given to a network of smaller machines which
operate collaboratively to process a workload. The clients may be personal
computers or workstations. In a simple network, the servers might also be
workstations, but could also be either mainframes, or even supercomputers.
The database may be distributed through the network.
Lively debate surrounds the question of which approach offers the most
advantages.
Supporters of mainframe technology argue that in the long run, centrally
managed data is cheaper and more effective. They also point out that
software for collaborative processing in client-server networks is at an
immature stage of development.
Data processing management of personal computing systems is at a similarly
early stage. A survey by the consultancy Nolan Norton shows that personal
computing management practices are relatively immature. 'On average,' it
says, 'current personal computing practices are only 34 per cent effective,
compared with 81 per cent effectiveness in traditional mainframe
environments'.
Client-server advocates point to lower costs - perhaps as little as 25 per
cent of an equivalent mainframe system; PCs are less expensive on a
price/performance basis and cost little to run. Security has become the
single biggest technological concern for the financial services business. As
managers have become more knowledgeable about computing and communications,
they have become aware of the risks to their business in networking.
In the UK, the subject has been given added impetus by worries about the
integrity of plastic card processing systems.
Questions have been raised about so-called 'phantom' withdrawals from
automated teller machines (ATMs), cash taken from machines apparently
without the card owners' knowledge or consent. While such withdrawals amount
to only a tiny percentage of the card fraud, they indicate there may be
unexplained loopholes in the ATM security.
This is an important question for banks, building societies and any other
financial institution using ATMs as a cost-effective way of expanding
business.
Barclays Bank in the UK says: 'The idea that money can mysteriously
disappear from an account without the use of a card and the correct personal
identification number is a pure myth'.
The question will shortly be tested in the British courts. In the meantime,
the principal banks are debating a move to 'smart' or chip cards with a
renewed enthusiasm. Smart cards, which contain a microprocessor and memory,
are virtually impossible to fake. The banks are also experimenting with
cameras in ATMs to establish without question customer identities. Biometric
methods including fingerprinting and signature verification are also being
tested.
Out-sourcing is perhaps the most controversial of the cost-saving measures
with which financial services companies are experimenting.
It implies passing over to a third party control and management of the data
centre against an agreed level of service. In practice, the data centre and
computers frequently pass into the ownership of the third party while the
data processing staff are taken on to the payroll.
According to the marketing consultancy Dataquest facilities management or
out-sourcing is set to grow by 20 per cent annually in the UK. It represents
a significant change for companies which have seen their data processing
systems as their source of competitive advantage.
Nevertheless the London Stock Exchange earlier this year agreed to pass
responsibility for running its computer systems to Andersen Consulting in a
deal worth up to Pounds 15m a year over the next five years.
Other financial sectors are following suit. Mr Michael Kelly, head of Touche
Ross's asset management and insurance division recently wrote that insurance
firms no longer believed they could secure a competitive edge through
technology: 'Companies have matured in their views on IT. They are saying,
'Let's give IT to the professional managers'.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TURNOVER IN stock index futures fell to its lowest level for nearly a year,
as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the chancellor's autumn
statement on Thursday, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,727, the December contract on the FT-SE Index briefly
sprang to life, moving forward to 2,733 within minutes of the opening. But
with no enthusiasm for dealing, December quickly lost its early momentum and
fell back to register the day's low of 2,717.
Thereafter, the contract was traded in a fairly narrow range of 2,720 and
2,731, but with little in the way of actual buying or selling. Dealers
pointed, however, to the continued healthy premium to fair value, which some
put down to lack of liquidity in both cash and futures.
December ended the session at 2,723, down 9 from Friday's close and around 9
points above its estimated fair value premium of about 17. Turnover, at
3,932, was the lowest recorded since December 1991.
Traded options suffered from the same malaise and volume reached a meagre
17,563 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was 6,330, up from Friday's
4,556. Among stock options, J. Sainsbury was the most actively traded,
recording a total of 2,002 trades. This was followed by Tesco with 1,806
deals and Asda on 1,146. Hanson also had a busy day with some 1,132 lots
dealt in its options.

FT  10 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Aircraft stocks upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS OF financial problems at GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing
company, along with fears of impending defence cuts, sent a chill through
the aerospace and engineering sectors, bringing heavy falls in several of
the major stocks.
Shares in Rolls-Royce took the full force of the worries surrounding GPA,
falling 10 1/2 to 124 1/2 p in trade of 5.1m, with the market worried about
the firm orders GPA had placed for 45 Boeing 757s, all of which are due to
be powered by Rolls-Royce engines. Smith New Court, Kleinwort Benson and
Nikko Securities were among brokers advising investors to sell the shares.
Strauss Turnbull also issued a 'sell' recommendation and suggested 80p as a
fair price for the shares.
However, it was British Aerospace which recorded the day's biggest fall in
the market in percentage terms, dropping 14 to 135p. BAe owns 20 per cent of
Airbus Industrie, with which GPA has a large order for A320 aircraft.
Sentiment was further weakened by speculation that the UK government would
announce further defence cuts in Thursday's Autumn Statement.
Also affected were Smiths industries, 10 lower at 318p, and TI group, 6
lighter at 287p.
Lasmo easier
There was widespread consternation around dealing rooms as Lasmo shares
wilted in the face of stories that a big institution was seeking to unload a
block of between 8m and 10m shares in the oil exploration company.
Marketmakers lowered their prices for Lasmo stock, expecting the shares to
come off sharply after the rumoured sale had taken place. But no large
trades in Lasmo were forthcoming, with the day's total recorded turnover
reaching only 2.4m.
Stories doing the rounds in the market suggested that the institutions were
unhappy at the rather downbeat presentation delivered by the company in the
City last week, and that one of the big US investment banks was offering the
big line of shares. Oil shares have generally been unsettled by the recent
bout of weakness in crude oil prices, which have reacted to fears of
increasing output.
'It looks as though the market was spoofed and somebody got rid of a long
position,' said one oil specialist. Lasmo announced yesterday the start-up
of production from its Markham gas field, located in the Netherlands area of
the North Sea.
BCI in the frame
Last week's move by Hanson to withdraw from the battle to take over Ranks
Hovis McDougall unleashed another bout of speculation that Hanson has lined
up another target. And some market observers took the line that the
conglemerate may well have Blue Circle Industries (BCI), the big UK building
materials group, in its sights. The shares rose 4 to 170p, after 172p.
Hanson slipped 2 1/4 to 227 1/4 p.
The market's suspicions were further aroused yesterday when a buyer of 2.5m
BCI shares appreared in the market. The shares were acquired in various
parcels during the day, dealers said. Turnover reached a hefty 5.5m shares,
the latest in a series of larger than usual busy days in the stock.
Takeover speculation has surrounded BCI for a number of years. During the
late-1980s Hanson was thought to have been behind a market raid for BCI
stock that netted only a handful of shares. More recently a number of
overseas companies are thought to have taken a hard look at the company.
Among the names mentioned were Lafarge Coppee and MB Caradon.
Worries over future profit growth persisted around Granada as speculation
continued that the group was ready to table an offer for Forte's catering
subsidiary, Gardner Merchant. Analysts said that Granada's reliance on
cost-cutting to bolster profits meant that a sizeable acquisition was
important to any future growth strategy. However, this also exposed concerns
that such an undertaking - Gardner Merchant would command a price tag of
some Pounds 400m - would require a rights issue, a precarious undertaking in
the present climate. It was also suggested that weekend press reports on
Granada's intentions came from the group itself and were designed to
manouevre Forte away from negotiations believed to be under way with the
Gardner management. Granada shares tumbled 10 to 283p. Forte was steady at
158p.
In a busy oil sector, British Gas eased a penny to 276p after a block of
4.1m shares was placed in the market at 273 1/2 p. Very late in the session
dealers said another big institution had sold a line of 6.4m shares at 271p.
BP was active and managed to edge up 2 1/2 to 228p on 5.4m traded. Shell,
scheduled to report third-quarter numbers on Thursday, hardened 2 to 530p.
Calor shares, aggressively bought in recent sessions by one of the large UK
integrated houses, retreated to close 7 off at 233p. Oil specialists expect
SHV, the private Dutch investment group, to announce that it has topped up
its shareholding from 46 per cent to 48 per cent.
Barclays remained the most heavily traded stock in the banks, rallying 7
more to 363p on 5.1m. Lloyds rose the same amount to 492p. HSBC, now ranked
the UK's fifth biggest company measured by its market capitalisation, which
is more than twice that of the next bank, National Westminster, added 5 at
560p.
SG Warburg, expected to report lower interim figures this morning, fell 14
to 524p.
Composite insurances showed General Accident a vulnerable market in front of
today's third-quarter numbers, which County NatWest expects will show a
sharp reduction in losses. County estimates that the company will report a
quarterly loss of Pounds 10m, against last time's Pounds 129m. The shares
weakened 12 to 536p. Royal, due to report on Thursday, receded 11 to 226p.
Among internationals, BAT Industries continued to bask in the glow of last
week's favourable results and added 10 at 937p. The weak copper prices seen
at the end of last week and reports of sell advice from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
left RTZ 14 lighter at 629p. A profits downgrade said to have come from
Nomura hit Inchcape, 9 cheaper at 490p.
In transports, reports of profits downgradings weakened BAA, which reported
a 46 per cent jump in interim figures. The shares slipped 11 to 747p. Also
in the doldrums was British Airways, where a sell recommendation from a
leading broker clipped 11 off the stock to 292 1/2 p.
Weakness in SmithKline Beecham was attributed to a warning of tough trading
ahead from leading US drugs group Merck last Friday. It was also revealed
that Merck would not be co-marketing one of the UK group's products.
SmithKline shares finished 11 1/2 lower at 512 1/2 p.
Leading property stocks were mildly positive on the weekend press
speculation over interest rate cuts. Slough Estates put on 3 at 137p.
Confirmation that resignations among Virgin executives had occurred sent
Thorn-EMI lower. The stock ended 10 down at 807p. Rank Organisation
retreated 9 to 615p as profit-taking took its toll.
A shortage of stock sent Booker forward by 15 to 390p. Unilever retreated on
nervousness over the Gatt talks, although analysts pointed out that the
company would suffer little should a trade war break out. The stock declined
14 to 1066p.
Unigate strengthened 10 to 297p. Early talk that an unnamed German group was
scanning the European foods market for a baby foods group was said to have
helped.
Nervousness ahead of results due on Thursday dented Burton, the retail
clothing group, which eased 2 1/2 to 45p.

FT  10 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift lower in nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD hopes that Thursday's economic statement will be accompanied by a
cut in UK base rates could not sustain the UK stock market yesterday.
Although above the day's low, the FT-SE Index closed beneath the 2,700 mark
regained only last week.
The stock market confidently expects base rates to be reduced by at least
one point, either as part of the government's economic statement or on the
day following, when the October retail price index is likely to show
year-on-year inflation down to 3.3 per cent.
While most City analysts would be satisfied with a one-point reduction to 7
per cent, some responded to the call from the Confederation of British
Industry for rates to be cut by two percentage points to 6 per cent.
However, the City was nervous when sterling fell sharply in late dealings
after the CBI's regional chairman warned of the risks posed by 'dramatic'
interest rate cuts.
Against this uncertain backcloth, equities abandoned initial gains and, with
stock index futures also virtually on hold, drifted down to a loss of 8.5 on
the Footsie at mid-morning.
A modest recovery, together with a calm start to the new session on Wall
Street, helped the London market later. The final reading put the FT-SE
Index at 2,695.4 for a loss of 7.3 on the day.
Seaq volume slipped to 517.5m shares from Friday's 652.8m. Retail business
was worth Pounds 1.2bn on Friday. Retail volume has been averaging more than
Pounds 1bn daily for the past two months, indicating that London-based
market firms have improved profitability during the final quarter of this
year. Once again, volume in second line stocks exceeded that in the Footsie
listed issues yesterday. Late trading saw several large blocks of blue chips
traded, notably BAT Industries (1.8m) and British Gas (6.4m).
However, strains on the securities industry remain severe and there were
suggestions yesterday that two more City brokerage houses would announce a
merger this week.
Traders stressed that there was little selling pressure. The Footsie was
held down by renewed falls among the international pharmaceutical stocks on
worries that the new US president may tighten Federal spending on medical
welfare. SmithKline Beecham suffered a bout of selling pressure.
Reports that GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, is seeking to
reschedule its bank debt unsettled Rolls-Royce and several other leading
names in the aircraft industry supply business, and dire statistics on
insolvency rates in British industry lay heavily across the manufacturing
sector.
Retail issues were helped by interest rate optimism but paid little heed to
the latest data on UK consumer credit, indicating that UK consumers
continued to pay down credit card debt in September. Confidence in prospects
for a consumer-led boom to lead the UK out of recession remained fragile.
Downgradings of UK companies by brokerage analysts continued to provide
features as well as to restrain investor activity across the range of the
market. Market strategists, however, agreed that the autumn economic
statement is likely to bring the first evidence of the government's growth
strategy and that this is expected to confirm the recovery trend in the
stock market since September.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Heavy selling erases early
Dow advance

Wall Street
HEAVY selling in the final hour of trading left blue chip stocks little
changed at the close yesterday after computer program buying and selective
bargain hunting had provided share prices with a solid early boost, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was just 0.81 up on balance at 3,240.87,
after a day's high reached mid-afternoon when the index had been some 24
points ahead. Other indices did a better job of holding on to their gains.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.01 higher at 418.59, the American SE
composite 2.10 firmer at 385.36 and the Nasdaq composite 5.23 stronger at
622.05, in the wake of good demand for small-capital growth stocks. New York
SE turnover was fairly heavy at 197.5m shares.
The impact of last week's presidential election on stock market sentiment
began to wane yesterday. Although speculation remains concentrated on the
likely make-up of President-elect Bill Clinton's cabinet - especially the
question of who is appointed to the top economic jobs - comments from the
Clinton transition team suggest that choices will not be made or publicised
until next month.
Consequently, investors were left to focus their attention on the bond
market, which traded nervously ahead of the important afternoon auction of
Dollars 15.5bn in three-year notes.
Bargain hunters lifted Walt Disney Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 7/8 in
turnover of 2.3m shares and IBM Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 67 5/8 on 2.2m
traded.
Ford firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 as speculation intensified that Mr
Alexander Trotman, head of the group's North American operations, would soon
be announced as Ford's new president and chief operating officer, making him
the clear successor to outgoing chairman and chief executive Mr Harold
Poling.
Ann Taylor Stores rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 after higher
third-quarter profits.
First Bank System shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 1/8 after signing a merger
agreement with Colorado National Bankshares in a deal that will cost First
Bank about Dollars 525m. Colorado National jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars
38 7/8 .
Storage Technology plummeted Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 23 5/8 in turnover of
4.8m shares after saying that testing of its Iceberg Computer Disk-Array
system will take longer than expected, extending into the second half of
1993.
Biogen added Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 44 3/4 after broking house Hambrecht &amp;
Quist raised its fourth-quarter profits forecast, the second such upgrade in
the past week.
Canada
A WEAK gold shares sector took the Toronto market lower in busy trading. The
TSE 300 index lost 17.1 to 3,293.8, while declines led advances by 360 to
259 after volume of 33.4m shares valued at CDollars 312m.
The golds index fell 2.53 per cent as spot gold in New York lost USDollars 3
an ounce to a six-year low of USDollars 333.05.

SAO PAULO fell 6.6 per cent yesterday as investors remained bearish about a

financial transactions, presented to Congress last week. At the closing bell
the Bovespa index of the 53 most-traded shares was down 2,846 points at
40,197.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Finland takes first prize for third
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland provided the best performance of the FT-Actuaries World Indices for
the third week running, while Malaysia came a close second as it rose to a
record high last week. But both markets appear vulnerable to a temporary
setback as some investors take their profits.
Mr Peter Lawrence at Kleinwort Benson says Finnish equities cannot continue
to climb at their current pace. The HEX index has risen more than 50 per
cent from its 5 1/2 -year low since early September, and on the FT-A,
Finland advanced 5.9 per cent in local currency terms last week.
However, he believes that the factors which have propelled the market higher
 -improved fundamentals, a rise in exports as a result of the markka
devaluation, and good eight months' results - will allow the market to
continue its recovery, albeit at a more sustainable pace. He adds that
sentiment is still positive, and that the opening of restricted shares to
foreigners at the start of next year should encourage more interest from
overseas.
Malaysia, up 4.8 per cent in local currency terms last week in the wake of a
pleasing budget which predicted GDP growth of 8 per cent next year, has seen
a lot of speculative buying, says Mr Michael Franklin, a director at Kim Eng
Securities. Retail investors have been heavily buying shares in the Magnum
group, on hopes that it will receive approval from Beijing to run a lottery
in China's southern Guangdong province.
There has been softness in Tenaga Nasional and Malaysia Telekom, which
account for more than one-third of the market, but any downturn in the
market could be limited to 10 per cent because of the weight of money
waiting to be invested in Malaysian equities.
South Africa's flat performance on the week in local currency disguises a
fall of 6.8 per cent in dollar terms, as the financial rand continues to
weaken on fears of another exodus by foreign companies.

JOHANNESBURG was mixed as the market waited for US president-elect Bill
Clinton to set out his economic policy. The gold index fell 30 to 783 and
the overall index lost 13 to 3,020. The industrial index was little changed
at 4,013.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual stocks stand out in
Paris and Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL stories helped Italian banks rise and French blue chips fall,
while generalities produced a technical gain for German equities, writes Our
Markets Staff. Madrid was closed for a public holiday.
PARIS eased in thin trading which was dominated by Total, the oil group
which is suffering from a succession of bad news items. The CAC-40 index
fell 6.97 to 1,786.65 in low turnover of FFr1.67bn, of which FFr210m was
generated by Total.
Total, which last week disappointed investors with news of a FFr600m worth
of restructuring and asset writedowns and a restriction on shareholder
voting rights, fell as low as FFr228.10 on news of an explosion at its
refinery in southern France. The refinery accounts for about a quarter of
its domestic annual refining capacity. The stock later recovered to close
FFr3.60 lower at FFr235.90.
Bic, the manufacturer of disposable cigarette lighters, razors and pens, saw
its shares fall to FFr865 on news that a US court had awarded Dollars 22m
against it in damages. But the shares later closed down FFr11 at FFr896 in
reasonably heavy volume of 60,000 shares.
LVMH lost another FFr19 to FFr3,560 on continued fears about the impact of a
trade war between Europe and the US. There were also concerns that analysts'
forecasts for 1993 were still too high.
MILAN continued to focus on privatisation stocks, especially
state-controlled banks, following Friday's leak of a government document,
and yesterday's announcement by Iri that it would sell its entire 67 per
cent stake in Credito through an international competitive auction.
Dealers said that the buying of bank stocks was predominantly domestic. The
rest of the market was quietly easier as the Comit index stood 0.18 down at
432.59 in turnover estimated at slightly more than L150bn after Friday's
L161.7bn.
Credito Italiano led the gainers, as it rose L220 or 10 per cent to L2,430,
reaching L2,560 in the afternoon in London. Banca di Roma added L120 or 6.6
per cent to L1,950 and Banca Commerciale Italiana gained L300 or L8.3 per
cent to L3,925.
Despite denials from Fiat that it planned to sell off Rinascente, the
retailer's savings shares were delayed from trading because buyers
outnumbered sellers. They finally settled at L3,140, up L140 or 4.7 per
cent; Fiat fell L169 to L4,381.
FRANKFURT combined fact with fantasy in a thin market as the dollar rose and
dealers speculated about interest rates ahead of this week's Bundesbank
meeting, causing export-oriented equities and the bond market to rise in
tandem.
Bond and stock futures rose, as the Bundesbank's average bond yield dropped
23 basis points to 7.25 per cent after rising 15 points last Friday.
Short-covering drove exporters and other dollar-sensitive stocks up as the
DAX index rose 21.64 to 1,508.80.
Turnover rose from DM3.7bn to DM4.3bn. Among obvious dollar beneficiaries,
in carmakers and engineering, Daimler rose DM14 to DM524.50 and Volkswagen
DM9.50 to DM276, and MAN and Linde put on DM8.50 to DM256.50, and DM13 to
DM672 respectively.
Other dollar-sensitives included Degussa, which trades precious metals in
one of its sectors, and Metallgesellschaft which is active in non-ferrous
metals, registering gains of DM18 to DM316, and DM12 to DM322.
STOCKHOLM gained 1.6 per cent on the firm dollar and expectations of
positive nine-month earnings reports. The Affarsvarlden General index rose
11.3 to 735.5 as turnover jumped to SKr511m from SKr282m.
Astra A shares rose SKr11 to SKr598 ahead of its results, due tomorrow.
Market estimates for its nine-month pre-tax profit range from SKr3.4bn to
SKr3.6bn after SKr2.58bn in the year-ago period.
Electrolux B shares added SKr6 to SKr177 ahead of its results, due on
November 19.
BRUSSELS closed mixed as Delhaize continued to dominate trading. The Bel-20
Index lost just 0.87 to 1,133.60.
The decline in Delhaize shares slowed after its heavy fall last week due to
adverse publicity surrounding its US unit, Food Lion. It ended BFr16 lower
at BFr1,470 and some bargain-hunting was evident.
AMSTERDAM retreated from the day's high to close mixed. After a high of
104.1, the Tendency Index finished up 0.3 at 103.7.
Unilever, ex-dividend, fell a net Fl 4.02 to Fl 184.60 on continued
disappointment about its third-quarter results. The smaller food stock,
Nutricia, gained Fl 5.50 to Fl 119.00 on a report that Germany's Altana was
interested in buying it.
DUBLIN saw more fall-out from the troubles of GPA, the aircraft leasing
group, as the big domestic banks dropped and Irish Life - which fell 5.7 per
cent last week on its exposure to GPA equity - lost another 8p to 140p.
The ISEQ overall index closed 15.67 lower at 1,108.90, threatening a 1992
low of 1,094.88. Bank of Ireland fell 3p to 154p and Allied Irish Banks by
6p to 151p.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.7 per
cent on fears of delay in budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN OVER a possible delay in the approval of the supplementary budget
added to the effect of a spate of negative interim reports, and the Nikkei
average lost 2.7 per cent on arbitrage unwinding and small-lot
profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 452.76 down at 16,417.05, near the day's low of 16,416.45
recorded just before the close. It opened at the day's high of 16,825.48 and
was taken lower by index-linked selling and foreigners' liquidation of
holdings.
Volume dipped to 180m shares from 198m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 864
to 71, with 127 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 26.50 to 1,249.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.63
to 999.47.
Worries that opposition parties will delay the debate over the supplementary
budget, including the emergency economic package in the current
extraordinary Diet session, depressed sentiment. The opposition has been
calling for testimony by Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of the LDP, and
Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister, to explain the the party's
links with Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery company, as well as with
gangsters and right-wing activists.
Public pension funds did not support the falling market. 'Public funds are
not in a rush. A lot of fund man-agers seem to be saving their firepower for
March, the fiscal year-end,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel.
Electronic issues were sold by investment trusts and tokkin funds, or
specified money trusts. NEC and Fujitsu weakened Y8 and Y25 to year's lows
of Y648 and Y510 respectively. Domestic fund managers said that while
electronic stocks looked cheap, hopes of a recovery seemed thin due to
slowing demand.
Aids-related shares plunged, with dealers and investors discouraged by last
week's announcement by TSD, a computer company on the over-the-counter
market, that it had previously made false announcements over clinical tests
of its HIV vaccine. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, fell Y60
to Y1,290 and Meiji Milk Products shed Y36 to Y875.
Securities companies lost ground on prospects of poor earnings because of
disappointing market volume. Traders said most brokers could have
overestimated their annual profit forecasts, based on projected average
daily volume for the second half of between 300m to 400m shares. The figure
for October has only been 218m shares. Nomura Securities receded Y50 to
Y1,320 and Daiwa Securities Y29 to Y781.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 369.99 to 17,927.94 in volume of 10.2m
shares.
Roundup
TURNOVER put on a better showing than share prices in parts of the region,
but South Korea starred in both departments.
SEOUL registered its fifth consecutive gain in a record turnover, on buying
by aggressive individual investors. The composite index rose 22.46, or 3.4
per cent, to 686.46 as 71.05m shares worth Won1.06 trillion changed hands,
against a previous turnover record of Won972.87bn on July 30, 1991.
SINGAPORE achieved record volume of 348.8m shares, against an earlier peak
of 269.2m on March 6, 1991, but the Straits Times Industrial index closed
only 2.76 higher at 1,415.88. Dealers said investors were not showing much
enthusiasm for Singaporean shares, and that Malaysian stocks were still
receiving most of the attention.
KUALA LUMPUR fell as volume soared to a new high of 471.6m shares, against
371.8m on Friday. Losses in some major component stocks pushed the composite
index down 5.67 to 648.93.
HONG KONG subsided after its recent gains. The Hang Seng index relinquished
47.10 at 6,267.91 in turnover of HKDollars 2.75bn.
BANGKOK dropped 2.1 per cent, led down by a substantial correction in the
banking and finance and securities sectors. The SET index closed 19.72 off
at 939.36 in Bt13.8bn turnover.
MANILA stocks were depressed by the crime situation and prospects of
prolonged power cuts. The composite index declined 5.02 to 1,345.66.
AUSTRALIA was pushed down by continued uncertainty about Westpac, and a
general lack of positive news. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.8 easier at
1,419.5.
BOMBAY fell a further 2.6 per cent on rumours that at least 12 Calcutta
brokers were on the brink of a payment default. Sentiment in Bombay was also
hit by double-digit inflation and the BSE index lost 70.80 to 2,685.39.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dealers move focus to Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR slipped by more than  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark in Europe on
profit-taking yesterday, after failing to sustain a break through DM1.60,
writes James Blitz.
The US currency rose by more than 5 pfennigs last week, and speculative
players appeared to be cashing in on those movements. Yesterday the dollar
closed in London at DM1.5885. Later in New York, however, it performed
strongly, ending at DM1.6041.
Otherwise, the market's attention was firmly fixed on sterling, which fell
to a five-year low against the dollar in late European trading.
Dealers sold the pound in the belief that base rates could be lowered by as
much as 2 per cent when the UK chancellor makes his autumn statement this
week.
Sterling lost some 1 1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.5210 in London, and
continued to drop in New York, finishing at Dollars 1.5105. The last time
the pound was seen at this low level was on January 15, 1987.
Yesterday, sterling dropped 3 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, ending at
DM2.4150.
The market continues to be moved by a strong belief that Germany will ease
short-term credit policy in the new year, pushing the dollar upwards. The
possible break-up of the Gatt talks is also being cited as a reason why the
dollar may be boosted in the short-term.
A full-scale trade war between the US and Europe, if it is allowed to
happen, would be detrimental to the entire world economy in the long run.
But Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London,
points out that the relative insulation of the US economy on matters of
trade makes the Gatt crisis a positive factor for the dollar.
In the US economy, for example, only 10 per cent of Gross National Product
is made up of imports and exports. In France's case, the figure is 20 to 25
per cent.
Mr Hawkins further commented: 'If tariffs are levied against, say, the
French wine industry, this could have a knock-on effect for the economy and
the French franc.'
For the moment the market is waiting on developments in Europe and the US.
Indeed, the French franc yesterday was firmer against the D-Mark after the
Bank of France decided not to cut its money market intervention rate,
contrary to market expectations. It finished at FFr3.3810 per D-Mark, after
a previous close of FFr3.3820.
Ms Joanne Perez, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said yesterday
that the French authorities could probably afford to reduce rates again
without risking any downside on the currency.
'A cut in rates would confirm that France is part of the hard core of the
exchange rate mechanism, and would be interpreted as a show of strength,'
she said. However, she believes it is unlikely that the French authorities
will cut rates to below the German level, in spite of public pressure to do
so.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Money Markets: UK prices in cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ONLY three days to go to the British government's Autumn Statement,
traders in the sterling cash market priced a full percentage point cut in
base rates into their cash market operations yesterday, writes James Blitz.
However, futures contracts in sterling and other European currencies fell
back on a mixture of profit-taking and slight disappointment that there had
been no easing of official credit policy in the UK and France.
The Bank of France did not change the money market intervention rate,
currently standing at 9.35 per cent, in yesterday's securities repurchase
operation.
The sterling cash market was again hit by the liquidity problem that affects
the market when there is a high expectation of interest rate cuts.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m at the start of
operations, but only Pounds 51m was removed in the early round. Traders were
unwilling to offer bills in the run-up to what one commercial bank dealer
called 'the most publicised rate reduction in the history of mankind'.
In the morning, the one-month cash rate was trading well below the Bank's
estab-lished rate for a 21-day repo, explaining the market's reluc-tance to
offer bills. The over-night rate peaked at 15 per cent.
Once this level had been reached, dealers were happier to borrow cash from
the Bank at established rates, and lend on the 'overnight'. This brought out
more bills in the afternoon, although there was late assistance of Pounds
430m.
Three-month money closed at 7 1/8 per cent offered, down from Friday's 7
5/16 per cent. One dealer did not rule out the possibility that three-month
money could go below 7 per cent before Thursday.
The December short sterling contract, which expires on December 16, fell
back 14 basis points from its opening level to close at 93.60.
This can still price in a 200 basis-point fall in base rates before the
year's end, and the decline reflected slightly gloomier sentiment across the
world rather than any creeping bearishness in UK markets.
One commercial bank dealer said the price adjustments were due to a rise in
3-month dollar cash rates to 3 3/4 per cent, compared to the Fed Funds rate
of 3 per cent. Tighter US conditions preceded this week's big Treasury Bond
issues, which are expected to show a rise in yields.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel prices fall to 5-year
lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICKEL PRICES were hit hardest yesterday by the wave of selling that is
driving down prices on the London Metal Exchange. After touching its lowest
level for more than five years, the price of nickel for delivery in three
months closed last night at Dollars 5,540, down Dollars 127.50 a tonne.
In the past week nickel prices have fallen by Dollars 602.50 a tonne or
nearly 10 per cent.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out that cuts planned by nickel
producers were 'perceived as tardy and insufficient'. Total nickel stocks,
an estimated 220,000 tonnes, equated to more than 18 weeks' consumption and
the outlook for stainless steel (the biggest user of nickel) was poor. 'A
period of depressed (nickel) prices looks to be in prospect for the
remainder of this year and the first half of 1993,' he said.
Copper prices also fell heavily yesterday before recovering slightly when
news about renewed political tension in Zaire created some nervousness about
supplies from the African copper belt. Three-months copper closed last night
at Pounds 1,411.50 a tonne, down Pounds 14.25 in one day and Pounds 64.75 or
4.4 per cent in a week.
Recovery in metals prices is not too far away, suggests Mr Jon Bergtheil,
analyst at James Capel, in a special report 'Metals and Easy Money'. He says
metal exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States will ease just as
western demand is picking up and western producers have cut output
substantially.
Mr Bergtheil says: 'This convergence will begin to take place from the
second quarter of 1993. Metal prices will anticipate this and begin to rise
from early 1993'.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Differences narrowed in cocoa
pact negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRODUCERS and consumers have begun to narrow their differences in
United Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva on a new international price
stabilisation accord.
Both sides have made new offers on the price range to be defended by the
accord and the amount of cocoa that could be withheld from the market to
keep the price within the specified range.
However, the gap between them remains large. With only four days to go until
the end of the two-week third round of talks on Friday, a fourth round looks
probable. This has been tentatively scheduled for next February in Geneva.
Early last week cocoa producers lowered their price demand from a mid-price
of SDR1,820 a tonne (Pounds 1,640) to one of SDR1,625 a tonne, with a floor
of SDR1,300 and a ceiling of SDR1,950. On Friday consumers raised their
proposed mid-price from SDR1,000 to SDR1,050, within a range of SDR840-1,260
a tonne. March cocoa futures closed in London yesterday at Pounds 745,
equivalent to SDR824, a tonne.
Consumers, led by the European Community, have also increased slightly, from
300,000 to 330,000 tonnes, the amount of cocoa they are prepared to see
withheld from the market under the proposed scheme for short-term price
stabilisation. Producers have come down from 600,000 to 500,000 tonnes but
Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister of the Ivory Coast, the biggest
producer, suggested last week that 450,000 tonnes would be acceptable to
producers.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Major backs banana plea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major, the British prime minister, has promised his government's
support for continuing access for Caribbean bananas to the European
Community following the creation of a single market in January, according to
Mr PJ Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister.
Mr Patterson said he had written to several European leaders about the
concerns of Caribbean banana exporters, and the need for continued
preferential entry to Europe to protect against more competitive fruit from
other areas, mainly Latin America.
'I am happy to reaffirm my government's firm commitment to ensure that new
arrangements on bananas fully meet our Lome obligations,' Mr Major replied.
'Achieving a successful outcome on bananas is a high priority for the UK
presidency of the community.'

GOLD held under pressure on the London bullion market, but futures were
trading at lifetime lows on Comex at midday. The New York market was
depressed by perceptions that inflation had been tamed and a widespread
belief that global economies would remain in the doldrums. London dealers
said the market had been battered by apparently programmed sales of central
bank gold in roughly 50,000 ounce lots over the past two months and now by
panic hedging from producers - even at current low price levels. London
COCOA futures hit a new high in early trading before turning tail to end
around Pounds 8 a tonne lower in near months after a reasonably busy day. 'I
think the market's just a bit tired. It's run-up a lot in the last week and
it needs a bit of consolidation,' one dealer said. By midday New York's
arabica COFFEE market had recovered on news that German statistician FO
Licht expects world production to fall to 93.32m bags in 1992-93, compared
with 101.99m bags last year.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy appears stuck with
aluminium white elephant - It looks as though taxpayers will to have to
carry on footing the bill for Alumix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MONTH could see some light shed on the uncertain fate of Alumix, the
Italian aluminium producer, part of the Efim state holding company, which
was put into voluntary liquidation in July.
The government has set a mid-November deadline for deciding how to deal with
Efim's wide-ranging operations. While healthier parts of the group, which
has operations ranging from glass to health spas, are likely to be sold off,
the long term future of the aluminium subsidiary is much less clear.
Alumix, which lost L420bn (Pounds 200m) on sales of about L1,200bn last year
and now has debts of some L1,300bn, is by far the most difficult of Efim's
many problems.
Many industrialists question why Italy, lacking reserves of bauxite
(aluminium ore) and highly dependent on imported energy, the biggest cost
factor in aluminium smelting, ever created an aluminium business in the
first place.
The answer is largely political. With the bulk of its smelting activities on
the island of Sardinia, Alumix was designed partly to provide jobs, and
through them, votes. Its plants are further examples of the tendency to
develop large industrial plants in fringe locations on the basis of social
policy rather than market forces.
The fear of losing votes and boosting unemployment explains the willingness
of successive Italian governments to be relatively patient as the problems
of Alumix - and Efim as a whole - steadily mounted. After its liquidation,
Efim was found to have debts of about L17,500bn - double previous estimates.
Alumix scraped together meagre net profits of L4bn and L9bn in 1988 and
1989. But in the past two years, its losses have been growing as a result of
the collapse in aluminium prices and steeply rising electricity charges.
Although many forecasters expect demand for aluminium to increase later this
decade, Alumix's problems look set to worsen in the short term.
On purely economic grounds, many Italians think Alumix should be closed
down. But in its latest decree law on winding up Efim, published last month,
the government appeared to grant the group yet another reprieve. Noting the
social importance of providing labour in the hard-pressed Sardinian economy,
where unemployment is high, the government of Mr Giuliano Amato appeared
willing to sanction yet another restructuring plan in the hope of turning
Alumix round.
Company officials draw attention to the important steps that have already
been taken in slimming down an industry born of the merger between the
former private-sector Alusuisse activities in Italy, based in Porto Marghera
near Venice, and the state-owned Aluminia group in Sardinia.
Production has been concentrated in Sardinia, where about 130,000 tonnes of
Alumix's total 160,000-tonnes-a-year output is now based. According to an
official, the Sardinian works are relatively up to date, while those in
Porto Marghera are much older. Among other achievements claimed by the group
is the creation in November 1991 of a four-division structure covering
smelting, extrusion, lamination and packaging, in an attempt to reduce costs
and improve co-ordination.
There has also been some reduction of the work-force, which by March this
year had fallen to about 6,500 on a group basis from 7,100 at the end of
1991.
However, Alumix claims many of the measures needed to restore its fortunes
depend on the government rather than its management. Redundancy programmes
are linked to government-sponsored early retirement schemes, which rely on
Rome for financial support. And in spite of ministerial agreement to a
L500bn cash boost agreed in 1991, and due to take effect at the end of that
year, the fresh money has never come, the company complains.
But Alumix's biggest grumble - and by far the most controversial aspect of
the business - concerns the price of electricity. At L44 per kilowatt hour,
Alumix complains its energy costs are far above the European average. In
July, the government agreed to slash electricity tariffs for the group's
Sardinian smelters by 40 per cent, bringing the cost down to L24 per KwH.
'That has helped', says Ms Chiara Benelli, a company official 'but it
doesn't cover production at Porto Marghera.'
Surprisingly, Ms Benelli does not expect the price cut to provoke a protest
among competitors in the European Community. 'It's not a subsidy, but just a
reduction of the excessive price rise introduced earlier', she says. Until
two years ago, Alumix was paying L28 per KwH.
The government appears to have already granted Alumix a short-term stay of
execution, although this month may still bring further surprises. Given that
a sale or public flotation of the group is inconceivable in its present
condition, ministers appear willing to provide some resources to help it put
its books straight. In the meantime, some fringe activities may be hived
off.
Alumix says virtually all its operations except the primary smelting
business are now in, or nearing, profits, at least at the operating level.
So conceivably, a subsidiary like its Comital foils and flexible packaging
business, based in Turin, could be sold off separately.
Yet even one-off sales are limited by the strong vertical integration
between many of the group's operations. Laminates, based at Porto Marghera,
are dependent on output from the adjoining smelting works. So for the time
being it looks as though for the Italian taxpayer wil have to carry on
footing the bill for the country's expensive aluminium business.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather makes a hash of UK
potato forecasts - Rain-soaked fields will almost certainly not produce the
crop surplus that had been expected earlier / Farmer's viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK potato crop this year is one of the biggest ever. Total potential
yield is estimated by the Potato Marketing Board at about 7m tonnes. Weather
conditions during the growing season have been ideal and there is hardly a
grower in the country who has produced a poor yield.
But I met a specialist potato farmer the other day, a man who grew about
1,400 acres, mainly on other farmers' land which he rented for the purpose,
who admitted that he expected to lose Pounds 250,000 on this year's
activities. Such is the paradox of potatoes. To make a real killing from the
crop it is necessary for there to be a shortage. This year there is a
perceived surplus.
I use the word perceived because, for various reasons, mostly to do with the
wet autumn, the apparent 1m tonne excess of supply over demand will almost
certainly not materialise.
Domestic demand for home grown potatoes is normally around 6m tonnes. Lower
home sale prices, although these are seldom passed on in full to consumers,
could well lead to an increase in consumption to perhaps 6.3m tonnes.,
The glut on the market during the main lifting period caused ex-farm prices
to collapse a few weeks ago, triggering the mechanism that allows the Potato
Marketing Board to buy limited quantities of potatoes in order to take them
off the domestic and processing markets. The price the board has paid -
Pounds 33 a tonne - leaves no profit for the grower but the objective is to
firm the price of the rest of the crop.
The board has in fact intervened in the market twice in recent weeks and
well in excess of 500,000 tonnes has been offered to it by growers, not all
of which may be accepted. That which is accepted will be sold back to
farmers, for a fraction of what the board paid for it, to be used as animal
feed. The operation, although modestly underwritten by the Ministry of
Agriculture, is mainly funded by growers through a system of levies paid to
the board on every acre of potatoes grown.
The greatest uncertainty, however, concerns the very high proportion of the
crop that has still not been harvested. A week ago the board estimated that
some 21 per cent of the area planted, containing about 1.5m tonnes, was
still in the ground.
There have been a few dry days since these figures were issued and doubtless
the unharvested acreage will now be a little smaller. After double the
normal rainfall in some of the main potato areas over the last three months
the problems of lifting in muddy conditions have been immense.
Comparative figures for recent years indicate the extent of this year's
delay in potato harvesting. In 1991 at the end of October 7 per cent of the
crop was left in the ground; in 1990, just 5 per cent. And the longer the
delay lasts into the winter the more difficult it is to lift the crop from
increasingly waterlogged soil.
Furthermore it is likely that the cold weather that has accompanied the rain
will have damaged a proportion of the unlifted tubers; for once soil
temperatures drop below about 8 deg C (46 F), the sugar content in the
starch of potatoes rises, making them unsuitable for processing and unlikely
to keep well in store through the winter. Also, most potatoes lifted in
present soil conditions have mud stuck to them, which also affects
storability by inhibiting under-floor ventilation. This in turn can lead to
the development in store of latent diseases, which could make significant
tonnages unmarketable for human consumption.
Some potato pundits have, in fact, predicted that national losses as a
result of this combination of factors could be between 200,000 and 300,000
tonnes. If they are right, and with most of the questionable potatoes still
in the soil they are guessing at present, it is clear that the surplus may
be more apparent than real.
So, increased consumption, wastage, and the sizeable tonnage taken off the
market may have created a virtual balance between supply and demand.
The marketing board presumably thinks so too because last Friday afternoon
the latest support buying scheme was closed. Growers now hope that there
will be a firmer undertone to the market and that buyers will be prepared to
pay them more than the 2p per lb most have received this season.
Moreover most growers believe that in a year like 1992 the UK's potato
marketing board, unique in the EC, will really justify itself. Its statutory
powers enable it to control the acreage grown as well as help to manipulate
the market. There is little doubt, in fact, that its activities help bring
some stability to a volatile sector and that is valued very highly by the
majority of potato farmers.
They are upset, therefore, that, along with the marketing boards for milk
and wool, the potato board, or at least its statutory powers, are set to
disappear. Indeed enabling Bills to effect the changes are scheduled to be
debated in the House of Lords within the next few weeks. It is all part of
legislation required to bring about the European Community's single market.
Hostility to the removal of the statutory powers in order to replace them
with a so-called 'light' community regime is based on the failure of most
other EC measures to stabilise commodity prices in an acceptable way in the
long term and to the ruinous potato prices suffered by other potato growers
in a year like this.
In Holland and Belgium, for instance, growers are at present receiving as
little as half the price paid in the UK. No European farmer, growers argue,
even the ultra efficient ones in the low countries, can survive for long at
such prices. UK growers also point to the apparent anomaly of a CAP reform
package that seeks to control production by limiting the cropped area of
commodities in surplus and compensating farmers for so doing, while at the
same time insisting on the removal of a system that is already achieving
such control at a minimal cost to the taxpayer.
Mr John Gummer, the UK minister of agriculture, does not appear to agree. He
told a group of East Anglian potato growers last week that it could not be
right to restrict the acreage of potatoes grown in the UK and risk a
domestic shortage which would suck in imports from other EC countries.
He claimed that he did not know the details of what Brussels would shortly
propose to replace the present system. It is highly unlikely, however, that
the imminent proposal will include statutory powers, which are at the heart
of present UK arrangements.
If they do not, many UK potato growers fear a volatile future that will
drive more of them out of business and suck in more imports in any case.
They are fighting a probably futile rear-guard action to try to keep their
tried and tested system. For they are well aware that neither they nor UK
consumers would gain from a change. The only beneficiaries of a totally free
market would be the processors and the supermarkets.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Judgment reserved on planned Finnish
Dollars 1bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trick is picking the right moment. That is the message to the Republic
of Finland from bankers digesting the announcement of its proposed Dollars
1bn global bond issue.
Full judgment will be reserved until details are settled, but the degree of
shoulder shrugging could be taken to indicate a hint of sovereign fatigue in
a market which has been awash with actual and rumoured jumbo sovereign
borrowings.
The news that Finland plans to issue a minimum Dollars 1bn of global bonds
for distribution in Europe, Asia and north America at least removed some
uncertainty.
Finland has a heavy borrowing programme and is eager to diversify its
borrowing base.
A global dollar issue is seen as a good way of accessing the US domestic
market in what should be its last major external financing of the year.
Details of the exact amount, scheduling and maturities of the notes to be
issued remain to be settled in discussions with the banks which won the
mandate, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Securities and Nomura International.
Late yesterday, bankers were placing their bets on five-year paper offering
75 to 80 basis points over comparable US Treasuries.
This is being hailed as the first sovereign global issue in a sector largely
dominated by the World Bank and Canadian provincial borrowers. It is also
Finland's first issue targeted at the US since it launched its last Yankee
bond issue in March 1988.
Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, who was involved in the
World Bank's first global issue as a member of its board, says he has since
closely followed the experiences of other borrowers in this market.
He says: 'The results have been favourable for the borrower and also for the
investor, who has an issue that is liquid and movable between the
international markets.'
Mr Kantola believes that a single global issue will work out cheaper in
terms of all-in costs than two separate smaller Euro and Yankee bonds. This
is the first time Finland has announced its borrowing plans in advance, says
Mr Kantola. 'When the deal is more sizeable it gives the market more time to
swallow the idea.'
Despite this year's borrowing activity, Finland's debt burden is still, he
argues, relatively light. It is now approaching 30 per cent of gross
national product compared with just under 20 per cent at the start of the
year, and Mr Kantola expects it to peak at just over 40 per cent. Next
year's borrowing requirement will be broadly similar to this year's at
around Dollars 12bn to Dollars 14bn, to be split approximately equally
between foreign and domestic borrowing.
Meanwhile, French francs saw another issue launched to tap international
demand for the currency. The FFr1bn five-year bond from Banque Nationale de
Paris was said to be fairly priced at 50 basis points over the comparable
OAT. The issue is fungible with BNP's recent FFr1.5bn issue.
Deutsche Bank, which led the Inter-American Development Bank's latest D-Mark
offering, said that at DM500m the 10-year bond was small enough to launch
using the traditional German structure rather the fixed-price reoffer
system.
Bankers claiming that there is now potentially strong demand for sterling
assets noted that the Pounds 100m five-year issue from Leeds Permanent
Building Society suffered in comparison with last Friday's Pounds 200m bond
from Halifax Building Society on credit grounds.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts rise on hopes for positive Autumn
Statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices rallied across the yield curve yesterday, buoyed
by hopes of a cut in the base rate and a bond-positive Autumn Statement on
Thursday.
The market opened on a strong note, helped by speculation in the weekend
press that the next cut in the base rate could be between 1.5 and 2
percentage points. Gilts ended between  1/8 and  1/4 of a point higher on
the day in the cash market, after some profit-taking.
Volume in the futures market was relatively low at about 19,000 contracts.
The Liffe contract opened at 102.04 and reached a high of 102.12, before
falling to end the day at 101.31. In the cash market, the 9 per cent gilt
due 2008 climbed from 103 23/32 to 104.00 to yield 8.53 per cent, while the
10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose from 105 15/32 to 105 19/32 .
The strong rally enabled the Bank of England to sell some of its latest tap
stock, the 8 per cent gilt due 2009.
The Bank announced Pounds 1bn of the stock for sale on Friday afternoon and
dealers estimated that more than half of the stock was sold yesterday.
US TREASURY prices were mixed in directionless trading yesterday, with
shorter dated securities weaker following the three-year note auction but
longer dated bonds steady-to-firmer.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 94
7/32 , yielding 7.743 per cent. The two-year note was lower, however, down
1/8 at 99 7/16 , yielding 5.534 per cent.
Trading throughout the day was dominated by manoeuvring before and after the
Treasury's sale of Dollars 15.5bn three-year notes. Prices at the short end
eased initially as some investors moved out of the three-year in an attempt
to nudge the yield higher and to prepare for the new supply.
The auction subsequently proved marginally disappointing, with only
lacklustre demand for the new paper.
The issue was sold at an average yield of 5.17 per cent, and the cautious
tone of the sale is likely to keep prices soft ahead of the upcoming 10-year
note and 30-year bond auctions.
JAPANESE government bond futures rallied strongly as yesterday's large fall
in the stock market helped to revive hopes of an interest rate cut.
The December futures contract climbed to a high of 107.80, from its opening
level of 107.29, with the market performing strongly in the afternoon.
The Nikkei stock index ended 452.76 points - or 2.68 per cent - lower than
Friday's finish at 16,417.05, on the back of poor corporate results and
political worries.
The current political preoccupation with the Sagawa Kyubin bribery scandal
is delaying the implementation of the supplementary budget, dealers said.
They added that if the delays continued, the combination of the worsening
economic climate and inability to move on the fiscal front could put
pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate.
In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.73 per
cent and reached 4.64 per cent before closing at 4.65 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds slipped about a quarter of a point in the afternoon,
as some US investors took profits in relatively thin trading.
The December bond futures contract on the Matif exchange ended the day at
around 110.80, down from 111.04.
Longer-dated bonds lost ground, but short-dated issues remained relatively
firm, dealers said.
GERMAN government bonds ended firmer after trading in a narrow range.
The Liffe bund futures contract moved from a low of 91.46 to a high of
91.63, and ended the day at around 91.57.
While 10-year bund futures ended firmer, the five-year bund contract edged
lower, reflecting some profit-taking after last week's rally in the
medium-dated sector. As a result the yield curve flattened slightly.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Midland pulls out of sterling
CP market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Bank yesterday pulled out of the sterling commercial paper (CP)
market, signalling further concentration in a market already dominated by
its rivals BZW and National Westminster.
'We've had a thorough review of this area and concluded that we can't
generate a sufficient return out of it to make it worth carrying on,'
Midland said.
The bank began dealing when the sterling commercial paper market opened in
1986, and had become the third most active bank in the area.
However, the sector has never developed as strongly as some other areas of
the Euro-CP market, leading to a succession of withdrawals - including those
of S. G. Warburg and Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banks - in recent
years.
This year, the amount of paper outstanding in the market has remained
generally flat, at between Pounds 4.1bn and Pounds 4.8bn (Dollars
6.35bn-Dollars 7.44bn).
Mr David Knight, head of CP at BZW, said Midland's withdrawal would not
undermine the sterling CP market. 'We're still very much committed to it,'
he said.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Accounting board retreats
over asset securitising changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTING regulators in the UK have backed down on proposed rules that
could have stopped banks and companies from securitising assets.
However, the proposals from the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) still
contain rules which some claim will put UK institutions at a disadvantage
when trying to sell asset-backed bonds, and which could make it impossible
to securitise credit card receivables.
The ASB proposed last year that all securitised assets - where a bank or
other entity passes assets to a special purpose vehicle, which then issues
bonds against them - should remain on the originator's balance sheet,
removing a significant attraction of such arrangements.
The proposal caused particular problems for banks, since under EC rules they
are assessed for capital adequacy purposes on all the assets that appear on
their balance sheets.
Yesterday, the ASB announced a change which, while still requiring companies
to record securitised assets on their balance sheets, would allow them to
show also the amount of non-recourse finance linked to the assets. This
would leave them with a net asset figure reflecting only the residual risk
left with the company from a securitisation.
The ASB said it had received 60 submissions from interested parties, which
had indicated strong views both for and against its first proposal.
Barclays and National Westminster, whose securitisation plans had been
thrown into doubt by the original ASB proposal, welcomed the change.
Mr Malcolm Veale, head of securitisation at NatWest, said that the new
approach would also make it easier for listed companies which have
considered securitising their assets but been put off by the accounting
treatment.
However, the ASB's proposal would still require most issuers to show 10 per
cent of the value as net assets on their balance sheets. This reflects the
option that issuers usually retain to buy back the bonds when the amount
outstanding shrinks to less than 10 per cent of the amount first issued,
thereby reducing their administration costs. Also, the proposals for the way
bonds backed by credit card receivables should be repaid will make it more
cumbersome to administer such issues.

postpone issue

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest private sector company, has
postponed its Dollars 100m international equity issue to the middle of 1993.
This follows a slide in the steel maker's shares on Indian stock exchanges
last week after it announced poor half-year results.
The company, which had been expected to lead up to 10 Indian companies
seeking to raise capital via international issues, deferred its float
because it feared its global depository receipts (GDRs) would not fetch more
than Rs80 each this month.
Brokers said when the company's shares were buoyant, at around Rs400 last
May, the company could have expected Rs350 per GDR. At the current low
domestic price of Rs240 a share, the company would have to sell its GDRs at
around Rs80.
Tisco said it was not short of foreign exchange, and would wait until its
shares recovered before going ahead with the issue. Mr Ishaat Hussain,
executive director for finance, said he was confident the company would
eventually secure a good price for its GDRs.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Man with a mission to accentuate
the positive - Citicorp's problems should be put into perspective,
vice-chairman Dr Onno Ruding tells Robert Peston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR ONNO Ruding is on a mission to explain. In his monthly trips to Europe,
he is keen to put Citicorp's problems into perspective and to point out that
the European operations of the US's biggest bank are proving surprisingly
resilient.
The former Dutch finance minister has for the past eight months been
Citicorp's vice-chairman, with responsibility for global finance activities,
which provide financial products and advice to big companies.
His appointment surprised some bankers because he is not American and has
spent much of his career in government. In the early 1970s, however, he was
a joint general manager of the Dutch Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (now part of
ABN Amro) and joined its board in 1981.
In an interview with the Financial Times, his positive message was that
Citicorp's commercial banking operations, which serve big companies, are
continuing to increase their share of the European market, according to an
authoritative survey. . The report shows the bank is strong in providing
clearing services and in foreign exchange trading.
The strength of its London-based foreign exchange trading floor has been
particularly valuable recently. The bank's most recent quarterly results
included a Dollars 171m increase in foreign exchange revenues, which Dr
Ruding said was partly attributable to the increased volume of business
since Black Wednesday, September 16, when the UK withdrew from the European
exchange rate mechanism.
But Citicorp's progress in Europe has been overshadowed by its problems in
the US, which stemmed from its aggressive lending policy in the 1980s.
In October 1991, Citicorp, whose main subsidiary is Citibank, ceased payment
of its dividend for the first time in its 179-year history after an Dollars
885m after-tax loss for the three months to 30 September. Its ratio of tier
one or core capital to assets had slipped to 3.67 per cent, so the bank
redoubled its efforts to cut costs.
There has been a recovery. In the third quarter of the current year,
Citicorp announced a Dollars 116m profit and said the tier one ratio was
4.25 per cent. However, there was no resumption of dividend payments.
The losses in 1991 stemmed largely from commercial property loans which went
bad. These losses have diminished, but Citicorp has recently faced rising
consumer bad debts.
Dr Ruding said write-offs of property and commercial loans would probably
fall to an average quarterly rate of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 450m
next year, compared with Dollars 521m in the three months to 30 September.
However, he added that consumer debt write-offs, which were Dollars 860m in
the quarter, would continue 'at a high level', although they would probably
not rise any more.
He is concerned that the lending mistakes should not be repeated. 'I have
spent quite some time since I came here on the question of how to improve
credit quality,' he said. 'There were not enough checks and balances
(against imprudent lending) in that if you had line responsibility you had a
high responsibility for new credits.'
He said the bank had introduced new limits on what managers 'can decide for
themselves'. The amount that a manager can lend on a short-term basis to
triple-A rated companies - the most financially strong companies - without
getting approval from senior executives has been increased, but long-term
loans and loans to low-rated companies are more tightly controlled. Dr
Ruding said it was also important that Citicorp's management committee
should not 'all the time give in to requests from managers (for permission
to make a loan)'.
He is also concerned that Citicorp's remuneration system encouraged managers
to increase lending while not checking the quality of the loans
sufficiently. 'That was not good at Citicorp', he said. 'It has now
improved'.
Nonetheless, US bank regulators have been taking a close interest in
Citicorp. In February, the bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
with the US Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency agreeing
that they would monitor its affairs more closely.
The MOU committed Citicorp to increase its ratio of capital to assets
significantly, which Dr Ruding said the bank was planning anyway. 'We want a
6 per cent tier one ratio in 1994,' he said. The MOU also prevented the bank
from adding to its assets without the approval of the regulators.
'We are still in close touch with the regulators. They were understandably
concerned about certain matters . . . I am in full agreement myself with
what they have said in the MOU,' Dr Ruding said.
The need to seek approval from the regulators before adding to assets would
be a constraint if Citicorp were planning 'the purchase of a large
organisation', he said. But, he added, such a move was not being
contemplated: 'We think we are big enough.'
The disclosure of the regulators' close involvement in Citicorp's affairs
was one rude shock for shareholders this year. The other was the resignation
a month ago of Mr Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president who was widely
viewed as a possible successor to Mr John Reed, the bank's chairman.
Dr Ruding said Mr Braddock's departure should not have been a surprise.
'People have not followed (our affairs) sufficiently. The cornerstone of his
resignation was laid in January this year with the reorganisation of top
management, which meant that few executive vice-presidents were reporting to
him any more.'
At that time, Mr Braddock gave up responsibility for running retail banking
operations to Mr Pei-yuan Chia. Mr Braddock then concentrated on cutting
Citicorp's costs.
'His cost-cutting was completed successfully, but his previous job had been
filled by Mr Pei-yuan Chia,' Dr Ruding said. 'You can't have two bosses (of
consumer banking).'
The timing of Mr Braddock's departure was determined by Citicorp's attempts
to raise Dollars 1.1bn of capital by the issue of preferred shares, or
Percs. 'You can't announce something like that (a resignation) during a
stock issue,' he said. However, Dr Ruding described Mr Braddock as 'highly
valuable'. 'I am pretty sure he will find a good job in the US'.
On the other hand, some European and US bankers profess themselves surprised
Mr Reed has kept his job through Citicorp's well-publicised problems. But Dr
Ruding uttered a stout defence of Mr Reed.
'John had and has the full support of the board including the
non-executives,' he said. 'He has also introduced a series of very important
and comprehensive measures to correct and remedy a number of shortcomings.
'He took action in a very aggressive way which I think has worked well,' he
concluded. Citicorp's shareholders will probably only concur wholeheartedly
when the bank resumes payment of its dividend.

KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest commercial bank, yesterday
indicated it might take further measures to strengthen its capital base when
it said it was seeking shareholder authorisation for an equity or
equity-related issue, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. This would enable KOP
to raise up to FM743.75m (Dollars 149.2m), or 20 per cent of its share
capital.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Marginal borrowers could be
crowded out, says OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARGINAL borrowers could be crowded out of the international capital markets
by borrowing needs of sovereign and corporate issuers in OECD countries.
The considerable sums expected to be raised over the next few months could
result in a flight to quality rather than a generalised tightening of
borrowing terms, suggests the OECD in its latest Financial Market Trends
publication.
Capital raising is still growing strongly: at Dollars 439bn, facilities
arranged over the period January-September 1992 were 16 per cent higher than
over the same period in 1991.
Until early summer, the main source of borrowing was the large-scale
refinancing needs of sovereign and corporate borrowers. Since then, however,
the need to replenish foreign currency reserves has given renewed urgency to
the raising of foreign capital.
The demand for capital from borrowers in OECD countries was some Dollars
50bn higher than in 1991, accounting for 88 per cent of the total.
Demand for longer-term financing from Latin American issuers which have
regained access to the private international markets is described as robust,
totalling some Dollars 15bn, but there has been a slowdown in fund-raising
by Asian and Middle Eastern borrowers.
While the equity-related bond market continued to suffer from the lack of
investor interest in the wake of losses experienced since the middle of last
year, placements of international equities grew rapidly to around Dollars
20bn to end-September, despite the turbulence in the major stock markets.
The international and foreign bonds markets have reverted to a period of
more sustainable expansion.
New bonds issued in the first nine months of 1992 totalled Dollars 249bn, up
9 per cent from what was already a record level. New issuing activity grew
by nearly 30 per cent in 1991.
Straight bond issues are up 12 per cent year on year, notwithstanding the
recent sharp fall of new issues in several European currency sectors. The US
dollar benefited most from the trend to reallocate funds in favour of safe
haven currencies.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: New reinsurance venture aims to
fill catastrophe gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors are financing a Dollars 350m Bermuda-based venture
which aims to take advantage of new opportunities in the catastrophe
reinsurance market.
The Mid Ocean Reinsurance Company, sponsored by Marsh &amp; McLennan, the
insurance brokers, and J. P. Morgan, the US bank, begins underwriting next
week.
The new company will work with international brokers to support risks lead
by underwriters in the London market, particularly at Lloyd's, where
capacity has been dented following a run of heavy losses.
Mr Ian Heap, Mid Ocean's president and chief executive, said the company had
been set up 'because the broker market for reinsurance was diminishing. The
demand for the product was exceeding supply.'
A number of reinsurers have withdrawn from the market and rates are rising,
he added.
Mid Ocean will initially underwrite up to Pounds 10m (Dollars 15.50m) per
risk, taking 'lines' (or shares) of up to 10 per cent of reinsurance
programmes. Mr Charles Skey, Mid Ocean's underwriter, has more than 30
years' experience at Lloyd's where he was widely regarded as an expert in
catastrophe reinsurance.
Mid Ocean will underwrite from Bermuda but has a contact office at Lloyd's.
Marsh and Morgan are each investing more than Dollars 30m in the new
company. Exel, a Bermuda-based insurer set up by US corporations in 1986 and
formerly headed by Mr Heap, will invest a further Dollars 100m.
Other backers include Commercial Union, the UK insurer; Mr Richard
Rainwater, a Texan investor; Bishop Estate of Hawaii; and Fund American
Enterprises Holdings of New York.
The investors are expecting returns on capital of more than 20 per cent in
the venture's initial years, according to Mr Heap.
Reinsurance premiums for catastrophe cover by UK and other European insurers
rose sharply at the end of 1990 and increased again last year.
US insurers are expecting big increases following record losses after
hurricanes Andrew and Iniki earlier this year.
Bermuda's low taxes and gentle regulatory environment make it an attractive
location for 'offshore' reinsurance and captive insurance companies.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Europe fuels Hyundai's strategy
 -A US sales slump has forced a shift in focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYUNDAI Motor, South Korea's largest vehicle manufacturer, is shifting gear
in its export strategy.
Europe could become the company's biggest foreign market this year,
providing new momentum for export growth after sales slumped dramatically in
the US.
US sales fuelled Hyundai Motor's rapid growth during the 1980s, with more
Americans than South Koreans buying Hyundai cars.
But US demand suddenly weakened in 1989 due to the economic downturn.
Production problems at Hyundai's Korean plants, and labour strife, led to a
temporary deterioration in quality and growing consumer complaints.
Hyundai's exports, which then accounted for almost two thirds of production,
halved to 200,000 vehicles in 1989.
In an attempt to revive exports, Hyundai quickly turned its attention to
Europe and has expanded considerably its distribution network there during
the past three years.
The number of European countries where Hyundai cars are sold has increased
from four in 1988 to 25, with France last month becoming the most recently
opened market.
Sales in Europe this year surpassed those in the US for the first time, with
78,571 vehicles sold in Europe during the first nine months against 61,235
cars in the US. Germany, which Hyundai entered only last year, is already
its second largest national market overseas, after the US.
Mr Kim Nae-Myoung, Hyundai Motor's export marketing director, says: 'In
spite of the recession . . . we have continued to grow due to our status as
a relative newcomer and because our prices are competitive.'
The depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen and other
leading currencies has helped. But Hyundai is also accepting profit margins
in Europe that are even lower than in the highly competitive South Korean
market, according to Mr Kim.
Analysts say Hyundai has little choice but to increase exports at almost any
price, because it needs to reduce a growing inventory of vehicles.
This reflects slower growth in the domestic market, which now accounts for
55 per cent of Hyundai's sales. The Korean government recently raised
vehicle taxes, already among the highest in the world, to curb car ownership
and alleviate growing traffic congestion. South Korea is now the world's
eighth biggest car market.
The introduction of the car taxes came at an awkward time for Hyundai and
other Korean motor manufacturers since they recently expanded production
facilities and are launching several new models. Hyundai's annual production
capacity is 900,000 vehicles.
Hyundai hopes to increase exports to almost 300,000 cars this year from
229,000 in 1991 as sales more than double in Europe and it develops other
markets, including Latin America, south-east Asia and the Middle East.
The strong export growth is predicted to raise Hyundai sales to Won6,500bn
(Dollars 8.31bn) this year from Won5,652bn in 1991. Earnings are also
expected to grow to Won65bn from Won54bn a year ago, although this mainly
reflects improved productivity in its factories.
Hyundai accounts for almost half of domestic motor vehicle sales and two
thirds of Korean car exports.
It has established a firm foothold in Europe ahead of its main domestic
competitors, Kia Motors and Daewoo Motor, owing to its ability to freely
market its cars worldwide.
All three Korean motor manufacturers have licensed technology from foreign
car companies. But Kia and Daewoo had to accept restrictions on overseas
sales in their technology agreements, while Hyundai's Japanese partner
Mitsubishi permitted export rights.
Daewoo recently broke its joint venture ties with General Motors of the US
in order to pursue overseas sales, while Kia is now planning to set up sales
networks in the US and Europe as it independently develops new car models.
Mr Kim believes Hyundai so far does not face much of a protectionist threat
in Europe. 'We have taken advantage of the quotas placed on Japanese imports
in developing a market. But our sales volume is too small for trade barriers
to be directed against us. Our market share is peanuts, less than 1 per cent
of the European market.'
Hyundai's greatest obstacle in Europe is unfavourable perceptions about the
quality of its vehicles, Mr Kim acknowledges.
Hyundai is hoping that its Lantra compact car, launched in mid-1990 after
five years of development, will help restore public trust.
The Lantra - known as the Elantra in Korea - is expected this year to
replace the Excel as Hyundai's most popular model in both the domestic and
foreign markets. Hyundai also exports its Sonata saloon and Scoupe compact,
while its luxury car Grandeur is only sold in Korea.
Hyundai's research and development programme is the second biggest in Korea
after Samsung Electronics, the country's main semiconductor producer.
Hyundai last year became the first Korean vehicle manufacturer to completely
develop a car engine and it plans to equip some of its vehicles with
fuel-saving 'lean-burn engines' beginning in 1994. The development of key
motor components will also enable Hyundai to reduce its dependence on
foreign suppliers and cut high royalty payments to them.

'They will do it in the course of the next six to 12 months or I guess the

he said.
The AMP is Westpac's biggest shareholder with just under 15 per cent of the

OMRON, a leading Japanese electronic systems manufacturer, yesterday blamed
a virtual freeze on investment by Japanese companies for an 80 per cent drop
in pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year.
Omron said the sharp downturn in the Japanese economy over the past six
months had created a drastic situation, with industrial investment grinding
to a halt after the boom of the late 1980s.
Omron, which makes factory, traffic and office computer control systems,
reported an 80.2 per cent drop in net profits to Y1.28bn (Dollars 10.4m) in
the six months to September from Y6.47bn in the same period a year earlier.
Turnover fell by 10.8 per cent to Y169.7bn from Y190.4bn.
Omron is suffering from the same pressures that are hitting many Japanese
manufacturers. Its heavy investment programme in the late 1980s has left it
carrying high depreciation costs as economic growth is slowing.

SENIOR management of Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday
given a year to solve the bank's problems before facing pressure for changes
from institutional shareholders.
Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest
financial institution, said it had been made clear to Westpac management
that the bank's operational performance must be improved quickly.
'They will do it in the course of the next six to 12 months or I guess the
board will decide they can't do it and make some alternative arrangements,'
he said.
The AMP is Westpac's biggest shareholder with just under 15 per cent of the
stock and two seats on the board. It has supported the bank's board and
senior managers over the past two years in spite of a series of poor
results.
Mr Salmon said there was no need for further board changes following the
resignations last month of five directors, including Sir Eric Neal, the
former chairman.
However, he said the AMP would 'have something to say' if Westpac were not
moving in the right direction within six months. 'We can apply a little bit
of leverage. We have a fair shareholding. I think we would get a lot of
support,' he said.
Westpac shares fell to a low of ADollars 2.42 on the Australian Stock
Exchange after Mr Salmon's comments, but recovered to close at ADollars
2.50, down one cent on the day. The shares fell 24 cents to a nine-year low
of ADollars 2.51 on Friday, following the announcement of an unexpected
ADollars 115m (USDollars 80m) tax charge in the US.
The US tax problem followed a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue and a
disastrous first half, in which the bank incurred a pre-tax loss of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts.

BANK Bumiputra Malaysia (BBMB), the state-owned institution, yesterday
reported a 57 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to MDollars 42.44m (USDollars
16.97m) for the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Total income rose to MDollars 656.77m from MDollars 625.86m while net
profits fell to MDollars 22.74m from MDollars 83.77m.
The bank gave no reasons for the sharp fall in profits but said that in May
1991 a court ordered it to pay MDollars 18.7m in damages for breach of
agreement in terminating a client's credit facility.
The government has twice rescued BBMB, Malaysia's second largest bank in
terms of assets, from collapse.
BBMB still faces a lawsuit in the US over the Hong Kong debacle involving
the collapse of Carrian Group to which the bank had been a leading lender.
BBMB's performance compared with record profits by other local banks is a
big blow to the government, analysts said.
On Saturday, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, announced that Mr Hanafiah
Hussein, BBMB chairman, and Mr Jaafar Ahmad, executive director, were
retiring.

CFTC
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Wendy Gramm, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), the US agency that oversees the burgeoning US futures and options
markets, said yesterday that she would join the flood of US officials
departing Washington with Mr George Bush in January.
Speaking informally to reporters as she left a meeting in Washington, she
said that she would leave her post as CFTC chairwoman in January and retire
from government.
News of her departure, coming less than a week after Mr Bush's defeat at the
polls, caught the futures industry unawares, but is not surprising.
A loyal appointee of Mr Bush and wife of a powerful Republican Senator from
Texas, Mr Phil Gramm, Mrs Gramm found herself politically mispositioned and
philosophically at odds with the incoming administration of Mr Bill Clinton.
Mrs Gramm, while likely to lose her position as chairwoman under Mr Clinton,
had the option of continuing on as a CFTC commissioner until April 1995.
Her departure will give Mr Clinton the opportunity to appoint three of the
agency's five commissioners early in his term.
She was appointed to the post in 1988 after working in the Budget office of
the Reagan White House, and immediately found herself defending her agency
and the futures industry from the fall-out from the October 1987 stock
market crash.
Nearly her entire tenure at the CFTC was spent defending the agency in a
battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities
watchdog, which was bidding for futures oversight, and with obtaining
landmark legis-lation defining the CFTC's powers.
She successfully shepherded the CFTC reauthorisation bill through Congress
in early September.
Futures industry officials believe that this will complete her legislative
mission, and means that she would have been ready to leave the CFTC even if
Mr Bush had gained a second term.
Mr John Damgard, head of the Futures Industry Association, the
Washington-based futures industry lobbying group, said: 'Mrs Gramm has been
an excellent chairman of the CFTC.
'She has steadfastly and consistently advocated free and open markets and
encouraged competition.'
Several possible successors have recently visited Washington, including at
least two Democratic congressmen and a leading Democratic staffer at the
agency.

ranges - Louise Kehoe examines US advances in microprocessor technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment (DEC), the troubled US minicomputer manufacturer, today
opens a critical campaign to regain sales momentum and profitability with
the launch of a range of computers based on the controversial 'Alpha'
technology.
It hopes to leapfrog its principal competitors, including Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, with a range of seven computers from a Dollars 15,000
workstation to a multi-processor mainframe-class system.
The new Alpha chip - which processes information 64 bits at a time similar
to a supercomputer - is likely to make Digital the front runner.
But SUN and Hewlett-Packard are jostling to upstage DEC and one another as
they also today unveil powerful computers based upon the new generation of
high-performance reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor
chips of which Alpha is currently the most powerful example.
The price of the products the three companies are launching today range from
under Dollars 5,000 to well over Dollars 150,000 and span desktop PCs
through to data-centre mainframes.
Risc chips made their commercial debut in the mid-1980s. Unlike earlier
'complex instruction set' micro-processors, they process a limited number of
simple instructions very rapidly.
These devices have become the critical componentin an industry-wide
computer-power battle, challenging the role of conventional microprocessors
in the PC market and traditional computer architectures in mini-computers
and mainframes.
Computer workstations will be centre stage in today's product launches as
Sun, H-P and Digital battle for a larger share of the Dollars 10bn
workstation market, one of the fastest growing sectors of the computer
market. Originally used primarily for engineering and technical
applications, workstations are invading the office where they become
powerful desktop computers.
H-P, which pioneered the use of Risc microprocessors in mid-range computers,
will unveil a new range of workstations that double the speed of its current
models. Digital has to build a base of software applications to take full
advantage of the new Alpha design.
Initially, Alpha workstations will be aimed primarily at software
developers.
By next March, the company predicts there will be 'several hundred'
applications designed to run on the Alpha computers. Some 900 software
companies are working on over 1,600 applications programs for Alpha, Digital
claims.
Sun will today unveil what it claims is 'the world's least expensive colour
Risc workstation', a desktop computer that will sell in the US for Dollars
4,295 and outperform similarly priced personal computers.
Sun's new Sparc Classic also sets a target for Apple Computer's next
generation of personal computers based upon IBM's PC Power Risc
microprocessor.
Sun will launch its most powerful computer to date - a mainframe-class
system for data centre applications that will eventually incorporate up to
20 processor modules working together, and beginning next April, Sun will
ship systems with up to eight modules.
H-P aims to maintain its performance advantage over competitors with a range
of systems based on a new version of its Risc technology that set processing
speed records while maintaining software compatibility with existing models.

DILLARD Department Stores, the Arkansas-based retailer, yesterday reported
solid progress in the third quarter of 1992, with after-tax profits
increasing from Dollars 39m to Dollars 44.4m after tax.
Sales rose from Dollars 954.9m in the same period of 1991, to Dollars
1.16bn, with the number of stores increasing to 220.
The third-quarter performance means the department store group has posted
after-tax profits of Dollars 126m for the first nine months of the year,
against Dollars 112m in the first three quarters of 1991.
But St Louis-based May Department Stores plunged into the red in the third
quarter, after it took a Dollars 298m extraordinary charge to cover planned
store closings and consolidations and several other property-related
charges.
This led May to report a Dollars 190m deficit after-tax in the three months,
against a Dollars 91m profit in the same period of 1991. Sales were modestly
higher at Dollars 2.67bn, against Dollars 2.56bn.
May has made after-tax profits of Dollars 284m in the nine months to
end-October, against Dollars 249m in the same period a year ago. May said in
the nine-month figures the third quarter one-off charge was offset by a
similar non-recurring gain, taken in the second quarter.
FRUIT of the Loom has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
for an offering of 700,000 Class A shares. The shares will be sold by Fruit
of the Loom's chairman Mr William Farley and Farley Inc and is part of
Farley's bankruptcy reorganisation plan.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: TSD shares suspended on false
data claim

TSD, a Japanese biotechnology and computer software company, triggered a
plunge in biotechnology-related stocks on the Tokyo stock market yesterday,
following an allegation that it had presented investors with false
information concerning clinical tests of its HIV vaccine.
Shares in TSD, which are traded on Tokyo's over-the-counter market, were
suspended on Friday by the Japan Securities Dealers Association after
reports alleging that TSD was misinforming investors.
On the OTC market yesterday, TSD shares did not trade due to the lack of
buyers, and closed at an offered price of Y2,320, down by a daily limit of
Y400 from Thursday's close.
In August last year, TSD announced that clinical tests for its anti-HIV
vaccine, co-developed with a professor of Yokohama City University, had
begun in a Thai hos-pital on HIV positive patients.
TSD's stock surged, rising to a high of Y3,650 in September 1991 from a
year's low of Y730 posted in April.
The rise in TSD's share price prompted a bulk of its convertible bonds worth
SFr45m (Dollars 32.1m), issued in 1990, to be converted into equity.
Mr Tsutomu Matsuzaki, president of TSD, last Friday admitted that the
company had yet to start the clinical tests since full approval from the
Thai government had not yet been obtained.
However, he denied allegations of giving false information to raise TSD's
stock price.
After the market closed yesterday, Mr Matsuzaki announced the Thai Public
Health Ministry had approved clinical tests of TSD's vaccine, and the
company was waiting for approval by the National Aids Committee.
The Aids theme was sparked by revelations last year that Meiji Milk
Products, a dairy producer, had discovered a substance seemingly capable of
killing the HIV virus inside the body.
Since then, brokers looking for a theme to drive up the market, embraced
shares of companies which announced research for Aids cures.
Mr David Goldstein, who is the head of the clinical trials unit of the
Australian National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said
that clinical tests of Aids cures could take more than three to four years,
until effective-ness is proven, while commercialisation of a cure may take
even longer.

STORAGE Technology's stock was down sharply yesterday when the company for
the third time announced delays in the development of its much-anticipated
Iceberg data storage system.
The stock suffered a 30 per cent fall to open at Dollars 22 1/4 on Monday,
down from a Dollars 31 3/4 close on Friday. In heavy trading it rallied
slightly to Dollars 23 7/8 at midday.
The company said it expected testing of Iceberg to extend into the second
half of 1993 and was planning on only 'limited revenue contribution from the
product for the year'. Originally, Iceberg installations had been expected
to begin in the second quarter of 1992.
Iceberg was announced with a great fanfare last January as a technology
breakthrough that would provide a fail-safe data storage system for
mainframe computers. It is based upon the concept of linking an array of
disk drives and duplicating data so that if one drive fails another will
take over.
StorageTek said it continued to encounter delays due to the complexity of
integrating the software and hardware of the Iceberg system.
However, it is optimistic about the prospects for the system. 'Disk arrays
are growing in importance at every level of computing,' said Mr Ryal Poppa,
StorageTek chairman, president and chief executive. 'We continue to see
Iceberg as defining the best of class and as providing unique capabilities
that will prove difficult for others to replicate.'

DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group that is engaged in a far-ranging
restructuring programme, has agreed to sell its electronic connectors
division for Dollars 400m to Hicks, Muse &amp; Company, a Dallas-based leveraged
buyout specialist.
Du Pont said last May it planned to dispose of the unit, which employs about
3,000 people. The division has annual revenues of about Dollars 450m.
In August Du Pont said it would reorganise its electronics division, which
will have annual revenues of about Dollars 800m after the sale of the
connectors business is completed. Mr Chad Holliday, president of Du Pont's
Asia Pacific operations, will take over responsibility for the electronics
division, which includes printed circuit materials and semiconductor
materials.
The purchase by Hicks, Muse includes Dollars 25m of senior preferred stock
in the acquired company.
Investing with Hicks, Muse is Mills &amp; Partners of St. Louis, a company that
also specialises in acquiring industrial businesses. The deal is expected to
be closed before the year-end.
The new company will be called Berg Electronics. Mr Norris Tolson,
vice-president and general manager of Du Pont's connectors business, will
become its president and chief operating officer and will receive an equity
stake.
Mr Thomas Hicks, chairman of Hicks, Muse, said the connector business had a
consistent record of operating profitability and a strong niche-market
position.
The division's 3,000 employees are spread equally among the Americas, Europe
and the Asia Pacific region. Du Pont first entered the connector
manufacturing sector in 1972.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Neighbourhood fight in Madrid -
Peter Bruce watches a takeover battle in Spain's property sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A takeover battle for control of a huge residential area of Madrid recently
vacated by the US Air Force promises to be one of the fiercest ever in
Spain.
The object of the struggle is the property company which owns and is named
after the area, El Encinar de los Reyes (Royal Oaks). At stake is a rapid
catch-up in property values following an end to more than 30 years of price
control.
El Encinar is wedged between two of Madrid's most expensive northern
suburbs, Moraleja and El Soto de Moraleja. While well-heeled Spaniards have
been paying vastly inflated prices to buy into the two Moralejas, property
values in El Encinar have been governed by prices agreed in 1958.
It was then that the US first established military links with the Franco
dictatorship. But the US service families have now departed and El Encinar's
owners believe that with a little rebuilding and some paint, the area could
be transformed into a boom town.
As the Spanish property market continues to fall into the doldrums, El
Encinar and its 866 homes must be the only property in Spain capable of
generating more money in the next five years than it has in the past 30.
The Olazabal family, immigrants to Madrid via the Basque country and Mexico,
where they made their fortune, bought control of El Encinar in 1962. They
now own 35 per cent of the company and have expanded into other ventures,
particularly in Mallorca.
Clearly, the Olazabals have been waiting a long time for their sitting
tenants at El Encinar to go in order to raise rents or sell the properties.
But instead of buying up the shares that still trade on the stock market
before the American families left, they waited just a little too long.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) one of Spain's biggest banks and the most
powerful Basque-run institution in Spain, began buying shares earlier this
year. Through its property affiliate, Metrovacesa, it owns almost 25 per
cent.
In October, the Olazabals announced they were making a formal bid for 14 per
cent of El Encinar at Pta2,500 (Dollars 22.45) a share. On the face of it
that would give them just 49 per cent of the company but El Ecinor owns 3
per cent of itself in treasury stock so they would have effective control.
Last week BBV struck back with plans to launch a counter offer later this
month for 75 per cent of El Encinar.
The Olazabals quickly responded with a bid of Pta2,750, and spoke of their
'sense of sorrow that a Basque bank, and especially the BBV, should so
violently try to displace a Basque family from exercising its traditional
control'.
What is being offered up here is a graphic display of how many of Spain's
old business families still believe business is something done between
friends. BBV, which has been living in a tougher world for some years,
immediately said it would beat the new Olazabal offer if it expired
unsuccessfully. Last night the family was debating whether to widen the
offer to satisfy its angry competitor.
It is probably no coincidence that the Olazabal bid is being guaranteed for
Pta2.45bn by the BBV's main rival, Banco Central Hispanoamericano (BCH).
Even less of a coincidence is that Metrovacesa's biggest property rival is
Vallehermoso, which is owned by the BCH.
Vallehermoso may not want to take El Encinar away from the Olazabals but it
would be most unhappy if Metrovacesa were to walk away with something quite
so succulent in a market so depressed. The fight for El Encinar could get
ugly.

Enso

<TEXT>
AHLSTROM, the Finnish forest and metals engineering group, is set to become
the leading private shareholder in Enso-Gutzeit through a forest-for-shares
deal worth FM926m (Dollars 185m).
Enso, one of Europe's leading forest industry groups, is buying 100,000
hectares of forest in south-eastern Finland from Ahlstrom.
Payment will be in the form of 44m new Enso shares, which equates to 23.5
per cent of the shares in Enso and 10.1 per cent of the votes.
The deal still leaves the Finnish state as the largest shareholder, with 59
per cent of the votes.
Mr Jukka Harmala, Enso's president, said the transaction would increase the
size of the group's raw material base to more than 450,000 hectares. It
would also improve the group's debt/equity ratio, he added.
Enso will issue 6.6m series A restricted shares at FM27 each and 37.4m
series R restricted shares at FM20 each to Ahlstrom. The deal is expected to
be completed by the end of the year, with the new shares entitled to a
dividend from 1993 onwards.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Black takes largest single
shareholding in Southam
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Conrad Black, Canadian proprietor of Britain's Daily Telegraph, has
broadened his base in North American publishing by becoming the largest
single shareholder in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain.
Hollinger, Mr Black's holding company, has agreed to pay CDollars 259m
(USDollars 207m) for the 23 per cent stake in Southam previously held by
Torstar Corp, another Canadian publishing group.
Hollinger is prevented by a Southam 'poison pill' from immediately buying
more of Southam's stock. But the deal fits the strategy which Mr Black has
favoured in the past of gaining control of troubled companies by starting
off with a minority stake.
Mr David Radler, Hollinger's president, yesterday described Southam as an
'under-valued asset'.
Hollinger owned about 5 per cent of the company in the 1980s, but sold the
holding three years ago at about double the current market price. 'We still
valued it as a serious asset, and as an asset we wanted,' Mr Radler said.
Hollinger paid CDollars 18.10 for each of Torstar's 14.3m Southam shares. A
Southam official said yesterday that the remaining shares were widely held,
with no single block of more than about 5 per cent.
The deal is expected to be finalised by the end of the year. Mr Radler said
the purchase would be financed through 'normal lines of credit'.
Southam owns 18 daily newspapers, with a combined circulation of 1.5m. They
include the main English-language papers in Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa.
Southam also publishes trade magazines and owns a leading Canadian bookstore
chain.
The company has been in considerable turmoil lately as a new management team
has sought to bring down costs and focus on core newspaper business. Southam
posted a CDollars 186m loss in the first nine months of this year, the bulk
of it stemming from a commercial printing division which has since been
sold.
Mr Black had been searching for a North American flagship to augment the
three chains of small, mostly rural newspapers which Hollinger presently
owns. He recently withdrew an offer to buy the bankrupt New York Daily News,
which is now in the process of being sold to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman,
publisher of US News &amp; World Report.
Hollinger also has a stake, through the Telegraph, in Fairfax, Australia's
second biggest publishing group, and owns the Jerusalem Post

FOKUS BANK, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday reported a sharp decline
in nine-month net losses to NKr405.3m (Dollars 62.7m) from NKr1.49bn last
year, but warned it has been forced to seek a further injection of state
capital.
Fokus said its capital adequacy at end-September was 4.5 per cent of
risk-weighted assets. It needs the extra capital in order to meet a
regulation target of 8 per cent by the end of the year.
Both Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the two biggest banks, last week
said they had entered discussions with the state-backed bank insurance fund
to obtain fresh capital. Last year the three troubled banks fell under the
control of the state after experiencing successive losses for a number of
years. As a result the state was forced to inject more than NKr20bn into the
Norwegian bank sector.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the French truck maker, is expected
shortly to announce up to 2,500 job losses, nearly 15 per cent of the
workforce, according to a letter from trade unions to the government owner.
RVI is heading for around a FFr1bn (Dollars 185m) loss this year, a sharp
turnround from the FFr23m net profit it made in 1991, says the letter from
the CFE-CGC white collar union, which appeals to the ministers of labour and
industry for other solutions to the problem.
The exact size and timing of the job losses, the latest indication of the
depth of recession in the world truck industry, will be announced by RVI
management in the next few weeks, possibly at the next staff council on
November 16.
An RVI official yesterday confirmed that job losses were on the way, in
response to a steep decline in orders. French truck sales alone are expected
to fall by 25 per cent this year, according to the union letter. RVI, which
announced just over 1,000 job losses last year, has already introduced
temporary lay-offs, averaging seven days per month.
But these are inadequate in the absence of any signs of recovery in sales,
said the official. If the latest job losses are confirmed, RVI will have
lost 30 per cent of its workforce over the past two years.
This news will be all the more unwelcome to the government, which must vet
the plans, at a time when unemployment continues to rise, up 1 per cent to
2.9m in September, or 10.3 per cent of the workforce.
Until recently, the public sector has been able to shed jobs with little
union opposition, but feelings have begun to heat up, with the recent
announcement of a 24-hour strike by Air France employees, in protest against
1,500 job losses at the state airline.

<TEXT>
SWEDEN's Saab Automobile said yesterday it would cut 2,000 jobs in a bid to
improve productivity and restore profits to its operations. The aim is to
achieve cost savings of SKr2bn (Dollars 335m).
The worst-hit facility will be the group's main Trollhatten plant, where
1,650 jobs, or more than 20 per cent of the workforce, will be cut. A
further 330 jobs will be shed at the company's Gothenburg and Sodertalje
operations.
Saab, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US,
said it had been forced to take action because of the poor sales outlook and
the losses it continued to sustain.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who took over as chief executive in September,
said: 'We are losing more than one million dollars a day. These actions are
necessary to safeguard Saab's future.'
The group said it made a loss of SKr1.34bn in the first nine months, 36 per
cent less than the SKr2.11bn deficit in the same 1991 period. But the loss
worsened in the third quarter to SKr541m from SKr522m a year ago, and the
full year result is expected to be in line with the SKr2.2bn loss sustained
last year.
Sales in the first nine months were higher at 66,800 units, compared with
64,700, but the forecast for the full year is unchanged at 87,500. Next year
output is expected to total just 80,000 units.

strategic flaw

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINOLTA, the Japanese camera maker, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of
Y4.98bn (Dollars 40m) for the six months ended September, reflecting the
vulnerability of leading Japanese companies with a past strategy of high
quality but low profitability.
The company's interim statement painted a bleak picture. After reporting
taxable losses of Y2bn in the same period last year, cash reserves have
fallen and short-term borrowings have increased, while the value of
securities holdings was eroded by the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock
market.
Sales for the first half were down 11.9 per cent to Y99.5bn, as Minolta
faced intense competition in the domestic camera market and struggled to
fulfil its aim of shifting the sales emphasis to office equipment such as
copiers and word processors.
Camera sales were down 22 per cent during the period, with export earnings
down 26 per cent. A restructuring plan intends to reduce the reliance on
export earnings by increasing sales in the home market, but domestic sales
were also 13 per cent lower.
Office equipment sales were down by just over 3 per cent, and sales in the
domestic market rose only marginally from Y11.2bn to Y11.9bn.
The company's cash reserves fell from Y14.5bn at end March to Y8.9bn, while
inventories rose from Y49.7bn to Y57bn over the past year.

The bank, which serves the Esbjerg area of west Jutland, experienced a run

This is the first time since 1984 that the Danish central bank and other

BARRING SLIPS, Morgan Crucible, the materials technology group, is to bring

Morgan is about to pay Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.48m) to buy assets from

Frenchtown will add technology and market position to the group's US

Stackpole purchase is destined to be less than perfectly understood.
Such has been the proliferation of deals, that even diligent investors can
be forgiven for losing sight of what exactly Morgan makes and what it is
going to do next.
Mr Bruce Farmer, the gritty chief executive from Birmingham with a doctorate
in material science, is the first to accept that Morgan Crucible is not the
best understood company.
And yet, the formula - exploitation of the properties of materials in new
markets and new products - has given Morgan a manufacturing position in 37
countries, sales in 83 more and one of the UK's more enviable currency
profiles since the recent devaluation of sterling.
With a market capitalisation of Pounds 575m and profits - if not earnings -
still growing, Morgan is also within sight of the FT-SE 100 Index.
Part of Morgan's problem is that terms like 'materials technology' and
'application engineers' do little to clear the fog.
The Pounds 346m-plus spent on acquisitions has, furthermore, tended to
obscure where earnings growth has been generated. Yet these acquisitions
have put Morgan into a dominant position in a number of its markets.
Following a period of self-imposed abstinence from paper-driven acquisition
 -Mr Farmer had a run in with the City last year after two rights issues in
10 months - Morgan's four divisions currently look like this:
More than half Morgan's sales come from ceramics - the group of materials
which include oxides of metals and demonstrate great compressive strength
and hardness, or resistance to high temperatures and corrosion. Thermal
ceramics, the largest division, has more than 50 per cent of the world
ceramic fibre market, plus a large slice of the market for heat resistant
bricks used in crucibles and refractories.
Its traditional industrial markets have, not surprisingly, been mauled by
the general economic downturn as furnace utilisation has fallen. Operating
profits for the full year are expected to fall 9 per cent to Pounds 21.5m
from sales of Pounds 205m, according to Nikko Europe.
But Morgan has managed to limit this fall, by comparison with other
producers of refactories, largely through the introduction of new
applications. Ceramic fibre is now being used as insulation in the
construction industry, and has already been installed in roofs at
EuroDisney.
The most interesting development, however, is car safety air-bags - which
inflate between driver or passenger and dashboard after a controlled
explosion. Morgan makes the heat filters that contain the heat of the
explosion. Thermal Ceramics estimates this market will be worth Dollars 25m
to it in the US by 1996.
The company is already making heat shields that cradle catalytic converters
and is developing ceramic fibre-reinforced metal for stronger, lighter
pistons. 'This company has tended to be in heat treatment in process
industries,' says Mr Farmer. 'Suddenly it will find itself in the auto
industry in a big way.'
Technical ceramics offers perhaps the best future growth prospects. The
group is developing the bio-medical market with pacemaker components and
artificial hip joints and new applications in power generation.
However, growth from new products is currently almost offset by the
slow-down in the aerospace and white consumer goods markets and demand for
traditional products like electrical insulators.
Operating profits are likely, however, to increase 43 per cent to Pounds
16.5m on sales of Pounds 165m as a result of the Pounds 35m spent last year
on two acquisitions - Dulmison in Australia and Wesgo from GTE Products.
Without these acquisitions, profits would have fallen by 6 per cent. Again,
Mr Farmer argues that compared with competitors like Hoechst in Germany,
Morgan's decline has been minimal.
Speciality materials and technologies produces a vast array of industrial
lubricants and other aids for manufacturing processes. Newer products
include solder flux removers and cleaning swabs for the computer and
electronic industries, and non-slip epoxy deck coatings for oil rigs and
naval vessels.
Recession in the defence markets and in the nuclear industry has held the
division back. It has also suffered from low margins at Holt Lloyd, the car
care business. Morgan is talking with a potential buyer of this business.
Operating profits are, nevertheless, expected to increase by 8 per cent this
year to Pounds 20m largely as a result of growth in new products.
The carbon division's dominant world position in the manufacture of carbon
brushes for electrical motors has been built through a network of plants
internationally. The business has low margins but very high volumes - the
Morganite plant in North Carolina, for example, last year made 175m brushes
and 40m electrical commutators.
Demand for smaller horse power and consumer motors has held up, partly
because of a dramatic increase in the number of motors that go into any one
automobile. And production of commutators has taken off.
Recession has, however, badly hit the company in larger brushes for railroad
and traction uses. In commutators, the group is planning a near-doubling of
US capacity to take on a troubled private producer. 'This is one example
where organic growth is better than acquisition,' says Mr Farmer.
Operating profits are likely to fall 9 per cent to Pounds 16m this year on
sales marginally ahead at Pounds 120m. By comparison, Le Carbone-Lorraine, a
subsidiary of Pechiney, incurred a loss at its last half-year and Mr Farmer
believes Morgan has been gaining market share.
Morgan divisional breakdown does not immediately suggest a bullish outlook
for earnings.
But for an industrial company, Morgan has shown a surprising resilience
which Mr Farmer puts down to geographical and product diversification. Much
of this is the result of little understood and little noticed acquisitions
which can incrementally improve market share, or capacity utilisation or
competitive position.
What is more, in the short term investors do not need to look to recovery in
Morgan's markets because of sterling's devaluation.
'We are the reverse of GM - what is good for the UK is bad for Morgan
Crucible,' Mr Farmer says.
Not only will devaluation boost Morgan's translated overseas profits it will
also increase competitive edge of Morgan's British production, much of which
is exported.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Prowting shares hit by warning of dividend
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Prowting, the Middlesex-based builder, yesterday fell from 82p to
71p after the company warned that it planned to cut its final dividend by
almost half.
The company, which builds 'everywhere south of Birmingham', announced that
it had made only Pounds 119,000 pre-tax profit during the six months to
end-August, compared with profits of Pounds 3m last time.
A Pounds 600,000 increase in interest charges to Pounds 2.4m was only part
of the reason for the setback.
House sales rose during the half from 131 to 154 units but margins were
under severe pressure with average prices falling from Pounds 103,00 to
Pounds 86,000.
Losses per share of 0.3p compared with earnings last time of 2.7p.
Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, said the company was maintaining the
interim dividend at 1.7p. It was thought prudent, however, given continuing
difficulties in the housing market to give shareholders early warning that
it proposed cutting the final from 3.3p to 1.7p, reducing the total for the
year to 3.4p (5p).
Mr Roydon was more optimistic, however, that a recovery in the housing
market might get underway in the New Year, led by lower interest rates
which, he said, could fall to 6 per cent.
Most ingredients for a recovery were in place, particularly if the
government announced plans to allow local authorities to buy repossessed
homes for rent, said Mr Roydon.
This would not help the group in the current financial year when it was
expected that even the proposed reduced final dividend would have to be
financed out of reserves.
Borrowings, which peaked in the spring at Pounds 42m, have since fallen to
Pounds 33.5m.
Gearing, at 59 per cent at the end of last year, is expected to fall to
about 50 per cent by the year end.
COMMENT
Prowting's strength is its land bank of 5,300 plots with planning permission
or zoned for housing, equivalent to more than 15 years' supply at current
production rates. The average plot cost of Pounds 12,700 is one of the
lowest in the sector. This should stand the group in good stead when the
housing market ultimately recovers. However, there are less heavily borrowed
builders with similar plot costs. Trading, however, remains difficult. The
group will do well to break-even this year and recovery, when it occurs, is
likely to be slow. A yield of almost 6.5 per cent may not be enough to
attract buyers for this tightly-held stock.

</HEADLINE>

AN 'unprecedentedly low' level of demand from the construction industry was
cited as the principal cause of a fall into losses at BMSS in the six months
to July 31.
The USM-quoted timber and building materials merchant reported a pre-tax
deficit of Pounds 16,000, against a profit of Pounds 254,000 last time.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 8.56m to Pounds 8.28m. Losses per share came

In view of the uncertain climate, the directors said, it was considered
advisable to conserve the company's resources. In light of this it had
decided to pass the interim dividend - 2p was paid last time.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rentokil takes four interests in Pounds 10m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL, the environmental services and property care group, has made four
acquisitions - one in the US and three in the UK - for about Pounds 10m.
The biggest purchase is Creative Planting, a tropical plants services
company, that supplies plants to offices covering the Washington DC and
Maryland area.
The initial consideration is Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) with a further
Dollars 14m payable depending on profit levels for 1992 and 1993.
In the year to June 1992, Creative Planting returned made profits of Dollars
1.4m on turnover of Dollars 8.7m and should boost turnover of Rentokil's
existing US operations to about Dollars 60m.
Mr Clive Thompson, chairman, said the acquisition made Rentokil 'by far the
major player' in Washington, adding he hopes to 'further develop our
position' there.
The other three acquisitions are: Argyll Services for Pounds 750,000. Part
of Rowland Compliance Testing for Pounds 150,000 and Wessex Hygiene Services
for Pounds 110,000.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys seeks buys on 13% rise -
Second-half plastics recovery and investment benefits improve profits as
sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARDLE STOREYS, the cash-rich plastic fabrics and safety equipment company,
yesterday labelled 1993 the 'year of acquisitions' as it reported a 13 per
cent advance in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.2m.
Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said the company was in talks on several
potential purchases, including one in the US where it has only a small
presence.
Wardle, which finished the year with net cash of Pounds 34m, was aiming to
make several smaller purchases in each of its main businesses, as opposed to
a single large one, he said.
The pre-tax advance was struck on sales 2 per cent lower at Pounds 76.6m for
the 12 months to August 31. Mr Taylor said the increase had been due to a
recovery in the plastic fabrics business during the second half, and the
efficiency benefits of an ongoing investment programme.
The increase had been achieved in spite of 'the bizarre events which
surround us', he said. A well-known sceptic when it comes to politicians, Mr
Taylor was scathing about the current direction of UK economic policy. 'They
are a pack of wallies,' he said. 'Economic policy can best be described as a
series of successive reactions to a series of successive emergencies.'
He admitted, however, that the devaluation of sterling was likely to benefit
Wardle in the medium term.
Strongest performance came from the safety and survival equipment division,
which includes products such as parachutes and life rafts. Operating profits
rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 3.8m on sales 7 per cent higher at Pounds 26m.
However, the inflatables operation - especially in the UK - was proving
disappointing. 'That is the only thing which is causing us to exercise a
note of caution,' Mr Taylor said.
Technical products, including plastic fabrics for use in the automotive and
baby buggy markets, increased profits by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 2.1m, on a
Pounds 3.3m drop in sales to Pounds 50.6m.
The final dividend is maintained at 12p for a total of 16p (16p). Earnings
per share increased by 10 per cent to 25p.
COMMENT
Whatever one thinks of Brian Taylor's politics - or lack of them - these
commendable results have been achieved in a trying environment. The
challenge now will be to find an earnings-enhancing acquisition. Mr Taylor's
last two significant attempts - hostile bids for Chamberlain Phipps and
Armstrong Equipment - left his reputation as a dealmaker bruised and
battered. It would appear the lesson has been learnt, and he is looking at
friendlier deals. The possible move into the US looks interesting, given the
potential for economic recovery and the company's relatively low exposure
there. Forecasts of Pounds 10m, with a p/e of about 15, make the shares look
fully valued in the short-term but an acquisition could make a world of
difference. However, Wardle's exposure to the automotive market makes it a
good candidate for recovery in the medium-term.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Further purchases lift Tomkins' stake in
RHM to 22.11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate offering Pounds 935m for Ranks Hovis
McDougall in an agreed bid, yesterday bought a further 36.26m shares in the
milling, baking and grocery products group, taking its stake to 22.11 per
cent.
It also posted its offer document to RHM shareholders.
The document showed that Mr Stanley Metcalfe, RHM chairman, was given a new
five year contract in February this year at an annual salary of Pounds
347,000. His remuneration was shown in the previous year's accounts at
Pounds 330,438.
The new contract was agreed at a time when RHM was warning that its profits
would fall.
If Tomkins' bid succeeds Mr Metcalfe will stay with the group as a
consultant for three months. If the remaining four years of his contract had
to be bought out, it could cost Tomkins approaching Pounds 1.4m.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, said no discussions on
compensation payments had taken place yet. He said he was busy meeting RHM
and Tomkins shareholders explaining the deal. The reaction he had received
was positive, he said.
With a recommendation for Tomkins' offer and a 22 per cent stake built up,
the chances of another bidder entering the contest appears unlikely.
Observers suggest that Tomkins' bid could win support from holders of over
50 per cent of RHM's shares by the first closing date, set at December 7.
Tomkins must first win approval from its own shareholders, and has called a
special meeting on December 4 to discuss the bid and the second instalment
of the Pounds 653m rights issue Tomkins is making to help finance it.
The share purchases yesterday were mostly at 260p, the value of the cash
offer Tomkins is making for RHM, or at 269.54p, which includes the 9.54p
dividend RHM shareholders are to receive.
Tomkins has spent over Pounds 200m buying 78.65m RHM shares and has almost
reached the limit of the share purchases it can make under rules which stop
a bidder spending more than the equivalent of a quarter of its own net asset
value on buying shares in its target.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: UB takes control of Wiltshire Brewery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UB Group, India's largest brewer and distillery group, has taken management
control of The Wiltshire Brewery which it plans to develop into a
significant UK drinks company.
Wiltshire, which brews only about 3,000 barrels a year of beers like Old
Grumble and Stonehenge, has paid Pounds 6.7m to expand its estate from 40 to
77 pubs after UB's refinancing.
Mr Vijay Mallya, UB chairman, will become executive chairman of Wiltshire
and his family will take a 15.5 per cent interest in the group.
'It is is a unique opportunity to get into distribution of spirit and beer
products in the UK,' said Mr Mallya. 'UB has long talked about the
globalisation of its interests in India.'
As part of the deal, Bass, the UK brewery group, takes an 8.6 per cent stake
through conversion of Pounds 700,000 of debt. It has also extended what
Wiltshire calls a favourable new supply agreement.
The new pubs are being financed partly through a Pounds 4.77m subscription
of new shares, subject to clawback for existing Wiltshire shareholders, and
a share placing with Mr Mallya and UB.
Of the acquired pubs, 28 come from a portfolio of foreclosed properties held
by Allied Irish Bank Properties while two are being sold by Bank of Ireland
Properties. Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance is advising Wiltshire.
UB currently has a limited presence in the UK, distributing Kingfisher lager
through a joint venture with Shepherd Neame.
Wiltshire will move its brewing operations from sites in Stourbridge and
Tisbury and consolidate them in a premises leased from UB group near its UK
headquarters in Buckingham. Consideration for this lease is being satisfied
by 1.8m shares.
Mr Mallya said he plans to increase the tenanted estate to more than 100
pubs within six months.
'When UB started in India it was one brewery, today it has 10; it was one
distillery and now it has 26,' said Mr Mallya. 'The focus is not just
distribution, it is the development of a drinks business.'
UB is India's seventh largest corporate conglomerate.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Henderson falls 26% to Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Administration, the UK fund management group, reported a 26 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.5m for the six months to September
30 against Pounds 8.8m.
The fall reflected a further shrinkage in assets under management, a drop in
interest income and a slight increase in operating margins.
The interim dividend is maintained at 12.5p.
The company said the outlook for the second half of the year was
'unpredictable' but added that longer term prospects remained good.
Mr Jeremy Edwards, managing director, said the company was close to
finalising terms for its planned acquisition of Touche Remnant, the
investment trust managers, from Societe Generale, the French bank.
Mr Edwards said the entire acquisition is to be financed from cash, saying
talks are underway to integrate the staff of the two firms.
Henderson is reported to be paying close to Pounds 40m for Touche Remnant,
to be offset by about Pounds 15m cash on Touche Remnant's balance sheet.
Henderson will consider merging some of its smaller unit trusts with Touche
Remnant's after the purchase and merger of some support operations.
Assets under management to September 30 eased to Pounds 7.28bn from Pounds
7.35bn at the end of March 1992, reflecting lower investment returns and the
loss of two pension fund clients, Mr Edwards said.
However, he said the loss of pension fund clients over the past few years
had almost ground to a halt. While investment performance for the first two
quarters of 1992 had been below average, investment returns for the third
quarter had been sufficient to raise performance above the market median.
Improved investment performance, he added, should enable the firm to resume
attracting pension fund clients.

EUROLEC, the London-based European joint-venture of General Electric of the
US and Britain's GEC, is to acquire Agut, a family-owned electrical control
products manufacturer based in Tarrasa-Barcelona, Spain.
Agut, which makes contractors, power electronics and electrical relays used
for electricity distribution, has annual sales of more than Dollars 40m
(Pounds 26m). Terms of the agreement, which is expected to be completed by
the year end, were not disclosed.
The acquisition is designed to strengthen Eurolec's product and technology
portfolio in the global market for electrical control products. It will also
enhance the joint venture's market position in Spain.
Mr Alan Clark, managing director, said the acquisition represented 'a
significant step in Eurolec's strategy of offering customers a broad range
of world-class products that control and distribute power.'
Eurolec, formed in 1989, has annual sales of about Dollars 500m and
operating units in France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Betterware leaps to Pounds 6.3m in first
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE UK shoppers remain tight-fisted in the high street, Betterware has
discovered a way to unlock spending from the home.
The door-to-door distributor of household goods more than doubled pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.81m to Pounds 6.3m, on turnover of Pounds 29.4m, in
the 28 weeks to September 12.
Sales in the home shopping division went up Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 23m, with
operating profit showing a sharp improvement to Pounds 5.85m.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the group was filling a gap left by
the hardware shops that had disappeared over recent years. Although
superstores offered household goods, the items tended to get lost on their
shelves.
Betterware increased its street-by-street penetration, helped by a
sophisticated computerised mapping system, as its army of self-employed
sales people grew from 7,000 to 9,000.
Mr Cohen, whose family owns 60 per cent of the company, said the average
amount each customer spent at a time had increased from Pounds 7 to more
than Pounds 8, reversing a downward trend from Pounds 9 three years ago. He
attributed this to a larger catalogue that improved presentation of the 411
products.
With fixed costs kept down - the company only employs 180 people directly
and suppliers hold most of the stock - a good proportion of additional
turnover filtered down to the bottom line. Economies of scale also assisted
as the print run for catalogues rose from 9m to 13m and buying power
improved for raw materials.
Its recently acquired French operation, accounting for less than 2 per cent
of sales, was expected to move into profit in the second half.
The group nearly doubled net cash to Pounds 8.8m during the half-year, with
the help of a deferred payment for land. Interest received trebled to Pounds
301,000. It plans to invest Pounds 9m in a new distribution centre over the
next two years.
Betterware's other division, a miscellany of consumer products manufacture
and coffee shops, suffered from recession, with operating profit sliding
from Pounds 302,000 to Pounds 140,000 on flat sales of Pounds 6.4m.
Earnings per share rose from 1.95p to 4.29p. The interim dividend is
increased from 0.34p to 0.5p.
COMMENT
Betterware's trend-trouncing performance added another 4p to its share
price, driving it to a new high of 172p. Its market value has multiplied
more than six times in the past two years to Pounds 175m. A prospective p/e
of 21, on its broker Smith New Court's full-year prognosis of Pounds 12.5m,
gives the company a well-deserved premium. The momentum built up in the UK
market and first fruits from France lie behind a forecast that profits will
gain another third next year. Looking ahead, Mr Cohen remains eloquent on
the subject of intensifying coverage of the UK, but diminishing returns must
set in. Then success in transferring the formula abroad will be crucial and
the jury has not even left the court on that one. With Betterware sporting a
Cadburyesque interim statement, complete with cash flow statement and
accountants' review, it is all dressed up to face scrutiny from retail
analysts as it graduates from small company status. Potential buyers should
wait to see what a fresh set of critics make of it.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Renold returns to black with Pounds 0.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENOLD, the chain and gear maker, yesterday reported a return to profit at
the interim stage, but said trading conditions remained tough.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 800,000 for the six months to October 3,
compared to losses of Pounds 1.3m last time.
Mr John Allan, finance director, said the improvement was due to cost and
efficiency gains in the last two years. Employee numbers have been cut by
about 20 per cent to 2,900, and a capital expenditure programme launched in
1989 is largely complete.
Turnover fell 3 per cent to Pounds 58.4m, although Mr Allan said order
levels for the year to September had improved.
The chain division was helped by strong automotive and transmission chain
sales. Gear products were weak, despite new product launches.
UK orders improved, mainly in the chain division. The company expects volume
and margin improvements for UK exports following sterling's fall in value.
But Germany continued to weaken.
Trading profits were Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 400,000 loss). Interest costs were
slightly higher at Pounds 1m (Pounds 900,000) after net borrowings increased
Pounds 2m to Pounds 14.7m, giving gearing of 28 per cent.
Capital expenditure, which fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 5m last year,
was expected to fall further to Pounds 3m this year.
Earnings per share were 0.7p (losses of 2.6p).

REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Harmony Leisure predicted they would take control of
the loss-making pubs and restaurants group following a heated annual meeting
yesterday.
The dissidents said their campaign to oust Harmony's executive directors was
boosted when two companies with substantial shareholdings expressed dismay
at the managing director's refusal to make a statement on the group's
performance.
Both Queens Moat, the hotel group which has a 14.5 per cent stake, and
Southend Property Holdings which owns 4 per cent, asked Mr Stanley Lever,
Harmony managing director, to make a statement on the company's prospects.
He refused.
The two companies urged the board to release its interim figures ahead of
the November 26 extraordinary meeting requisitioned by the the rebels.
Queen's Moat expressed concern that the accounts had been qualified because
Barclays, Harmony's bankers, made it a condition of its facilities that Mr
Lever remained on the board and that borrowings were cut.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Continental agrees Air Canada bid

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier which has been operating
under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since late-1990, yesterday
accepted a Dollars 450m (Pounds 290.3m) investment proposal from Air Canada,
the larger of the two main Canadian carriers.
The deal is another step in the trend towards global airlines alliances and
follows a long bidding process. It will be implemented when Continental's
reorganisation plan comes into effect and the carrier moves out of
bankruptcy, probably in early 1993.
The deal promises a welcome cash injection for Continental. Meanwhile, Air
Canada has been manoeuvring for 18 months to become an emerging global
airline, but has been dogged by a worsening financial performance as the
Canadian recession has deepened.
Air Canada, with a Texan investment partnership called Air Partners, plans
to invest Dollars 450m. Of this, Dollars 110m will buy common stock in the
carrier, shared between the Canadian carrier and the partnership. Air Canada
will also buy Dollars 30m of non-voting preferred stock.
Air Canada will also acquire Dollars 150m of debt securities backed by
unencumbered assets of the US airline, while Air Partners will buy and then
place out Dollars 160m of debt securities secured by assets of Continental
Micronesia, a Continental affiliate.
Air Canada will hold 27.5 per cent of the equity in the reorganised airline,
and 24 per cent of the voting stock. Air Partners - headed by Mr David
Bonderman and Mr James Coulter, who both have links with the billionaire
Texan financier, Mr Robert Bass - will have a similar equity stake but 41
per cent of the votes.
A further 35.6 per cent of the equity will go to Continental's unsecured
creditors, in return for forgiving certain claims.
The restructured US airline will have 18 board members - six Air Partners
appointees, six from Air Canada, three representing unsecured creditors, two
independents and one from management. The deal requires regulatory approval,
but yesterday Air Partners said the bidders had attempted to comply with US
caps on foreign ownership of airlines - which stand at 25 per cent of the
voting rights and up to 49 per cent of the equity.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Hanson threatens to sue Costain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the large Anglo-US conglomerate, last night threatened to sue
Costain after the UK construction group announced it was accepting a higher
offer for its profitable Australian coal mining business.
Costain said Altus Finance, part of Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned
bank, had agreed to pay USDollars 245m (Pounds 158m) for the coal mining
business and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property interests.
Costain had agreed to sell only the New South Wales coal-mining operation
for USDollars 200m to Peabody Coal, a Hanson subsidiary. Mr Irl Engelhardt,
president of Peabody, the world's second largest private coal producer,
said: 'We are consulting our legal advisers on this. Peabody has acted in
good faith and we have an enforceable contract.'
It is the second time in less than two weeks Hanson has been trumped. The
group last week pulled out of its Pounds 790m offer for Ranks Hovis
McDougall after Tomkins, a rival British conglomerate, bid Pounds 935m for
the UK milling, baking and grocery products group.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive of the British construction group,
yesterday denied the company had broken the terms of the agreement with
Peabody announced three weeks ago. He said: 'Under the sale agreement we
were permitted to consider a subsequent unsolicited offer, if this was
considered by our legal advisers to be in the best interest of our
shareholders. We can understand Hanson's disappointment but we have a duty
to look after our shareholders first.'
Hanson claims the Altus offer resulted from talks begun before the Peabody
deal was announced. Altus will take over borrowings of ADollars 120m (Pounds
54m) making the deal worth more than Pounds 200m to Costain which needs to
reduce its borrowings.
Costain said the offer, after expenses, was worth Pounds 26m more than the
offer from Peabody. Part of the increase was due to a better offer for its
coal mines.
Altus, which controls a Pounds 1.6bn portfolio of financial and industrial
holdings, has been seeking to diversify away from financial investments. It
is 67 per cent owned by Credit Lyonnais and 32 per cent by Thomson-CSF, the
French state defence group.

FT  10 NOV 92 / GPA shelves planned preference issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group has shelved its Dollars 350m (Pounds 225.80m) convertible
preference share issue which it planned to complete by the end of the year,
writes Roland Rudd.
Nomura International, the Japanese investment house working on the
convertible, has told shareholders that GPA's failure to raise Dollars 752m
from Alps2 (the securitisation of aircraft leases) means the convertible can
no longer go ahead.
One of GPA's biggest shareholders said: 'We have been told that the
convertible has been aborted. I do not believe the group will try again to
persuade shareholders to raise additional finance.'
Another investor said: 'Shareholders are not willing to take part in any
refinancing of the group while there is a chance than the group could be in
breach of its covenants.'
Nomura had hoped that 65 per cent of GPA's shareholders would make
irrevocable commitments to take about two-thirds of the new shares by
Wednesday.
It planned to place the remaining one-third of the shares with new investors
over the next week in order to launch the new share issue on November 20.
However, one of GPA's financial advisers said: 'The convertible was based on
a whole range of business assumptions which are no longer viable.' Nomura
would find it impossible to go back to share-holders with the same plan, he
added.
Nomura has 1.75m GPA shares, most of which it bought at an average of
Dollars 20 a share compared with the Dollars 8 conversion price of the
shelved convertible.
Although the investment bank is not involved in advising GPA in its talks
with its banks, it hopes to continue its relationship with the group.
GPA has written to its investors detailing its current financial situation.
A GPA executive said yesterday the group took heart from its core leasing
business which continued to perform will under Mr Phil Bolger, deputy chief
executive of GPA leasing.

FT  10 NOV 92 / BAA rises 46% and increases dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised UK airport group, yesterday shrugged off the recession
by reporting a 46 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 220m
and a 9 per cent rise in its interim dividend to 6.25p a share.
The performance reflected a 30 per cent rise in productivity, lower property
write-downs and restructuring costs, and a recovery in passenger traffic
after the Gulf war slump last year.
The productivity improvement followed a 20 per cent cut in the workforce in
the past financial year from 10,733 to 8,730.
Exceptional charges covering property write-downs and staff reorganisation
fell to Pounds 11.5m compared with Pounds 54.5m a year ago. Excluding these
charges, pre-tax profits rose 12.6 per cent to Pounds 232m. Group revenues
rose 5 per cent to Pounds 541m.
Although passenger numbers increased 11 per cent in the first half,
passenger growth for the year to the end of March 1993 was expected to be
between 6 per cent and 8 per cent. Sir John Egan, chief executive, said this
reflected continuing recession in the UK and other industrialised countries
and the fact that the Gulf war recovery had been absorbed by the traffic
figures.
In spite of the 11 per cent rise in passengers, income from landing fees
rose only 3 per cent in the first half to Pounds 246m because of tougher
regulatory pricing imposed last year by the Civil Aviation Authority. But
Sir John said BAA managed to cut debt by Pounds 78m and for the first time
since privatisation it was in a positive cash-flow position.
Traffic at Heathrow, the group's biggest airport, grew nearly 11 per cent
largely as a result of increasing numbers of passengers using Heathrow to
transfer between flights. Transfer passengers accounted for a third of the
growth in passenger numbers during the first half. Sir John said the
transfer market had become 'the frontline in the competitive battle between
Europe's major airports'.
Although commercial income rose 7 per cent to Pounds 163m in the first half,
passengers were spending on average about 3 per cent less than last year,
largely due to recession, more transfer passengers with less opportunity to
shop, and the weakness of the US dollar this summer.

FT  10 NOV 92 / ICI demerger is on course for 1993, confirms chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DENYS Henderson, chair-man of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday
confirmed that the organisational split of the group's pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and specialities businesses into a separate company was on
track. He said the new company would be fully formed as a subsidiary of ICI
by January 1, 1993.
A final decision to go ahead with the demerger of the group into two
separately quoted companies would be made at the February meeting of the ICI
board, said Sir Denys.
The board would look at the financial position of the whole company and
forecasts for the group's performance next year.
Sir Denys, speaking in Taiwan where ICI was opening a Pounds 150m facility,
declined to comment on whether ICI would maintain its full-year dividend.
The board would also consider the state of the stock market to establish
whether it would be possible to issue fresh shares in the bioscience
company, he said.
Analysts believe most of ICI's liabilities would be given to the bioscience
group, freeing the bulk chemicals operations from debt. The bioscience
businesses would then issue shares to clear their debt and raise cash for
possible acquisitions.
Sir Denys warned that the pharmaceutical division's operating profits next
year would be flat. The division generated trading profits of Pounds 538m
last year, equivalent to 52 per cent of ICI's total pre-tax profit on 12 per
cent of group sales. Next year agrochemicals would improve on poor
performance during 1992, he added. 'There's a lot of money looking for
quality stocks,' he said. 'As a company, the bioscience business should be
quite attractive - in fact, that is British under-statement, they should be
very attractive.'
The bioscience company, which had previously been referred to as ICI
Bioscience, would be renamed to create a new identity, said Sir Denys.
Details of the progress of the demerger process will be given on November
18.
Sir Denys denied that advanced corporation tax would prove a stumbling block
to the demerger. ICI did not face an unrelieved ACT problem yet, although at
some stage it would happen because the group generates more than 80 per cent
of its turnover outside the UK.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Flying into thin air as debt rises: The troubled leasing
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group's recent failure to raise Dollars 752m (Pounds 485m) from the sale
of bonds backed by 18 aircraft leases triggered the current talks with its
banks over rescheduling its borrowing arrangements.
The aborted securitisation of aircraft leases has unravelled the financial
strategy that the group put together with its shareholders, lenders and
aircraft suppliers in the aftermath of its shelved Dollars 800m flotation in
June.
Its debt has risen significantly since it issued its prospectus for its
failed flotation when it had borrowings of more than Dollars 3bn. They have
now risen to around Dollars 5bn.
While GPA appears able to pay its interest on its debt for the foreseeable
future, an analysis of its accounts shows it may face difficulties in paying
back principal on the debt from cash flow.
The group reported Dollars 285m in net cash flow from leases - after the
deduction of interest - in 1992. In other words, these were the funds
generated last year to meet other obligations, such as debt repayment.
GPA's latest accounts says that Dollars 451m comes up for repayment in the
current year, which ends on March 31 1993, and that a further Dollars 654m
is due in the following year.
It will have difficulty making these payments, unless there is a sharp
increase in net cash flow from leases, which the company says is unlikely.
The securitisation of aircraft leases would, however, have helped in making
these debt payments.
It would also have boosted shareholders' confidence and therefore increased
the chances of the company raising a further Dollars 350m from a preference
share issue. But this issue has now been shelved, and with it the group's
hopes of a Luxembourg public listing.
Its lending banks - which include National Westminster, Citicorp of the US
and 26 Japanese banks - are aware that in the absence of new liquidity,
either from the securitisation of aircraft or from tapping existing
shareholders for new funds, the group will need to reschedule some of its
debt payments for 1993.
A further problem facing the group is that it has signed contracts with
aircraft manufacturers to buy 308 aircraft by the year 2000 at a cost of
Dollars 11.9bn and it has the option to buy a further 200 for Dollars 9.1bn.
These orders represent 48 per cent of all orders and options placed by
aircraft leasing companies. The Los Angeles-based International Lease
Finance Corporation (ILFC), owned since 1990 by the American insurer AIG, is
second with 24 per cent.
GPA recently persuaded the manufacturers to defer delivery of Dollars 5bn of
these aircraft. However, this agreement was conditional on the success of
the preference share issue.
That tentative agreement will now have to be renegotiated.
GPA has paid Dollars 954.1m in pre-delivery payments, with Boeing holding 37
per cent of the payments, Airbus 29 per cent and McDonnell Douglas 26 per
cent. Under the current contracts, GPA is committed to spend Dollars 4.7bn
by the end of 1993 on the purchase of 146 aircraft.
A report by the Wall Street firm MJ Whitman, which specialises in debt
trading, says that banks may be reluctant to provide the funds to meet these
commitments.
The report, called GPA Group PLC: Flying in Thin Air, says: 'Barring a
radical change in the global aviation market, we believe GPA will have great
difficulty placing most of these new planes (on leases with airlines) in
advance of the order dates, yet we doubt their lenders will allow access to
credit without leases being in place.'
However, Dr Onno Ruding, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which is one of GPA's
lenders, said: 'The role of a specialised intermediary in the aviation
business . . . remains crucial. There will remain a major need for companies
such as GPA. I think the parties involved are aware of it, particularly the
manufacturers. I don't have to explain it to them . . . There should be
co-operation between suppliers and banks.'
GPA's future will be decided by whether there is co-operation between these
manufacturers and banks in any restructuring of its finances.
But given that there are competing manufacturers and 73 banks - plus other
creditors - reaching agreement will not be easy.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Unyielding equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest rates have so far done nothing to improve the lot of equity
market investors looking for income. Far from sparking a recovery in
high-yielding shares, the sector has fared poorly ever since base rates
started to fall. Kleinwort Benson's index of the 100 largest high-yield
stocks has underperformed the market by 15 per cent since the start of 1991
and shows no sign of turning. A high yield has become synonymous with a
doubtful dividend: 25 companies in the index have cut their pay-out this
year. Little wonder that equity income funds have, unusually, been left
standing by growth funds, even allowing for reinvestment of dividends.
In theory, high-yielding stocks should look relatively more attractive as
nominal interest rates come down. Poor dividend growth across the market as
a whole has created demand for secure, high-yielding stocks from cash-hungry
investment institutions. The combination of high yield and a safe dividend,
then, should be a stronger support than ever. This could be a powerful prop
for water and electricity stocks, for example, despite increasing regulatory
risks.
For the rest of the high-yielders, though, interest rates will have to fall
further. In sectors such as construction and property, where prices are if
anything falling, interest rates of 8 per cent still look punitive in real
terms. And while dividend cover for the market as a whole is running well
below the long-term average of 2.5 times, many high-yielders have to rebuild
cover from less than 1. This could be another strong argument for those
seeking income to increase their investment in gilts.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Ford unions to ballot on action - Workers face compulsory
redundancies for first time in 30 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS AT Ford in the UK are to ballot members on industrial action, as
workers face compulsory redundancies for the first time in almost 30 years
as well as a 40 per cent cut in pay for workers on short time.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU electrical and
engineering union, said yesterday: 'The company seems to be turning the
industrial relations clock back 20 years. We have no option but to ballot
members on action.'
Ford said its Halewood, Merseyside, car assembly plant would move to single
shift working for November in a further bid attempt to cut car production in
line with weak sales.
The threat of industrial action followed Ford's withdrawal of an offer to
maintain its long-standing policy of voluntary redundancies only, in
exchange for a six-month pay freeze from November 24 and a cut in lay-off
pay from 100 per cent of the basic wage to 60 per cent from Jan-uary 1 1993.
The lay-off pay of a skilled day worker earning Pounds 281.93 a week would
go down to Pounds 169.15.
Mr John Hougham, Ford personnel director, indicated that some undertakings
made before the downturn could no longer be sustained.
'We are prisoners of the economic climate. We believe the market is going to
stay totally flat throughout the year and see little sign of an upturn
before 1994.'
The company still hopes to avoid compulsory redundancies but is looking for
about 270 more volunteers before December 11. More than 3,000 workers have
already volunteered to leave this year.
The Dagenham assembly plant is likely to achieve all job losses voluntarily,
but some workers at Halewood are likely to face enforced redundancies,
although all Ford workers can apply for an enhanced severance package.
Ford's move contrasts with the deal negotiated by Rover, the British
Aerospace subsidiary, last month for a two-year 3.6 per cent pay deal and a
guarantee of no compulsory redundancies.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said Ford
workers would be balloted on strike action and action short of a strike. But
he said: 'We certainly won't walk our members into a major problem.'
Unions are angry because they believe UK plants are unfairly bearing the
brunt of job cuts in Ford's European operations, in spite of significant
recent productivity gains in the UK.

FT  10 NOV 92 / HK business group asks Patten to renegotiate reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INFLUENTIAL group of Hong Kong business people yesterday called on Mr
Chris Patten, the governor, to drop his proposals for democratic reform in
the colony and to negotiate fresh plans with China.
The Business and Professionals Federation, a powerful conservative think
tank, said the impasse between London and Beijing must be resolved by
dialogue and consultation.
It is the first heavyweight organisation openly to oppose the governor, who
has found general support among the public. A test of Mr Patten's support in
the local legislature will come tomorrow when it debates his proposals.
Mr Patten's plans for greater democracy in Hong Kong have been rejected by
China. It has said it will not discuss the matter further until the governor
backs down. Beijing has threatened to reverse any changes he introduces
without its agreement when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
Mr Vincent Lo, the business group's chairman, said the federation supported
many of the governor's plans, but 'to run the risk of developing a political
structure which will be dismantled in 4 1/2 years' time is just not
acceptable to us'.
He said that any plans for Hong Kong's political development should be
compatible with the Basic Law, the colony's post-1997 constitution passed by
the Chinese parliament in 1990.
By backing Communist China instead of Mr Patten, the group threatens to
dilute a local mandate for greater democracy in the increasingly strident
war of words between China and Britain over Hong Kong's the future.
Mr Lo, chairman of Shui On, a leading property developer in the colony, is
one of the businessmen tipped to become Hong Kong's first chief executive,
or governor, after China takes over.
He was flanked at the press conference by Sir David Akers-Jones, a former
chief secretary of Hong Kong and now head of the housing authority, and Mr
David Gledhill, a former head of foreign business in the colony.
Many businessmen, long accustomed to considerable leverage over the colonial
government, are wary of the democracy plans due to their heavy investment in
China's increasingly market-oriented southern provinces.
The federation's stance bears a strong resemblance to Beijing's position,
which has said Mr Patten should withdraw his proposals and negotiate on the
same basis that Britain was contemplating in late 1989 and early 1990.
Over the weekend Mr Patten said he was sure the business community 'would
want to avoid seeing a gap opening up between what some businessmen had to
say and what clearly the community wants'.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK public spending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that the government could use proceeds from council house sales to
cover higher infrastructure spending next year is beguiling. In practice,
however, it is easier said than done. Doubling to 50 per cent, as some have
suggested, the proportion of proceeds from new sales which councils can
spend would only release around Pounds 750m. The real prize is the backlog
of unspent proceeds, possibly amounting to as much as Pounds 8bn. This
money, which is supposed to be used to pay down local authority debts,
cannot easily be freed without adding to the public sector borrowing
requirement.
True, the release could count as self-financed local authority spending
under the government's complex definitions. So it would come outside the
crucial Pounds 244.5bn planning total for public spending. But, it would
still count as general government expenditure which counts towards the PSBR.
Moreover there would be a net rise in public debt outstanding despite local
government's large cash balances. Local authorities would have less cash
with which to pay down debt. None of this would appeal to a gilts market
already fretting that next year's PSBR will easily exceed Pounds 40bn.
Worse still for Mr Lamont, the new spending would remain largely in the gift
of local authorities rather than Whitehall. If he wants resources for the
infrastructure, the chancellor might be better advised to dip into the
contingency reserves or find new privatisation receipts. Even then he may
have only a limited amount extra to spend - at least if he really wants to
keep fiscal policy tight enough to allow further substantial interest rate
cuts.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Costain/Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the outcome of the little spat between Costain and Hanson over
Costain's Australian coal interests, both sides look like losers. Hard on
the heels of losing RHM to Tomkins, Hanson could do without the public
relations headache of another deal turning sour. Given Costain's need to
reduce debt, it is hardly in its interest for the whole thing to be bogged
down in the courts. The difference between the two is that Hanson can better
afford the inconvenience.
That Costain needs to sell its prime asset is underlined by how little the
shares have risen since the original deal was announced. Even when the money
comes in, gearing will be about 50 per cent. If the preference shares are
repaid next year and cash flow remains negative, gearing may well rise to
around 70 per cent, even without further asset writedowns. To add to its
woes, much of Costain's debt is denominated in dollars: it will not benefit
from falling UK rates, but will be hurt by the devaluation of sterling when
its hedging runs out.
Meanwhile the company is stuck with an underperforming US coal operation and
its basic UK contracting and construction business. Costain badly needs an
upturn in the UK construction market to revive its fortunes. The Autumn
Statement notwithstanding, that looks as depressingly far away as ever.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Which property company trades at a mere 5 per cent discount to net assets?
Which transport stock yields 2.8 per cent and stands on a forward multiple
of 17 times earnings? The answer in both cases is BAA, which raises the
further question of why this privatised airport operator commands such a
generous UK stock market rating.
One reason is the company's ability to appear defensive and cyclical at the
same time. Both commercial income and traffic charges, after all, are highly
sensitive to economic activity. Another is the benign attitude of the
regulator, certainly relative to other privatised monopolies. Perhaps the
least well appreciated secret of BAA's success, though - illustrated by
yesterday's 46 per cent jump in interim profits - is its close dependence on
British Airways. A striking feature of the first-half results was the sharp
rise in transfer passengers at Heathrow, an achievement largely attributable
to BA's marketing skills in taking away North Atlantic business from the
likes of Lufthansa and Air France. BA's success is just as well, given that
it accounts for almost half the passengers using Heathrow and a fifth of
those passing through Gatwick.
BAA's long-term appeal remains undiminished. But the 3.4 per cent fall in
income per passenger from retailing in the first half and the cautious
forecast of second-half traffic growth may hold back further progress for
now. There may also be some concern that earnings will be hit by an
additional Pounds 20m of depreciation when BAA finally comes to write up the
balance-sheet value of its assets.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Pharmaceutical prices to NHS do not allow for excess
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN GRIFFIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Sonabend (Letters, October 30) was incorrect on two counts when he
implied that pharmaceutical companies were exploiting Britain's National
Health Service. First, in unfavourably comparing the price of insulin in the
US and France with the 'notional' price in the UK he overlooked the fact
that the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS) ensures that British
taxpayers get value for money from the suppliers of medicines to the NHS.
Under this scheme, companies are allowed a target return on capital in
respect of their range of products which they may or may not achieve but
must not exceed. Any excess profit is repaid to the government.
Second, Mr Sonabend has been highly selective. A recent price index for
prescription medicines produced by the Swedish pricing authority showed that
in relation to Sweden (equalling 100) the figures for other European
countries were as follows: Switzerland (136), the Netherlands (132), Denmark
(130), Germany (192), Finland (111), Norway (103), the UK (99), Italy (95),
Belgium and Austria (93), and France (65).

FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Electricity in an open market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof JAMES LAWTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The purpose of the electrical supply industry is to provide reliable,
economically priced electricity to the consumer. The ability of generators
to optimise fuel price and security of supply in both the short and long
term on the world markets is a major factor in achieving this objective.
Prof Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, was therefore correct
in telling the Department of Trade and Industry select committee that it is
not his job to determine fuel mix. However, it is his job to protect the
consumer. In regard to the gas contracts of the regional electricity
companies he referred to his power to disallow uneconomic charges to pass
through. He then went on to indicate that there is not a single price for
electricity, that there were factors other than price and that it is not his
job to review every gas contract signed by the regional electricity
companies (RECs).
Given this apparently self-negating interpretation (with which I agree), how
to move forward? Clearly the requirement is for mechanisms that encourage
proper market behaviour. Specifically, contract negotiations should be
conducted in an open market and not, as now, in secret. Then prima facie
evidence for misuse of market power by either RECs or generators would be
visible, acting as a deterrent and providing both transparency for
regulatory bodies and easily accessible evidence for any inquiry.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Rethink on financial services regulation cannot be
avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S M YASSUKOVICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent comments from authoritative sources indicate that City support
for the Financial Services Act, always half-hearted at best, is now
substantially eroded. As with so many modern compromises, the concept of
practitioner-based self-regulation backed by statute has satisfied no one.
Despite the government's well-known reluctance to countenance new or amended
legislation in the field of financial services regulation, a fundamental
rethink cannot be long avoided. It is hoped that the review ordered by the
Treasury from the SIB will set the stage.
Surely the problem is the fatal flaw in the original legislation initiative.
The government sought to deal with two entirely distinct problems with a
single bill. A more sensible approach would have been two separate bills,
one dealing with investor protection within the retail financial services
industry and the other with the wholesale and international markets of the
City. The first bill would have been dominated by conduct of business and
compensation issues and the second would have focused on systemic risk.
It is absurd to believe that investor protection of the public at large can
be self-financed and self-regulated. It is like asking the Police Federation
to pay for and supervise policing. The so-called independent financial
advisers cannot pay for regulation or pass the costs on to their clients and
the producers of financial products are clearly disinclined to pick up the
cost. The only alternative is to tax the wholesale markets but this will
affect London's competitive position. The retail sector should be regulated
by a taxpayer-financed government agency. Self-financed self-regulation
should be applied only to the wholesale markets under the aegis of an agency
with the same independence (in supervisory matters) and authority as the
Bank of England.
Harmonisation requirements driven from Brussels will force change in any
case. To persist with self-regulation in the retail area is rightly deemed
eccentric in the rest of Europe. However, the European wholesale financial
community, mostly represented in London, could be mustered to support
sensible and flexible regulation of intra-professional markets with maximum
practitioner involvement in the process.

So it is perhaps appropriate that yesteryear's mighty corporate raider,

It's taken more than a year, but Hollis Harris has at last had his prayers
answered. In August 1991, Harris, then president of Continental Airlines,
urged employees of the bankrupt US carrier to join him in praying three
times a day 'that God will show us a way to survive'. The very next day
Continental dispensed with his services.
But the Methodist minister's son from the Georgia Bible belt has bounced
back. He resurfaced earlier this year in Montreal as chief executive of Air
Canada; and one of his early moves was to submit an offer - together with a
group of Texan investors - for his former employer.
Now Continental has decided to accept the Air Canada-led bid in the hope
that the infusion of new capital would enable it to emerge from Chapter 11
early next year. For its part, Air Canada hopes the deal will make it a more
attractive partner for international alliances.
Harris could do with another burst of divine intervention, however. Air
Canada itself is still bleeding about a million dollars of red ink a day and
has debts of over Dollars 3bn. Whether or not these problems can be
overcome, it won't be for lack of prayer in the executive suite. Air
Canada's chairman, Claude Taylor, is a devout Baptist.

FT  10 NOV 92 / A ray of hope shines from a pit of despair: In a unique
leasing deal, Scottish miners have invested their own money to reopen a
British Coal colliery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh is the scene of a unique venture in
British coal-mining. By the end of this month a group of miners who have
formed their own company will begin regular production of coal from the pit
which they have leased from British Coal.
Not only is this the first time British Coal has allowed a deep mine to be
worked by another operator, but each of the 110 miners who are working at
Monktonhall has raised Pounds 10,000 to finance the venture and guarantee
his job. Monktonhall Mineworkers has no other equity capital. Years of
persistence in the face of opposition from local Labour politicians and
scepticism by financiers appear to be paying off.
'It's up to ourselves,' says Mr Jim Parker, the managing director, a former
British Coal executive. 'We've got no excuses. There's no bad geology, no
lazy miners, and no bad management to blame.'
British Coal stopped production at Monktonhall in 1987, deciding that it was
uneconomical, but the mine was maintained so that it could be reopened.
Local politicians and MPs launched a campaign to persuade the company to
reopen it. In early 1991 Lothian regional council and other local
authorities presented a consultants' report proposing a mining operation
employing 370 men, with new investment of Pounds 8m. But to the dismay of
the politicians and the National Union of Mineworkers, British Coal
announced in August 1991 that it could not justify reopening the mine under
its own management.
However, British Coal was prepared to lease Monktonhall to another operator.
This was the chance which a group of ex-mineworkers from the area, guided by
Mr Parker and chaired by Mr Jackie Aitchison (then working as a bus driver),
had been waiting for. Some of them had put Pounds 2,000 each into a
consultants' feasibility study prior to the local authorities' report, and
its conclusions were encouraging.
Last December, British Coal agreed to negotiate a lease with Monktonhall
Mineworkers, although it said a rival offer from Caledonian Mining, a
private company based at Newark, Nottinghamshire, 'enjoyed comparable
technical merit'. The state-owned company apparently chose the mineworkers
because of political and public pressure.
It took Monktonhall Mineworkers, assisted by the accountants Price
Waterhouse, nearly six months to finalise the lease agreement. The
Labour-controlled local authorities refused to provide finance, believing
the venture would be short-lived, and the miners did not succeed in raising
capital from outside institutions.
'We'd decided back in October 1991 to finance the project from our own
resources,' says Mr Parker, 'but we wanted outside capital as a backstop. We
found that institutions which had earlier shown interest in our scheme had
turned against us. They listened to local politicians and union leaders.
It's not outrageous to say that these politicians and unionists would have
preferred the mine shut to it being operated by someone other than British
Coal.'
Labour politicians would have preferred to have the mine run by the
nationalised coal company to it becoming a potential showcase for private
enterprise. But the mineworkers had quiet backing from the government, which
wanted the bid to succeed, and vocal support from local Conservatives,
Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party.
The mineworkers secured a loan facility for an undisclosed amount from the
Bank of Scotland and decided to invest the maximum they could afford -
Pounds 10,000 each, amounting to Pounds 1.1m for the first 110 miners. Some
of them put in savings from their British Coal redundancy money, while
others took out loans from the Life Association of Scotland or mortgaged
their homes.
Mr Parker says: 'No one was deceived. We encouraged the miners' wives to
come to our meetings to hear about the risks.' The company has a waiting
list of ex-miners willing to put in their stake.
The company took over Monktonhall in June and installed new winding ropes,
reactivated the underground conveyers and bought used machinery in England
at one-tenth the price of new equipment, according to Mr Parker.
Mr Parker says that Monktonhall should produce 250,000 tonnes of coal a year
as the number of miners rises to 155, working two shifts over a five-day
week. The mine produced about 1m tonnes a year under British Coal, employing
about 1,000 people at its peak.
According to Mr Parker, output per year should be 1,400 tonnes a miner,
substantially higher than under British Coal's management. Productivity will
also be higher, Mr Parker says, because the mineworkers will be working more
weeks of the year than under British Coal, without that company's 'ludicrous
holidays, loud-mouthed unions and spineless management. We have the
motivation of people who have put their own money into their company.'
The cost of production, he says, should be Pounds 1.30 a gigajoule compared
with the Pounds 1.80 a gigajoule which British Coal is thought to charge
ScottishPower, the leading electricity company in Scotland. But
Monktonhall's costs are above those of opencast coal.
This weakness was highlighted last week when ScottishPower, which had sought
tenders for coal supplies, rejected Monktonhall's offer on the grounds that
its price was uncompetitive. Instead, it accepted tenders from opencast
suppliers in the UK and overseas. Though disappointed, Monktonhall Miners
say they will be able to win enough contracts to survive. The company
already has contracts to sell some of its coal, and is tendering for orders
from large users in Ireland, Malta, the Isle of Man and the Isle of Skye.
Quite apart from the battle for contracts, Monktonhall represents a high
risk venture. Its financial resources are slender; the market for deep-mined
coal is competitive, but it will have to maintain output and sales to cover
the cost of keeping the mine pumped and paying interest to the bank. One
coal industry observer, thinking of the miners' big personal stakes, calls
Monktonhall 'a tragedy waiting to happen'.
But Mr Parker has faith in the venture. He says several more pits which
British Coal has closed could be reopened profitably on the same basis as
Monktonhall with mineworkers as shareholders. He already has his eyes on the
mothballed Frances colliery at Kirkcaldy, Fife, though that mine, he says,
would cost Pounds 16m to revive, requiring more than the miners' personal
funds.
He believes the experiment at Monktonhall will improve the prospects for
other mines faced with closure. 'There is nothing utopian about this
venture. Men here in their 30s are going to make a lot of money at
Monktonhall.'

The conundrum of the moment is not whether or when Mr John Major will
reshuffle his cabinet, but whether he dares to do so. For any change that
the prime minister makes will upset one or another faction of the
Conservative party. Instead of restoring his authority, it might leave him
in an even more precarious position.
Mr Major managed to avoid this danger when he appointed the inoffensive Mr
Peter Brooke to replace Mr David Mellor as secretary for the national
heritage. But that was a one-off. There are few Peter Brooke clones, and not
one of them is as able as the original. The prime minister tried hard to
keep Mr Mellor - partly, perhaps, out of an understandable fear that any
move he made could set off an explosion within what has become an extremely
volatile party. The same logic suggests a bias in favour of continuity now.
Yet the forces that favour change are strong. Slapping ministers around is
the way prime ministers assert themselves. Some incumbents, notably the
chancellor, should be moved elsewhere. Those are two positive reasons for
encouraging a reshuffle. There is also a reason for not doing so: that the
right, having tasted blood in parliamentary battles over the past six weeks,
now seeks to demonstrate its strength by telling Mr Major how to construct
his cabinet.
None of these arguments is conclusive. A reshuffle does not always have the
desired effect on public opinion, as the late Harold Macmillan discovered
when he sacked seven ministers in July 1962. That midsummer 'night of the
long knives' was widely regarded as an act of panic. It was one of the
events that led to Macmillan's downfall 15 months later. Then again putting
a new chancellor in would not itself restore confidence. Much would depend
on who was chosen. Mr Major's difficulty is that the party has as much to
say about that as he does, and it may reject his first choice.
As to the ambitions of the impertinent right, there is little to be done
even if the prime minister is weak enough to accede to its demands. All the
right-wingers of stature are now in the House of Lords. Lady Thatcher and
Lords Tebbit, Parkinson and Ridley are unavailable to the Commons. So is
Lord Lawson, a right-wing conservative of a different stripe. Lord Howe, who
is pro-European and not in any anti-government faction, is also trapped
upstairs.
It would make little difference to the unity of the Tories if all six of
these noble persons were still MPs. The thrust of their common European
policy when in office was at least as pro-European as the one the Tory
Europhobe right is currently attempting to destabilise. Their absent heroes,
and heroine, acted one way then, and speak another way now. The Single
European Act gave more central power to the Brussels bureaucracy than any
other instrument since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. That act was
initiated, bargained for, and bulldozed through by a gang of Thatcherites
under the eponymous heroine herself.
Very well then, it is said, why not promote some of the remaining
representatives of the right? The list of junior ministers is unconvincing.
If you put the sceptical Mr John Redwood around the table at Number 10
Downing Street then why not the loyal Mr Stephen Dorrell? The cabinet itself
is, we must suppose, a happy band of brothers and sisters. Messrs Michael
Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo may to various degrees harbour
doubts about Mr Major's European and other policies, but none of them has
resigned. They share the collective responsibility imposed by the prime
minister's characteristic method of asking everyone around the table to
indicate assent in advance of each important pronouncement.
There is an additional argument in favour of keeping the cabinet intact, at
least for the immediate future. This week Treasury ministers will speak to
every backbencher in an effort to soften up the party in advance of
Thursday's statement on public spending. The exercise constitutes an
admission that the votes of Conservative members cannot be taken for granted
by this Conservative government. The party will be asked to resist the
temptation to break into factions representing one aggrieved group or
another - nurses, say, or teachers. The government's hope is that it will be
seen to be presenting a tough but properly thought-out economic programme to
which every minister subscribes.
Fanciful as this endeavour may seem, it would stand less chance of success
if the Autumn Statement was followed by a reshuffle of the very cabinet
which is supposed to be so united in support of it. The restoration of the
government's authority depends above all on a renewal of confidence in its
ability to guide the economy out of the recession. To achieve that, the
prime minister must start getting some decisions right. To reshuffle or not
to reshuffle is among the most important of those decisions.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Detour for the through train: Chris Patten's proposals for
greater democracy in Hong Kong are a high-risk strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That things in the Colony aren't
what they should be
no one can doubt any longer,
and though in spite of everything we
do move forward,
maybe - as more than a few believe
 - the time has come
to bring in a Political Reformer.
C P Cavafy, In a Large Greek Colony, 200BC
It was clear from the day Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong that his
governorship was going to be different from those of the 27 governors who
had come before him.
This was underlined on October 7 when he publicised his proposals for the
reform of Hong Kong's political system. In one move he changed the course of
British policy towards Hong Kong in two significant ways.
First, he signalled his intention to involve the people of Hong Kong in
their political future, in contrast to past colonial policy which had
involved only a coterie of local worthies. And second, by saying he would
present his proposals to the local legislature if China failed to agree, he
went against Foreign Office orthodoxy. This had always stressed the need for
British policy to complement what Beijing planned for Hong Kong after its
reversion to China in 1997, known locally as the 'through train'.
Mr Patten's strategy is nothing if not high risk. After a series of
unsuccessful meetings with Chinese leaders in Beijing two weeks ago, he now
faces protracted trench warfare with China, which has given every indication
that it neither approves of his proposals nor is prepared to discuss them
further. His, and Hong Kong's, nerve will be sorely tested in the coming
months.
It is also a strategy which, if successful, could raise awkward questions in
Britain about past policy: in particular, the questions of why the UK did
not stand up to China earlier and why it took so long to accelerate the
introduction of democracy in Hong Kong.
Mr Patten's proposals for constitutional development of the 60-member
Legislative Council (LegCo) in 1995 are not radical by the standards of any
western democracy.
In the 1991 elections, businessmen and professionals had two votes - one for
a legislator to represent their professional affiliation and another for a
geographical constituency. The proposals would extend this right of two
votes to ordinary employees in the 1995 elections.
In addition to expanding the franchise, 10 more legislators will be returned
to LegCo by selection of an electoral college, which, under the Patten
proposals, would consist of democratically elected local officials. As a
concession to China, however, he has not sought to increase the number of
democratically elected seats from the 20 already agreed with China for the
1995 election. He has also kept liberal politicians off his Executive
Council, or quasi-cabinet, which China has always opposed.
To date China has refused to discuss the plans, saying publicly that Britain
has reneged on secret agreements made in early 1990. It has threatened to
overturn the 1995 elections if conducted on Mr Patten's terms when it takes
over in 1997. It has also threatened to repudiate contracts and debt
agreements for the colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 13.9bn) airport project
if he proceeds to build it without China's approval. Talks about the airport
broke down three weeks ago and China appears to be in no hurry to settle the
issue.
The question now is: can Mr Patten succeed? Or will he inevitably have to
bend to China's will? The key to the answer lies in his ability to retain
the support of the public, maintain confidence in the colony's economy and
most important, get his plans through LegCo. So far, the political tide
appears to be turning in his direction.
First, the business community appears to have shrugged off the recent
furore. The Hong Kong stock market has continued to rise in spite of the
diplomatic stand-off between Britain and China. The prospect of rapid
economic development in China has attracted international investors, and
Hong Kong is the only market through which they can obtain an exposure to
it.
The Hang Seng index - the market's barometer - closed yesterday at 6,267.91,
only 1.5 per cent off its all-time high set on Thursday. Furthermore, there
is no shortage of money for new listings, another crucial indicator of
confidence.
Last week a mainland Chinese company floated a subsidiary and broke all
records for a new listing in the colony. China Travel Service sought
HKDollars 400m for 25 per cent of an offshoot subsidiary which owns theme
parks in China and a freight-forwarding business. The issue was
oversubscribed, by 411 times; the market offered CTS HKDollars 150bn.
Further signs that the colony's influential business community is reserving
judgment come from business people themselves. According to Ms Sally Aw,
chairman of the Sing Tao media and property group: 'This is 1992 and by 1995
there will have been a lot of changes. By 1997 the situation will be
different again. Anything can happen. By 1995 China may have a different
view; I think you have to give them time.'
Mr Adrian Fu, scion of the colony's Fu family which has interests in
property and hotels in both Hong Kong and China, strikes a similar tone: 'No
one expected China to agree to Patten's proposals. What was unusual is that
he and Lu Ping (China's top official on Hong Kong affairs) had bad words
without offending each other.'
Mr Patten cannot, however, count on local Chinese business people for much
support. Their economic interests, which increasingly lie on the Chinese
mainland, will prevent the few who support him from speaking out, because by
doing so they invite China's retaliation. As one China expert noted: 'These
people are vulnerable because the success of projects they are mixed up with
in China depends on a corrupt and arbitrary bureaucracy.'
The Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong yesterday implicitly
endorsed Lu Ping's line and called on Mr Patten to withdraw his proposals
and seek fresh talks with China. It said it was unacceptable to put in place
a political structure which would be dismantled in 4 1/2 years.
Mr Patten will also be denied the support of the expatriate business
community. Schooled and brought up in liberal democracies, many expatriates
scorn suggestions that the people of Hong Kong are interested in political
liberty. They view the Hong Kong Chinese as being more interested in making
money.
This perception, however, is not supported by the public opinion polls that
the Hong Kong media have been conducting since Mr Patten arrived in the
colony in July. One recent poll published by East magazine, a new weekly
launched by the popular Oriental Daily, tracks Mr Patten's personal
popularity and approval for his proposals in the period from his
announcement of them on October 7 until his return from Beijing on October
23. The poll shows that his popularity has fluctuated between 61 and 65 per
cent, while approval for what he wants to do has ranged between 70 and 85
per cent.
Other polls show equally strong readings. One in Ming Pao, published four
days after his speech to LegCo, showed nearly five-to-one in favour of
proceeding with his political reforms even if China objected, which by then
was the course it had already embarked on.
This is not to say that Mr Patten has a guarantee of permanent support; many
local people are cynical about his motives and see his style of leadership
simply as a desire for popularity. 'He is trying to push for more democracy
in the knowledge that he can't succeed; he is here to fail 'honourably','
noted one local.
The feeling of many working-class people was summed up by Mr Yip Wing Shing,
a photocopier repairman. 'No one can say at this point if his reforms are
good, but I think we should give them a try. Because no one can guarantee
that even if we do what China wants now, they won't change things in 1997.'
The governor's plans, however, will stand or fall on the floor of LegCo. It
is the local legislature which, as Mr Patten constantly reminds it, will
have to pass the laws which are needed to conduct the 1995 polls.
Few doubt that if Mr Patten laid legislation before the council today it
would be passed. The calculation is a fine one, but according to one
estimate the government could count on 27 sure votes compared with 24 -
mostly members appointed by Mr Patten's predecessor, Lord Wilson - against.
That leaves seven undecided, together with one further legislator he has to
appoint. But opinion is volatile.
Views within LegCo are as polarised as the above numbers would suggest. The
conservative grouping, which will vote against his legislation, wants him to
call a referendum before LegCo votes on the package. 'The French have just
held a referendum; so have the Canadians,' says Mr Allen Lee, leader of the
Co-operative Resources Centre, the main conservative grouping. 'Do not tell
me that democratic countries can hold referenda and Hong Kong cannot. If the
people vote for his proposals, then we will go along with them. In the
absence of a referendum we will vote against.'
A referendum, however, is unlikely to be held. It is far too close to an
'act of self-determination' and Britain has always said such a plebiscite
was inappropriate for Hong Kong because it was not being granted
independence.
Mr Lee is a believer in the 'through train' concept. 'If LegCo passes Mr
Patten's proposals by a narrow margin - which I think it will - the question
still remains, do we want elections that will be good only until 1997? Do we
want China to have a total say over who sits in LegCo post-1997?'
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, who supports Mr Patten even
though he believes he has not gone far enough, takes a different view. 'The
lack of convergence is not a big deal,' he says. 'Why is it so terrible?
There is at least a chance that China will not reverse what Mr Patten does.
China can ruin Hong Kong if it wants to be bloody-minded. But how does that
help China and its economic development?'
This view finds some resonance with Mr Patten's close advisers. One points
out that the alternative to the governor's ideas is for Britain to ensure
that the politicians whom China does not like do not get elected in 1995.
This, he says, is too much to ask. The advisers maintain that the costs to
China of reversing a system which Mr Patten believes can be made to work
would be too great. To some, however, this rationale echoes the hopes
expressed in June 1989, when another group of Chinese free-thinkers faced
the authorities in Tiananmen Square.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry has, in recent weeks, shown a
willingness to speak out. But by lecturing the government rather than its
members, it merely continues the traditional British practice of blaming
others for industry's own shortcomings.
'Making it in Britain', a report from the CBI's National Manufacturing
Council, is a typically worthy and woolly document. It rightly argues that
the British manufacturing base is too small and inefficient. But the
overwhelming impression created by the report is that government action is
both the primary cause and cure for industry's weakness.
The priorities for industry, listed in the report, are frustratingly vague:
industry must 'establish a clear sense of strategic direction' and 'develop
greater consumer focus in every facet of business'. It is the government
that must act now by cutting corporation tax, lowering interest rates and
freezing public sector pay.
Yet the document has a gaping hole. It contains almost no discussion of
either pay or profits, variables which industrialists influence directly.
The depressing fact is that the productivity gains of the 1980s were
consumed rather than invested, something the CBI report omits to mention.
Between 1980 and 1990, real wages rose by 18 per cent in the US, 29 per cent
in west Germany, 31 per cent in France and 42 per cent in the UK. That is
why UK profitability and investment remain low by international standards.
British industrialists and trade unionists pay themselves too much, a
reality they squirm to avoid. Ford UK is typical. Since the recession began,
its workers have received two pay increases: more than 12 per cent in the
first year and 5 per cent in the second, years in which inflation averaged
6.8 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Little wonder profits are
squeezed. But it is not Ford's personnel managers and union negotiators who
will lose their jobs.
The UK economy badly needs a strong employers' organisation with the courage
to tell its members and their employees that they should put profits and
investment before increases in wages and executive salaries. It needs
leaders who are prepared to say that pay settlements are still twice as high
as they should be if the competitiveness gains from sterling's devaluation
are not to be lost. This is a message the CBI, along with the government and
the Labour party, finds it impossible or impolitic to articulate.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Leading Article: How to escape a trade war
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HEGEL REMARKED that 'what experience and history teach is this
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that nations and governments have never learned anything from history'. To
this his pupil, Karl Marx, added that history reappeared 'the first time as
tragedy, the second as farce'. Marx looks right, for a change. The world
economic malaise may soon be aggravated by a 'trade war' between the
European Community and the US over less than 2m tonnes of oilseeds. This
farce must be stopped. Immediate responsibility for doing so rests with the
EC.
Allegations of interference by the president of the Commission, Mr Jacques
Delors, in the work of Mr Ray MacSharry as farm trade negotiator - a
position he himself had arguably usurped from Mr Frans Andriessen, the
commissioner for external affairs - are just symptoms of the malaise. The
disease is confusion over the role of the EC in the world.
Mr Delors has argued that 'adolescent Europe' should be able to say no to
its American big brother. So it should. The question is over what. Can the
EC wish to make its refusal to accept two adverse Gatt panel findings on its
oilseeds regime the principle on which, like Martin Luther, it must take its
stand, because it can do no other?
What needs to be recognised now is, first, that the oilseeds dispute and the
Uruguay Round, though connected, are at least juridically separate; second,
that the credibility of the Gatt dispute settlement process is under test;
and, finally, that the underlying Gatt principle of reciprocity does allow
the US to withdraw concessions from the EC. This withdrawal can be up to the
value of the losses imposed by the EC oilseed regime, which Gatt panels
judge to have unfairly damaged the interests of the EC's trading partners.
Counter-retaliation by the EC would be a different matter. It would take the
dispute into uncharted territory.
The EC should, instead, accept the American proposal for binding arbitration
on the size of the losses imposed by its oilseeds regime. It should also
agree that the US may withdraw concessions equal in value to the losses
identified by the arbitrator, if agreement cannot be reached on changes to
its oilseeds regime. Such a rebalancing of the account in a protectionist
direction would be far from ideal. But the potentially lethal infection from
the oilseeds dispute would have been sterilised.
With the oilseed dispute contained, the wider question of the Uruguay Round
could be tackled once more. Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director general,
should consider calling the negotiators back to Geneva. This would seem to
be particularly timely now that the EC negotiation is back in the hands of a
man responsible for trade policy as a whole. It also looks as though the
best chance of resolving the outstanding issues in farm trade might be in
the context of an overall negotiation.
Some in the EC appear not to want the round completed at all, whether for
domestic political reasons or because they believe the EC will be
strengthened by a confrontation with the US. They play with fire. Neither
the political cohesiveness nor the economic strength of the EC would be
strengthened by failure of the trade negotiations, particularly if the EC
were to be blamed for the collapse.
This is looking increasingly like a pivotal moment in the post-cold-war era.
An intrinsically trivial dispute over oilseeds could lead to the
disintegration of the Uruguay Round and even of the GATT; it could divide
the US from the EC; it could create serious friction within the EC; and it
could imperil world prosperity. A few hundred million Ecus worth of
soyabeans are not worth the risk. Let the epitaph on postwar international
economic co-operation not be that for once people did learn from history,
but then they forgot.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The Matrix case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CASE against three former executives of the Matrix Churchill company,
withdrawn by the public prosecutor yesterday, has cast a disturbing glare on
the apparent ineffectiveness of government controls on exports of military
hardware. What is not clear, however, is whether these procedures were
merely ineffective, or whether in some sense the government was conniving at
the circumvention of its own declared export control policy, in pursuit of
quite different foreign policy objectives.
The executives were accused of selling machine tools to Iraq during the
Iran-Iraq war, despite a government ban on military-type exports to either
of the warring parties; but it emerged in court that Mr Alan Clark, former
trade minister, and government officials had deliberately encouraged the
company to conceal what they knew was the military end-use of the machine
tools.
The weaknesses of the export control procedures were inevitably compounded
by the involvement of British intelligence. Illicit arms exports may seem to
be a useful channel for acquiring sensitive information. Yet Britain, along
with its allies, proved anything but well-informed about Iraq's political
intentions and about its weapons programmes. So perhaps the trade was more
advantageous to Iraq than to Britain.
One plausible explanation for the circumvention of the arms embargo was that
the British government secretly supported Iraq in the war against Iran. In
principle the embargo was imposed equally on both countries, and no doubt
the government would have viewed an even-handed stalemate with equanimity.
Yet it undoubtedly feared most the prospect of an Iranian victory, with the
accompanying danger that the fundamentalist regime in Tehran could dominate
the whole Gulf.
Such a judgment was certainly shared by the French government. But the big
difference between British and French policy was that Paris openly
proclaimed a strategic alliance with Saddam Hussein, whereas British support
remained unofficial. The invasion of Kuwait showed that it was more prudent
to fear Iran than to trust Iraq.
As a result, the British government has been embarrassed by the latest
revelations; whereas France suffered the deeper shock of a betrayed
alliance. But if British governments depart for reasons of state from
declared high principle to hard realpolitik, at least they should do so with
greater competence than was shown in the Matrix case.

Channel 4's art and culture magazine programme Without Walls (9.00) looks
into the origins of the Volkswagen Beetle which it describes as 'Hitler's
baby' and 'a symbol of Nazism'. It seems that Hitler handed his own sketches
for the car to Ferdinand Porsche, who is generally credited as its creator.
Second half of the programme is devoted to the design of sports stadiums.
Kinsey (9.30 BBC1) is another of those law series which is about marriage,
children, drugs, almost anything but the law, really. In the title role
Leigh Lawson has a wonderful time wearing a Clint Eastwood 'duster' coat
while all sorts of women dance attendance upon him: ex-wife, doting
secretary, new (spiffing redhead) partner. However, at the end of the last
episode his daughter arrived at his office after being thrown out of school
and the tables look ready for turning.
Sir John Harvey-Jones begins Troubleshooter 2 by revisiting the firms which
were the subjects of his first series (Morgan Cars, Churchill pottery,
Tri-ang toys and so on). Later in this new series he will be offering his
advice to six more businesses and organisations (9.45 BBC2).

FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Flotsam, jetsam and Ravel - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Barbican on Sunday, Kent Nagano conducted the London Symphony in a
curious programme. The first half was a showcase for John Williams' guitar,
which guaranteed a full house but required little more than tactful
accompaniment; in the second we got Ravel's complete Daphnis et Chloe, which
is both an audience-puller and a serious test for a conductor.
In Rodrigo's evergreen Concierto de Aranjuez, featherweight but elegant,
Nagano missed nothing, and Williams - whom I have not heard in several
years, since he moved home to Australia - not only proved that his
formidable technique is still secure, but found new expressive depths and
shadows in his cadenzas. So far, so admirable. Unfortunately he chose to
follow the Concierto with a UK premiere, the 'Antarctica' Suite by Nigel
Westlake, a colleague from his new ensemble ATTACCA.
It is adapted from Westlake's score for a monster-screen movie - where for
all I know, the composer's catch-as-catch-can invention may work perfectly.
As re-composed for virtuoso guitar with small orchestra, however, it cut no
ice to speak of: bits of ad lib solo virtuosity were pinned on to swatches
of pictorial colour and that was that. No direction, no point, nothing but
random effects; one would go to some trouble to avoid hearing it again.
Nagano's account of Ravel's Daphnis sounded like a promising first shot. On
the minus side, there were unresolved problems of balance: the nine-strong
percussion section and the brass often covered vital thematic stuff from the
strings, and in turn they were themselves sometimes blotted out by the LSO
Chorus - far too numerous for their collective role here. Those wordless
voices should be one strand in the texture, not pugnacious competition; and
besides, in their testing a cappella interlude they came uncomfortably close
to losing their grip on pitch.
On the plus side, however, Nagano preserved the crucial balletic pulse
better than most conductors. The score lived and breathed. For Chloe's
heartbroken dance in piratical captivity, he found pathetic accents of
speaking force - more exposed than in any account I remember, but utterly
true to Ravel's intentions.
In the last, 'wild' - though rigorously controlled - Danse generale, Nagano
took note of something that all programme-notes are too polite to mention:
that the ancient Greek Daphnis tale was expressly about sexual innocence and
subsequent happy discovery. Even Diaghilev preferred to leave that decently
obscure; but Ravel spelt it out in the near-orgasmic cries of his final
chorus, coming quicker and more urgent as the tempo contracts from 5/4 time
to 3/4 and then to 2/4, with a gross full-orchestra trill on the last chord.
Nagano gave all that full value, and quite right too.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Le Roi malgre lui - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emmanuel Chabrier's last opera ('King in spite of himself') was another
opera-comique like his L'Etoile, but musically even richer. A broader
dramatic range (since L'Etoile he had composed his 'serious' Saxon epic
Gwendoline); splendid tunes, mostly of a quirkily original cut, and tingling
orchestration; and a feast of adventurous harmony, which supplied Ravel with
takeaways for several years.
The reason why it is almost unknown - and Saturday's concert performance by
the Chelsea Opera Group was doubly welcome - is not, I think, quite what the
COG's commentary suggested: that the plot is hopelessly complicated. Many of
Feydeau's farces would seem as baffling if recounted in detail, but like
them most of Le Roi should be clear enough when played out in its audience's
own language. The trouble is rather that the disguises and surprises are too
arbitrary to generate enough comic tension.
Furthermore, it needs so much spoken dialogue that the opera becomes
unfeasibly long. Though the COG omitted that altogether, the music still
filled two and a half hours (plus interval), with scarcely a number that one
would sacrifice. Michael Lloyd conducted it with terrific style and energy:
should anybody devise a stage-rescue for the piece, they should ring him at
once. The COG orchestra played up exuberantly, failing only to make
Chabrier's most elaborate tuttis shine as clearly as they might.
Having nothing to do but sing, the cast were eager and willing, and two were
outstanding. Elizabeth Gale's Minka (Polish mistress to the Comte de Nangis,
whose mission is to ensure that the reluctant Henri de Valois accepts the
Polish throne) grew ever brighter and more heartfelt. Geoffrey Dolton's wry
Venetian Duke delivered his couplets, and everything else, with faultless,
up-front panache: he is a gift to the French 19th-century repertoire, and
should be exhibited in a lot more of it.
Paul Napier-Burrows represented poor Henri mildly and pleasantly, but
without much character - though Henri may be a hapless wimp, he is
nonetheless the wimp in the middle. As his ex-mistress Alexina, the
Venetian's wife, Anne Heath-Welch sang with gusto and a raw edge in her
upper register; her machinating Polish uncle, Count Laski, was the sound,
imperturbable Brian Bannatyne-Scott. If David Owen's forceful tenor gusto
missed something of the Comte's disarming fecklessness, his lusty,
hell-for-leather contribution to his final duet with Minka would surely have
gladdened the composer's heart. Full of heart and wit as it is, Chabrier's
music never forgets the loins either.
And now: will somebody please mount a competition for a new Roi libretto? It
would need to take careful account of the situations to which Chabrier's
music answers so neatly - but those could be accommodated within a tighter
story and terser dialogue. It would be essential to keep the period-feel:
not the historical Henri's period (late 16th-century), but Chabrier's
(Feydeau and Labiche). If done cleverly enough, that could reinstate this
sunny masterpiece to the repertoire.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: God among the pots and pans - William Packer admires
the still-life paintings of Picasso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should the myth still persist that Picasso was no more than this century's
greatest charlatan and fraud, this exhibition at Paris should finally
explode it. Its subject is Picasso as a painter, and occasional sculptor, of
the still-life, and it fills two large galleries on one floor of the Grand
Palais.
Given the size of the known oeuvre, it would have been infinitely
extendable. But the exhibition has been beautifully chosen, its scope
perfectly balanced to its concentration. It has already been seen in
Cleveland and Philadelphia and this is its sole European showing. There can
be no better reason for getting to Paris before the year is out.
'God moves among the pots and pans', said Saint Teresa of Avila. Picasso
made much the same point himself in saying that 'the most ordinary of
objects is . . . a vehicle for my thought - just as the parable was for
Christ.' The principle of much in little, of virtue in simplicity, of all
the world in a grain of sand, is, in whatever guise, unanswerable. For the
artist the still-life has been a focus of preoccupation since art began. The
symbolic appurtenances of the hero or the attributes of the saint may have
served the purpose of simple identification but, more than that, the flower
at the foot of the Virgin, the lily in the hand of the Angel, brought back
the story into the real world, brought it quite literally down to earth.
Still-life became a distinct discipline during the more secular
post-Reformation world. It is in relation to that movement that we can see
more clearly the significance of Picasso. For the point of the still life,
is that the artist is confronted by objects which are real, immediate and
commonplace. The effect upon a true artist is to drain off all
self-conscious cleverness and formality. The still life offers no model to
flatter or seduce, no grand design to achieve, no patron to please. The work
is done for its own sake, enabling the artist to try out ideas, to
experiment, to analyse, understand and realise forms.
It is thus no accident that still-life should have been the staple of
Picasso's work at the time of his most intense and private research, along
with Braque, in the great Cubist adventure in the years around 1910. And how
odd it is that all this high-cubist nature morte, (as the French call it
with conscious irony) that once seemed difficult and austere, should now
appear to us rich, lively and beautiful.
Picasso's lifelong interest in still-life is displayed at this exhibition:
here are the bowls of fruit, the glasses, bottles, the pipes and papers, and
the guitars. And ever present, too, is mortality as leitmotif, the skulls
and heads, the fish and fowl for the table, nature morte indeed. Such
symbolism might seem especially poignant in the work of the early 1940s, for
Picasso was in Paris throughout the Occupation. Indeed, it is generally
agreed that his work was especially dark and gloomy during that time.
Here is a painting of late May 1940, of a fish and a crab apparently biting
and clawing at each other, with the Battle of France still fiercely in
progress and occupation by no means certain. And here is the 'Tete de mort'
of 1943, the image an abstracted death's head modelled and cast in bronze.
Some of the most obviously angst-ridden works date rather from later 1930s,
post-'Guernica' (his response to the Spanish civil war)and a time when his
private life was particularly disrupted. Little is known of Picasso in Paris
during the war. He was a distinguished neutral alien in his later middle
age; materials no doubt were hard to come by, scope and palette alike
necessarily restricted. I believe he simply kept his head down in difficult
and gloomy times.
Some wonderful things came out of this period, all as formally lively and
wittily inventive as ever, sometimes even positively light-hearted. A
grisaille of May 1941, than which one might think nothing would be gloomier,
turns out to be of a coil of sausage, a bottle and artichokes upon a table,
and the knives and forks springing out of the open drawer, like nestlings
clamouring to be fed. More soberly, the exhibition shows the life-long
centrality of cubism to the work. Once established, it might rest for a
while suppressed beneath the surface, but it was always present as a
powerful and determining creative force.
The exposition of the young artist's development through the 1900s, from
precocious talent to the mature and full achievement of cubism, affords the
show's greatest thrill. The proto-cubist works of 1906 to 1909 in
particular, as they move out of the shadow of 'les Demoiselles d'Avignon'
towards a more universal, less equivocal image and reference, are
astonishing for their formal certainty and monumental character. In later
periods Picasso would often achieve still life on the grand and monumental
scale, but never would he surpass the achievement of those early years. The
large canvas from Basle, of the table with its leaf down across the picture
plane, its top established by bread and fruit and grey compotier, and more
bread leant against the wall and the green curtain behind, turns the corner
from Cezanne towards the modernism, in all its aspects, of our own time. It
is, in its simplicity, one of the great paintings of the century.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Marlowe's 'Dr Faustus' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nottingham Playhouse has here an example of director's theatre at its
most superficial, with poor Marlowe's Dr Faustus served up as (a) style and
(b) comedy.
Director Phelim McDermott and designer Julian Crouch have dressed Faustus,
Wagner and other mortals in darkly drab Dickensian attire while the devils
are kitted in modern suits and primary colours. (Mephistopheles is in bright
yellow from head to toe.) The music, by John Winfield, is booming
sub-Vangelis stuff that drowns many of the words. You do not see Helen of
Troy; you just see wind pouring through a red-tunnel. And, thanks to the
wind and the music, you can't hear what Faustus says about her, though this
 -'Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?' - is the most famous
speech in the play.
The action all takes place in Faustus's study, a tall library stuffed with
books - reminiscent of the set for the 1975 RSC staging (with Ian McKellen).
An ensemble of seven plays all the characters other than Faustus and
Mephistopheles, and they seldom leave F and M alone. They keep filing
through the library as if it were the British Library's Reading Room; they
wear books as mortar-boards, they plant books down as stepping-stones, they
flutter books in the air like birds, they pop in and out of their study's
doors and windows and the perpetuate a constantly surreal, amusingly
bizarre, atmosphere.
Thanks to them, the interest of this Faustus is all on the sidelines. The
main event is the comic masque of the seven deadly sins. With grotesque
masks and costumes - a witty mix of Bosch, Daumier and Dali but in pale
papier-mache. Lechery is a woman with a parasol, a bustle and a huge phallus
rearing up from under her skirts. Amid a production that is generally
unconcerned with fidelity to Marlowe's text, these sins are encouraged to
ad-lib, commenting on their role-playing with campy lines like 'that's a
lovely line, that. Next line is better.' Another romp is the knockabout
treatment of the Pope in Rome, with wordless chanting and silly ritual,
which Faustus and Mephistopheles disrupt with various invisible-man tactics.
And the sorcerer's-apprentice scenes for the servants with Faustus's books
are the best fun of all.
McDermott's direction, however, makes Faustus himself flimsy. Jamie Newall
is a smug Oxford-postgrad Faustus, with a wretched habit of leaving his
mouth gaping open at the end of a line. Though he has worked out a carefully
mannered, would-be classical, actorly interpretation of the text, he has no
urgency. Michael Cashman's Mephistopheles is more natural in emphasis but
nothing about him is as forceful as the colour of his suit. Both he and
Newall are lightweight baritones who ensure that the play's central drama
remains in a stuffy shade of woollen grey. It is hard to forgive actors
wasting such roles as these - but the fault is less theirs than McDermott's.
Dr Faustus has both comedy and surrealism, sure. But, according to
McDermott, not much else.
At the Nottingham Playhouse until November 28

FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Stephen Kovacevich - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While there is no sign of rising unemployment in the ranks of pianists and
conductors, the practice of job-sharing continues. The number of pianists
who follow a double career as conductors includes such eminent keyboard
players as Daniel Barenboim and Christoph Eschenbach, to whom in recent
years we have also had to add the name of Stephen Kovacevich.
As his conducting duties have grown, Kovacevich (previously Stephen Bishop,
then Bishop-Kovacevich) has been seen far less in recital. A new recording
contract would, however, seem to be pointing him back in that direction. His
weekend appearance in a South Bank piano matinee was a welcome return, both
to the Royal Festival Hall and the sonatas of Beethoven, in which he was
always respected.
It is in the classical repertoire that Kovacevich has mainly won his
laurels. But even among the noted classical pianists, he has a distinct
personality. There is not the intellectual rigour that marked out Serkin,
with his determination to shine a bright light of clarity over the music and
throw every inner voice into relief. Nor does he have the determined
rhythmic grip that marks out, say, Annie Fischer and others.
For Kovacevich power and momentum fuse to provide the driving force. He
played two sonatas in this programme, the 'Waldstein' and the A flat major,
Op. 110, and both of them wanted to be fast and furious. It may be that the
violent contrasts catch the Beethovenian spirit, though it was difficult to
reconcile the hushed piano of Op. 110's Arioso, when it was followed moments
later by the thundering entry of the fugue in the left hand.
The 'Waldstein' was an exciting performance - at a price. Again the quieter
passages were properly reflective. But once the momentum was up, the music
hurtled forwards with little sense of there being the control to guide it.
The thrill was undeniable, but this was a big-dipper performance that ended
up throwing other musical virtues to the winds. The last climax before the
end became a noisy, incoherent, headlong assault.
In between, there was the solace of Schubert. Two late collections, the
Moments musicaux, D780, and 12 Landler, D790, offered playing of genuine
subtlety, the inimitable Schubertian harmonies sensitively touched upon, the
colours delicately varied: another Kovacevich altogether. Played like this,
these supposedly simple pieces seem to take on almost the richness of the
Chopin Mazurkas.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Technology: Prawn crisps and politics - From next year, the
EC will have 412 approved food additives. Charles Arthur examines their
contents and asks why we need so many
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may think the meals you eat are full of taste and goodness, but they are
usually full of something else as well - additives, the host of flavourings,
sweeteners, preservatives and colourings used by the food industry to
enhance or disguise their products and make them last longer.
To the average consumer, the number of approved additives in the UK,
currently 300, might seem more than enough for a healthy digestion. But next
year, when the Single European Act comes into force, it will jump to as many
as 412.
The logic behind permitting such a big leap in the array of 'E' numbers
which describe each additive is hard to follow. None of the extra 112
additives that might appear in people's food is a new chemical that has been
discovered in the past couple of years. Some are banned in the UK at the
moment: in the case of the sweetener cyclamate, since the 1960s.
Nor does the UK presently have a more rigid set of standards for allowing
additives than other countries. It is the least restrictive, with the
longest 'approved' list in Europe. Germany, by contrast, allows just 150,
while Greece allows only 120. For these countries, the shock will be even
greater. 'What's being allowed isn't the lowest common denominator,' says
Erik Millstone of Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit. 'In fact
it's lower than that. Even standards in the UK will decline, as they will
across the EC.'
Millstone often lobbies against the food industry's interest in putting what
he sees as unnecessary chemicals into foods. He is up against considerable
competition. The food industry in Europe is comparable in size to the
defence industry. In the UK the spending on additives alone is worth Pounds
453m; throughout the EC it totals Pounds 1.8bn.
But why are additives used at all? There are two principal reasons: people
want food that will last longer (meaning it can be transported further and
stored for longer), and manufacturers have discovered that the taste-buds
are surprisingly easily fooled.
The first reason led to the development of antioxidants (which stop oils
turning rancid) and preservatives (which discourage the growth of
micro-organisms). The second has led to the real boom area: colourings,
flavourings and sweeteners.
A few decades ago, food manufacturers looking to cut costs discovered that
they could use lower-quality raw foodstuffs if, later in the manufacturing
process, they added colourings to make them look more like the target
product: red for tomato-based products, yellow for cheese, and so on.
Flavourings could provide taste that was not there before. And sweeteners
could compensate for 'rough' flavours: the tongue is highly tuned to the
taste of sugar (or sugar-tasting products such as saccharin) which masks
less pleasant ones. That is why sugars and sweeteners are the most common
added ingredients in processed foods. It is also why food companies keen to
promote a quality image emphasise the additives they leave out of their
products.
The rapid multiplication of additives has led to careful scientific testing,
with products fed to laboratory animals to make sure they cannot be
dangerous, even when consumed in huge quantities. This process caused the
banning of cyclamate in the UK: experimental evidence suggested it caused
rats' testicles to shrink.
Yet some additives that have been approved are now strongly suspected of
causing side-effects: the best-known, tartrazine (E102), is a bright
orange-yellow colour commonly found in orange squash concentrates which is
now thought to make some children hyperactive and disruptive. Monosodium
glutamate, used widely in Chinese food, can cause nausea and headaches.
The process of drawing up a Europe-wide list of approved additives has been
carried out over the past three years by the EC Scientific Office, overseen
by the EC Scientific Committee on Food, an international group of
scientists.
Part of that work includes setting out rules for how much of an additive may
be used in a food and in which foods each of the additives can be used, in a
wide-ranging ruling which at one stage threatened an essential part of the
British way of life, no less a product than the prawn cocktail crisp.
Certain additives will only be allowed in particular foods: for example,
erythrosine (E127), a red colouring (used in many kinds of confectionery)
only in glace cherries; a pinkish colouring only in the 'saucisson de
Strasbourg' of France's Alsace; and Brown FK (E154), a colouring widely used
in all sorts of fish products, only in particular fish.
The prawn cocktail crisp came under scrutiny because an early version of the
list of approved sweeteners said certain strong additives could not be used
in any snack. However, sweet crisp flavours (such as prawn cocktail) contain
traces of aspartame or saccharin.
As can be imagined, the bargaining and lobbying at EC level over which
additives should be allowed and in which foods has been intense. The
political fighting has also been prolonged. 'You can say that again,'
remarked a spokeswoman for the UK's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries.
The EC argued that the flavour of prawn crisps was artificial. 'But
sweeteners is a minefield, and has been for some time.' The scientific
committee relented after the UK said jobs would be lost; the day was saved
for prawn cocktail crisps.
Yet to speak to some in the industry, the burgeoning list is hardly a matter
for excitement. Malcolm Jones, managing director of Bensons Crisps of
Kirkham in Lancashire, says: 'We don't see a dramatic change coming. But it
has to come to fruition yet.'
His company, which employs 700 people and has sales of Pounds 25m, is the
UK's fourth-biggest crisp-maker - behind Pepsico, Dalgety and United
Biscuits. 'A lot of representation has gone on through countries and vested
interests,' he says. 'But nothing suggests that we've got problems.'
Similarly, the Snack and Crisp Manufacturers' Association reckons it has
headed off any difficulties. 'We have done our homework,' says Keith
Nightingale, its director general. 'It looks like we will be able to use the
products that we wished to, in the future. We will be able to live with what
ultimately emerges.'
The word 'ultimately' is carefully chosen: the legislation enabling all
these changes has still to work its way through the European Parliament.
Nightingale suggests this means that the 412-strong list will not become law
from January.
However, others in and outside the industry disagree: the Single European
Act, they reckon, means that the list must come into force after the end of
this year, and the scientific committee can add more numbers to it - and,
possibly, subtract a few - as it goes along.
But it has still left some annoyed. 'It has been a political rather than a
scientific process,' says Millstone, who belongs to a lobby group called the
Food Additives Campaign Team. 'The negotiations have been between industry
and government, and communication with consumers has been excluded. The EC
didn't call a meeting of the Food Consumers' committee for five years;
people speaking for consumers were systematically excluded from the talks.'
Millstone agrees that some of the extra additives are harmless. But, he
says, 'consumers had felt some progress was made in the late 1980s with the
reduction in the number of additives such as colours. Now we will have
synthetic colours such as tartrazine and amarynth (E123) on this list'. The
fight against the Es could be ready to start all over again once the clock
strikes midnight at the end of 1992. So hang on to your prawn cocktail
crisps.

<TEXT>
Lucas, the aerospace and car components group recently shaken by some top
management turbulence, has moved swiftly to replace Tony Edwards, the head
of its aerospace division who abruptly decided two weeks ago to move to TI
Group.
The company has appointed Frank Turner, an old hand at Rolls-Royce, the
aero-engine and industrial power group, to take over as managing director of
its aerospace activities.
Turner, the current director of Rolls-Royce's civil engine business and a
well-known figure in the aerospace industry, will also join the Lucas board
at the end of this month.
Aged 49, the Yorkshire-born Turner (above), has spent his entire working
life with Rolls-Royce. He started as an apprentice and moved on to become
project manager of the RB211 engine assembly in the early 1970s. Before
becoming director of the company's civil engine business, his posts included
financial controller manufacturing, general manager production, director of
manufacturing for civil engines, director, company manufacturing
engineering, and of industrial and marine.
A strong marketing man, he was closely involved in Rolls-Royce's efforts to
expand its civil engine range and increase its market share at the expense
of the UK company's two US rivals, Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric.

FT  10 NOV 92 / People: Dales succeeds Hodson at Nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now is not the optimum time to become the finance director of a building
society. The best hope of Alistair Dales, who will become finance director
of Nationwide Building Society in January, is that things will have calmed
down by then after what he expects will be 'a rocky couple of months'.
Dales' short-term pessimism about society results due before the end of the
year is balanced by a suitably caut-ious optimism about the longer term. He
believes societies are 'on the way to the road to recovery' from
difficulties created by the slump in the domestic housing market.
He will succeed Daniel Hodson, deputy chief executive and finance director
of the society, whose appointment as chief executive of the London
International Financial Futures Exchange was announced at the end of last
month. But he is keen to dispel any notion that the change will lead to a
radical change of direction.
The most that Dales, aged 43 and currently divisional director for finance
and controls, contemplates is 'tweaking a couple of things at the edges'. He
expresses determination to carry on the policies of Hodson, who recruited
him from Morgan Guaranty to Nationwide in 1989. But he is not above
expressing public admiration for the 'degree of creativity' shown by other
societies in trying to stimulate sales, and rent repossessed properties:
'There is a lot to be done, but there is a lot of creativity out there, and
a commitment to get things sorted out.'
Tim Melville-Ross, the society's chief executive, is full of praise for
Dales' range of experience at Morgan Guaranty in Brussels, Amsterdam and
London. But his main task for the moment will be the hard graft of cutting
costs and improving operations in the traditional domestic business.

The world is full of frustrated or redundant senior managers looking for the
opportunity which will launch them in their own business. Most would prefer
a market niche where, in the early stages at least, they can build a company
without treading on the toes of larger, well-established players.
In late 1988 John Crathorne fitted the bill of the frustrated manager.
However, Stoves, the company he now heads, does not, at first sight, match
up to the specification of an ideal business.
For Stoves, the revamped cooker manufacturing arm of Yale &amp; Valor, is
fighting for a place in a market dominated by multinationals. The kitchen
appliance market is the almost exclusive preserve of global companies such
as Sweden's Electrolux, Whirlpool of the US, Bosch Siemens in Germany and
the Italian Merloni group (formerly Indesit).
These large companies have been developing global product ranges which
currently dominate many national markets. Smaller companies with a narrower
focus have either sold up or gone bust. Belling, a long-established UK
manufacturer of electric cookers, recently folded though the business was
subsequently acquired by Dimplex, a manufacturer of electric appliances.
So how does Stoves, with projected 1992-93 sales of less than Pounds 35m and
a workforce of just 570 people hope to prosper, let along survive?
Crathorne, a former executive chairman of Thorn EMI's major domestic
appliance division, believes the large multinationals' perceived strengths
are in fact their weakness.
Stoves, in contrast, concentrates on cookers, modifying their design to meet
the different cooking habits of each country. It has also adopted production
control techniques more commonly found only in far larger companies.
'You can have a global dishwasher, fridge or vacuum cleaner but cookers must
reflect national cooking methods,' he says. 'UK housewives do more baking
and want even browning. The French want a different heat balance. We may not
know as much about white goods in general as Electrolux but we know more
about cookers.'
The original idea for an upmarket, British-made consumer durable came from
Sean O'Connor, then a director of Lowe, an advertising agency, and now
deputy chairman of Stoves. But it was Crathorne who narrowed the search down
to cookers and who assembled a management team composed of senior managers
from other large white goods manufacturers.
When Yale &amp; Valor put its cookers division up for sale Crathorne won the
backing of buy-out financiers Candover for a Pounds 12m management buy-in.
In 1989, Crathorne's team took a 30 per cent stake in the business, which is
based at Prescot on the edge of Liverpool. 'It was a shell-shocked site,
desperately under-invested,' says Crathorne. 'The employees had long since
stopped trusting the management.'
One of the first steps of the new management was to move from a line
assembly system to one based on small groups or 'cells' of workers
responsible for the complete assembly. The idea was to make the job more
interesting and to give the workers responsibility for quality control.
Under the old system 70 per cent of cookers coming off the line had defects.
This figure is now down to just over 10 per cent.
At the same time Stoves moved towards a system of just-in-time delivery and
supply. It developed closer links with its suppliers and reduced their
number from 250 to just 50. Under the old system Stoves had 16 suppliers of
steel and carried Pounds 1m worth of stock. It now has one supplier and
carries Pounds 40,000 of stock.
It also began a switch from what Jeff Kane, manufacturing director and the
sole member of the old Yale &amp; Valor team to join the new management, calls
'hard tooling' to the use of computer numerically controlled (CNC) tools.
Formerly the company would make cooker chassis using heavy presses and
welding methods. Design changes took months to implement and were very
costly as new dies were made.
It now uses CNC equipment to bend, cut and punch the metal struts which make
up the cooker frames and water pressure to shape the sheet metal which forms
the cooker ovens or 'cavities'. In the year before the buy-in the company
introduced four new models. In the three years since it has launched more
than 200.
Installing the new production equipment took longer than expected but it now
gives the company far greater flexibility in developing new products.
Introducing a new cooker design using old tooling could take two years and
cost Pounds 100,000 but the company can now design a new cooker in just five
weeks at a cost of Pounds 2,000, says Kane.
Stoves protects its products and processes by registering patents at the
rate of one a month but believes that part of its defences depend on its
manufacturing methods. A competitor could copy a design in six months but
unless it had similar manufacturing processes it would have difficulty
replicating the exact design, says Ben Gostelow, engineering director and a
former design director at Electrolux.
This work on changing production methods has gone hand in hand with a
marketing campaign involving Pounds 400,000 in market research. The company
has long been a big supplier to British Gas showrooms and to the caravan
sector but Stoves has been working hard at developing new markets.
Stoves continues to supply its Valor range to the lower end of the market
but it is pushing its more expensive Stoves range. Brand loyalty is
practically non-existent in the cooker market, says Guy Weaver, marketing
director, so the market place is wide open to the new entrant.
Crathorne's team has taken the company from a Pounds 4m loss before the
buy-in to its first projected profit of more than Pounds 1m this year,
despite a 30 per cent contraction in the UK cooker market. It expects to
increase pre-tax profits to around Pounds 5m on turnover of Pounds 50m in
two years' time, without any increase in the size of its workforce.
So far so good. But can the company maintain this rate of improvement? As
long as Stoves remains a small player it will probably be left alone but
further growth may prompt a sterner response from the bigger companies.
While it has no immediate plans to increase the size of its workforce it may
find that further growth increases the need for control of its independent
'cell' structure. And can it maintain the productivity improvements achieved
once the novelty has worn off?
An even more fundamental problem is that of the ownership of the company.
The management is working to a five-year timetable to turn the company round
after which time financial backers and the managers themselves may want to
realise at least part of their investment. The danger is that Stoves would
then be bought up by a larger competitor with the risk of losing the
characteristics which have made it successful.

continues to decline - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The volume of large buy-out activity has been sharply reduced by the
recession but there has been a much smaller fall, just 10 per cent, in the
number of smaller buy-outs where management takes a majority stake,
according to a survey* by 3i, the venture capital group.
The review of 188 buy-outs financed by 3i showed that the average
price/earnings multiple fell from 7.5 to 6.1 per cent between 1989 and 1991.
Individual managers invested on average just Pounds 40,000 in their company
while the average investment by management teams was between Pounds 100,000
and Pounds 150,000.
The average ratio of debt to equity (gearing) of the buy-outs was relatively
constant over the three year period at 1.75:1.

More than half of small businesses in the UK make no use of personal
computers to improve their efficiency at work, according to a Mori survey
for IBM.
In spite of the oft-proclaimed 'workplace revolution' in the use of PCs, 53
per cent of businesses employing up to 10 people still manage invoicing and
accounts, letter writing and maintaining work schedules manually. However, 6
per cent of businesses are considering buying a PC 'in the short term'.
Businesses in the south are far more likely to have or to be considering
buying a PC than those in the Midlands and the north. Sixty-six per cent of
southern businesses have or plan to buy a PC compared with 46 per cent in
the north and 38 per cent in the Midlands.
Of those firms which do not have a PC, only one in four believes it would
help improve efficiency.

approach - In a Nutshell

Women who set up in business are more cautious in their financial
forecasting than men but are more likely to achieve their goals. Women
expect to achieve an average turnover of Pounds 50,000 in their first year
while men expect to reach Pounds 110,000, according to a survey by NOP
Corporate and Financial.
The difference cannot be entirely attributed to the different sectors which
men and women choose to work in because retailing was the most popular
sector for both sexes, the researchers said.
Men who originally expected their first year turnover to be Pounds 130,000
achieved only Pounds 120,000 in their first 18 months while women who
forecast sales of Pounds 45,000 in their first year managed Pounds 75,000
after 18 months.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Atlantic Computers disclosure - Legal
Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spicer and Oppenheim (now part of Touche Ross) has lost its battle to avoid
handing over to the administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings all
books, papers and other records relating to B&amp;C's 1988 acquisition of
Atlantic Computers, the collapsed computer leasing company.
Atlantic went under in April 1990 with a deficiency in its assets of some
Pounds 279m, shortly before B&amp;C itself went into administration. B&amp;C's
administrators felt there were 'serious questions' about Atlantic's business
and representations made to B&amp;C at the time which needed answering.
Spicers argued that, under the 1986 Insolvency Act, it only had to hand over
sufficient information to the administrators to 'reconstitute the state of
the company's knowledge' if it had remained solvent.
The Law Lords disagreed. The protection offered by the act lay not in
limiting the category of documents but in the fact that the person applying
for a production order had to satisfy the court that it was justified, and
that it would not impose an unreasonable burden on the person concerned. The
application was not necessarily unreasonable because it was inconvenient for
Spicers, or might provide ammunition for a claim against it.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: UK judge explains Court's balancing
act - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice's annual All Saints vacation last week gave
the judges time to pause and reflect on what lies ahead. In particular they
were busy preparing for the celebrations to mark the ECJ's 40th anniversary.
On December 4, the president of the Court, Judge Ole Due, will host an
anniversary meeting attended by, among others, his counterparts from the
Commission and the Parliament and, as a representative of the UK presidency
of the Council, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor.
States' rights
The UK judge, David Edward, speaking to the UK Association for European Law
in London on the subject of 'member states' rights', outlined how the Court
sees its current role against the backdrop of recent historical and
political developments in Europe.
He reminded his audience that the EC legal system is not static but responds
to the political and economic trends around it.
Until another institution undertook political responsibility for the
Community, the Court would continue to be criticised for its role, not
because it is a political court but because the issues which it deals with
are political, he said.
The economic and political dimension are relevant to the Court's
decision-making. The risk of legal incoherence would continue as long as it
was the ECJ which had to fill the political vacuum in the EC.
Relying on the flexible nature of the Rome treaty's constitutional charter,
the Court's approach to its task was increasingly expressed as a balancing
of the different economic and political interests represented by the
Community, the member states and individuals, Judge Edward said.
Coloroll pension trustees case
Judge Edward stressed the importance for international business of tracking
the development of this balancing exercise over the coming months, as
important cases in the fields of the internal market, competition, state
aids and state monopolies come before the Court.
Judge Edward referred, for example, to the Coloroll Pension Trustees case
(C-200/91) which follows on and seeks clarification of issues raised by the
Barber case. Even if the Maastricht treaty's protocol limits the application
of equal pay principles in the pensions context to after the Barber
decision, many complex questions about the practical effects of equal
pension rights remain to be answered.
The Court will hear the case at the end of January next year, along with
test cases from Germany and Holland which raise similar issues. The Court
will therefore have the opportunity to clarify in a pan-European context the
issues of retrospection and the use of sex-based mortality tables.
The Court must decide whether equality is required only for pension benefits
earned by service since May 17 1990, the date of the Barber judgment, or for
benefits which become payable after May 17 1990, whether they were earned by
service before or after that date. The difference in the cost of these
interpretations to British pension schemes has been estimated at Pounds
40bn.
The court will also have to decide whether the equal pay requirements of the
Rome treaty ban the use of mortality tables which reflect the differing life
expectancy of men and women. If they do, annuities, tax-free lump sums,
money purchase benefits and transfer values will all have to be calculated
on a unisex basis. This is a requirement of the Equal Rights Amendment in
the US, but is not usual in Europe.
As a measure of how important this case is to EC governments, the court will
hear submissions from the UK, Ireland, Holland, Germany and Denmark, as well
as the European Commission. The advocate general's opinion is expected by
April and the Court's judgment just before the start of the summer vacation
in July.
Sunday trading
Judge Edward also cited the Sunday trading cases as examples of the Court's
recognition of member states' rights, in the context of the Rome treaty's
free movement of goods rules, to maintain cultural and religious values,
subject to objective justification and proportionality. Judgment in the B&amp;Q
case (C-169/91) referred to the ECJ by the House of Lords is expected
shortly.
Another test case moving through the Court at the moment is the Vereniging
Veronica Omroep case (C-148/91). It concerns the compatibility with treaty
rules on free movement of capital, establishment and services, of the Dutch
television broadcasting authorisation rules. The Dutch law restricts the
business activities and investment freedom of licensed operators to achieve
pluralistic and cultural objectives. Advocate General Tesauro will deliver
his opinion to the Court on November 18.
In total there are more than 700 cases pending before the ECJ. These include
340 cases commenced in 1991 and more than 350 cases already filed in the
first nine months of 1992.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: City solicitors ride the recession -
British charges have not been cut and they compare unfavourably with big US
firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are British companies paying too much for legal services? Are the UK's top
commercial law firms really the most expensive in the world, charging
Dollars 235 an hour more than their US counterparts? Recent evidence
suggests the answer to both questions is yes.
First, the International Financial Law Review produced figures which showed
the average hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a top City of
London law firm has risen by 20 per cent over the last 12 months to Dollars
585 per hour.
The top rate for a partner in the most expensive Wall Street firms was
Dollars 350 per hour and the average hourly rate for partners in US law
firms was Dollars 230 (see table).
Then, Mrs Yve Newbold, Hanson company secretary, speaking at the English
solicitors' annual conference in Birmingham last month, attacked
'unrealistic' commercial law firms for their failure to reduce their
charging rates during the recession.
Finally, a Gallup survey of 200 large and medium-sized UK companies
published yesterday revealed that 57 per cent of companies using London law
firms and 48 per cent of all the companies surveyed felt they were paying
too much for legal advice.
Thirty-four per cent said they had been overcharged by lawyers in the past
two years.
The case for the prosecution looks strong but does it stand up to
cross-examination? Mrs Newbold stands by her criticism but is quick to point
out that Hanson has no problems with the law firms it uses.
The company is large and sophisticated enough and has sufficiently
experienced in-house lawyers to drive a hard bargain on rates. Her comments,
she said, were directed at companies which did not have this experience or
negotiating strength.
She knows of 'a number of City law firms' which 'it would not be fair to
name' charging Pounds 450 per hour for advice.
'That is totally unrealistic. Industry is having to be realistic. Top
management have had to take pay cuts. How many senior law firm partners have
taken a drop in their real income in recent years?'
Mr Barry O'Meara, ICI's deputy group solicitor, believes that if companies
are being taken for a ride on costs, it is their own fault.
'They must learn to treat legal services like any other raw material. They
would drive a hard bargain when buying widgets; why not when buying legal
advice?' he asks.
The solution is to keep a tight rein on how the law firm does the work. 'Any
businessman who gives a lawyer a free hand is a fool,' he adds.
The role of the internal lawyer is key to ensuring that law firms staff the
job correctly, do not follow irrelevant lines of inquiry and that the
correct level of lawyer is assigned to it.
Mr Peter Hall, general counsel for More O'Ferrall Adshel and chairman of the
Law Society's commerce and industry group, says that, although there is now
a much greater awareness among commercial law firms of the need to be
flexible in their approach to charging, there is still widespread concern
among his members about the level of costs in the middle of a recession.
He says one consequence of perceived overcharging by City law firms has been
a shift of routine work out of London to the large provincial law firms,
where it can often be done to the same standard at half or one-third of the
cost. This is borne out by the Gallup survey.
What about the case for the defence? City law firms are still remarkably
touchy on the subject of fees. Linklaters &amp; Paines, the UK's second biggest
law firm, is adamant that the days of law firms imposing fee structures and
hourly rates on their corporate clients are long gone.
Everything is negotiable, including fixed fees, success fees, premium rates
for technically demanding jobs, low rates for routine work, and discounts
where deals fall apart.
What about the accusation that UK lawyers are the most expensive in the
world? Mr Ken Walder, British Petroleum group general counsel, says the
apparent difference between the hourly rates of UK and US firms is largely a
product of the dollar exchange rate. The difference between the two has
narrowed considerably with the pound at Dollars 1.53.
He adds that methods of billing are very different, but that he would be
'astonished' if he got a bill from a UK firm for almost twice the amount
charged for similar work by a US firm.
Linklaters would not dispute that. But it adds that UK lawyers only charge
'a fraction' of the hours billed to clients by US lawyers each year, so a
comparison of hourly rates is meaningless. The International Financial Law
Review figures are simply not comparing like with like.
This is not an argument which cuts much ice with Mr Bruce Buck, the senior
London partner of New York law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom. 'If
they are billing less hours and at the end of the day the client is not
paying any less, then they are simply billing less hours at a much higher
rate.'
Wherever the truth lies in this debate, commercial lawyers still need to
beware. The Gallup survey revealed that 47 per cent of the companies
questioned felt their accountants had provided the best service over the
past 12 month, compared with only 36 per cent who rated their solicitors as
the best.
With multi-disciplinary professional partnerships just around the corner,
perhaps the writing is on the wall.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Shephard warned over spending on Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) yesterday warned Mrs
Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, that there must be no cuts to the
programme in Thursday's Autumn Statement.
The warning came as renewed tension emerged yesterday between the government
and business on the responsibility for and the financing of national
training programmes.
Mrs Shephard emphasised the responsibilities of business as far as training
is concerned to the conference: 'The main responsibility for developing the
potential of people in work rests with employers. That embraces all your
decisions about people - on recruitment, on training, on job changes and on
involvement.'
Employers spend more than Pounds 20bn a year on training, while the
government's expenditure on training programmes is Pounds 2.5bn. The
training programmes are supervised by Tecs, which are responsible for
delivering the government-funded schemes.
Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, the group of Tec leaders which liaises
with the government on behalf of the movement, told the conference: 'In the
Tecs, we recognise the problems of government in the public-expenditure
round. What we need, as well as adequate funds, is greater flexibility in
the use of our funds.'
The greater part of Tec funding is spent on youth training and the training
of unemployed adults. But under Treasury rules, Tecs have little flexibility
to switch money from one part of their budgets to another.
Mrs Shephard refused to be drawn on the funding arrangements for Tecs likely
to be contained in the Autumn Statement, but she acknowledged: 'We have some
way to go on flexibility'.
Mr Duncan Lawton, chief executive of British Vita, the polymer, fibre and
foam company, noted that the success of Tecs is based on the reputation of
their boards in local communities.
'If on Thursday we are going to be severely cut in spending, the reputation
of those boards will be dented. They will not be able to deliver,' he
warned. This, he added, would be 'immoral'.
Mrs Shephard told the conference: 'There is a tension between trying to give
these tremendously motivated business people as much freedom as we can in a
way which is consonant with the use of public funds'.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Rejoining the European exchange rate
mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN must ultimately rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, Sir
Leon Brittan, European Commission vice-president, told the conference
yesterday. However, it might be necessary to devise an interim stage before
returning to full membership, Tony Jackson writes.
'Past experience shows that a monetary lodestone is needed,' he said. 'In
the 1980s sterling M3 didn't work. Total government discretion, which is
what having a vast range of monetary indicators really means, is
insufficient.'
The Maastricht treaty had an important part to play in helping Britain out
of recession, Sir Leon said. 'Without Maastricht there would be an
atmosphere of uncertainty. The final outcome would be that a smaller group
of European countries would go it alone, leaving Britain in the second
division.'
Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman of Guinness and chairman of the CBI's Europe
committee, attacked British politicians opposed to Maastricht. 'They should
now acknowledge the damage they will do to business if their anti-European
feelings get the better of them,' he said.
Sir Anthony said he saw no real danger to British business within the
treaty. 'I believe it contains an awful lot that we need,' he said. 'It also
contains much we do not need but is harmless to business. So let those in
this country who oppose the treaty propose another practical way of getting
what we need or shut up.'

<TEXT>
IF YOU listen carefully to the platform party at this year's CBI conference,
you can almost hear the sound of purring. At long last the CBI is being
taken seriously by the government.
Cabinet ministers and civil servants have flocked to address the conference
and seek its opinions. For an organisation which spent much of the 1980s in
the shadows, the result is an unaccustomed glow of self-importance.
The change is not difficult to account for. The government has been giving
greater emphasis to stimulating growth than to combatting inflation. At the
same time, ministers appear to be losing faith in a consumer-led economic
revival. The only alternative is an investment-led recovery, and if the
government cannot afford such investment itself, it is up to the CBI's
membership to come to the rescue.
Whether those members are in the mood to oblige is altogether another
matter. The CBI's own surveys suggest that investment in plant and machinery
next year will fall for the fourth consecutive year.
The first report from its new National Manufacturing Council, produced with
a flourish on the first day of the conference, set a target of doubled
investment per employee by UK industry by the year 2000. From the
government's viewpoint, that may appear to be a somewhat leisurely
programme.
In return, the CBI seeks help from the government in the form of lower rates
of corporation tax and higher capital allowances. It also looks to the City
for easier bank finance and the acceptance of lower dividend payments to
shareholders.
That last point was returned to repeatedly by speakers from the floor
yesterday. The argument is familiar: that in competing nations such as
Germany and Japan, a much larger proportion of profits is retained for
investment rather than being paid out to shareholders. If that argument
really takes hold, the Stock Market had better look to the consequences.
There is however a further aspect of the debate which is causing the City
anxiety. The more that companies cut dividends, the more the average company
pension fund will find itself running short of income. Companies which
enjoyed pension holidays in the 1980s may accordingly find their profits
affected by the necessity to top up their funds. The more that costs, the
less there is to invest in plant and machinery.
There is a further reason the government should not feel overly sanguine
about CBI members rushing to save the economy by investing. It is one thing
for the organisation's leaders to be called in to talk to the prime minister
or the chancellor, as has happened during the past weeks. The rank and file,
some of whom will doubtless return from Harrogate only to lay off more
workers, are not included in the general euphoria.
In yesterday's debate on the UK economy, two calls most vociferously
applauded were that the Bank of England should be granted independence and
that the Treasury should be sacked en masse.
It may well be a step forward that the government is taking the CBI
seriously. A more important step would be for the CBI's members to return
the compliment.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten defends schools bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY April of next year 500 schools in England and Wales will have achieved
grant maintained status and opted out of control by local education
authorities, Mr John Patten, education secretary, predicted in the Commons
last night.
Moving the second reading of the Education Bill, he said the total would
probably be 'getting on for' 1,500 by April 1994, as forecast in the white
paper published in July.
Mr Patten's claim that in taking account of this development the bill
established a new framework for primary and secondary schools that would
endure well into the next century was hotly disputed by Labour MPs.
Mr Patten said the growing popularity of self-governing grant maintained
schools was reflected in the inclusion in the bill of provisions
establishing a new funding agency which would be responsible for authorising
their capital and recurrent expenditure.
As the number of grant-maintained schools grew, the funding agency would
take on a parallel duty to ensure a sufficiency of school places, he said.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, called the bill a 'dangerous
irrelevancy' which did not tackle the issues which most concerned parents -
over-sized classes, short-age of books and a lack of resources.
She warned that its emphasis on specialisation should be seen as a 'code
word' for selection, and pledged it would be opposed by Labour MPs at every
stage.

PEERS should be required to register special interests in the same way as
MPs in the Commons, the government was urged yesterday.
Tory Lord Marlesford said that in recent years 'institutions have been
undermined, in some cases by misbehaviour and real scandals, in others by
innuendo, often badly based and malicious'. He told the Lords: 'There are
two alternative defences: one, privacy and secrecy; and the other,
transparency. Isn't transparency by far the better approach?'
Lords Leader Lord Wakeham stressed that peers spoke 'on their personal
honour' and voluntarily declared any interests before they addressed the
House.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht legislation faces
obstacle course - The bill's timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY observer believed last week's government victory over Tory
Euro-sceptics marked the begining of the end of the Maastricht treaty's
ratification in the UK, the subsequent confusion has provided a sobering
lesson in the realities of Westminster procedures - and Conservative party
internal dynamics.
For government business managers trying to steer the bill through parliament
the way ahead resembles an obstacle course surrounded in fog. Nobody is
quite sure where the next hurdle lies or when the race will finish.
The outline timetable goes something like this:
Before Christmas the bill will return to the Commons for that start of its
'committee stage'. Two or three days will be set aside.
(The formal 'first reading' and two days of debate to give the bill a
'second reading,' and approve the broad principles of the legislation, took
place before the Danish referendum in June).
Euro-sceptics are certain to raise hundreds of points of order, each of
which has to be answered by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Commons speaker. This
may take several days.
Work will then begin on the hundreds of amendments tabled by Maastricht's
opponents and the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Even though not all
of these will be chosen for debate, and many of those that are will be
grouped, that will still leave a substantial number of separate discussions,
each of which could last a few hours. In practice little headway will be
made with the substance of the bill before MPs break for Christmas.
Time will be allocated throughout the first half of next year for the
Committee stage to continue, with other legislation considered concurrently.
There is no hint yet that the government plans to bring in a 'guillotine'
motion which would timetable debate. The official line is that the
Maastricht treaty includes important constitutional change deserving serious
consideration.
But the unspoken sub-text is that Euro-sceptics were told last week that the
'third reading' - which follows the committee stage line-by-line
consideration of the whole bill - will not come before the second Danish
referendum.
This, the government argues, will not be until May. While some cabinet
ministers believe the referendum and the third reading are not
interdependent, Downing Street is sticking to the line that May is the most
likely time for the Danish poll - and the third reading.
What happens if the detailed committee stage debate collapses well before
then - so the third reading could take place in April - is not clear. Also
unclear is what happens should the referendum in Denmark be delayed beyond
May.
If the bill is to complete its passage before the end of the current session
 -as it must do unless the process has to start all over again  - it must go
to the House of Lords before the summer recess.
Peers' consideration of the bill cannot start until after the Commons' third
reading. The process in the Lords is a similar mix of debate in principle
and discussion of detail, finishing with a third reading debate.
Although by convention peers do not throw out a bill that is a manifesto
commitment, with many of Maastricht's most vociferous opponents in the upper
house - including Baroness Thatcher - its passage there will not necessarily
be smooth.
If the Lords has amended the bill at all, it must return to the Commons, as
the final form of the legislation has to be agreed by both MPs and peers.
If MPs refuse to accept changes made in the Lords, the bill could 'ping
pong' back and forth between the two chambers until agreement is reached -
although the Commons always has the final say. This could mean a last-minute
rush to get the bill though before the end of the session. Usually the date
for the state opening of the next session is fixed well in advance for
sometime in November. The Queen cannot be delayed.
In the final - and purely technical - stage, the Queen signifies her
agreement, and this Royal Assent turns the bill into an Act, completing the
parliamentary process.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Obscure diners with a mind to spoil
the party - The new-found influence of the 92 Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER John Major might be forgiven for wanting a quiet supper on
Thursday - the day his chancellor presents what looks set to be a
controversial Autumn Statement.
His diary will tell him he is unlikely to be granted such a wish, since he
is due to dine with the 92 Group of Thatcherite rightwingers.
This 100-strong group of Tory backbenchers contains many of the 'enemy
within': those MPs who have been making the government's life a misery in
recent weeks by exploiting its slender Commons majority to push for
climbdowns on key aspects of economic and European policy.
Over the weekend, it turned its attention to forcing a more favourable
balance in the ranks of the chief policy-makers themselves. This culminated
on Sunday with a public demand by Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North and a
92 Group member, for the prime minister to take 'an early opportunity to
redress that balance and have a cabinet more representative of popular and
party opinion.'
In terms of raw power, the 92 - under the guileful chairmanship of Sir
George Gardiner, the veteran MP for true-blue Reigate - has never been more
of a force to be reckoned with. The government's anaemic majority and the
large proportion of the new Tory intake who have swiftly become
card-carrying members have seen to that.
When Sir George said publicly that he and four colleagues were preparing to
support the government in last week's critical Maastricht divisions, it was
front-page news. Its members form a powerful bloc on the executive of the
1922 committee, which acts as mouthpiece-in-chief of Tory backbench opinion.
But in some ways, the increasingly public profile that the 92 has adopted
since April's general election is an ironic indication of waning influence.
During the Thatcher years, the group was able to concentrate instead on
working behind the scenes to secure the election of sympathetic candidates
to the chairs of the most important Tory backbench committees, emerging
occasionally to take issue with those whose conduct it considered beyond the
pale.
A sign of the obscurity in which it has traditionally operated lies in the
number of seasoned Westminster observers who wrongly believe that the 92
owes its name to the year of its foundation. In fact, this derives from the
address - 92 Cheyne Walk in fashionable Chelsea - where it was established
several years ago.
Now, as Mr Carlisle's remarks imply, the corridors of real power are
insufficiently lined with 92 group sympathisers however full of them the
back benches may be.
The less than stellar qualities of some of those being proposed as
replacements for 'targeted' ministers like Mr William Waldegrave, public
services minister, and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, suggest that
this 'imbalance' may not quickly be corrected. Meanwhile, the views of those
deemed most likely to succeed Mr Major should he decide to throw in the
towel are if anything even less in tune with those on the right.
And there, in effect, is the rub: the nature of the 92 group's power is
purely destructive. If it is exercised to topple the present administration,
the group could be lumbered with a still more unsympathetic government.
If Mr Major is groping for an encouraging thought over the sherry on
Thursday, this may well be it.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo warns on cash cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night launched an
intensive campaign to prepare junior ministers and Conservative MPs for the
announcement of tough cutbacks in public expenditure in chancellor Norman
Lamont's Autumn Statement on Thursday.
In an exercise designed to minimise the chances that Thursday's statement
will provoke renewed unrest on the backbenches, Mr Portillo emphasised that
the spending curbs had the full support of the cabinet.
Warning that public borrowing would rise sharply as a result of the economic
recession, the chief secretary reminded his colleagues that the government's
economic successes during the 1980s had been built on tough spending
controls.
He warned that without similar restraint now it would be impossible to
deliver tax cuts before the general election due by 1997.
Mr Portillo, who has organised a series of meetings which will include every
Conservative MP before details of the spending and economic recovery package
are announced, said that it was essential the cabinet decisions received the
full backing of the parliamentary party.
He confirmed that a tight squeeze on public-sector pay awards - expected to
limit increases to less than 2 per cent - would be at the centre of a
spending deal which had protected many capital programmes.
It is understood, however, that the pay review bodies covering hundreds of
thousands of public sector workers will not be suspended for a year. Instead
they will be expected to take into account the government's economic
priorities when making their recommendations.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour spells out plan for 'New
Deal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR called on the government yesterday to abandon its hostility to an
industrial policy, set aside its planned spending cuts and use the public
sector as 'an engine of growth' to save the country from a slump.
Its plan for a 'British New Deal' also proposed to finance the package costs
by retaining stamp duty on share trans - actions, due to fall in April, and
by raising revenue through a one-off windfall levy on the turnover of the
privatised utility companies. The measures could be worth about Pounds 1.8bn
to the exchequer.
Labour's recovery programme came before a similar exercise today by the
Liberal Democrats as both parties try to pre-empt Thursday's Autumn
Statement by issuing alternative public-expenditure prescriptions.
Both parties will use their proposals as benchmarks against which to measure
those of Mr Norman Lamont. If the chancellor adopts some of their plans, he
will be accused of poaching and, where he does not, he will stand charged of
failing to do enough.
The Labour package fleshes out earlier demands for a comprehensive programme
of employment and training measures, valued at about Pounds 350m, capital
spending on environmental improvements and the phased release of local
authorities' capital receipts to boost house-building.
Announcing the package, shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown also called for a
cut in interest rates, investment incentives for industry, grants for medium
and smaller businesses, an export drive and talks with industrialists on
boosting output and sales.
Questioned on whether Labour would raise tax, he dismissed any such move as
likely to depress demand and rejected increased national insurance
contributions, now rumoured to be part of Mr Lamont's proposals.
He also appeared to have put on ice Labour's controversial 'shadow budget',
unveiled before the April election, which included the lifting of the
ceiling on NICs.
Mr Brown also said there should be changes to public accounting procedures,
supervised by a new council of independent economic advisers and
co-ordinated Community-wide efforts to stimulate growth.
Warning against 'one-off cosmetic initiatives' and short-term packages, he
said: 'The key is the immediate recovery programme accompanied by a long
term strategy for sustainable growth.'
In advance of unveiling the Liberal Democrats' recovery proposals today, Mr
Malcolm Bruce, the party's trade and industry spokesman, yesterday gave
examples of construction projects which could be launched quickly and would
create at least 450,000 jobs.
The measures, which they estimate would cost more than Pounds 4bn of public
money, include track renewal for British Rail; support for light railway
systems in areas such as the west Midlands and Leeds; and improvements to
the trunk road system.
The Liberal Democrats are keen that the row between the two main opposition
parties over last week's vote on Europe should not prevent them from working
together against the government's public spending plans.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, has written privately to Mr John Smith,
urging co-operation over the Autumn Statement.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Gazumping on repossessions rises sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLUMP in property prices has led to an increasing number of buyers being
'gazumped' by property developers making late bids for repossessed houses,
the ombudsman for corporate estate agents said yesterday.
The increase in complaints of gazumping on repossessions contributed to a 50
per cent increase in complaints about estate agents in the second year the
ombudsman has operated. Complaints rose to 1,864 in the year to August, from
1,236 in the previous year.
Mr David Quayle, the ombudsman, said he thought the anger of gazumped buyers
was usually 'wrongly directed' at estate agents. They did not appreciate the
risks of trying to buy a repossessed house.
Mr Quayle said building societies and others holding repossessed properties
had a legal duty to obtain the highest price. This often led to properties
being advertised even after an offer had been accepted subject to contract.'
Many buyers feel they have got a good bargain and they get upset when there
is a late bid, especially when they have spent money on fees,' he said.
Agents should explain that only a final contract ensured a deal.
The highest single award made by the ombudsman this year was Pounds 4,000 to
a property owner told by an estate agent that he had no hope of selling his
property. This estate agent had a client interested in buying the property.
Most awards were Pounds 100 to Pounds 500. There were only three of more
than Pounds 3,000. The biggest group of complaints was over alleged
maladministration.
Mr Quayle said the complaints represented 'only a very small percentage' of
the 315,000 successful residential property transactions in a single year.
He suggested two changes to common practice.
One is to charge dual commissions to sellers when an agent introduces a
prospective buyer before the handling of the sale is passed to a second
agent. He said this practice may not always be fair, even when contractually
justified.
He also said agents should draw up guidelines to make clear whether they are
obliged to disclose information to a potential buyer which may be damaging
to a sale.
The government's pledge to abolish stamp duty on the transfer of shares
should be postponed and the rate of duty doubled from 0.5 per cent to 1 per
cent, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday. It said the
measure would bring in about Pounds 2bn which could pay for measures to
boost the housing market.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Repaying debt is consumer priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS, unconvinced by lower interest rates, continued to make the
repayment of debt a priority last month.
Official figures out yesterday showed that consumers paid back Pounds 60m
more than they borrowed in September following a net repayment of Pounds 36m
in August.
Almost all of last month's fall in consumer credit was accounted for by a
big reduction in credit card debts. Lending by banks on credit cards that
are part of the Visa or Mastercard system fell by Pounds 58m, compared with
a fall of only Pounds 3m in August. Net lending by finance houses rose by
Pounds 6m, while loans by building societies fell by Pounds 8m.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office also showed that new credit
advanced to consumers rose to Pounds 4.4bn in September compared with Pounds
3.8bn in August. Economists said that last month's higher figure probably
reflected a big rise in loans on household goods, following a rush to buy
houses in August, before the stamp duty concession was removed.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brother said: 'Although
consumer credit remains weak, it has not shown a fresh collapse over the
summer.'
A broader measure of credit growth which includes bank loans on personal
accounts and lending by non-bank credit cards shows an acceleration in net
consumer credit growth in the latest quarter, compared with the second
quarter.
In the three months to the end of September, consumer lending according to
this measure expanded by Pounds 332m compared with the second quarter's
exceptionally low figure of Pounds 155m.
Although the narrow measure of consumer borrowing represents only about 15
per cent of total private sector debt - it does not include mortgages - it
is a useful snapshot on consumer behaviour.
The latest figures, for example, show that in the third quarter, consumer
credit fell by Pounds 18m, reflecting caution about the economic situation
and the high cost of borrowing. The figure compares with growth of Pounds
202m in the third quarter last year, and growth of Pounds 786m in the third
quarter of 1990.

FT  10 NOV 92 / British Coal rounds on critics over lost sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday rejected criticism that it had lost an opportunity to
sell large quantities of coal to ScottishPower when it responded to the
electricity generation and supply company's request for coal supply
quotations.
ScottishPower had asked coal producers to quote for the supply of 250,000
tonnes and indicated that it would consider buying further quantities if the
price was right.
Last week it agreed to buy 250,000 tonnes from British Coal and awarded
contracts for 100,000 tonnes from private Scottish opencast mines, plus
840,000 tonnes from suppliers in Australia, Poland, the former Soviet Union
and the US.
When ScottishPower's orders were announced, British Coal said that if it had
known the electricity company was interested in buying more than 250,000
tonnes it would have tendered accordingly.
ScottishPower said the tender document stated that it was prepared to buy
more than the basic tonnage and that it used the same wording as previous
tenders. In a 1991 tender, British Coal's offer of more than ScottishPower
had requested was accepted.
Yesterday Mr Malcolm Edwards, who resigned as British Coal's marketing
director earlier this year after a disagreement with Mr Neil Clarke,
chairman of the company, said: 'This is a very important bit of business
which is unlikely to recur.'
British Coal was unable to confirm yesterday that it had several hundred
thousand tonnes of opencast coal stockpiled on the surface in Scotland which
could have been sold to ScottishPower. It will anyway supply ScottishPower
with 2.5m tonnes of coal this year under contracts running to 1995.

FT  10 NOV 92 / FT Satellite Monitor: Fall in sales of TV dishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of satellite dishes were significantly down last month compared with
October last year and there is little sign that the Christmas selling period
has taken off.
The FT satellite monitor survey for last month found that 71,000 dishes had
been installed compared with 61,000 in September. In October last year more
than 100,000 dishes were sold or rented followed by a similar number in
November.
There has been a shortage of dishes from both Amstrad and Pace over the last
few weeks but this has now been eased. A Pounds 5m winter advertising
campaign has been launched.
November's sales figure should show whether the slowdown has been caused by
dish shortages or by a dampening of demand.
Over the past three years satellite television has grown at an average rate
of 900,000 homes a year and the new satellite television channels are now
available in 3.08m homes.
There has been a modest increase in demand, according to the monitor, which

FT  10 NOV 92 / Cheaper electricity at risk, power chief warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of National Power, the UK's largest electricity
generator, warned yesterday that protection of vested interests in the
energy industry may jeopardise the prospect of cheaper electricity.
Mr John Baker said that 'though it is inevitably going to be a slow process,
I have no doubt that electricity prices in the UK will continue to fall in
real terms as competition bites and cost savings continue to be passed to
the end user.'
He added, however, that this scenario assumed no outside intervention to
protect vested interests and to reduce the impact of market forces.
Mr Baker's warning was made at a Financial Times conference in London on
World Electricity, as he prepared to give evidence in the House of Commons
today to the select committee inquiring into the future of coal.
Mr Baker said the reorganisation of the UK electricity industry had shown
there was no 'immutable law which says electricity prices can only go up,
not down.' Competition was already providing significant impetus towards
lower prices when in Europe as a whole real prices tended to remain
stubbornly high.
'One reason is that a number of European countries have preferred a policy
of subsidising uneconomic domestic energy sources to buying more
competitively prices fuel in open world markets,' he said.
Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, speaking at the same
conference, called on the government to take a longer term approach to
energy planning and to move more rapidly towards a coherent energy policy
for the UK.
Mr Hann said that market forces may not be sufficient alone to guarantee
security of supply at 'competitive prices and without damaging the
environment beyond repair.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / Osman makes ninth freedom appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH evidence has come to light undermining the decision to extradite
fugitive banker Mr Lorrain Osman to Hong Kong to face multi-million-dollar
theft and fraud charges, the High Court was told today.
Mr Osman, 60, Britain's longest-serving unconvicted prisoner, was making his
ninth application in seven years for a writ of habeas corpus freeing him
from custody at Brixton prison in south London.
His lawyer, Mr Michael Mansfield QC, said statements incriminating him -
made by a key witness and self-confessed receiver of bribes - had been in
the possession of the Hong Kong government since 1984.
They were only released to the defence in recent months, he said, and
showed that vital evidence in the decision to extradite was 'totally
worthless'.
Mr Mansfield asked to seek a judicial review of the latest decision last
week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to order his removal to Hong
Kong. Mr Osman was committed in June 1987 to await extradition on 42 charges
 -later reduced to 39 - of theft, corruption and conspiracy to defraud.
All relate to the 1983 collapse of Carrian Investments, a shipping and
property group. Mr Osman was non-executive chairman of Carrian's creditor,
Bumiputra Malaysia Finance.
Mr Mansfield said the case involved allegations that loans by BMFL to
Carrian between 1979 and 1983 were made without proper security, involving
corrupt payments and false accounting. Ibrahim Jaafar, BMFL's chief
executive, providing evidence,
was granted 'unusually wide immunity' from prosecution - and allowed to keep
bribes, added Mr Mansfield.
Mr Jaafar had claimed that Mr Osman was involved in advancing Dollars 138m
in loans without adequate security.
Mr Mansfield said it had emerged that, in 1984, Mr Jaafar told Hong Kong's
commercial crime bureau that the loans were secured.
Clive Nicholls QC, for the Hong Kong authorities, accused Mr Osman of making
a 'grave and baseless' allegation. He said a fugitive was allowed to attack
the good faith of a state requesting extradition. 'However, we argue there
can be circumstances where the accusation itself is simply scandalous.'
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Reporting rules on pensions changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be required to show the impact of post-retirement benefits
such as medical costs more quickly and in more detail in their accounts,
under a tough new ruling introduced yesterday by the Urgent Issues Task
Force of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB).
Abstract 6 from the task force broadens the principles specified in SSAP 24,
the accounting standard for pension costs, to include other forms of
post-retirement benefits.
The ruling will principally affect UK companies with US subsidiaries, where
private medical costs and other benefits incurred by former employees run
into many millions of pounds.
It specifies that a company must show an annual charge through the profit
and loss account based on actuarial assumptions of the present value of any
future post-retirement benefits to be paid.
It will also have to show provisional liabilities in the balance sheet to
reflect these future costs, with a corresponding reduction in shareholders'
funds.
At present, most post-retirement benefits other than pensions are not
specifically funded by the company in advance. They are simply paid for and
treated in the accounts on a cash basis by being shown only in the year in
which they are paid out.
The new ruling instead follows the accruals principal by which accounts are
generally prepared. It echoes the line taken by FAS 106, a similar standard
on post-retirement benefits introduced recently by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board in the US.
The new consensus also requires additional disclosures in the accounts to
show any important assumptions for the measurement of post-retirement
benefits.
It becomes mandatory for companies' financial year-ends after December 23
1994, with transitional requirements after December 23 this year.
Separately, Fred 2, a draft financial reporting exposure draft which amends
SSAP 15, the existing accounting standard on deferred tax, proposes that
annual contributions on pensions and other post-retirement benefits can be
paid net of tax.

FT  10 NOV 92 / What future for coal?: Australia sees market chance in pit
closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE upheaval in the British coal industry comes as little surprise to
Australia which, as the world's leading coal exporter, has long seen the
rationalisation of much of Europe's coal production as inevitable.
Australia's industry could scarcely contrast more strongly with its British
counterpart. Australian producers see themselves as leading the world coal
industry with modern and expanding operations based on private ownership. Mr
Rod Charlton, manager, coal marketing services for Australia's MIM Holdings,
says his industry is targeting the UK for growth in sales of steaming coal -
largely used for power generation.
'Many Australian steaming coal brands have been successfully tested in the
UK and pit closures give us the chance to pick up business,' he says.
'We're not looking to the closures as a huge boost to our sales, but they
will reduce the excess thermal coal supply on world markets. In combination
with new power station building programmes in the Asia-Pacific region and
the probable closure of some German mines, the outlook over the next five
years is for steady improvement in the supply demand balance.'
Such an improvement would be welcome for the Australian industry which is
grappling with spot prices for thermal coal - used for steam raising - which
are about 25 per cent below contract rates. These spot prices are largely
unprofitable to Australian producers, even in Asia where they have a strong
freight advantage.
If UK electricity authorities were to seek replacement tonnage for British
Coal supplies through spot tenders, Australian producers would be unlikely
to feature as significant bidders. A freight disadvantage of about USDollars
6 a tonne against South African and US competitors would render UK spot
business unprofitable for almost all Australian suppliers.
The Australian industry's awareness of likely trends in the UK coal industry
was evident in a survey of world coal markets commissioned in May, 1991,
from Sydney-based consultants, Barlow Jonker.
The survey forecast continuing mine closures in Britain, leading to an
increased reliance on imported coal, though this was likely to be offset by
increased use of gas for power generation.
Like its UK counterpart, the Australian coal industry has not avoided
closures in recent years. The difference has been that most Australian
closures have been related to expansion of more efficient facilities which
have more than offset production cuts.
The result has been continuing overall growth in Australian coal production,
while productivity has more than doubled in the past decade to stand at
6,150 tonnes of saleable output per employee per year in 1991-92.
Much of this improvement reflects capital spending on modern plant and the
Barlow Jonker survey indicated the industry would need to spend a further
Dollars A3bn (Pounds 1.36bn) by 1995 to keep pace with expected Asian demand
growth.
But these expenditure plans come against a background of falling prices for
export coal. Latest earnings statistics from the Australian Coal Association
showed that almost half the coal companies in New South Wales incurred
losses in the latest period. Queensland, the other main coal exporting
state, does not release figures, but the ratio there is likely to have been
worse.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Rifkind blocks Pounds 2bn defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the defence secretary, appears to have fought off
demands from the Treasury for deep defence cuts in Thursday's public
spending review.
A proposal which would have reduced the department's Pounds 24bn annual
budget by about Pounds 2bn over three years has been abandoned, civil
servants said yesterday, though a smaller cut had not been ruled out.
Ministers decided that a Pounds 2bn reduction was 'not possible', said
sources. Mr Rifkind is said to have warned that thousands of jobs would be
lost and some companies might not survive if cuts were deep.
A modest cut should keep the MoD on the course set by the Options for Change
defence review in 1990. It might also allow the government to keep its
election manifesto promise not to cut the defence budget below Pounds 24bn a
year.
Last year's Autumn Statement on spending plans envisaged a 1992-3 defence
outlay of Pounds 24.1bn rising to Pounds 24.8bn by 1994-5. A small cut or a
freeze this year should avoid the need for another defence review, said the
sources.
But equipment, which takes the biggest slice of the defence budget at 37 per
cent, should still bear the brunt of cuts in the medium-term.
Projects under threat of postponement or cancellation include:
An upgrade to Challenger 1 tanks, which the MoD said performed only
'adequately' in the Gulf war. Vickers is the contractor and BAe, through
Royal Ordnance, would make a new gun.
The Pounds 700m Tornado GR1 aircraft mid-life upgrade, involving many
companies including GEC-Marconi and BAe. The project has begun, but the
heavy spending does not begin until 1996.
A Pounds 500m medium-range surface-to-air-missile to replace the already
retired Bloodhound. The procurement decision has been delayed several times
already and is now due in June next year. BAe and GEC-Marconi are among the
competitors for the contract.
The Trigat anti-tank missiles (Pounds 425m). The production phase has
already been cut from spending plans. The Treasury believes that the UK has
too many anti-tank systems.
Possible savings of up to Pounds 2bn to the UK with the European Fighter
Aircraft, arising from recent talks over how to cut the cost of the
four-nation project, would be made only in the second half of the decade.
Short-term savings will be hard to find. Cash has already been committed to
pay for staff cuts under the Options for Change review, while most large
capital projects do not call for heavy spending until the middle of the
decade.
