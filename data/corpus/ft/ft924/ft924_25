FT  10 NOV 92 / InterCity wants targets eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail's InterCity sector has told the government that it cannot meet
punctuality targets on some routes because lack of investment is making
services unreliable.
It has asked for changes in the Passenger's Charter to allow for lower
standards on routes such as the west coast main line between London Euston,
the West Midlands and the north-west.
However, it may also accept tougher standards for services on the east coast
main line between London King's Cross and Edinburgh, which has recently been
modernised at a cost of Pounds 700m.
The performance targets require InterCity to get 90 per cent of its trains
to their destinations within 10 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. In
the year to March, it managed only 84.1 per cent. Mr Chris Green,
InterCity's managing director, said it was unrealistic to expect all lines
to perform to the same standard because they had widely differing
characteristics.
He wants to switch to the system used by Network SouthEast which has
different targets for each of 15 different routes depending on the amount of
modernisation they have undergone.
Mr Green singled out the west coast main line which he said was
deteriorating badly because the government had yet to approve a Pounds 350m
programme of spending on urgently needed track works.
An announcement on the targets for next year is expected next month. The
Department of Transport said punctuality targets would remain as demanding
as possible and be raised where realistic.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Lift industry fights for breath in bargain basement:
Manufacturers warn that a fall in sales threatens to end UK production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK lift industry, which only three years ago was benefiting from the
construction boom , is stuck firmly in the bargain basement. Prices have
been slashed, hundreds of jobs have been lost, and small service companies
which dabbled in the new equipment business have collapsed along with their
customers in the building industry.
In real terms, the new lift market is probably at an all-time low. 'There's
never been a better time to buy a lift,' says Mr John Leingang, the stoical
chief executive at Otis, the US-owned liftmaker which leads the UK market.
With no end to the recession in sight, there are fears about the future of
lift manufacturing in the UK, which was formerly a net exporter of lifts but
has been a net importer during the past decade or so.
'I've not seen the market at such a low ebb, or so much pessimism, in the 20
years I have been in the industry,' says Mr David Fazakerley, director of
the National Association of Lift Manufacturers. 'The effect could be a shift
of manufacturing away from the UK.'
Just as in many other sectors of the engineering industry, the recession is
particularly painful because it follows the boom years of 1988 and 1989. The
industry was at full pelt, producing lifts for a construction sector that
was often too busy to take delivery on time. Even abandoned mineshafts were
pressed into service as lift stores, says Mr Fazakerley. 'We had lifts
stored all over Northamptonshire,' says Mr Kevin Gamble, managing director
of Northampton-based Express Lifts.
Skilled staff were being poached, sometimes in groups, as the liftmakers
tried to keep pace with their customers. Otis and Express, which dominate
the UK industry, thrived at the top end of the market - the
high-specification, custom-built and hence higher-margin lifts for lavish
new office blocks in the City and Docklands.
'US and Japanese companies were saying we've got to have a foothold in
Europe, and London was the logical place,' says Mr Leingang. 'But it was
clearly unsustainable . . . it was patently obvious that after the boom
there would have to be a crash.'
Otis had a contract worth nearly Pounds 40m to supply lifts to Canary Wharf;
most of the money was paid and final payments are being discussed with the
administrators. Express has about 280 lifts in the Docklands, including the
oldest at the Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels.
Lift-makers are still installing equipment in some big City projects, but
new orders at the top end of the market have virtually dried up, especially
in London. So, while Otis estimates the new lift market has almost halved
overall from 10,233 units in 1989 to a forecast 5,200 this year, the value
has dropped much more steeply: from Pounds 330m to Pounds 111m.
'You can buy the equivalent lift for about the same price as was paid in
1983,' says Mr Leingang, 'and I can't think of any way in which it would not
be a better lift for reliability and quality.'
At the lower end of the market, however, the fall has been less severe. Unit
sales last year of passenger hydraulic lifts, which cannot be used beyond
six-to-eight floors, dropped from 3,320 in 1989 to 2,077, underpinned by
sales to hospitals, nursing homes, and sheltered housing.
But the entry barriers to the standard lift market are lower, and a big push
by both Otis and Express into hydraulic lifts has intensified competition.
Mr Gamble sees the market staying flat at 2,000 units this year and next.
Even the lift refurbishment business, which normally acts
counter-cyclically, looks like slipping next year to Pounds 80m from Pounds
90m this year, says Mr Gamble. In a property recession, tenants put immense
pressure on landlords to refurbish in return for staying put, but this time
landlords are worried that their tenants will go bust anyway.
That leaves the lift maintenance market, which remains a steady earner.
However, landlords are cutting corners by extending service intervals,
potentially threatening safety. Mr Gamble sees the maintenance market, which
could normally be expected to grow in real terms, stabilising at Pounds 200m
a year until 1995.
Employment in the industry, which peaked at around 11,500, has fallen to
about 10,000, says Mr Fazakerley. As new equipment orders are completed,
numbers will fall further.
Otis has reduced employment by 25 per cent to 3,000, although the reduction
includes 150 overseas Otis employees brought in for Canary Wharf. Express, a
subsidiary of the UK's General Electric Company, has cut its workforce by
300 to 1,450, although it is still recruiting on its service side.
But the news is not all bad. Galvanised by a Nedo report in 1988 which
criticised the industry's failures to respond to customers' needs, the
liftmakers have sharpened up their act.
Both Otis and Express have withdrawn from national pay bargaining and have
negotiated productivity deals with employees. Otis has built a new service
and training centre in west London to strengthen its position in the
refurbishment market.
At Express, where profits have improved throughout the recession, Mr Gamble
has introduced project management to the lift industry, and manufacturing
has been reorganised. A new computer-aided design system is enabling the
company to make a single lift for the same cost as a larger batch.
All this has helped the larger companies weather the recession and to
compete hard for overseas orders. Last week Express announced the largest
order in its 75-year history: a Pounds 6.9m contract from the Singapore
Housing Development Board for 200 traction lifts.
But what the lift-makers need most is a boost to domestic demand, and nobody
is holding their breath for a rise in construction activity. 'It's going to
be a 4,000-5,000 unit market for the next five years,' says Mr Leingang.
Mr Fazakerley believes the recent one percentage point cut in interest rates
may halt any further decline, but Mr Gamble believes that even if interest
rates were to fall to two per cent, it would take two years for confidence
to return to normal levels.
Whatever happens, the heavy investment in the late 1980s in training new
employees has been turned to waste by the recession, and is unlikely to be
repeated.
Devaluation will add to the pressures on smaller companies which entered the
new equipment business during the boom - typically by 'packaging' thousands
of imported lifts parts - and are already suffering as customers delay
payments, nitpick over details - or go under.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Land Rover raises output of Discovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND ROVER is increasing production of its Discovery four-wheel-drive
leisure vehicle by about 10 per cent to 600 a week.
The move to the higher output level, which began yesterday, is to cater for
increased demand, particularly in the UK, Land Rover said last night.
It comes in the wake of the faint hopes raised by the statistics for October
new-vehicle registrations that the long and severe slump in UK sales of new
vehicles may at last be coming to an end.
Sales of new cars in October were 8.2 per cent higher than in the same month
a year ago, bringing sales in the first 10 months of the year to 1.4m,
although this is still 1.9 per cent lower than a year ago. Recovery hopes
were strengthened by registrations of new commercial vehicles also rising
last month, by 5.3 per cent.
Demand for the Discovery has been consistently ahead of the mainstream car
market, with UK sales up 19 per cent so far this year. This is the second
time within three months that Discovery output has increased. Earlier in the
year it was 500 a week.
No extra jobs will be created. The 8,000 workers at Land Rover's Birmingham
plant will meet the higher output levels through overtime and Saturday
working. And Land Rover said the number of workers was expected to continue
to fall by about 10 per cent a year through non-replacement of leavers and
improved productivity. The plant is to stay on single-shift working.
Land Rover's total output, which includes Range Rovers and Land Rovers, is
expected to remain unchanged this year at about 55,000. This is similar to
1991 but below the record 69,000 output of 1990.
About 70 per cent of Land Rover's total output is exported. The company
refused to forecast whether overseas sales would be boosted by sterling's
devaluation - the main factor behind an announcement by Volkswagen yesterday
that it is increasing its UK prices by an average of 2.9 per cent from
November 16.
Most leading car importers have been studying how best to raise prices after
the devaluation. They have delayed only because of the depressed state of
the market. Several German and French producers have already raised prices
in Italy following the lira devaluation.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz are expected to impose increases of up to 6 per cent,
and Volkswagen's is widely expected to be a two-stage increase, with a
second rise early next year.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Co-op Bank pay offer rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIFU, the banking union, yesterday rejected an offer from the Co-operative
Bank which it said would mean a pay freeze for nearly a third of staff.
The union says the bank wants to freeze the pay of staff paid above 'market
rates' in a switch to a system of performance-related pay.
The union said it was also unhappy that the bank had refused to give 'cast
iron' guarantees that there would be no compulsory redundancies.
The bank said that more than 1,000 workers had taken voluntary redundancy
over the past two years and that it intended to continue shedding jobs
voluntarily.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Sea dumping ban 'on course'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO phase out the dumping at sea of sewage sludge and industrial waste
are on course Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, last night told
delegates at the opening of a meeting of the London Dumping Convention.
Mr Gummer said the sewage ban would 'give the environment the benefit of the
doubt'.
He added: 'This applies especially to the sea, which is a common inheritance
of all nations.
'In the UK, major investments are being made to develop land-based
alternatives to sea dumping of industrial wastes and of sewage sludge.
'This will enable us to phase out our last remaining licences for sea
dumping of industrial wastes by early next year and to cease sea dumping of
sewage sludge by 1998.'
The London Dumping Convention was set up in 1972 to curb the disposal of
harmful wastes in the oceans.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Dairy Crest sells Dales creamery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HAWES creamery in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, has been sold for more
than Pounds 300,000 in a deal that means the continuation of the dale's
800-year cheesemaking tradition, Chris Tighe writes.
Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board manufacturing subsidiary, yesterday
announced the sale of the creamery and the Wensleydale Dairy Products
distribution business to a group including four former members of the Hawes
management.
Most of the money for the purchase has come from Mr John Gibson, a
businessman based at Masham, on the edge of Wensleydale.
The four former managers, who between them have more than 60 years of
cheesemaking experience, mainly at Hawes, provided the rest of the cash.
Mr Gibson said that the team hoped to move next week into the premises,
which closed in May. They plan to restart production before the end of this
year. Target turnover in the first year was 'several million pounds
sterling', he said. The business aims to employ 25 people by the middle of
next year.
The creamery will concentrate on making small Wensleydale cheeses for the
speciality market. Purchase of the Dairy Products distribution wing provides
a 400-strong customer order book on which to build, Mr Gibson said. The new
business will also lay greater stress on marketing, and develop a visitor
centre for tourists at the creamery.
The news, following months of uncertainty, was warmly welcomed in Hawes,
where the closure cost 59 jobs. 'It's wonderful news. Everybody's
delighted,' said local businessman Mr John Blackie, part of the Hawes Dairy
Rescue Committee which campaigned to save the creamery.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Businesses urged to back customer care
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES were yesterday urged to give priority to customer care as the
Institute of Trading Standards Administration launched National Consumer
Week.
Mr Tony Northcott, chairman of the institute's fair trading standards
committee, said business 'must be encouraged to make customer care their
first commitment, before, during and after a sale'.
He said increased consumer education meant many Britons now knew their
rights and responsibilities. He added: 'Playing by the rules, on both sides,
brings fair competition.'
Sir Gordon Borrie, the institute president, said there were two reasons why
the consumer must be given priority. The European single market meant there
was a danger of unequal standards, poor means of redress and the circulation
of unsafe or poor quality goods. The second reason was the difficult
economic climate, because in such times unscrupulous traders cut corners.

FT  10 NOV 92 / SIB threat to small advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the umbrella regulatory body for the
financial services industry, is to consider whether the entire industry
should continue to subsidise the contributions by independent financial
advisers to the investors' compensation scheme, it said yesterday.
A disproportionately large share of payouts under the scheme cover default
by independents. The end of cross-subsidisation could raise their
contributions significantly, driving many out of business.
'There must be a danger that the smaller members' existence would be
threatened if cross-subsidisation ended,' said Fimbra, the self-regulatory
body for independent financial advisers.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, in a departure from the stance of his
predecessor, has said that if the independent sector cannot stand on its
own, no special measures should be taken to maintain it.
The brokerage community in particular has objected to cross-subsidisation,
arguing that its members do not benefit from the services of the
independents and should not be held responsible for their excesses.
Mr Christopher Sharples, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority,
the self-regulatory body for the brokerages and investment banks, said: 'The
whole concept of cross-subsidisation is unacceptable to us.'
Members of his organisation paid an additional Pounds 1m to the compensation
scheme last year, and the cost could be significantly higher this year. 'I
am told the claims are coming in thick and fast,' he said.
The life insurance industry has been voluntarily subsidising contributions
from independents to the scheme. Last year life insurers paid an additional
Pounds 14m to cover levies on the independents.
Meanwhile, SIB also endorsed plans for members of a new self-regulatory body
for retail financial services to contribute up to Pounds 50m towards claims
on the compensation scheme. The Personal Investment Authority is expected to
include Fimbra members as well as the life insurers, some large independent
advisers and the financial services arms of banks and building societies.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: Trial collapse prompts US
questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial triggered an immediate political
reaction in Washington, where the Bush Administration has been accused by
members of Congress of covering up its knowledge and possible involvement in
the activities of the UK company's Ohio affiliate.
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, has accused the
White House of covering up the entire Matrix affair, especially as the
machine tools maker was financed by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The BNL affair, along with the role of Matrix and other companies, has been
dubbed 'Iraqgate' in the US. Mr Bill Clinton, the president-elect, called
during his campaign for a special prosecutor to investigate the affair.
Congressional investigators have compared the trial of Mr Paul Henderson,
the former Matrix managing director who worked for British intelligence
services, to the US court hearings concerning Mr Christopher Drogoul, the
former BNL Atlanta manager who said he lent Dollars 5bn to Iraq with the
knowledge and approval of US government officials.
The US assets of Matrix - which was the linchpin of Iraq's clandestine
military procurement network - were frozen two years ago by the US Treasury,
as were the assets of Mr Anees Mansour Wadi, an Iraqi associate of Matrix
whose California company (Bay Industries) was also identified by the US
government as part of Baghdad's arms supply network.
Congressional investigators said yesterday the disclosure in London that the
UK government also knew of Matrix's relations with Mr Carlos Cardoen, the
Chilean arms supplier of Saddam Hussein, appeared to contradict previous
denials by the White House that Washington gave covert support to Mr
Cardoen.
Mr Dennis Kane, the House Banking Committee staffer who has led
Congressional investigations into the Iraqgate affair, said the developments
in London were of signal importance. 'President Bush, Brent Scowcroft, his
national security adviser, and other officials have claimed it was not US
policy to arm Iraq. Revelations in the Matrix Churchill case raise serious
questions about the veracity of their statements and raise the question of
whether the US in fact illegally helped to arm Saddam Hussein.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: A raffish ex-minister of whom
myths are made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENTLEMANLY, unpredictable, wealthy, sardonic, and brimming with
self-confidence bordering on arrogance, Mr Alan Clark, the former defence
minister, is a rich character in every sense of the word.
Some of the stories about him may be apocryphal but he is the sort of
raffish character who attracts and almost revels in myths about him.
On becoming a minister he was supposed to have looked at the modest official
car provided and remarked: 'You expect me to get in that?' before arranging
for his own Jaguar to convey him with suitable dignity.
Mr Clark often enraged others. He accused some European countries of
'running for the cellars' during the Gulf war and once referred to
'bongo-bongo land' during a discussion about immigration.
He survived partly because he was close to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former
prime minister, who appreciated his quirkiness and maverick free-market
zeal.
After serving in the MoD and the DTI and following nearly 20 years in
parliament, he stood down as MP for Plymouth Sutton at the general election
 -and managed to infuriate his constituency party by making his announcement
at the 11th hour.
With the Commons now bereft of many of the strongest characters of the
1980s, he would perhaps have been too colourful a character to have enjoyed
himself much longer.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: A juggling act between business
and espionage - 'I never saw myself as a spy but I suppose that is exactly
what I was,' says British businessman who risked life for MI6
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE engineering heartland of the Midlands which moulded businessman Mr Paul
Henderson might have been a world away from Whitehall when he stepped off a
train at Euston station one day in September 1989 to be greeted by his
control officer.
This was Henderson, the spy, a man who for the best part of 20 years had
been risking his life for British intelligence.
In his first full interview to be published after the end of his trial
yesterday, Mr Henderson spoke about his secret life and how he juggled the
role of businessman and spy.
For years he had placed his life in the safe-keeping of MI6, which he had
long since come to trust. It was a trust that would be sorely tested in the
months ahead.
He recalled the rest of that September day. A chauffeur-driven grey Ford
Granada took them to a building overlooking the Mall. They were escorted
into an opulent room for a day-long session of intense questioning.
Seated on one side of an oval table was Mr Henderson, managing director of
Matrix Churchill, the Coventry machine tool manufacturer he had joined as a
boy apprentice more than 30 years earlier.
Facing him was a panel of six officers, mostly scientists attached to MI6.
All were introduced using first names only. They proceeded to drain him of
his knowledge of Eastern Europe and Iraq.
They broke for lunch and walked the short distance to a gentleman's club in
Pall Mall. Fresh scientists were introduced for the afternoon session, which
concentrated on eastern Europe. When the session ended, the party walked
across to the Foreign Office before they dispersed.
'Later I went back and retraced my steps. I must have walked that route 10
times, from the house, to the club, back to the house and over to the
Foreign Office to be sure of where I went that day,' said Mr Henderson.
Even now, with the Cold War and the Gulf war part of history, he refuses to
disclose the full details of what he revealed. Part of what he told them
emerged in the trial. Another part remains veiled in spite of his
disillusionment with an intelligence service which he had loyally served
since 1973.
For the best part of 20 years he concealed his intelligence work from his
colleagues and family, including his wife. Only his close friend and
colleague Mr Mark Gutteridge was party to the secret and Mr Gutteridge was
himself encouraged to pass information to the intelligence services.
Mr Henderson was working in a deadly business for which he could have paid
with his life. He worked to basic ground rules. 'I never made notes or
contacted anyone in a country in which I was staying. I never made phone
calls,' he said. He was told by his controllers always to memorise numbers
and names. 'My memory was not that good and I wrote the numbers down against
made-up names,' he said.
His first encounter with British intelligence was in 1973 when he became
managing director of Matrix Churchill International, which handled the
export sales of the machine tools division within the TI Group of companies,
to which Matrix Churchill then belonged.
Four officers of MI6 - two men and two women - visited the factory to give a
briefing on what to do and what not to do for sales staff working behind the
Iron Curtain. 'It was a bit late for me because I had already been
travelling there for four years. But it was all pretty common-sense stuff,'
he said.
A few days later one of the women phoned back. For the next two or three
years she became his controller. They met in pubs and cafes whenever he
returned from his visits to the eastern bloc. 'I went to every eastern bloc
country in that time. I was travelling eight months of the year,' he said.
Over the years his controllers changed but they remained hungry for
information. 'They would tell me what they were looking for and I would
decide whether I would do it or not; simple as that,' said Mr Henderson. He
was never paid and never asked for payment. 'I did it because at the end of
the day I thought it was the right thing to do and it was helping my
country,' he said.
'I never saw myself as a spy but I suppose at the end of the day that's
exactly what I was doing.'
His business was machine tools, a business for which Britain was once
renowned. Matrix made lathes that could turn almost anything from kettles to
colanders. They could make shell casings and had served the munitions
industry for more than 100 years.
The company traded heavily with the Soviet bloc and had 1,200 machine tools
installed in the Soviet Union. 'You don't sell a thousand machine tools to
the Soviet Union without some having a military capability,' he said.
In 1986 Mr Henderson was elevated to the prestigious position of joint
chairman of the Anglo Soviet Working Group on the development of machine
tool trade. The other joint chairman was Mr Boris Kurakin, a deputy minister
of machine tool manufacture in the Soviet Union. Then, in 1987, at the end
of the Iran-Iraq war, a delegation of Iraqis introduced by an Essex
businessman called Mr Roy Ricks visited Matrix.
'I didn't think we would get any business out of them and thought we were
wasting our time,' said Mr Henderson. The company received a Pounds 19m
order for CNC lathes to be used in the manufacture of 80mm, 122mm and 155mm
shells. Their use for Iraq's munitions industry was accepted by the then
trade minister Mr Alan Clark.
Other machine tool companies were also reaping the benefits of Iraqi orders
to re-equip its defence industries. BSA Tools, Colchester Lathes and Wickman
Bennet all had orders for machine tools for the Iraqi defence industry.
The UK had a policy against supplying Iran or Iraq with potentially lethal
equipment but, as Mr Clark later told the court, this was an 'elastic'
policy which could be stretched to include machine tools.
Later that year TI, the parent company, was contacted again by Mr Ricks on
behalf of Iraqi interests which wanted to buy Matrix. The Iraqis had made
earlier inquiries at other machine tool companies. Sir John Cuckney, the
former MI5 officer who had been a non-executive deputy chairman of TI at the
time of the sale, said later that there had been nothing unusual about
selling Matrix to an Iraqi company. The price had been a good one and TI had
wanted to sell it.
Mr Henderson now believes that the deal had greater significance. 'There is
no doubt in my mind that the business was sold to the Iraqis so that we
could monitor them.'
Mr Henderson put the deal together, negotiating with Iraqi intelligence
officers posing as businessmen. He recalls Dr Safa Habobi wearing the
military uniform of a brigadier, but this was not unusual in the Ba'ath
Party where everyone has a right to a military rank. Mr Henderson would
later be told by MI6 that Habobi was a member of Iraqi intelligence.
The Iraqi ownership gave Mr Henderson the perfect opening. He could now
amass information for the British government while doing business for his
company. 'I used to drink with Iraqi officials until two or three (in the
morning),' he said. 'Booze is a great loosener of the tongue. I found things
out that maybe I shouldn't have found out.'
Was he aware of the risks he was taking? 'After a couple of years I suddenly
began to realise that at the end of the day I was putting myself at risk.
But that was all there was to it.'
From mid 1988 his MI6 controller repeatedly asked one question: did he know
anything about project Babylon? 'I was confusing this at first with the Lion
of Babylon programme which referred to the refurbishment of tanks. It was
only later I understood they were asking me about the supergun programme.'
With hindsight, this was a vital clue which suggests that British
intelligence may have begun assembling a picture of Iraq's supergun project
as early as mid 1988. This is earlier than any intelligence officer has
admitted to MPs.
It has taken two years for Mr Henderson and his lawyers to piece together
the broader picture of the British government relationship with Iraq. It
took an Old Bailey trial to drag it out into the open.
For future businessmen who might do as he did he warns. 'Make sure you have
everything in writing.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: Secret support of Saddam that
went to the top - Cabinet ministers 'sought to suppress evidence' /
Documents indicate Foreign Office warned of arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT took the trial of three Midlands businessmen at the Old Bailey to provide
the first firm evidence that the UK government encouraged shipments to
Saddam Hussein's military machine and that senior ministers were aware of
this policy.
Documents released yesterday give the first detailed information on how the
government allowed the machine tool industry to make shipments with a known
military purpose.
Hundreds of pages of memos and letters between senior Whitehall officials
show that senior ministers in the Thatcher government were aware of what was
going on.
They also indicate that the former prime minister was kept abreast of the
Whitehall debate over exports to Saddam's military machine which continued
to within weeks of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Few British trials have been so dominated by a sub-plot of political
intrigue. An array of witness box confessions came from senior civil
servants, officers from MI6 and MI5 giving evidence behind screens, and Mr
Alan Clark, the pugnacious former defence minister under Mrs Thatcher.
Four ministers, three of them cabinet members, tried to suppress the
evidence, the defence claimed. They failed and yesterday the case,
prosecuted by Customs and Excise, collapsed amid recrimination and
embarrassment.
The tide for the defence, representing three former executives of the
Coventry lathe manufacturer Matrix Churchill accused of exporting restricted
machine tools to Iraq, began to turn when Judge Brian Smedley agreed to the
release of some 500 previously classified documents.
Mr Kevin Robinson, solicitor for Mr Paul Henderson, former managing director
of Matrix, said afterwards: 'It was like treading in a field of diamonds.
Every document was damaging, said Mr Robinson. But what he called 'the
Koh-i-Noor' was a typed sheet from the Middle East section of the Foreign
Office with a handwritten note. Signed by an official on the Middle East
desk called Michael Blackley and marked confidential, it warned that a UN
arms embargo in January 1988 would affect the shipment of machine tools to
Iraq: 'The licences should not for the moment be revoked,' it said, 'but if
it becomes public knowledge that the tools are to be used to make munitions,
deliveries would have to stop at once . . . the companies should be warned
of the falling guillotine and urged to produce and ship as fast as they
can.'
The drama which ended in court yesterday began in the middle of the bloody
Iran-Iraq war, in October 1984. Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary,
declared an embargo on the supply of lethal equipment to either side.
Ministers pretended that this remained policy when the war ended but, by the
end of 1988, Iraq had become the third biggest market for machine tools,
much of them so-called dual-use equipment. The bulk of the documents suggest
that the desire to sell to the Iraqi military was primarily trade-driven.
However, minutes of a meeting of top Whitehall officials in March 1989,
marked 'secret', say guidelines for sales of arms to Iran and Iraq should be
more 'flexibly' applied to Baghdad.
Matrix was one of a dozen British companies secretly allowed to supply
Saddam with arms-related technology.
In March 1989 the DTI, with the backing of the Foreign Office and the MoD,
approved the export to Iraq by Matrix of spohisticated lathe equipment
which, the documents show, officials knew could be used for developing
nuclear weapons.
A February 1989 note from the private secretary of Mr William Waldegrave
when he was a foreign office minister says the Matrix 'machinery in question
has legitimate civil uses - but could also be employed in munitions
manufacture, or even uranium enrichment'. The letter said Mr Waldegrave was
inclined to support the applications.
According to the documents released yesterday, the DTI and Customs allowed a
final order of machines for making fuses to be sent to Iraq on July 27 1990
 -less than two weeks before the invasion of Kuwait.
The ostensible reason for the collapse of the trial was that the evidence
given by Mr Clark contradicted the case brought by Customs.
It is now clear that his evidence was only part of the story. Confidential
memos show the information on the sale of dual-use equipment to Iraq was
going all the way up to Mrs Thatcher.
A memo in June 1990 from Mr Martin Stanley, principal private secretary to
Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, to Customs makes it
clear that Customs action against Matrix would be discussed by Mrs Thatcher
and her ministers.
Whitehall concern had become apparent six days earlier in a memo from a
senior DTI official to Mr Ridley. 'The dirty washing liable to emerge from
the action proposed by Customs and Excise will add to the problems caused by
the gun (the Supergun). For the DTI the timing is extrordinarily
embarrassing given recent correspondence between ourselves, MoD and FO.'
A DTI memo intended for the prime minister warned of repercussions on more
than Pounds 1bn of export credit guarantees for Iraq.
Before the trial cabinet ministers Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Malcolm Rifkind and
Mr Michael Heseltine, along with Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office
minister, all signed 'public interest immunity' certificates seeking to
prevent any documentary evidence from their departments being used in open
court.
A number of companies were encouraged to export arms-related equipment to
Iraq. But only Matrix was charged with evading DTI controls. That Customs
maintained its prosecution knowing what would emerge and the embarrassment
it would cause is intriguing. Some point to its independent role as a
prosecutor and to its frustration with the DTI at obtaining any convictions
over the Supergun affair.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: Industry reeling from trade bans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S machine-tool industry has been decimated by the loss of business
resulting from embargoes on Iraq.
In 1986 the UK machine-tool industry had no exports to Iraq. This was before
the Department of Trade and Industry sponsored British companies to take
part in Iraq's first international trade fair following the end of the
Iran-Iraq war.
In the space of two years UK machine-tool manufacturers were enjoying sales
of Pounds 31.4m, promoting Iraq to number three after the US and West
Germany in the table of machine-tool export markets.
Most of Britain's machine-tool makers had exports to Iraq. Many of the
exports were being used for the manufacture of munitions.
Seven years later, with the Iraqi market destroyed and with the refusal of
the government to countenance a new market in Iran, the UK survivors of the
high-technology end of the industry can be counted on one hand.
Matrix Churchill, the company with the biggest Iraqi orders, is in
receivership; Wickman Bennett of Coventry has also ceased production. It
agreed a fine with Customs and Excise over exports to Iraq.
Colchester Lathes, another exporter to Iraq and part of the 600 Group, has
merged into its sister company. Bridgeport, which had been planning to
produce machines under licence for Iraq, has closed part of its operations
and trimmed others. Brown and Sharpe, which had subcontract work with Iraq,
no longer makes machine tools in the UK.
Executives of four machine-tool companies were questioned by Customs and
Excise but charges were only pursued against three at Matrix Churchill. One
case is outstanding - against Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA Tools.
Customs officials admitted yesterday the prosecution was now in doubt but
they said no decision had been made.
Mr John Nosworthy, former director-general of the Machine Tools Technologies
Association, said: 'It appears that HM Customs took some pretty drastic
measures in investigating industry, but may not have been as thorough in
investigating what government departments were up to.'
He accused the government of damaging the industry by allowing the trial to
proceed.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Congress leaders jostle for power: After the election, the
race is on to join the purse-strings committees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE transition team of President-elect Bill Clinton is moving cautiously
towards the creation of a new administration, but in the legislative branch
of the US government, congressional leaders are wasting no time regrouping
after last week's elections.
New senators flew to Washington yesterday to be sworn in, and Speaker Thomas
Foley went with other Democratic leaders to Chicago to meet the House of
Representatives' new intake.
While the new members were being inducted, the veterans of Capitol Hill were
already jockeying for position. House members began yesterday picking over -
in strict order of seniority - the list of vacant office suites, and
elections are due to be held today for several key Senate party posts.
Most of the posts are uncontested, but a fierce, if covert, battle is being
waged by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to oust Senator Phil Gramm of
Texas from the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
which Mr Gramm has used to launch his 1996 presidential campaign.
Most critical of all, however, is the allocation of committee assignments
next month, with an unusual number of open seats on the prized financial
committees up for grabs.
The committees that preside over taxation and spending - the House ways and
means committee and the Senate finance committee for taxation, and the
appropriations committees of both chambers for spending - wield enormous
influence because of their control over the purse strings.
The Senate appropriations committee has seen relatively little turnover, but
13 of the 59 members of the House appropriations committee have retired and
six more were defeated in primaries or elections. They include three
chairmen of the subcommittees that control spending in specific sectors.
Among those stepping up will be Congressman Bob Carr of Michigan, expected
to become head of the transportation subcommittee, and Congressman Louis
Stokes of Ohio, who will take over the veterans, housing and independent
agencies subcommittee, which includes the space budget in its domain.
One critical question is the future of 82-year-old Congressman Jamie
Whitten, who chairs the full appropriations committee and its agriculture
subcommittee. He was compelled by illness during the last Congress to hand
over day-to-day responsibilities to Congressman William Natcher of Kentucky,
a year older but much fitter.
Some Democrats are urging a breach of the normal seniority rules to place a
younger member, such as Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin, in the
committee's chair. The senior Republican on appropriations, Congressman
Joseph McDade of Pennsylvania, could also be ousted because of his recent
indictment on charges of bribery.
No such coup is expected against Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of
ways and means, but of his committee's 36 members, 13 have left Congress.
The selection of new members to replace them will be particularly important
because of ways and means' jurisdiction over health care issues, which are
expected to be high on the agenda of both the Clinton administration and the
new Congress.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Pressure growing for Mexican electoral reform: Nafta and the
economy are causing problems for Salinas too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, now entering his fifth year in
office, these are anxious times.
The country's current account deficit widened earlier this year just as
foreign capital dried up, forcing the government to raise interest rates to
ensure continued inflows of finance and to slow growth.
Pressure is intensifying on Mr Salinas to reform a political system which
has ensured that the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held power
for 63 years. While this agenda includes a reform of the party that brought
him to office, he has to be careful that the reforms do not so split the PRI
that it loses the 1994 presidential election.
Further complicating matters, his friend and ally to the north - President
George Bush - has been voted out of office, adding to uncertainty over one
of Mr Salinas's central policies, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Without Nafta's ratification, Mr Salinas will be seen to have lost his
biggest gamble.
The issues facing Mr Salinas are linked. If Mexico's regional politics
degenerate into violence in the coming year, it will hurt the chances for
ratification of Nafta. Without Nafta, the level of investment required to
sustain growth and the current account deficit will be difficult to achieve.
Without an upturn in growth in 1994, the prospects for the PRI in the
presidential elections will be weakened.
Mr Salinas will have at the very least a central role in choosing the PRI's
presidential candidate next year even if, as seems unlikely, the traditional
dedazo - the presidential nomination which has in the past effectively
appointed the next president - is diluted to give the rank and file of the
party a bigger say.
Before then, he will want to defuse the controversies which have followed
the election of PRI candidates for a handful of state governorships. Mr
Salinas is widely held to have intervened to replace the governors, the
latest in the state of Michoacan, following protests about alleged fraud
from the left-of-centre Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).
Such protests have fatally weakened the credibility of Mexico's electoral
rules, while the gubernatorial resignations have divided the PRI rank and
file, and strengthened the opposition. With less than two years before the
presidential election, Mr Salinas needs to change the system fast.
In his state of the union address this month Mr Salinas outlined his
strategy to defuse this tension, through further reform of the federal
electoral system to provide a model which will be followed by the states.
The proposals are expected to be passed into law next year.
According to government officials, the proposals include ceilings on private
campaign contributions and expenditure, more public funding, auditing of
campaign revenue, rules to ensure fair access to the news media, in
particular television, and greater independence for the bodies overseeing
the election. Parties will have the right to veto who sits on the electoral
bodies.
Although reforms are unlikely to satisfy the PRD - the advantage of
incumbency is so huge in Mexico that a level playing field for all parties
may be impossible to secure - Mr Salinas's more immediate problem may be the
damaging effect on morale of PRI party members.
Many PRIistas are already hugely dissatisfied with the way Mr Salinas has
undermined their power, and the president is still calling for further
reform of the party, in its finances, ideology, candidate selection and
internal structure. The reform, he told the Financial Times, 'has not
finished, it has to go further, and the elements have to be defended as such
as part of a deepening process of reform'.
The state of the union address also gave clues about how Mr Salinas would
approach economic problems. There was an unequivocal commitment that fiscal
policy would not be loosened in an attempt to accelerate growth. The
government plans a budget surplus next year to follow this year's.
Furthermore, government officials say other economic reforms can be
expected.
These include a simplification of the 1973 foreign investment law, which
will leave foreign investment excluded from only a small number of
industries viewed as strategic.
The government is also working on plans to make the central bank
independent, a significant step likely to be interpreted positively by
financial markets and business. 'I'm convinced that a strong professional
and experienced central bank is essential for any process of reform,' said
the president, hinting at a change other government officials say is
forthcoming.
The government hopes these and other measures will consolidate and
institutionalise the economic reforms it has already passed. 'We must
emphatically make this deep process of reform part of the everyday life of
the population.
'That's when the reforms become institutionalised. Then they won't depend on
individuals for them to be successful or permanent. Institutional reform is
a fundamental element,' Mr Salinas said.

BRAZIL'S interim President Itamar Franco reacted angrily yesterday to
allegations that he had been a financial beneficiary of the corruption scam
that caused the demise of his predecessor, Mr Fernando Collor, and brought
him to power last month.
The charges were made by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the alleged front-man in the
multi-million-dollar kickback scheme, who told reporters he had given money
to Mr Franco while he was Mr Collor's vice president and during the 1989
elections.
The claim sent the nervous Brazilian stock markets falling again.
A furious Mr Franco challenged Mr Farias to present a copy of any cheque
made out to him.
Prosecution lawyers in Mr Collor's impeachment trial yesterday completed
their report to the Senate, accusing him of 20 crimes, including electoral
malpractice, tax evasion, and 'crimes of responsibility'.

FT  10 NOV 92 / US savings and loan supervisor to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Timothy Ryan said yesterday that he would step down next month as
director of the US Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision after three years
in charge of the recovering savings and loan industry.
Mr Ryan told the annual meeting of the Savings and Community Bankers of
America in San Diego that the overhaul of the S&amp;L, or thrift, industry was
'virtually complete'.
'Together we have made the savings and loan business into an industry of
strong, well-capitalised, profitable institutions,' he said in the text of a
speech prepared for delivery yesterday.
Four years ago, Mr Ryan said, the 3,100 thrifts in the US were between them
losing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m) a month.
Their capital amounted to just 0.33 per cent of their combined assets of
Dollars 1,300bn.
In the first half of 1992, he said, the 2,000 surviving thrifts made Dollars
2.8bn in profits. Capital amounted to 5.7 per cent of their much trimmed
combined assets of Dollars 840bn.
The S&amp;L crisis, however, is not yet over for the US federal government. Mr
Ryan's office continues to send failed thrifts into liquidation under the
auspices of the Resolution Trust Corporation, but the last Congress failed
to vote an additional Dollars 43bn for the RTC, which has been without new
funds since April 1.
The Bush administration estimates that the failure to authorise new funds is
adding Dollars 4m-Dollars 6m a day to the ultimate cost of the crisis by
preventing regulators from closing savings and loan businesses as quickly as
they would like.
The Congressional Budget Office projects the total cost of the S&amp;L bailout
at Dollars 195bn up to 1998.
Mr Ryan, 47, said he told President George Bush when he was appointed OTS
director in April 1990 that he would leave after the 1992 election. The
former White House aide and pension lawyer said he intended to return to
private business.

AMNESTY International said yesterday that Indonesia has arrested hundreds of
suspected supporters of independence for East Timor ahead of the first
anniversary of the November 12 massacre by Indonesian troops, Reuter reports
from Lisbon.
The London-based human rights group said Indonesia tortured political
detainees and had failed to honour United Nations resolutions and
recommendations on the former Portuguese colony.
'Torture and ill-treatment of political detainees continues to be both
common and routine,' Amnesty said in a statement, made available to Reuters
in Lisbon.
'In the weeks prior to the anniversary of the massacre, the authorities
arrested hundreds of suspected suporters of East Timor's independence to
prevent them from publicly and peacefully expressing their political views,'
Amnesty said.
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 a few months after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration and annexed the territory of 750,000
people a year later.
On November 12 last year, Indonesian troops fired on a crowd of
anti-Indonesian demonstrators at a cemetery in the East Timor capital Dili,
provoking international outcry.
Eyewitnesses said up to 180 people were killed, but an official Indonesian
report said 50 had died.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stepped up its
confrontation against the ruling Congress party, accusing it of 'utter
failure on the political, social and economic fronts'.
At a weekend meeting in the temple town of Bhubaneswar in the eastern state
of Orissa, the BJP directed party workers to be prepared for elections in
the near future. It was especially strident in its criticism of Prime
Minister P V Narasimha Rao's economic reform programme, which it had earlier
supported.
The Congress party retorted that it was fully prepared to meet the challenge
of a mid-term election. It said it was 'not afraid of the BJP's hollow
threats,' and that Mr Rao's policy of consensus politics should not be
misconstrued as weakness.
The BJP lacks the strength in the lower house of parliament to topple the
Rao government. No other political party is thought seriously to want an
election so soon after the general election last year.
The BJP accused the government of 'practically no performance' in the
agrarian and industrial sectors, and of having failed to increase exports or
control inflation and foreign debt.
It said rises in petroleum and fertiliser prices had played havoc in the
economy.
Mr L K Advani, leader of the opposition in the lower house and de facto head
of the BJP, said his party was confident that it could convince the people
that the Congress government, 'with its dismal record in Kashmir, Assam,
Punjab and Ayodhya, could not hold the country together'.
The Ayodhya temple issue, which has contributed to the BJP's growth in
influence over the last two years, threatens to reach another flash-point on
December 6, with Hindu militants planning to resume construction of the
temple in defiance of court orders.

TAIWAN is tightening its screening of foreign investment applications and
bids for infrastructure contracts to block projects by companies with large
mainland Chinese shareholdings, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Taipei.
'We are screening foreign investment applications prudently to prevent
Communist Chinese capital from slipping through,' said Mr Chen Ming-pang,
secretary-general of the government's Investment Commission.
Foreign companies would be ordered to withdraw existing investments in
Taiwan if they were found to have major Chinese shareholdings.
Companies with big Chinese investments will also be blocked from bidding for
contracts under Taiwan's six-year, Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193.5bn)
development plan, economics ministry officials said.
Taiwan has curbed economic contacts with China since the end of the civil
war in 1949. Under a law passed in July, companies with combined Chinese
shareholdings of more than 20 per cent are banned from investing on the
island. Local newspapers have said Chinese capital is avoiding restrictions,
entering Taiwan through Chinese-invested companies in third countries.

<TEXT>
BAHRAIN is set to become the latest Gulf state to announce fresh moves
towards wider political participation by unveiling details of a 30-seat
consultative council next month.
Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, Bahrain's emir, told the Saudi newspaper
Asharq al-Awsat he was 'serious' about naming the council, which would be
announced 'very soon.'
Senior Bahraini officials said a decree establishing the council, all
members of which will be appointed by the emir, would be issued in December.
The council is expected to have a purely advisory role and diplomats said
yesterday the state's rulers appeared to be moving with great caution in
establishing the new body.
It will be the first broadening of political participation in the Gulf state
since the emir suspended Bahrain's first elected parliament just two years
after its formation in 1973, claiming the body's internal arguments were
obstructing government.
Oman last year set up its first consultative council, while King Fahd, the
Saudi ruler, recently named the speaker for a 60-member advisory body,
appointments to which have still not been announced. Kuwait last month held
its first general elections since 1985.

IMPLEMENTATION of Japan's supplementary budget - seen as critical to the
government's emergency programme to prevent the economy falling into
recession - was further delayed yesterday by the political power struggle
set off by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin bribery scandal.
The start of debate over the supplementary budget, which is crucial to
implementing a Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) emergency economic package announced
in August, will be delayed until next week at the earliest, according to
members of the Japanese parliament.
The delay is due to the ruling Liberal Democratic party's (LDP) failure to
agree with the main opposition parties over a timetable for the
supplementary budget to be discussed by the Japanese parliament's powerful
budget committee.
The Diet convened on October 30 for a 40-day extra-ordinary session to pass
the budget, which is needed to implement large-scale public works spending.
Ministry of Finance officials warned that prolonged delay could seriously
undermine confidence.
But they said there were no plans for interim measures to help support stock
market and business confidence.
The opposition parties, led by the Social Democratic party, are demanding
that 10 LDP leaders give sworn testimony to the Diet over their alleged
involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin affair.
The opposition parties will be keen not to risk being blamed for holding up
passage of the budget. But they are insisting LDP leaders should give sworn
testimony to the Diet.
The LDP has proposed that unsworn testimony should be given to the
parliament's ethics committee.
The likelihood that the Diet will hear evidence over the scandal means it
will continue to create political uncertainty at a time when the Japanese
economy is on the verge of recession.
The scandal has sparked a power struggle at the top of the LDP after a
public outcry forced the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former head of
the largest LDP faction. Mr Kanemaru admitted he accepted a Y500m illegal
donation from the company.
However, in the past week pressure has been mounting on other LDP leaders,
particularly Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and titular head
of the largest LDP faction to clarify his role in the affair.
Last week Tokyo prosecutors pursuing a breach of trust case against former
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin executives read depositions in court which alleged
several other LDP leaders were involved in dealings with the company which
was linked to organised crime syndicates and right-wing nationalist groups.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister and LDP president, yesterday played
down suggestions that the party might take libel action against the
prosecutors for reading the controversial depositions given by politicians
of the far right.

ARAB-ISRAELI peace talks resumed yesterday overshadowed by new violence in
Lebanon and uncertainty over the transition of power from President George
Bush to President-elect Bill Clinton, Reuter reports from Washington.
The seventh round of talks since last year's Madrid peace conference
reconvened after a 12-day pause for the US presidential election and is due
to continue until November 19.
Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator in talks with Syria, was in
tough mood, seeking a statement that Damascus was not involved in weekend
clashes in Lebanon.
Pro-Iranian guerrillas had fired salvos of Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel and Israel's south Lebanon security zone late on Sunday in apparent
retaliation for an Israeli air raid that killed four guerrillas.
Mr Rabinovich said Israel had not changed its positions in this round
despite a deadlock with the Syrians on their demand for a total withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights and Israel's counter-demand for a Syrian
commitment to sign a peace treaty.
Israel is negotiating with Jordan, Lebanon and Palestinians from the
occupied territories, as well as Syria.
Few people expect breakthroughs before the Clinton team is in place. If they
are contemplating any significant concessions, the parties might want to
keep them up their sleeves until then. By the same token, it is in nobody's
interest to annoy the new US leader by provoking a crisis.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Jordan conspiracy verdict due today: Trial could be a
warning to militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN's State Security Court is due to announce its verdict today in the
most controversial political trial the country has seen for years. Two
militant Moslem members of parliament and two merchants are accused of
conspiring to overthrow the Hashemite monarchy with the intent of creating
an Islamic state.
The MPs, Mr Leith Shbeilat, and Mr Ya'aqub Qarrash, face charges of
belonging to an illegal Iranian-backed group - the Shabab al Nafeer al
Islami (Moslem Youth for Mobilisation) - possession of weapons and
explosives, undermining Jordanian-Iraqi relations and slander against the
king.
Both men face a maximum sentence, if found guilty, of death.
Mr Shbeilat and Mr Qarrash have pleaded not guilty while the two other
defendants say they are guilty only of possessing weapons which they insist
were for use in the occupied territories against Israel.
After a month of controversial and often fiery sittings, the outcome of the
trial, the first of its kind to be held in public, is seen by many as a
serious test of Jordan's embryonic democracy and, perhaps, of the degree to
which the authorities in Jordan may seek to circumscribe its limits.
The verdict comes just days after King Hussein, in his first speech since
returning to Amman from cancer surgery in the US, laid out his vision of
Jordan's future as an exemplary democratic state in the region.
From the outset, the case has been riddled with conspiracy theories. Mr
Qarrash and Mr Shbeilat claim that the trial has political motivations and
the proceedings have been reproached by many as unconstitutional.
Many Jordanians have expressed the hope that the King himself, as formal
head of the kingdom's judicial system, should somehow intervene in the case.
In a recent FT interview, King Hussein said he was 'keeping a close eye on
what is happening to see what can be done'. He added: 'I don't think anyone
should worry, we are totally committed to democracy, to pluralism, to human
rights.'
Prosecution evidence collected by the General Intelligence Department (GID),
otherwise known as the Mukharbarat, includes bugged telephone conversations
and a secret witness, a Mr Yassin Ramadan Yassin, who claimed to have
carried Dollars 200,000 from Iran to Mr Shbeilat last April.
After questioning Mr Yassin during a closed session of the otherwise open
court last month, Mr Shbeilat and Sheikh Qarrash's lawyers withdrew from the
case in protest at what they described as 'terrorism of the defence' and the
two MPs began a hunger strike.
The court-appointed lawyers who presented the defence's summation were
rejected by both MPs as 'not understanding the case'.
Although Mr Qarrash and Mr Shbeilat are friends who share not only religious
convictions but also an office in Amman, they are, in the eyes of the
Jordanian public, as different as chalk and cheese. Mr Qarrash is known for
his religious zeal and controversial business practices and, aside from the
fundamentalists, few would mourn if he were found guilty.
Conviction of Mr Shbeilat, on the other hand, a successful civil engineer
and by far the most popular MP in the 80-member lower house of parliament,
could prove more explosive. There have already been demonstrations outside
the court protesting his innocence and the return of a guilty verdict could
provoke a backlash.
Many Jordanians believe the trial to be a warning shot to Islamic militants
who won 33 seats in the 1989 parliamentary elections and, with the recent
legalisation of political parties, are successfully gathering support for
general elections in November next year.
Mr Shbeilat's supporters believe the trial is a counter-action to the MP's
calls for constitutional reform and his involvement in a parliamentary
committee which investigated corruption charges against a number of former
ministers, including Mr Zaid Rifai, a former prime minister.
Even some of Mr Shbeilat's political opponents, among them some senior
Jordanians, believe the case against the popular MP to be weak at best and
even possibly contrived.
Mr Abdul Karim Dughmi, lower house deputy speaker and former minister, one
of Mr Shbeilat's original defence lawyers, argued: 'I am definitely sure
that the case against Shbeilat was a conspiracy by certain powerful sides in
the government to silence him politically.'
Government sources insist, however, that the evidence against the defendants
could not have been ignored. 'The threat of militant fundamentalists is a
real one,' said one senior figure. 'If democracy is to succeed then we have
to accept the judicial system.'

LEBANON'S billionaire prime minister declared war on corruption, inflation
and illegal speculation yesterday and promised to push for an Israeli
withdrawal from the south, Reuter reports from Beirut.
Mr Rafik al-Hariri, a banking and construction tycoon with Saudi royal
links, told MPs the main goals of his new government were to free the south
and a return to prosperity.
He said the cabinet was intent on 'liberating the land from occupation,
liberating the state from the aftermath of the war, liberating the
administration from corruption and the citizens from the effects of chaos'
following 15 years of civil war. Mr Hariri, whose Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn)
fortune puts him among the world's 100 richest men, is expected to win a
vote of confidence in parliament for his government by a landslide later
this week.
Speaking after pro-Iranian guerrillas had fired rockets into Israel and its
'security zone' in south Lebanon, Mr Hariri endorsed the right of the
Lebanese to fight Israel's occupation by all means.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Israel to settle for 10% inflation rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL will settle for near 10 per cent inflation next year - a rate well
above that in its main European and US trading partners - in a drive to
sustain growth and reduce record 11 per cent unemployment caused by mass
immigration from the former Soviet Union, the Governor of the Bank of Israel
said yesterday.
Mr Jacob Frenkel said he was not 'playing a game of trade-offs between
unemployment and inflation' because inflation would stay on a downward path.
But a dramatic fall in the rate this year to an expected 11 per cent, from
18 per cent in 1991, allowed for a period of 'consolidation' when inflation
would fall less quickly. 'We are very very sensitive to the social and
economic dangers that high and sustained unemployment can bring to the
nation,' he said in an interview.
He was speaking after the Labour-led government moved to bolster growth,
which is set to reach about 6 per cent in real terms this year, by
announcing it would let the value of the shekel fall by 11 per cent over the
next year. It also announced a package of tax cuts and incentives for the
business sector.
These included a cut in VAT from 18 to 17 per cent from the start of next
year, a four point cut in the corporate tax rate to 36 per cent spread over
the next four years and 50 per cent rise in depreciation rates allowed on
fixed assets for tax purposes.
Mr Frenkel said he fully backed the measures. The prior announcment of the
rate of shekel devaluation over the coming 12 months continued a policy of a
'diagonal crawling peg' in place for the last year. It combined 'flexibility
and stability' while excluding damaging sudden lurches in exchange rates, he
said.
Although the projected devaluation will more than cover the difference
between domestic inflation and inflation in Israel's main export markets,
the Manufacturers' Association said it was not enough.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Khmer Rouge shatters Dollars 2bn UN peace plan: Brutal rebel
group grows stronger in its north Cambodian fastness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a few days ago it was still easy to find United Nations officials and
western diplomats who believed that the left-wing Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group would stop defying the UN and start co-operating with the Cambodian
peace plan agreed in Paris in October last year.
The Khmer Rouge, already notorious for causing the deaths of an estimated 1m
Cambodians when it ruled the country between 1975 and 1978, has in the past
seven months repeatedly flouted a nationwide ceasefire, fired on UN
helicopters, and sabotaged bridges. It has also refused to allow UN forces
access to the areas it controls and refuses to disarm its troops in
accordance with the peace agreement.
But the optimists persistently argue that the Khmer Rouge was merely playing
for time and making last-minute 'tactical moves' to consolidate its recent
territorial, political and economic gains before yielding to the UN and
taking part in the elections scheduled for next May - elections which the
Khmer Rouge was confidently expected to lose.
Such hopes were dashed over the weekend by the failure of the international
talks in Beijing aimed at bringing the Khmer Rouge to heel.
Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, ignored the pleas of the
various sponsors of the Paris peace accord, shrugged off a UN deadline of
November 15 for Khmer Rouge compliance and said his organisation would not
participate in the elections 'in the prevailing conditions'.
The consequences of continued Khmer Rouge intransigence are likely to be
severe, both for the credibility of the UN, which is committing more than
20,000 troops and civilians and Dollars 2bn to the largest peacekeeping
operation in its history, and for the future of Cambodia as it struggles to
emerge from two decades of war.
'I'm finding it harder to maintain my optimism,' a western diplomat who
follows events in Cambodia said yesterday. 'The Khmer Rouge appears to have
concluded that the whole election process will not be to its benefit.'
One immediate worry for the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) is
that the other three Cambodian factions will start to reverse the
disarmament process, which they had begun without the Khmer Rouge. About
55,000 troops, most from the Vietnamese-installed administration of Mr Hun
Sen, have reported to cantonment areas, out of about 450,000 soldiers and
militiamen in the four factions.
The UN is now casting around for ways to prevent the entire accord
unravelling. The first step is likely to be a UN Security Council meeting
this month to consider the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on the
Khmer Rouge, which has been building up financial reserves by selling gems
and timber from the territory it controls to Thai businessmen across the
border.
The new Thai civilian government has said it will try to implement whatever
the UN decides, but doubts remain over whether a formal closure of the
frontier would have much impact on the trade between the Khmer Rouge and
Thailand. The rugged border makes control of smuggling hard at the best of
times, and the Thai armed forces which supervise the area will be reluctant
to forgo the 'protection money' they earn from Thai entrepreneurs who deal
with the Khmer Rouge.
Another course of action being considered by the sponsors of the Cambodia
peace plan is a rewriting of the original accord in order to exclude the
Khmer Rouge. This was previously regarded as out of the question because of
the enormous efforts needed to negotiate the original plan.
'Now that we have been unable to reach agreement. . .some appropriate
adjustments must be made to the Paris agreements,' Mr Ali Alatas,
Indonesia's foreign minister and one of the chairmen of the Paris peace
conference, said after the failure of the Beijing talks.
The danger of excluding the Khmer Rouge once for all, western diplomats say,
is that it would be free to denounce the election results, then bide its
time in the fastnesses of northern Cambodia until the UN is forced by a
shortage of funds to extricate itself from the country, and ultimately
challenge the future elected government.
The Khmer Rouge has been stridently emphasising its nationalist credentials
and successfully exploiting popular distrust of neighbouring Vietnam by
blaming the Vietnamese government and the numerous Vietnamese settlers
inside Cambodia for most of Cambodia's problems, and for its own
intransigence.
Critics of UN operations in Cambodia say Untac officials have consistently
over-emphasised the weaknesses of the Khmer Rouge, have been fooled by
repeated Khmer Rouge hints that the organisation was on the verge of
co-operating with the UN, and have failed to use even the threat of military
force to tackle blatant Khmer Rouge violations of the peace accord.
They have also, critics say, played into the hands of Khmer Rouge
anti-Vietnamese propagandists by leaving too much authority in the hands of
the Hun Sen government, which is, in terms of the peace accord, only one of
the four factions.
While UN officers speak of Khmer Rouge guerrillas defecting in search of
food and money, Mr Raoul Jennar, a Brussels-based consultant who monitors
Cambodian affairs, says that the Khmer Rouge is poaching troops from the
other, less-belligerent factions and now has a presence in 20 of the 21
provinces. 'Today,' he wrote recently, 'the Khmer Rouge display the contempt
with which they hold the concern that has been shown to them by the
governments and diplomats from the 18 countries who signed the peace
agreement.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US fires new salvo in Gatt propaganda war
 -Report says deal would give sharp boost to processed French farm exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL completion of the Uruguay Round would create an export boom for
French farmers in the high-value processed products that account for 70 per
cent of current farm exports, according to a report by US farm economists in
Europe.
Independent farm experts said the report exaggerated potential gains, but
agreed that as Europe's most efficient agriculture producers, French farmers
could on balance see gains.
They said some of the gains would come at the expense of less efficient
farmers in other parts of Europe - such as Germany or Spain - rather than
through boosted sales to markets outside Europe.
The report comes at a time when French farmers are campaigning fiercely to
prevent further dilution of the Common Agriculture Policy's farm subsidy
regime. The collapse last week of ill-tempered US-EC negotiations on reform
of Europe's agriculture subsidy system has triggered fears of a tit-for-tat
trade war.
It is clearly intended to fuel the propaganda war between France, backed by
other smaller farm exporters such as Spain and Ireland, and leading
industrial exporters who fear the farm trade dispute will scuttle the
ambitious Uruguay Round reform package, which embraces trade in a wide range
of services, in textiles, improved settlement of international trade
disputes, and cuts in tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade.
The report predicts an export boom for French beverages, processed and fresh
fruits and vegetables, and livestock products. These together accounted for
exports worth FFr130bn (Pounds 15.5bn) last year - about 70 per cent of
total farm exports.
'Potential gains for this already huge sector are staggering, and far
outweigh even the most pessimistic French estimates of potential losses in
the cereals and oilseeds sectors,' the report says.
It says an extra 35,000 jobs would be created for every FFr5bn increase in
exports.
Mr Jean-Marie Demange, agriculture counsellor at France's London embassy,
said yesterday he was puzzled by projections of more farm jobs: the
country's farming population is expected to fall from 1m at present to less
than 700,000 within seven years, he said.
Dynamic regions such as Brittany could be expected to gain, as could the
country's efficient poultry sector, he added - but this was only a small
part of the farm sector.
He insisted that while France was a strong producer of processed farm
products, it could not be expected to perform well in marketing these
outside Europe, since most farmers were small operators, with poor links to
large groups with any international trading network. France at present
imports more processed food products than it exports, he said.
The report also claims that CAP reforms will lead to higher demand inside
the EC for cereals. It quotes EC studies predicting a 10m tonne increase in
annual demand for cereals due to livestock feeding alone. This would more
than offset the US demand for cuts in subsidised exports of cereals.
'Things are not going to be as bad as the French say, but nor are they going
to be as good as the Americans say,' Mr Jim Rollo, a farm trade expert at
the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London, said.
'France will do well out of the realignment of EC agriculture, and is likely
to gain a lot in Europe's internal market, perhaps at the expense of German,
British or Italian farmers. But there is quite a lot of adjustment to go
through.'

frigates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Greek Defence Ministry yesterday signed a contract to buy three
second-hand frigates from the Netherlands navy for a total of Fl 380m
(Pounds 140m), with delivery due by 1995.
The purchase is part of a Pounds 1bn modernisation programme for the Greek
navy, which calls for adding 12 frigates to a fleet currently based on
destroyers and fast patrol craft, equipped with missiles.
Greece will pay cash for the Kortenaer class frigates, built in the early
1980s. But payment will be spread over eight years, with annual instalments
starting at Fl 20m and rising to Fl 90m in 1995.
The frigates will be equipped with Sea Sparrow surface-to- air missiles,
Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles, anti-submarine systems and a helicopter
pad.
Mr Ioannis Stathopoulos, the Greek defence under-secretary, said yesterday
the deal would help modernise the Greek fleet, which was 'necessary in order
to avert war and lay the foundations for peace in the region.'
The frigate deal was preceded by the delivery of 170 Leopard tanks, handed
over by the Netherlands to Greece under the so-called 'cascade'
redistribution of older Nato weaponry from western Europe. Greece has also
agreed to buy 177 armoured personnel carriers from the Netherlands, at a
reduced price.
Greece already has two Kortenaer class frigates, which took part in the Gulf
war, patrolling in the Red Sea. Earlier this year, the Greek navy took
delivery of two Knox-class frigates from the US, transferred free of charge
under a bilateral military aid programme. Another US frigate will be given
to Greece in 1993.
Meanwhile, Greece has received the first of four Meko-class frigates ordered
in 1987 from Germany at a total cost of Pounds 800m. The other three are
being built under licence at a state-owned Greek shipyard.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Caricom cuts import tariff
</HEADLINE>

   PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Caribbean Community (Caricom) has lowered the rates of a controversial
tariff being applied to imports from third countries. However, the reduction
has angered regional businesses which want continued protection, and is not
expected to satisfy the community's critics, including the US, which want
more substantial and immediate cuts.
At an extraordinary summit in Trinidad, the leaders of the 13 Caricom states
agreed to reduce the top level of the common external tariff from 45 per
cent to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent, with all states committed to
this reduction between January 1 and June 30 next year.
This will be followed by a further reduction of the top rate to between 25

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: IBM to push Sony standard

<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer manufacturer, and Sony, the leading Japanese consumer
electronics group, are co-operating to promote Sony's standard for CD-based
multi-media technology.
IBM has announced that it will sell Sony's hand-held multi-media CD-ROM
players in the US for which it has developed its own software. The two will
be sold by IBM as a package. The Sony CD-ROM player was launched in the US
in mid-September.
The decision by IBM to market Sony's CD-ROM player is an endorsement by IBM
of Sony's standard, which is slightly different from an internationally
agreed CD-ROM standard.
The link between two of the largest electronics companies has stirred
excitement among industry circles over the possible formation of an
agreement extending to the development of new software for Sony's consumer
electronics products. Such an agreement could create the basis for a
powerful electronics industry alliance.
The talks mark a further step in IBM's strategy to develop a network of
international alliances with partners in Europe and Asia as part of its
restructuring programme.
CD-ROM players are the hardware heart of multi-media machines which combine
video, photography, data, animation and sound, by applying computing power
to consumer electronic products. The computer software to bring together a
variety of previously separate consumer products is vital to multi-media
machines.
The emergence of multi-media has prompted software producers, many of them
US companies, to forge new relationships with Japanese consumer electronics
hardware manufacturers. Last month, Sony agreed with Nintendo, the
video-game manufacturers, to manufacture and market a new game system that
combine Nintendo video games with a CD-ROM drive.
Slower growth in consumer electronics and computer sales combined with high
research costs and development, is forcing companies to forge international
alliances.
Apple, the US personal computer maker, is also allied with Sony while IBM
has teamed up with Sharp, to market a pocket sized communications device.
AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group and Matsushita, the world's largest
electronics group last month unveiled an alliance to produce a pocket
communicator.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Caricom reduces external tariff and
pleases no-one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Caribbean Community (Caricom) has lowered the rates of a controversial
tariff being applied to imports from third countries. However, the reduction
has angered regional businesses which want continued protection, and is not
expected to satisfy the community's critics, including the US, which want
more substantial and immediate cuts.
At an extraordinary summit in Trinidad, the leaders of the 13 Caricom states
agreed to reduce the top level of the common external tariff from the 45 per
cent to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent, with all states committed to
this reduction between January 1 and June 30 next year. This will be
followed by a further reduction of the top rate to between 25 per cent and
30 per cent by 1995, with the rate falling to between 20 per cent and 25 per
cent by 1997.
The Community, which has a market of 5.5m people, is made up of 13
English-speaking countries of the region, and is trying to create a customs
union which the members have agreed is a prerequisite for a planned common
market.
The Bahamas is not a party to the community's trading arrangements, and
Belize has been granted permission to delay the implementation of the new
tariff arrangements.
The new tariff structure is a compromise aimed at satisfying the deep
division among community members. Jamaica, which had called for an immediate
reduction of the top rate to 20 per cent, said the region's industry had to
be made competitive.
But some countries objected, saying their fledgling industries needed
protection from cheap imports, while others said their budgets would be
harmed by reduced revenues if import duties were cut.
Mr Patrick Manning, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, and chairman of
Caricom, said the competing interests of all members had to be taken into
account, and this explained the progressive cut in the top rates, spread
over five years, rather than a more significant and immediate cut.
Having asked for an immediate and steeper reduction of the tariff, Mr P J
Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister, said he had accepted the sliding scale,
but would move immediately to a top tariff rate of 30 per cent in January.
However, regional business leaders who had objected to any reduction in the
tariff rates, are angered by the Caricom decision.
'With a eventual tariff level of 20 per cent, very few manufacturers will be
able to compete,' complained Mr Neil Poon Tip, president of the Trinidad and
Tobago Manufacturers Association. 'We operate very small plants and our
inputs also have an additional cost in freight charges.'
Mr Bobby Khan, president of the Barbados Manufacturers Association, forecast
business closures in the region, saying that the countries which have been
pressuring the community for a reduction in the tariff rates would also lose
markets in the Caribbean.
The Caricom decision is unlikely to satisfy Washington, which had said a
more significant reduction in tariffs was needed if the community was to
keep in step with changing trends in global trade.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: ICI hopes risky gamble will pay off in
Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries (ICI), Britain's biggest manufacturing company,
yesterday opened its largest single product plant, a 350,000-tonne-a-year
pure terephthalic acid (PTA) unit in Taiwan. The Pounds 150m facility, the
biggest investment in Taiwan by a foreign group, is part of ICI's strategy
of expansion in the Asia-Pacific region.
However, the investment - a substantial one, given the whole group allocated
only Pounds 776m to capital expenditure last year - is a high-risk gamble.
The group is expected to make a profit of only Pounds 610m this year,
compared with Pounds 843m last year and a peak in 1989 of Pounds 1.5bn.
ICI's investment comes at a time when the market for PTA, used to
manufacture polyester for textiles, bottles and films, is struggling. Since
the plant's construction began in 1989 Asian prices have fallen by about 15
per cent to Dollars 540 a tonne.
The PTA price fall has been driven by slowing demand growth - down from 12
per cent a year in the 1980s to 8 per cent - and capacity increases.
In Asia alone, 10 PTA plants with a combined capacity of more than 2m tonnes
a year have come on stream since 1989. Worldwide capacity is 9m tonnes a
year, while demand is only 8m tonnes.
However, ICI, the world's second largest manufacturer of PTA after Amoco of
the US, believes its investment is strategically correct.
'PTA is one of the few growth opportunities at present available in the
petrochemical industry,' Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI chemicals
and polymers, said.
The British company is gambling that despite the present glut, a PTA
shortage will occur in Asia during the mid-1990s. Regional demand is at
present about 5.1m tonnes a year.
Although theoretically there is about 5.3m tonnes capacity in Asia, PTA is
hard to manufacture and actual production is about 4.4m tonnes, ICI said.
By the middle of the decade, it hopes regional demand will be 6m tonnes a
year with theoretical production also at 6m tonnes and actual production at
5.1m tonnes. Three new units with a combined annual capacity of 750,000
tonnes are due to come on stream before 1996, according to Mr David Hewitt,
ICI's international PTA business manager.
ICI hopes any increase in Asian demand will not draw in extra imports from
the US, currently some 700,000 tonnes a year.
'For once, we appear to have got our timing about right. We're probably
coming on stream only six months too early,' says Mr Hewitt. Asian PTA
prices will tighten by as much as 15 per cent by 1995, he believes.
'We need to make cash at the bottom of the cycle and generate lots at the
top. Even at present prices we are putting cash into the coffers.'
ICI's PTA business, which now generates Pounds 200m turnover a year, is set
for rapid expansion, Mr Brogden says. He expects PTA sales to rise to Pounds
320m by 1994 as annual production increases from 500,000 to 900,000 tonnes.
Within five or six years, PTA will represent 25 per cent of the chemicals
and polymers' annual turnover which was last year nearly Pounds 3bn.
The group's first PTA plant in Asia will not be its last, Mr Hewitt adds.
The group will be looking to construct a new plant within five years. One
possible location is China.
But before ICI can consider expanding further, its PTA business must pay its
way. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, warned yesterday the group was not
interested in making investments that did not make money. Operations must
generate significant profits to justify further capital spending.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Delors scales down EC revenue plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission moved to avert another damaging row within the
Community yesterday by scaling back its plan to increase revenue by a third
over five years, suggesting instead a smaller rise over seven years.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, made his more modest proposal in
line with sharply downgraded EC growth projections. The new plan is designed
to meet objections by the richer northern countries, while still satisfying
the aspirations of the poorer countries - Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Greece - which had been promised a doubling of fiscal transfers under the
original proposals.
The Commission's move comes as the 12 face simultaneous crises on the
Uruguay Round trade talks and ratification of the Maastricht treaty on
European union. Member states' approval of the so-called Delors II package
was being seen as a test of political will among the 12.
A majority of the 12 foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday agreed
that the new plan had a reasonable chance of being hammered into a deal at
the Edinburgh summit next month.
The main discordant reactions yesterday were towards a UK presidency draft
conclusion for the summit, saying that midway through the period covered by
the revised plan, 'economic and social cohesion . . . will increasingly
depend on the application of sound economic policies, and decreasingly rely
on structural transfers'.
Mr Delors in effect put back on the table a refined version of the
compromise he withdrew, amid some acrimony, at the Lisbon summit in June.
The original Delors II package called for an increase in the EC budget from
Ecu66.6bn now to Ecu 87.5bn (Pounds 70.7bn) in 1997, at today's prices. The
new plan would raise the budget to Ecu80.2bn in 1997 - an increase of barely
21 per cent - and only Ecu86.2bn by 1999.
The revised seven-year package would begin with two flat years, with EC
spending adjusted downwards in line with increases in Community growth of
1.1 per cent this year, 1.4 per cent next year and an estimated 2.2 per cent
in 1994. The original package assumed five years' growth at an average of
2.5 per cent.
If the revised package is accepted, less will go to farm spending and nearly
Ecu1bn will be switched from the proposed increase in research and
development spending to keep the EC's 'cohesion' effort funded at this
level.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK-Russia treaty lays the ground for wide co-operation
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Russia yesterday turned their backs on the legacy of Cold War
suspicion and signed a new bilateral treaty pledging peace, friendship and
wide-ranging co-operation.
The treaty, signed at Downing Street by Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first
democratically elected president, and Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, was the first such document since the 1766 Alliance of Amity and
Commerce with Czarist Russia.
The two leaders also signed five other agreements covering fields as diverse
as a new telephone hot-line between Downing Street and the Kremlin, and
measures to improve economic and military co-operation and the safe
transport of nuclear weapons destined for destruction.
Later Mr Yeltsin called on British businessmen to increase their involvement
in the emerging Russian market economy and pledged to speed up payments owed
to British exporters, with priority for smaller companies. He also told his
City audience at the Stock Exchange that Russia needed help to reschedule
its foreign debt. Until now discussions on debt rescheduling have focussed
on debt incurred before January 1, 1991. Mr Yeltsin asked creditors to move
the cut-off point to December 8, 1991, the formal demise of the Soviet
Union.
So far, both government and commercial bank holders of the former Soviet
Union's estimated Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn foreign debt have been reluctant
to include debts contracted in 1991 in any agreement. Germany, in
particular, made large loans in this period to help finance homes for Soviet
troops leaving east Germany and to prop up Mr Mikhail Gorbachev,
Mr Yeltsin said his government planned to cut value added tax from 28 to 20
per cent in January and reduce profits taxes. Although Russia still faced
huge problems, 'the worst of our economic problems are now behind us' he
said, referring to the wave of privatisations and market reforms. 'Not
everyone has strong nerves. But we do have patience, commonsense and the
ability to learn how to live a normal economic life.'
The president, who faces a bruising political struggle with conservatives
over both economic and foreign policy at next month's session of the
Congress of Peoples Deputies, appeared heartened by the warmth of his
reception in London. 'We agreed on everything, on economic, financial,
political, ecological and military fields, everything,' he said, thanking Mr
Major for his 'profound understanding of Russia and its reforms'.
In the economic sphere the two sides agreed to set up a UK-Russian
inter-governmental steering committee on trade and investment, in which
businessmen would be directly involved. Mr Major said several big contracts
for UK companies were 'looking promising'.
John Brown, the engineering company is 'to go ahead with some urgency' in a
venture with Gazprom, the Russian gas enterprise, to build a polyethylene
complex at Novy Urengoi with support from the ECGD which, Mr Major said, now
has Pounds 280m available to support trade with the former Soviet Union.
Gazprom in turn is expected to place orders with Rolls Royce for replacement
gas turbines and spares for gas pipeline transmission.
ECGD support was also pledged for a new Moscow airport terminal at
Domodedovo, and the Comstar telephone modernisation project.

CROAT forces yesterday cut off the vital supply route linking Serb-held
territories in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia with Belgrade, the Serbian and
federal capital.
Belgrade Radio said the Croats had severed the land corridor running across
northern Bosnia from Belgrade to Banja Luka, military headquarters of
Bosnia's Serbs. The radio also said Moslem fighters had cut off a main road
running south to Pale, the Serb stronghold just east of Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital.
Despite earlier ceasefire agreements between Serb and Croat forces, which
control some 25 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina, fighting yesterday
intensified around Croat-held Mostar and Serb-controlled Nevesinje in
southern Bosnia.
Croatian Radio claimed Croat and Moslem forces had moved the front line deep
into Serb-held territory.
In Belgrade, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday
announced a plan to end the war in Bosnia by freezing current front lines.
While the Geneva Conference on Yugoslavia has rejected the partition of
Bosnia along ethnic lines, Mr Karadzic said the former Yugoslav republic had
ceased to exist.
'This war is no longer being waged for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
because it has already been divided between the Serbs and Croats,' he said.
The leader of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic, which covers some 70 per
cent of Bosnia, appeared confident Serb forces could preserve their
territorial gains even in peace.

BRITAIN will try today to accelerate plans to make the single European
market, due to come into force next January 1, both efficient and
user-friendly.
At today's meeting of internal market ministers, Mr Richard Needham, UK
trade minister responsible for the internal market, will present his
counterparts with a series of ideas,
including calls for:
Commission proposals to ensure the smooth running of the market;
regular reports on implementation, which might embarrass laggard member
states into turning EC legislation into national law;
greater transparency, and an improved contacts between EC members to deal
with complaints and problems.
Britain, the current Community president, will also suggest that an analysis
of the effectiveness of the internal market should be carried out in 1996.
British officials yesterday described it as 'a Cecchini report Mark Two' - a
reference to the 1988 analysis of the benefits of market integration which
helped underpin the Commission's single market proposals.
Some countries (said to include Spain and Italy) believe it may be too early
to make such plans while member states and Brussels are still discussing
subsidiarity, the principle that EC decisions should be taken at the lowest
appropriate level.
The resolutions are supposed to be complementary to the recent Sutherland
report on implementation, which recommended improvements to consumer rights,
streamlining of EC law and enforcement of directives through national
courts. A fuller response to that report will be made in the first half of
1993.
Mr Peter Sutherland, the ex-commissioner who chaired the report committee,
is among many who fear that a strong and fair internal market will be
undermined if member states use the pretext of subsidiarity to assert their
own national interests over those of the Community.
Ministers will also try to reach agreement today on two long-awaited and
much-debated measures which will allow cross-border movement of cultural
goods, and the free movement of pharmaceuticals.

international arrangements, they agree to provide export credits on
'suitably favourable terms'.
They also recognise the importance of the development of infrastructure,
including both national and international transport and communications
systems. Companies and organisations will be encouraged to participate in
projects to improve the infrastructure, including co-operation in securing
funding from international organisations.
Each party agrees to provide legal protection for investment by nationals of
the other country in accordance with the 1989 Agreement for the Promotion
and Reciprocal Protection of Investments.

The slowdown in the west German economy is causing an increasing number of
bankruptcies in small and medium-sized companies, writes Judy Dempsey in
Bonn. The failure rate reached 839 in August, a rise of 13.4 per cent over
the same month a year ago.
Over the first eight months of this year, 6,374 companies filed for
bankruptcy, an increase of 12.5 per cent over the same period in 1991, while
the total number of officially announced insolvency cases increased to
9,235, or 6.7 per cent, according to the Federal Statistics Office.
The German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, said the D-Mark was under
exaggerated upward pressure, Reuter reports from Bonn. In a speech prepared
for delivery in Bonn, he said tight curbs in public spending would help to
make lower interest rates possible. 'Lower interest rates would remove the
exaggerated upwards pressure on the mark. The competitive situation of our
companies will also be noticeably improved as a result,' he said.

THE first opinion poll of the Irish election campaign yesterday did little
to boost the hopes of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of winning an
absolute majority for his Fianna Fail party for the first time in 15 years.
The poll showed voter satisfaction with the government at just 23 per cent,
the personal rating of Mr Reynolds dropping 20 percentage points in two
weeks to 30 per cent, and only 37 per cent of voters wanting to see Fianna
Fail win with an absolute majority.
The personal feud of honour between Mr Reynolds and Mr Des O'Malley the
leader of the Progressive Democrats, which brought about the coalition
collapse last week, has not helped the cause of either and in the public's
eye precipitated an unnecessary general election on November 25. Most voters
appear to believe neither leader in their differing versions of events given
to a parliamentary inquiry into the beef industry, which caused the
coalition split.
The most popular figure of the campaign so far is Mr Dick Spring, the leader
of the Labour party, who polled a 66 per cent 'satisfaction rating' against
31 per cent for Mr Reynolds, 30 per cent for Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael
leader, and 39 per cent for Mr O'Malley, according to Irish Marketing
Surveys which conducted the nationwide poll. While the party leaders
exchanged their first salvos of the campaign from TV and radio studios in
Dublin over the weekend, it appeared that only the Labour party had got off
the starting blocks in the countryside. Labour party activists could be seen
canvassing Mass-goers outside churches in Mr Reynolds' own constituency of
Longford. Others were out fixing freshly-printed Labour party campaign
posters to lampposts along the main roads.
Mr Bruton, launched his party's manifesto last Friday promising IPounds 270m
in tax concessions and incentives aimed at reducing the country's record
jobless figures. The proposal was immediately attacked by Mr Bertie Ahern,
the finance minister, who said that these could only be financed either
through increased taxes in other areas, by reneging on public sector pay
agreements in 1993, or freezing planned social welfare increases. Mr
Proinsias de Rossa, the leader of the socialist Democratic Left party,
dismissed Mr Bruton's proposals as 'shifting the deckchairs around on the
Titanic'.
Fianna Fail has been by far the slowest off the mark and will not have its
manifesto ready until the middle of the week, while Mr Bruton has already
set off on a two-week nationwide tour to visit every constituency in the
country to sell his message. Arguably he has a harder job, as only 23 per
cent of voters appear to support Fine Gael, against 47 per cent wanting
Fianna Fail either to have an absolute majority or to lead a coalition.
Labour polled 15 per cent, up from 9 per cent in the 1989 elections.
Fianna Fail has consistently won more than 40 per cent of the vote since the
1930s. Under Ireland's single transferable vote system and multiple seat
constituencies, 47 per cent could be enough to win Fianna Fail an absolute
majority.
In the past two elections, however, its support has fallen by election day,
leaving it short of the 83 seats necessary for a majority.

THE ROW in Austria over the government's policy towards immigrants and
refugees will come to a head tomorrow when the radical Freedom Party, led by
the charismatic Mr Jorg Haider, proposes the formation of a parliamentary
committee to study the controversial foreigner issue.
Mr Haider has said he will postpone until the end of the year his threat to
launch a national petition to toughen immigration policy if the commission
is formed. But Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor and leader of the
Democratic Socialist Party, said he would only agree to the committee being
formed if the FPO cancelled its threatened petition campaign. On Sunday, Mr
Vranitzky led hundreds of people in mounting a ceremonial guard at a Jewish
cemetery in Eisenstadt where vandals sprayed anti-Semitic slogans on
gravestones.
'This country is the home of all who were born in it and the home of all
those born elsewhere, but who live here,' Mr Vranitzky said. 'Whoever
desecrates a cemetery, shames both the dead and the living."
Mr Haider has outlined 12 demands, including that the government halt all
immigration, expel illegal immigrants and limit the proportion of foreigners
in any school class to 30 per cent. The issue has been brought to the fore
by the arrival of large numbers of refugees from former Yugoslavia.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Pound falls as pressure grows for rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and Our Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTING PRESSURE on the UK government to expand the economy and cut
interest rates sharply unleashed speculative selling of sterling which
pushed the pound down to a five-year low against the dollar yesterday.
As UK industry leaders urged the government to ease off its fight against
inflation in favour of immediate action to bring the economy out of
recession, dealers sold pounds in the belief that base rates could be cut by
as much as 2 percentage points when the chancellor makes his Autumn
Statement on Thursday.
On the domestic money market, traders priced a full percentage point cut in
base rates into their cash market operations. Three-month money, which often
acts as a bellwether of base rate trends, closed around 7 per cent, down
from 7 3/16 per cent on Friday. As hopes of a cut in borrowing costs grew,
sterling fell by nearly 2 cents to a close of Dollars 1.5210 in London. It
is understood, however, that Mr Lamont is not contemplating such a radical
step as a 2 point base rate cut. He has let it be known that weekend reports
suggesting the government might order an immediate cut in rates to 6 per
cent are 'not realistic'.
At the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference in Harrogate,
delegates maintained pressure on ministers to unveil a detailed plan for
economic recovery on Thursday.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, one of two cabinet ministers at
the conference yesterday, heightened expectations when he said the Autumn
Statement would 'mark a turning point in the future course of the British
economy'. The chancellor's proposals, he said, would present the public with
further evidence that the government was dedicated to ensuring that all its
policies were tailored to recovery, growth and jobs.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said Thursday's statement was critically
important and would be seen as a test of the government's determination to
bring about lasting recovery.
Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN and head of the CBI's economic affairs
committee, said inflation should no longer be the dominant theme of policy.
'The battle we need to win now is against the lack of confidence which is
holding back growth and investment in the economy.'
Official figures showing that lower interest rates failed to entice
consumers into borrowing more last month provided further evidence yesterday
of a continuing lack of confidence in the economy. Net consumer credit fell
by Pounds 60m in September, suggesting that consumers are attempting to pay
off expensive debts before taking on new loans.
After its fall in London, sterling continued to drop in New York, touching
Dollars 1.5090 - a level last seen in January 1987 - before closing at
Dollars 1.5105. The pound fell 3 1/2 pfennigs to DM2.4150 in London but
steadied in New York to DM2.4239.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Mitterrand attacks UK delay on treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand launched a strong attack last night on Mr John
Major for delaying the UK decision on ratifying the Maastricht treaty until
well into next year.
His unusually sharp assault on the prime minister came as British and Danish
ministers had limited success in Brussels in trying to calm EC partners
alarmed about the Maastricht treaty's future.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, asked other EC ministers to take in
good faith the UK's goal of speedy ratification, but he avoided giving a
final date for wrapping up the treaty in the House of Commons.
The French president said in a television interview he would be content to
give the UK government 'a delay of a few weeks' after January 1 1993  -
which had been set as a target date for ratification - 'but not more'.
While he was confident that 10 countries would ratify the union treaty by
the end of this year, Mr Mitterrand said it was 'unacceptable' for Mr Major
to delay the UK ratification decision until after Denmark held a second
referendum on the issue in May at the earliest.
Downing Street reacted tersely to Mr Mitterrand's remarks. An official said:
'The British government has a number of priorities. The first now is to
prevent a trade war. The timing of the Maastricht legislation is a matter
for the British government.'
The French president's strong stance bodes ill for Mr Major at next month's
Edinburgh summit, though Mr Mitterrand said he still thought the UK leader
'will stick to his word'.
Clearly hoping for a further change of tack by Mr Major, Mr Mitterrand said:
'One should not prejudge the final decision of Mr Major, who only a short
time ago seemed to say that Britain would deliver its verdict before January
1.
'I judge it (the UK delay) badly, but one should not be surprised. On all
the big European agreements in recent years, we have had the same sort of
difficulties with Britain.'
Indirectly, Mr Mitterrand was even more scathing about Denmark. For Britain
to make the timing of its decision dependent on Denmark was 'unacceptable,
because this could last as long as the Danes would wish it'.
After the Brussels meeting, Mr Hurd said the UK decision to delay
ratification until after a second Danish referendum had met with 'some
anxiety, but considerable understanding'.
Belgian and French officials both suggested yesterday that the delay in
approving the treaty could jeopardise enlargement negotiations planned early
next year with Finland, Sweden and Austria.
Mr Hurd acknowledged doubts about the timetable, but he implied that the
postponement of UK ratification was the price to be paid for overcoming
opposition within the ruling Tory party. 'A delayed treaty is better than no
treaty.'
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said Denmark aimed to hold
a second referendum on the treaty next May. But the timing would depend on
the EC agreeing on Denmark's demands for 'legally binding' exemptions by the
time of the EC summit on December 11-12.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Inquiry urged as arms to Iraq case collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday faced demands for an inquiry into its policy of
selling defence equipment to Iraq in the run-up to the Gulf war, after the
trial of three directors of a Midlands machine tool exporter collapsed.
Four government ministers, it emerged yesterday, tried to suppress 500 pages
of confidential Whitehall documents which, said defence lawyers, detailed a
'secret policy' to promote UK exports of defence-related equipment to Iraq.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and the Foreign Office
minister Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, had all argued unsuccessfully for the
documents to be suppressed on the grounds of national security.
The documents suggest that several senior ministers in the government of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, including the former prime minister, were briefed on this
policy and that the effort to arm Iraq continued to within weeks of
Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
Two notes between senior Whitehall officials also reveal that, 18 months
earlier, the Department of Trade and Industry, with Ministry of Defence and
Foreign Office backing, approved the export of sophisticated engineering
equipment to Baghdad which could be used in the development of nuclear
weapons.
The collapse of the Old Bailey prosecution of three former directors of
Matrix Churchill, the Coventry machine tool maker, who were charged with
breaching export controls by pretending that machine tools sold to Iraq were
for civil use, followed an admission by Customs and Excise that it could no
longer sustain a case against them.
Evidence given during the trial by Mr Alan Clark, a former trade minister,
was 'inconsistent' with his earlier statements to Customs investigators, the
court was told.
Mr Kevin Robinson, lawyer for defendant Mr Paul Henderson, former managing
director of Matrix, rejected this explanation. 'Clark is the public excuse',
he said. 'All Alan Clark did was tell the truth in the witness box.'
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Henderson described yesterday
how he had worked for British intelligence in the former Soviet bloc and
Iraq for more than 15 years.
The documents released yesterday showed how from October 1987, ministers and
civil servants, supplied with information by the security and intelligence
services, had known Matrix Churchill products were destined for use in
Iraq's defence procurement programme.
Leading Labour calls for an inquiry, Mr Robin Cook, the party's trade and
industry spokesman, called for full disclosure of the role played by the DTI
in the affair. 'Mr Michael Heseltine must now tell us how much the DTI knew
about weapon deals with Saddam and why they connived at arms exports instead
of controlling them', he said.
Both the DTI and Downing Street yesterday refused to comment on the lawyers'
allegations. The DTI tried to distance itself from Mr Clark, saying his
comments in court had been personal opinions, not government policy. Mr
Clark refused to comment, apart from saying that the matter had now been
concluded.
The three Matrix Churchill directors accused of deceiving the DTI in the
company's applications for export licences were Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor
Abraham, its former commercial manager, and Mr Peter Allen, its former sales
director.

FT  10 NOV 92 / French defeated on plan for early trade reprisals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRM Anglo-German alliance last night beat back a French move for early
reprisals against the US in the looming EC-US trade war.
This coincided with intervention in the dispute by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Dunkel
decided to go to Brussels and Washington within the next few days to press
the EC and the US to resolve their dispute over European oilseeds subsidies
and to reconvene talks on world trade liberalisation in Geneva.
At a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the French urged that the EC
begin preparing reprisals against the US threat to levy punitive tariffs on
Dollars 300m (Pounds 193.5m) of European exports on December 5.
But, instead, a majority of ministers called for urgent resumption of
negotiations with the US.
Only Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Greece rallied to the French call for a
muscular response to Washington.
However, most of the 12 agreed that EC counter-retaliation would be
inevitable if the US goes ahead with its sanctions after the 30-day waiting
period it has set.
The EC ministers expressed 'severe disappointment at US threats to withdraw,
unilaterally, Gatt-bound concessions' while trade talks were still going on
in Geneva. The ministers warned 'that such action could only lead to a
retaliatory spiral, which would damage both sides through a slump in
business confidence and lost jobs'.
Senior EC diplomats said last night that the European Commission in Brussels
would be told at its meeting tomorrow to bury its internal differences over
who negotiates for the Community in the trade affair.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, last week relinquished
responsibility for the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round of trade talks
because he felt Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was undermining him
by siding with France. Tomorrow's meeting could therefore be a showdown
between Mr Delors and Mr MacSharry.
'There is urgency about getting (the talks with the US) going,' a UK
presidency official said. 'Let us say that there will be urgent
disappointment if (after Wednesday) they haven't sorted themselves out.'
French officials would not be drawn on whether Mr MacSharry had exceeded his
mandate - as Paris and Mr Delors have claimed - in the deal he was close to
reaching in Chicago.
Mr Bruno Durieux, French trade minister, said: 'We do not want the Gatt
agreement to go any further than the effort demanded (in farm subsidy cuts)
by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.'
Mr MacSharry maintains he has kept within the CAP reform's projected cuts in
subsidised food exports. But Mr Durieux said yesterday this remains 'to be
confirmed'.
The Commission yesterday undertook to demonstrate whether the price and
production cuts the 12 agreed in May for the CAP reform fit within any
eventual Gatt deal.
Mr Dunkel's intervention came after ambassadors to Gatt said at an informal
meeting with him yesterday that they wanted him to talk to the two trading
powers urgently.
At today's emergency meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee, the
top-level supervisory body for the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks, Mr Dunkel is expected to be given a formal mandate to sound out the
US and EC on getting the Geneva talks restarted.

HONEYWELL, the US controls group, announced plans to consolidate its
aerospace operations, and reposition its home and building controls and
industrial units.
In connection with these moves the company will take a fourth-quarter
pre-tax charge of about Dollars 100m, or 90 cents per share after tax. The
charges will partially offset gains of Dollars 273m from settlements of
patent infringement suits filed by Honeywell against several camera
manufacturers.
Honeywell said that its Space and Aviation unit will be 'appropriately sized
for changing market conditions', characterised by declining deliveries of
new aircraft and continuing reductions in defence spending.
Honeywell is to increase its annual dividend by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.78,
accelerate a Dollars 600m share repurchase programme and split its stock
two-for-one.

TSD, a Japanese biotechnology and computer software company, triggered a
plunge in biotechnology-related stocks on the Tokyo stock market yesterday,
following an allegation that it had presented investors with false
information concerning clinical tests of its HIV vaccine.
Shares in TSD, which are traded on Tokyo's over-the-counter market, were
suspended on Friday by the Japan Securities Dealers Association after
reports alleging that TSD was misinforming investors.
On the OTC market yesterday, TSD shares did not trade due to the lack of
buyers, and closed at an offered price of Y2,320, down by a daily limit of
Y400 from Thursday's close.
In August last year, TSD announced that clinical tests for its anti-HIV
vaccine, co-developed with a professor of Yokohama City University, had
begun in a Thai hos-pital on HIV positive patients.
TSD's stock surged, rising to a high of Y3,650 in September 1991 from a
year's low of Y730 posted in April.
The rise in TSD's share price prompted a bulk of its convertible bonds worth
SFr45m (Dollars 32.1m), issued in 1990, to be converted into equity.
Mr Tsutomu Matsuzaki, president of TSD, last Friday admitted that the
company had yet to start the clinical tests since full approval from the
Thai government had not yet been obtained.
However, he denied allegations of giving false information to raise TSD's
stock price.
After the market closed yesterday, Mr Matsuzaki announced the Thai Public
Health Ministry had approved clinical tests of TSD's vaccine, and the
company was waiting for approval by the National Aids Committee.

The San Francisco-based company said that the decision - which is part of a
broader programme to reduce total group expenses - was taken following a
six-month long study.
The changes will result in a net reduction of about 1,000 positions, or 28
per cent, from the level of headquarters staff at the beginning of this
year.
Since about 550 corporate staff employees have already opted for early
retirement, the net number of jobs being cut will be about 450.
The job cuts will occur in more than a dozen departments, including tax,
treasury, legal and human resources.
The oil and gas group also announced a separate measure to reduce costs by
restructuring its in-house technology company.
This move is expected to save Dollars 35m to Dollars 45m a year and will
result in the reduction of another 500 jobs, or 22 per cent of the total.
Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that he regretted 'that these
changes will leave some employees without jobs'.
He said that the cuts reflected the business environment.
Chevron's third-quarter net earnings, announced last month, were 21 per cent
higher at Dollars 378m.

<TEXT>
REVCO, the large US drugstore operator which emerged from a four-year stint
in bankruptcy last June, yesterday unveiled a major refinancing plan, aimed
at cutting the company's interest bill and improving its balance sheet.
Under the refinancing scheme, Revco would raise around Dollars 110m from the
sale of new ordinary shares, by way of rights to existing shareholders, plus
a further Dollars 125m from the sale of new senior notes.
It also proposes to implement new credit facilities - comprising a Dollars
150m secured term loan facility and execute a Dollars 150m secured revolving
credit facility, co-agented by Banque Paribas, Continental Bank and GE
Capital Corporate Finance Group.
The drugstore chain would then repay in full its three existing classes of
debt securities, at a cost of Dollars 433.2m, and replace the existing
working capital agreement.
The company said that board approval for the rights issue part of the
package was predicated on the subscription price ranging between Dollars 7
and Dollars 8.
Yesterday, Revco's market price eased by Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 3/8 .
Revco operates around 1,149 outlets in nine eastern states and has some
16,000 employees.
In late-September it reported a small Dollars 1.54m loss after tax in the
first quarter to August 22, since it emerged from bankruptcy.
At the operating level, the company was marginally profitable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's pledge to abolish stamp duty on the transfer of shares
should be postponed and the rate of duty should be doubled from 0.5 per cent
to 1 per cent, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday .
'Share ownership is a luxury, not a necessity,' the association said. It
added that the measure would bring in around Pounds 2bn which could be used
to offset a package of measures to stimulate the housing market.
It called on Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, in his Autumn Statement on
Thursday to reduce interest rates, double mortgage tax relief for first-time
buyers and abolish stamp duty on house sales.
The association also called for local authorities to be allowed to invest a
larger proportion of money from sales of homes in housebuilding, and for
housing associations to be given funds to buy repossessed homes.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER executive of International Signal &amp; Control (ISC), the Pennsylvania
company acquired in 1987 by Ferranti of Britain, told a US court yesterday
he was innocent of arms smuggling, partly because he had been recruited by
and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Mr Thomas Jasin, former president of ISC Technologies, has been accused of
smuggling South African missile technology into and out of the US as part of
a helicopter-and-missile project destined for the People's Republic of
China.
Mr Jasin, who left ISC before it merged with Ferranti in 1987, has been
charged with violating US export laws.
Prosecutors allege that masterminded an elaborate plot to smuggle the South
African-made Striker missile, via an Italian company owned by ISC, into the
US for wind-tunnel testing, an essential step in mounting the anti-tank
weapon on US-made Sikorsky helicopters which were to be sold to China in
1986.
Last week the Financial Times obtained documents showing Ferranti was
involved in the Striker project, along with the Sikorsky division of United
Technologies and the US Army. Neither Ferranti nor Sikorsky has been accused
of wrongdoing.
Mr Jasin's attorney told a Philadelphia court his client was an innocent man
working for the CIA. Mr Jasin denied any wrongdoing, saying he was duped by
Mr James Guerin, the convicted former Ferranti deputy chairman and founder
of ISC, into believing the technology transfer was well within US law.
The government will try to refute Mr Jasin's claim of innocence in what it
described as a completely unlawful deal struck between Mr Guerin and members
of Armscorp, the South African government-owned arms company.

FT  10 NOV 92 / S&amp;L supervisor to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Timothy Ryan said yesterday that he would step down next month as
director of the US Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision after three years
in charge of the recovering savings and loan industry.
Mr Ryan told the annual meeting of the Savings and Community Bankers of
America in San Diego the overhaul of the S&amp;L, or thrift, industry was
'virtually complete'.
'Together we have made the savings and loan business into an industry of
strong, well-capitalised, profitable institutions,' he said in the text of a
speech prepared for delivery yesterday.
Four years ago, Mr Ryan said, the 3,100 thrifts in the US were between them
losing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m) a month. Their capital amounted
to just 0.33 per cent of their combined assets of Dollars 1,300bn.
In the first half of 1992, he said, the 2,000 surviving thrifts made Dollars
2.8bn in profits. Capital amounted to 5.7 per cent of their much trimmed
combined assets of Dollars 840bn.
The S&amp;L crisis, however, is not yet over for the US federal government. Mr
Ryan's office continues to send failed thrifts into liquidation under the
auspices of the Resolution Trust Corporation, but the last Congress failed
to vote an additional Dollars 43bn for the RTC, which has been without new
funds since April 1.

FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Russians win first satellite contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA won its first commercial contract yesterday to launch a western-built
satellite into orbit. The Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.2m) deal opens the way for
Russia to undercut its three western rivals in the Dollars 2bn-a-year
commercial launch market.
It is also likely to trigger calls for steps to protect the US launch
industry. Vice-President-elect Al Gore and other senior Democratic
politicians have recently demanded action to stop predatory pricing of
launches by Russia and China.
The contract was placed by Inmarsat, a 65-nation international co-operative
of nations and the world's second biggest independent operator of commercial
satellites. At the same time, it awarded a Dollars 62m contract to launch a
similar satellite on the Ariane rocket built by Arianespace, the French-led
European consortium controlling half the market.
The loser at yesterday's Inmarsat council meeting was General Dynamics of
the US, which won in the previous round of Inmarsat contracts. 'This mix of
launchers minimises risk,' Mr Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat director-general,
said. He described the choice of the Russian Proton rocket as 'pioneering',
while conceding it was 'commercially unknown'.
The decision is likely to generate a strong reaction from the new
administration in Washington. Last week Senator John D Rockefeller said that
allowing launch business to go to Russia and China 'could jeopardise the US
space launch industry.' The US might have to change its trade policy to
protect US interests, he added.
Russia may get its second contract within weeks. Intelsat, a co-operative of
more than 120 nations and the biggest independent satellite owner, is to
choose between Russia, China, Japan, Arianespace and General Dynamics for a
series of launches, in December.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Bosnian Moslem refugees reach the end of a long line: The
dejected inmates of Posusje's camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JASMINA CERIC was top of her class in English. Until this spring she lived a
happy, middle-class life. Her father was the owner of the local supermarket
and a cafe.
Eight days ago she arrived here with her mother and sister to share a
run-down school building with 700 other people, one of more than 800,000
displaced people trapped in warring Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In the schoolroom where she sleeps there are one man, nine women and eight
children and all their remaining belongings. From her home she took only
clothes and a doll called Sonja.
Jasmina is 11, with translucent green eyes and a ponytail. Her ambition was
to become an English teacher, but now she has no idea what her future is.
She is at least luckier than those in the gym, which has to accommodate
about 400 people. Old men sit on their mattresses and smoke. Clothes are
hung on wallbars and climbing ropes. The school has no heating.
Posusje is just inside the border from coastal Croatia. On the road that you
meet here, you can travel 30 miles in either direction and you enter a war
zone. A small mountain town with a white stone church, it would be a
pleasant enough place. But the refugees here - there are more in the hotel
and some 3,000 in family homes - are disillusioned. Decanted through a
network of reception centres, they all come hoping to cross the border. But
the Croatian authorities say they can take no more than the 340,000 who have
already come from Bosnia.
Aid workers say overcrowding and poor sanitation are compounded by constant
struggles with local authorities. Almost all the refugees at the school are
Moslems. They believe Bosnian Croats are more favoured. They are meant to
move on from here, but it seems like the end of the line.
Jasmina comes from Prijedor in northern Bosnia, where before this year
Moslems slightly outnumbered Serbs. Last month Serb leaders from Bosnia and
Croatia called an 'all-Serbian parliament' in the town. Jasmina's father,
who belonged Bosnia's territorial reserves, was captured by Serb soldiers
seven months ago and sent to the Manjuca camp near Banja Luka. He has
managed to send his family three letters through the Red Cross.
The supermarket and cafe were looted and burnt down. Their three cars were
also destroyed.
Before coming here, mother and daughters spent 20 days at another centre in
Travnik, northwest of Sarajevo, which has recently come under shelling. They
went by bus, but walked part of the way.
At Posusje they are given cold fish - the same every day - and bread,
sometimes milk. The gym has cooking facilities but many do not use them for
fear of disease. The camp has hepatitis and typhus cases.
There are six makeshift latrines. Clothes are washed outside in buckets and
hung on trees. The refugees rely on rainwater collected in cisterns.
'It is horrible,' Jasmina says. 'It is very cold at night and there are not
many blankets.' She wants to go to school, but does not, and instead has to
live in one. The family has no money left, no papers. Her mother has told
her they will not go back to Prijedor. Jasmina is not quite sure why.
Sakib Karavic is 14 1/2 . He would like to go back to his village not far
from Prijedor. 'But there is no place to go. It's pointless.' His
grandfather was killed when a shell hit his home. Sakib's family has been
here a month and a half after an odyssey through Bosnia by cattle-wagon, on
foot and by truck.
They knew Serbs in the village. 'They were our neighbours. And then they
burnt our houses.'
Everyone has seen the pictures, the packed camps, the streams of people last
week fleeing Jajce along the road to Travnik. But equally strong are the
impressions made by the stench, by the way the women fix their gaze, half
pleading, half hopeless, and by the surrounding hillsides with their neat
villas. A few yards from the school building, people sit around cafe tables.
This is, after all, Europe.
Hasan Hasecic, a dignified man with a white stubble, acts as spokesman for
the refugees at Posusje. 'Other countries refuse us, abandon us,' he says.
'Nobody wants to live here. It's a grave.'
He has little faith in outside help. 'Every day, people come, and they ask,
and they write, and nothing happens.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / Mitterrand proposes constitutional reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand is to propose a series of constitutional
reforms, including new judicial arrangements to try government ministers for
their responsibility in such cases as the recent scandal over
Aids-contaminated blood.
In a television interview which he gave last night partly to deal with
allegations that former Socialist ministers had escaped their responsibility
in the transfusion of contaminated blood to haemophiliacs, Mr Mitterrand
called for a change in the constitution that at present renders ministers
immune from prosecution except by an ill-suited and little-used
parliamentary impeachment procedure.
In the meantime, however, he challenged the two houses of the parliament to
set up a 'High Court of Justice' in the Aids-blood case. Though Mr
Mitterrand did not mention any former ministers by name, the three people
involved are Mr Laurent Fabius, current leader of the Socialist party, who
was prime minister in the mid-1980s when the fateful transfusions took
place, and two former health ministers. A court recently sentenced three
senior doctors to prison.
But the main surprise which Mr Mitterrand sprung on his audience was that
his proposed judicial change would be part of a constitutional reform
package to be unveiled this month. He said this would cover 'six or seven
points', including a change to the seven-year, renewable mandate of French
presidents, a 'better balance' between the executive and legislative
branches, a strengthening of the judiciary's independence and an extension
of the use of referenda.
The president said this would amount to 'a cleaning up' of the Fifth
Republic's 1958 constitution, rather than the institution of a new 'Sixth
Republic'. It would nevertheless require the convening of a consultative
constitutional committee, whose work would take some time.
But Mr Mitterrand, who affirmed himself in good health and leading 'for the
past 10 days a normal working life' after his September operation for
prostate cancer, said he intended to be around until the end of his term in
1995 to see the constitutional reforms put in place.
Mr Mitterrand first raised the issue of constitutional reform a year ago
when he acknowledged that the two terms of seven years to which he had been
elected were too long. Last night he refused to divulge his proposed reform.
But he made it clear that, health permitting, he did not intend to apply
retroactively any limitation of tenure to himself. The right-wing opposition
had hoped that he might, in view of his low standing in the opinion polls.
This has taken a further dive the past month. In a survey published in Le
Figaro last weekend, only 34 per cent expressed confidence in the president,
and 41 per cent in his prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy.

<TEXT>
GERMANY reacted with dismay yesterday to the public relations disaster which
resulted from Sunday's huge anti-racist demonstration in Berlin, when it
ended in anarchists pelting the state president with eggs.
While political leaders insisted the scale of the 300,000-strong
demonstration was an overwhelming statement of the country's opposition to
neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners and asylum-seekers, the media saw the violent
protests by some 300 left-wingers as a terrible blow to Germany's
international image.
The extreme left celebrated the event as a triumph for their tactics of
'exposing the hypocrisy of the politicians', and undermining the deliberate
'propaganda show' of the political establishment.
The sorry end to what had been an impressive and powerful display of
national disgust for the recent rash of violent skinhead attacks on refugee
hostels has unleashed a new wave of questioning over the ability of the main
political parties to solve the country's acutely sensitive immigration
problem. The political irrelevance of the 300-odd left-wing extremists is
rapidly being submerged in the emotional response.
The conservative newspaper Die Welt called the outcome 'a black Sunday' in a
special front-page commentary.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it 'an awful spectacle,' demanded
harsh action against the protesters, but called above all for the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD) to agree on radical changes in the law to enable the
inflow of would-be immigrants to be controlled.
The SPD leadership agreed at the weekend that 'clarification and
amplification' of the country's constitution guaranteeing the right of
asylum would be possible - provided the basic right of asylum remained
untouched.
They also called for a European quota system for immigrants, and agreed that
Germany should refuse entry to any asylum-seekers already rejected by other
EC member states.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Gatt chief to intervene in Europe-US oilseeds row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, will travel to Brussels and Washington within the next few days to
urge the European Community and the US to resolve their oilseeds dispute and
to reconvene world trade talks in Geneva.
Ambassadors to Gatt made clear at an informal meeting with Mr Dunkel
yesterday that they wanted him to talk to the two trading powers urgently.
At today's emergency meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee, the
top-level supervisory body for the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks, Mr Dunkel is expected to be given a formal mandate to sound out the
US and EC on getting the Geneva talks restarted.
The hope is that this will increase the pressure on the two trading blocs to
come to terms over oilseeds before the US-imposed sanctions deadline of
December 5 and, if necessary, bring their broader dispute over farm
subsidies back into the scope of the multilateral negotiations.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers of the 12 EC countries agreed last night that
negotiations with the US on farm subsidies should resume immediately to head
off the risk of a transatlantic trade war.
But the ministers also agreed the bloc would have to respond if Washington
carried out its threat to slap massive duties on food imports from the EC on
December 5, German economics minister Jurgen Mollemann told reporters.
The 12 EC countries had earlier been split between French demands that the
EC immediately start drawing up counter-retaliation plans against the US,
and British and German wishes to get negotiations restarted immediately with
Washington to head off trade war.
'You can't negotiate with a pistol to your temple', said Mr Bruno Durieux,
the French trade minister.
Nevertheless, only Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Greece rallied unequivocally
behind France during the meeting.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, last week relinquished his
responsibility for negotiating the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round because
he felt Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was undermining him by
siding with France.
'There is urgency about getting (the talks with the US) going,' a UK
presidency official said, 'and it is obvious that there is a meeting on
Wednesday,' referring to what could be a showdown between Mr Delors and Mr
MacSharry. 'Let us say that there will be urgent disappointment if (after
Wednesday) they haven't sorted themselves out.'
The UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark - the countries most opposed to
setting in train reprisals against the US - acknowledged that a majority of
EC member states would back retaliation against the US if there was no
settlement on the oilseeds row and Gatt within the 30-day 'cooling off'
period before Washington acts.
The breakdown of the US-EC farm subsidy talks in Chicago last week and
subsequent threats of an escalating trade war have infuriated other
countries involved in the 108-nation Uruguay Round, which is teetering on
the verge of collapse.
Trade officials in Geneva yesterday expressed bitterness that the US and EC
had failed to take the necessary political decisions to resolve their
differences and pave the way for a successful completion of the round.

DENMARK aims to hold a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty next May,
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister said yesterday.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen warned fellow European Community foreign ministers,
however, that the timing depended on the EC reaching agreement on Denmark's
demands for 'legally binding' exemptions from Maastricht by the time of the
EC summit in December.
Danish demands, which include a UK-style opt out on a common European
currency and a putative defence force, received a cool reception from EC
foreign ministers in Brussels. Several EC members suggested that Denmark's
demands amounted to reopening Maastricht and could require an unacceptable
reratification of the treaty.
Uncertainty about the Danish question - coupled with the UK's decision to
delay final ratification until after May - is causing concern over the
timing of enlargement negotiations with Finland, Sweden and Austria next
year.
All 12 member states are required to ratify Maastricht before it can be
enforced. Under a compromise agreed at the EC summit in Lisbon in June,
enlargement talks are linked to ratification and settlement of the Delors II
budget package, including extra funds for poorer EC members.
Belgium, which holds the rotating presidency from July 1993, said the UK
postponement threatened to upset its two priorities: enlargement and
implementation of Maastricht.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen admitted he did not love the language of the Danish
demands - largely dictated to the minority government by opposition parties.
But 'this is the only possibility of establishing a situation in which the
Maastricht treaty. . . .can come into force'.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S first general strike in over three years was less than a
resounding success yesterday, with all but a few key unions largely ignoring
the call for a one-day stoppage in protest at the government's economic
policies.
In Buenos Aires, the capital and largest city, shops were open, offices and
banks worked normally, while public transport operated at about 70 per cent
of its usual capacity.
However, Mr Edmundo Soria, transport secretary, admitted that the city's
train system, which normally transports between 1.3m and 1.4m people a day,
was practically paralysed, as were bus services in working-class areas of
southern Buenos Aires.
The strike went off relatively peacefully, apart from a small bomb which
exploded harmlessly outside the headquarters of the CGT union confederation.
Pickets also attacked and burned several buses.
Companies in the Buenos Aires industrial belt and other industrial centres
said their factories were either brought to a complete halt or worked well
below capacity. Reports from Cordoba, Argentina's third largest city, say
the strike was 90 per cent effective.
The CGT called the strike to protest against President Carlos Menem's plans
to abolish union privileges and reform Argentina's rigid labour laws.
Although the pro-Peronist unions called 13 general strikes to defeat
economic reform under the previous government of President Raul Alfonsin,
they have not resisted the privatisations and mass dismissals decreed by Mr
Menem, a Peronist.
However, they have drawn the line at the government's attempts to eliminate
union control over welfare funds, estimated to be worth Dollars 5bn a year.
Unions are also up in arms over a ban on wage indexation and plans to make
it easier for companies to sack workers. Economists say that labour and
social security reforms are vital to maintain the balance and momentum of
the government's free market policies.
Underlying the economic issues is a political struggle. Mr Menem needs union
support to amend the constitution to allow him to stand for re-election when
his term ends in 1995. Analysts say that is why he has so far shrunk from
tackling labour reform.
Union bosses are also attempting to recover their former political
ascendancy. But yesterday's strike was hardly convincing as a show of union
strength.
Strikes under the previous government were much more disruptive, especially
in the country's bigger cities, which nearly shut down.
The traditionally powerful unions are slowly losing support in the country.
Pollsters note that the unions have failed to capitalise on growing
discontent caused by falling wages and collapsing social services, mainly
because their leadership is widely viewed as bureaucratic and
unrepresentative.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Chile breaks out of the boom-bust cycle: Soaring investment
is enabling the government to target the country's poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CHILE is likely to become Latin America's top performing economy this year.
The latest central bank forecast sees the economy expanding by at least 8
per cent in 1992, following nine years of uninterrupted growth.
After three years of falling inflation, the country appears to have broken
the cycle of inflationary booms followed by sharp recessions that has been
the region's trademark for many decades.
Newspapers have not carried a gloomy economic article in months. Instead,
the headlines reflect the giddy feeling of success that permeates the
country.
Santiago's skyline is a jungle of construction cranes and shimmering new
buildings. A recent survey of 900 export companies reported steady or
expanding foreign orders. There are so many mining projects in the Atacama
desert that engineering firms are recruiting professionals abroad, having
emptied the engineering schools at home. Unemployment, at 5 per cent, is at
a 20-year low.
The strength of the Chilean economy is underpinned by growing and
diversifying exports. These will nudge the Dollars 10bn mark this year,
representing almost 30 per cent of GDP. Traditional exports, such a copper,
fishmeal and fresh fruit still form the bulk of foreign earnings, but they
are being joined by an eclectic list of new products and manufactured goods.
Non-traditional exports - fresh salmon from southern Chile, wine from the
central valley, furniture, biotechnology - are growing at an annual rate of
18 per cent and will earn almost Dollars 2bn in 1992. Chile recently
overtook Germany as the third largest wine exporter to the US, behind France
and Italy. About 10m cases will be shipped this year, worth Dollars 100m.
The government's foreign policy is centred on opening new markets for
Chilean exports. President Patricio Aylwin and a retinue of businessmen flew
to the Far East this week for trade talks in Malaysia, China and Japan,
which is now the biggest buyer of Chilean goods.
The country is sprinting to break a whole batch of economic records this
year. The central bank's international reserves, at Dollars 8.9bn, are
enough to cover Chile's import bill for one year. In August, Chile became
the first country in Latin America to regain international standards of
creditworthiness with a Standard &amp; Poor's investment grade rating for the
country's sovereign debt.
Investment is growing at almost twice the rate of the economy. This year,
the government is targetting Dollars 3bn on housing, irrigation and the
country's congested roads and ports, while the private sector has invested a
record Dollars 4.3bn in mining, forestry and other export industries.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, sees this as the biggest vote of
confidence from a business community that initially fretted over economic
policy in the hands of a centre-left government after Chile's return to
democracy in 1990.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this investment boom is that it is
being financed almost entirely out of Chile's domestic savings. Both Mr
Foxley and Mr Roberto Zahler, the president of Chile's independent central
bank, see this as an important departure from the country's historic
reliance on foreign capital flows.
National savings have climbed to 18 per cent of GDP, from a meagre 8 per
cent 10 years ago. So while foreign investment remains important, Mr Zahler
believes Chile is strengthening its ability to weather external shocks.
Unlike central bankers elsewhere in Latin America, Mr Zahler is in the
enviable position of having to manage the headaches of success. His main
challenge this year has been to stem the flood of dollars entering the
country, and control the steady appreciation of the peso without damaging
the competitiveness of Chilean exports.
The central bank has relaxed foreign exchange controls to allow the peso to
appreciate by about 10 per cent against the dollar this year. Although the
main reason for doing this was to stem the build up of foreign exchange
reserves, cheaper imports have also helped bring down inflation by almost 6
points this year to an annual 13 per cent.
The central bank has has forecast inflation of between 10 and 12 per cent
for next year because of the widespread indexation of the economy.
Success is also changing the nature of economic debate in Chile. The radical
free-marketeers who held sway during Gen Augusto Pinochet's era have lost
ground to a new generation of economic thinkers who believe the state has an
important role to play in promoting health, education and technological
change.
Economists at Santiago's Catholic University, once the breeding ground for
Gen Pinochet's finance ministers, are now focusing on fighting poverty,
which still engulfs 40 per cent of the population.
But Mr Foxley still believes it will take perhaps 20 years to raise Chile's
per capita income, which is still low at Dollars 2,800, to those of southern
Europe.
A tax reform pushed through in the first year of President Aylwin's
government allowed Mr Foxley to raise an extra Dollars 1bn for social
projects, better pensions and higher wages for doctors, schoolteachers and
civil servants.
He has done this while generating fiscal surpluses in the past 2 1/2 years.
He says the government will have saved over 3.2 per cent of GDP in 1992.
Eventually, Chileans will feel bold enough to question the cost of their
armed forces. They are paying a high price for the country's peaceful
transition to democracy: the military consume more than 15 per cent of the
government's income.
In private, government officials admit that they are paying to keep the army
happy and out of politics. The military burden will continue to drain public
finances for many years to come, as Gen Pinochet's conscript army is
unlikely to rethink its role in Chile's new democracy until the 74-year-old
commander-in-chief retires in 1998.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (5): A long, hard slog back to recovery -
The economic recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S economic recession, which began in the autumn of 1990, shows few
signs of coming to an end. Indeed, the turbulent events of this autumn have
added to widespread predictions that the slump will persist until the
mid-1990s - much longer than even the most pessimistic economists believed
likely only a few months ago, writes Robert Taylor.
The immediate future is not all gloom. Sweden looks set for an export boom
on the back of a sharp decline in unit costs, with an expected 9 per cent
improvement in competitiveness over the next two years. Industry is forecast
to increase its relative competitive position by 18 per cent against
Germany, its main export market, in that period.
Sweden's exports are set to rise by 3.5 per cent next year and by 6 per cent
in 1994, according to the Ministry of Finance. That will ensure a healthy
trade surplus of Skr47bn in 1993 and SKr59.6bn in the following year.
The country's current account will move out of deficit. In 1991 it was
SKr21.3bn and this year it will be SKr19.9bn in the red but by 1994 Sweden
will enjoy a small surplus of 4.1 per cent.
Wage and price rises are expected to be much lower than those experienced by
Sweden's main trade rivals. The 5 per cent cut in employers' social
contributions announced as part of the September crisis package, combined
with expected low wage rises of only 2.5 per cent on average in both 1993
and 1994, will help to boost industrial productivity by an impressive annual
growth rate of 5 per cent over the same period.
The consumer price index is expected to increase by 2.1 per cent this year
(compared with a crippling 9.4 per cent in 1991), which is lower than that
of most western European countries. Prices are set to climb by 4 per cent
next year, but this is due to increases in indirect taxation. In 1994 the
Ministry of Finance predicts the index to grow by 2.3 per cent.
Some comfort might also be drawn from official forecasts (backed up by
independent predictions) for savings. The savings ratio - for so long
negative in a country that believed it should spend and spend because of
high inflation - is expected to be a positive 6.2 per cent this year, 5.8
per cent in 1993 and 6.3 per cent in 1994. Such savings figures have not
been seen in Sweden since the middle of the 1960s.
But these optimistic economic indicators seem unlikely to comfort most
Swedes who face a squeeze on their affluent living standards until at least
1995.
This year Sweden is expected to suffer a fall of 1.1 per cent in its gross
domestic product after a 1.4 per cent decline in 1991. This will be followed
by a further 1.5 per cent drop next year before a modest 0.9 per cent
recovery in 1994.
Real disposable income is set to plummet by 2.9 per cent next year before
staging a modest 0.5 per cent recovery in 1994. Personal consumption will
decline by 2.5 per cent this year followed by a 2.5 per cent fall next year
and nil growth in 1994. But the Ministry of Finance believes that there is
'a considerable risk that the decline will be even greater'.
The most serious sign of continuing slump will be the nosedive in
investment, partly because of the intractable crisis in the property market
due to plummeting real estate values and the drop in demand for
construction. Official predictions for 1993 and 1994 suggest gross
investment will drop by 8.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. The
Federation of Swedish Industries in its latest prognosis expects a huge 29.1
per cent slump in housing investment next year and a further 17.4 per cent
plunge in 1994.
The Ministry of Finance believes there will be an improvement in industrial
output in 1993 of 1 per cent, followed by a 5 per cent growth in the
following year. This follows a 5.3 per cent decline in industrial output
last year and a predicted further 2.5 per cent fall this year.
These figures could prove over-optimistic. The Federation of Swedish
Industries forecasts a 5.4 per cent fall in industrial production this year
followed by a further 4 per decline cent in 1993 and even a 1 per cent drop
in 1994.
The non-Socialist coalition government is committed to a free market
strategy designed to reduce the burden of the state on the economy. But the
prolonged recession is forcing ministers to scale down expectations and
accept they cannot cut taxes and government spending as fast as they would
like.
The latest forecasts suggest the Swedish public sector is going to remain
substantial at least until the middle 1990s. The level of public consumption
that totalled SKr383bn in 1991 (out of a total demand of SKr1.809bn) is
going to remain constant with a 0.1 per cent increase this year and a rise
of 0.2 per cent in 1993 before it falls by 0.5 per cent in 1994.
This year government outlays total 69.2 per cent of Sweden's gross domestic
product while tax revenues have declined to 50.8 per cent because of the
decline in business activities. In 1993 the proportion raised by the public
sector in taxes and charges will rise to 51.5 per cent and to 52.1 per cent
in 1994. At the same time public expenditure will climb to 71.8 per cent
next year and to 72.7 per cent the year after.
Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, faces an uphill task in reducing
the government's budget deficit. It is not hard to understand the anxiety of
Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor, and the money markets at what
has been happening to government spending over the past 12 months.
In this calendar year the budget deficit is predicted to be around SKr110bn,
just under 8 per cent of gross domestic product. This contrasts with a
SKr70.8bn deficit totalling 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1991. For the 1992-1993
financial year ending next July the budget deficit looks set to be about
SKr160bn.
The first of the two September cross-party crisis packages aims to abolish
the structural part of that deficit over the next two years although the
precise size of that figure remains uncertain. The Ministry of Finance
expects the public sector deficit to amount to around 10 per cent of
Sweden's gross domestic product in both 1993 and 1994, so it is not going to
be easy to bring government spending under control.
The bleak message this autumn is that the country faces a long, hard slog
back to economic recovery. But at least there is a bipartisan consensus on
the framework of what needs to be done. All sides hope to adapt Sweden to
the rigours of the European Community after 1995. This means a rapid
adjustment in laying down the foundations for future growth.
It is unfortunate for Sweden that it is having to abandon old ways of
economic thinking in the middle of a financial hurricane. The current
outlook depends so much on what happens to the international economy outside
the control and even the influence of Sweden's policy-makers. In September
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, likened his country to a small boat
tossing and turning on high seas. The turbulence may have eased but it
remains questionable whether it has really gone away completely.
Since the early months of 1989 Sweden has experienced five separate economic
crises that have produced large net outflows of foreign capital from the
country and necessitated government spending cuts, tax increases and
exorbitant interest rates. The country has had to pay a bitter price for its
old reputation as a devaluer.
Most observers are convinced now that Sweden has gone through too much to
resort to manipulation of the exchange rate as a way out of its troubles.
But the policymakers will have to keep their nerve when registered
unemployment soars over 7 per cent in 1993 and popular pressure increases
for a dash for growth as a method of creating jobs quickly.
What looks likely to hold them back from abandoning their current strategy
is the recognition that such a U-turn would destroy Sweden's determination
to be a model EC member in 1995.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (7): Swedish model leaves stage - Wage
bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S world-famous system of centralised wage bargaining between the
country's employers and trade unions died slowly in the 1980s as SAF
(Arbetsgivareforeningen) the country's powerful employers' organisation,
turned against it on the grounds that it was inflexible, unwieldy and
inflationary. But no definitive, permanent alternative has so far emerged,
writes Robert Taylor.
This autumn SAF has mobilised its 45,000 corporate members in a united front
against any attempt by the trade unions to press for a new centralised wage
agreement for 1993 and beyond after the present arrangements end in April.
Mr Ulf Laurin, SAF's combative president, wants to see no general pay rise
for anybody next year but a continuation of the existing two-year national
agreement achieved by a government-appointed mediation commission. However,
he favours the removal of two days' paid holiday from all workers as part of
September's all-party crisis package.
In the longer run, he believes in an escape once and for all from the
fixation with centralised pay bargaining and the encouragement of a
multiplicity of different payment systems among companies. 'The Swedish
Model is dead. I want to see a diversity of Swedish Models in wage
determination,' he explains.
Most employers are in no position to compensate their workers for the
present severe squeeze on living standards, let alone provide them with an
increase that would improve their wage packets.
'We are uniquely united this time,' says Mr Laurin. For once all of Sweden's
employers - even those in the country's enormous public services sector -
have agreed to hold a firm line over pay. He accepts some of the large
export-oriented companies may want to reward their workers and he believes
they need the flexibility to do so but he remains opposed to any return to
the old Swedish wage bargaining system that - as he points out - ensured
many workers secured three separate pay rises at different levels -
national, industrial and company - with the inevitable emergence of severe
wage drift.
SAF is opposed in particular to any attempt by the trade unions to negotiate
 -as they want - a special deal for the low paid. Nor are employers in the
mood to endorse any wage bargaining that involves income redistribution. The
days of egalitarian wage policies are over.
Ideally, SAF would like to see pay negotiations in future as close to the
individual worker as possible. The present economic crisis provides Sweden's
employers with an opportunity to reform industrial relations as they want.
Rising unemployment can be expected to weaken trade union resistance.
But it is necessary to distinguish between employer rhetoric and reality
over wage determination. Under Mr Laurin's leadership SAF has abandoned much
of its corporatist behaviour. Its nominees no longer sit of right on public
boards. The organisation does not believe it should help to run the country.
It preaches robust free market values of decentralisation and individualism.
But this is no clean break with the past. Old habits linger on and the
severity of Sweden's economic troubles continue to shape employer attitudes.
Two years ago, neither SAF nor the trade unions wanted the creation of a
temporary national mediation commission to coax the two sides to agree on
pay but they accepted it eventually and it turned out a great success.
Wage pressures eased dramatically as a result of the commission with a fall
in the level of increase in hourly earnings from 10 per cent in 1990 to 5.6
per cent a year later.
Professor Hans de Geer , the author of a forthcoming book in English - The
Rise and Fall of the Swedish Model (Carden Publications) - admits SAF found
itself in a 'paradoxical stance' as a result of accepting the mediation
commission. As he argues: 'In reality, if not formally, just as SAF decided
in principle on a decentralised form of negotiations, formal wage formation
was again being centralised.'
This winter the LO - Sweden's once mighty blue-collar union federation  - is
revising its whole attitude to wage bargaining. It recently admitted:
'Increased unemployment and a deregulated capital market have dramatically
strengthened the power of employers in their relations with workers.'
Some union leaders may talk of using pay bargaining as a way of compensating
households for the coming squeeze on their living standards but few Swedes
believe the mood among workers is ripe for militant action. The LO favours
the creation of what it calls an Ecu wage norm at national level of around 5
per cent, arguing that a centralised approach is more cost-effective than
any other.
The National Institute of Economic Research estimated recently that hourly
earnings will rise by only 3.5 per cent this year with further modest
increases of 3 per cent in 1993 and 4 per cent in 1994. This will ensure a
1.9 per cent increase in real disposable income, followed by a 2.8 per cent
drop next year and only 1 per cent growth in 1994.
Compare this with the increase of hourly earnings in both 1989 and 1990 by
an average 10 per cent and a real improvement in disposable incomes of 2 per
cent and 3.1 per cent respectively.
The cold climate for wage bargaining may help to reduce unit labour costs
still further over the next two years but many employers in manufacturing
are reforming their work organisations and they want to introduce forms of
merit pay to reward and encourage their workers. As Mr Laurin emphasises,
Swedish employers want to have the freedom to introduce more flexible
payments systems.
But in the end neither SAF nor the trade unions seem likely to achieve all
they want. Sweden will not return to centralised, nationwide wage
determination. Nor will it move to the unstable free-for- all known in
Britain. Some co-ordination among employers and trade unions seems likely to
remain, however decentralised pay determination may grow in future. Indeed,
SAF will have to devise a strong and uniform employer front to ensure a more
long-term flexible approach succeeds.
Prof de Geer sees the possible emergence of a 'system of local negotiations
based on a fundamental attitude of converging interests in the companies'.
This will empower local trade union organisations and their employer
equivalents.
An obvious tension exists between the national macro-economic need for low
or no pay rises and the wish by Swedish employers to link pay more closely
to productivity. The greater application of market forces to public welfare
services may help to break down the difference in bargaining between private
and public sectors but the demand for equity and fairness remains strong.
The outlines of Sweden's next pay system have yet to be agreed. In the
meantime, all sides face the gloomy prospect of wage-cutting unless the
economy revives.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (6): Bid to tackle the jobless crisis -
Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE maintenance of full employment is no longer the first priority of
Sweden's economic policymakers. Few may be ready to admit it in public but,
ever since October 1990 when the then ruling Social Democrats introduced a
crisis package to reverse a dramatic outflow of capital from the country, it
has become increasingly apparent that the conquest of inflation and defence
of the krona's fixed exchange rate are regarded as more urgent objectives,
writes Robert Taylor.
But this does not mean that Swedes are willing to sit passively and watch an
inexorable rise in their registered unemployment total to the current
European Community average of just under 10 per cent. On the contrary; even
during the marathon all-party negotiations in September on the bipartisan
crisis package, all the country's party leaders (even the conservative Mr
Bildt) recognised further financial resources were needed to counter the
threat of soaring joblessness this winter.
Indeed, in the current financial year which ends next July Sweden's labour
market board (Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen or AMS) - the public body responsible
for the employment services - has been allocated SKr30bn to spend, nearly
double the SKr19bn it received in 1991-1992. 'We are getting all the
financial resources we need. In fact I'm really worried about whether we
will be able to make good use of all the money,' admits Mr Gote Berhardsson,
AMS's general director.
He takes a gloomy, if realistic, view of what will happen to Sweden's labour
market over the next few years. 'The 1993-94 financial year will be worse
than this year,' he says. AMS estimates that the registered unemployment
total will have reached 9 per cent by next autumn. The number of long-term
jobless (defined as those registered without work for more than six months)
will climb to 100,000 next year from 62,000 at the moment.
AMS reckons that nearly 500,000 jobs will have vanished from the Swedish
labour market between the start of 1991 and the end of 1993. It estimates
50,000 jobs will be lost in manufacturing next year, which is a further 6
per cent fall, cutting the labour force in that sector to 850,000.
On top of this, AMS forecasts that 35 per cent of Sweden's construction
workers will be jobless by next winter. In the past the country's service
sector has provided a way out by increasing job opportunities, but not any
more. Even Sweden's huge public services will be shedding labour over the
coming months with around 45,000 jobs expected to go next year while job
losses in the private services sector look set to accelerate to 60,000.
Mr Berhardsson stresses that AMS alone is incapable of solving the growing
unemployment crisis. 'We can't take on the responsibility for bringing back
full employment.' He argues that it is up to the government to pursue a
growth strategy that will create more jobs.
He believes his organisation can deal with up to 3.5 per cent of the entire
workforce but next year AMS is being asked to cater for as many as 0.25m
people, which is 5 per cent.
AMS was established as a public agency in the early 1950s. It had been seen
as an instrument to lubricate the tight labour market by providing training
and education programmes that give workers new skills so they can adapt to
technological change. As such, it has won an international reputation,
though few other countries have really copied the AMS system.
Now, however, AMS must deal with a growing jobless crisis, of a magnitude
which Sweden has not experienced for more than 60 years. But AMS is no part
of the country's social services. It remains a commercially driven
organisation, not a relief agency which has been given the thankless task of
containing the rise in the country's unemployment.
At present AMS is spending about 30 per cent of its budget in paying
unemployment benefit to the registered jobless, a proportion of its
allocation that Mr Berhardsson for one believes is much too high.
Traditionally AMS has concentrated its resources on active, not passive,
labour market activities or on the placement and counselling services for
those either without work seeking a new job or wishing to change their
employment.
Lutheran Sweden takes a traditionally harsh view of the work-shy and it
applies stiff work availability tests for those who find themselves without
a job. Indeed, AMS is prepared to use coercive methods if necessary to
encourage shirkers to go on a training course or take a place on a work
experience scheme.
At the moment it is estimated that 97,000 Swedes are on training courses,
which last for six months. A further 46,500 Swedes aged between 18 and 24
are taking advantage of a new AMS scheme that began this September which
provides them with work experience for six months mainly with small private
sector companies. The number of places on the scheme will rise to 72,000 in
1993. Participants are paid an allowance equal to the benefit they would
receive if unemployed but Mr Berhardsson insists it is not a form of job
substitution. On top of this, AMS has a further 40,000 Swedes carrying out
relief work mainly for local authorities.
Already AMS's emergency action has had an impact on the aggregate numbers
out of work. In September those recorded as unemployed (who were seeking
work actively) fell to 5.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent in August. But it is
estimated that as many as 11 per cent of workers now lie outside Sweden's
normal labour market, either unemployed or being covered by AMS schemes, and
that figure looks set to rise to 15 per cent during 1993.
The financial support being given to Sweden's labour market services by the
government indicates that politicians are keen to minimise the social and
economic damage caused by unemployment. Nonetheless, the overall statistics
suggest Sweden can no longer claim to be an exception to other western
European economies. Like them, it is also having to deal with a jobless
crisis that no amount of training and education alone can disguise for long.

SWEDEN'S ability to adapt its economy and political system to the realities
of international recession was put to a severe test this autumn as capital
flowed out of the country in a crisis of confidence.
In its stubborn defence of the krona's fixed exchange rate, Sweden stood
impressively united. A wide alliance emerged combining the political
parties, employers, financiers, trade unionists and the public. For many
Swedes it became a patriotic duty to stand firm against devaluation.
Other European countries - Britain, Spain, Italy and Finland - caved in
under the pressure of the speculators. The French franc was saved by the
powerful intervention of the Bundesbank. Only Sweden among those in the eye
of Europe's financial storms came through by its own efforts.
'I have found many governments on my recent travels around Europe who have
been impressed by what we did,' says Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's conservative
prime minister.
At one point the central bank was forced to increase its overnight lending
rate to 500 per cent to convince the markets of Sweden's resolve. 'At first,
we underestimated the severity of the crisis,' admits Mr Bildt. Indeed, it
took at least a fortnight of public urging from Mr Bengt Dennis, the central
bank governor, to convince the government it must reassure the markets that
it would eliminate the country's structural budget deficit.
National resistance to devaluation was impressive. After all, Sweden has
used that weapon many times since the war to improve its industrial
competitiveness at the expense of its trading partners.
However, Mr Bildt argues: 'Devaluation does not work in the long run - that
was our experience.' Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Social Democrats,
agrees with him.
Under enormous pressure, the main political parties suspended their
animosities to hammer out two separate national crisis packages designed to
defend the krona and restore the country's industrial competitiveness.
'It was an historic milestone,' declares Mr Carlsson. There have been
sacrifices on both sides. Cherished welfare programmes, such as child
benefit, have been cut. Some of the government's free market plans, such as
privatising state industries, have been postponed. Living standards will be
squeezed and there will be more unemployment. But opinion polls suggest
nearly 90 per cent of Swedes agree with what was done.
The response to September's crisis shows how Sweden has changed over the
past three and a half years since the abolition of its foreign exchange
controls in July 1989. From being a model social democracy, it is being
transformed into a market-oriented economy determined to integrate into
western Europe.
All the controls and regulations that cut the country off from the rest of
the world have gone. From January 1 Sweden will become a member of the
19-nation European Economic Area. Now most influential Swedes want to become
good Europeans and travel on the inside track of the Community.
The consensus among the country's great and the good over the virtues of EC
membership remains solid. When formal negotiations begin with Brussels on
Sweden's entry early next year the impetus for a swift and successful
outcome will quicken.
Mr Bildt insists his country's tight timetable for EC membership can still
be kept despite doubts over the Maastricht treaty in Denmark and Britain and
worries over lost EC momentum. He wants to see an outline agreement ready by
next December so it can be ratified by parliament and then presented for the
approval of the Swedish people in a binding referendum perhaps in the spring
or early summer of 1994, before the general election due that autumn. If all
goes well, Sweden could then join the EC on January 1 1995.
The prime minister considers that negotiations with the EC will take only
'two to three months' to reach a satisfactory outcome. He sees the only
problem area as regional policy, with reassurances from Brussels that it
will recognise the special needs of Sweden's Arctic Circle area. But
enlargement also involves Finland, Austria and probably Norway as well as
Switzerland. Mr Bildt accepts their negotiations could prove harder and
might hold up Sweden's move.
At present the opinion polls suggest most Swedes are against EC entry,
partly because of the confusion over the ratification of the Maastricht
treaty, but also because many identify the EC cause with a currently
unpopular government. But, Mr Bildt insists the mood is changeable. With all
the main political parties campaigning for a Yes vote in the referendum, he
believes the pro-EC forces will win.
He also draws comfort from the fact that unlike in Norway the present
hostility towards the EC in Sweden has not led to the development of a
political movement aginst entry. Only the tiny Greens and the former
Communist party oppose Sweden's EC entry and neither has more than 4 per
cent of the vote at present. The politicians believe they have time to
convince the voters to support the EC.
There is a sound reason for the apparent haste by those who want to see
rapid negotiation for Sweden to join the EC. Under the country's
constitution so fundamental a change must be ratified by two successive
parliaments. Ratification is needed for any amendment to the constitution at
least nine months before a general election and this must be voted through
again by the incoming parliament.
In practice, this would mean ratifying Sweden's entry terms by next December
18 as the Swedish voters go to the country again on September 18 1994. If
this timetable goes adrift Sweden would not be able to join the EC until
January 1998.
In the meantime, Sweden faces other severe problems. Its recession is likely
to continue longer than anybody expected a few months ago. Unemployment
looks set to rise to 9 per cent or more - figures not seen in Sweden since
the early 1930s. An export-led recovery is expected as the country's
industrial competitiveness improves with lower costs and greater
productivity, but for most Swedes the next two years will mean a probable
decline in living standards and real wages, with negative or next to no
growth before 1995.
With the international money markets likely to remain feverish, Sweden is
still vulnerable as a small, open economy dependent on exports to maintain
its relatively affluent lifestyle. Pressures on the krona have abated, but
they could return again.
The future of the country's banks and financial institutions continues to
cause concern. The credit losses resulting from the reckless lending
policies of the late 1980s after deregulation have already forced the state
to underpin Nordbanken, Gota Bank and the savings bank Skopbanken. The
government is taking the unprecedented step of guaranteeing to uphold the
financial system at a cost of up to SKr90bn over the next three years. This
will be a severe burden on the taxpayer and could trigger wider anxieties
about the solidity of the banks.
But there is a greater worry ahead. Sweden's budget deficit is forecast by
the Ministry of Finance to reach 10 per cent of the country's gross national
product by the 1993-1994 financial year, a figure Mr Bildt and others accept
is 'unsustainable'. The protracted slump means the cyclical debt will go on
rising as the structural one declines, so Sweden will have no choice but to
reduce the huge size of its public sector.
So far, it has only been trimmed round the edges. More drastic surgery will
be necessary next year. But there could be strong resistance to change, as
illustrated in recent weeks by the trade union uproar over the all-party
proposal that workers should lose two days from their statutory five weeks
and two days' paid holiday.
Vested interests in the Swedish welfare state remain formidable. Politicians
across the spectrum have talked for years about restructuring the public
services - making them more sensitive to consumer needs and introducing
greater individual choice. But when it comes to action, much of Sweden's
public services are run by the local authorities, not the central state.
Moreover, any radical strategy would involve job losses and upheaval while
the Swedish labour market has no employment opportunities. This is why Mr
Bildt and others talk about a phased programme of renewal. All sides agreed
in September's crisis package that financing and administration of the
health service should be shifted from the state to employers by the
mid-1990s. That is a sign of what may come elsewhere in the public sector.
In Mr Bildt's phrase, Sweden's 'welfare state' will be transformed into a
'welfare market'.
Despite the rapidity of the structural changes that are occurring as the
country adapts to the needs of EC membership and global competition, older
values of solidarity and fairness will not be turned over easily. Continuity
remains as important as change in modern Sweden.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Detroit's insiders tip Briton
for top Ford job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WILL Ford Motor, the second largest of Detroit's big three vehicle
manufacturers, follow rivals General Motors and Chrysler and remake its top
management team before the year is out? If so, might a British-born
executive emerge as heir-apparent to the chair-man?
That is one of the hottest topics of debate in the US motor industry, with
some analysts suggesting Ford could move as early as this week to anoint an
heir-apparent to Mr Harold Poling, the company's 67-year-old chairman and
chief executive, who is due to retire next year.
The favoured candidate of the Detroit rumour-mill is Mr Alex Trotman, 59,
the British-born executive vice-president in charge of Ford's North American
operations.
Until just a few months ago, the front-runner had been widely assumed to be
Mr Allan Gilmour, 58, the urbane executive vice-president in charge of
worldwide vehicle operations.
However, some analysts claim to have detected growing enthusiasm on the Ford
board for Mr Trotman, who currently reports to Mr Gilmour. Mr Trotman's
background is in manufacturing, while Mr Gilmour rose through Ford's finance
operations.
The financial and engineering sides of the industry have often vied for the
top jobs - hence the phrase 'bean counters versus car guys'. The finance
stream has tended to provide the chairmen at both GM and Ford, although
recently there appears to have been a trend towards engineers, or at least
finance men with operational backgrounds.
Ford's board is due to hold two more meetings before the end of the year -
the first is on Thursday - and analysts suggest it may decide to set a
succession in motion, so as to ensure a smooth transition next year. A
spokesman yesterday declined to comment.
One possibility would be for Mr Trotman to be elevated to the board by
taking over as president and chief operating officer from Mr Philip Benton,
63, who is thought to be near retirement. However, this theory argues that
the board would also promote Mr Gilmour to vice-chairman, seeking to retain
him as a key member of the management team.
Mr Trotman, who joined Ford in Britain in 1955 as a student trainee, rose on
the product planning side. He is the only member of the group's senior
executive team to have run its vehicle operations in the three major markets
 -North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (12): Fortunes shift with
those of the industry - Profile of Tandem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE changing fortunes of Tandem, the Cupertino, California-based maker of
'fault-tolerant' computer systems, reflect the shift in attitudes towards
computerisation within the financial services industry which is its
principal customer.
Founded in 1974, it has grown steadily if unspectacularly to revenues of
Dollars 2bn for the year ended September 30, 1992. The company made a net
loss of Dollars 41.2m after restructuring charges of Dollars 106m. The
company, therefore, has not proven immune to the effects of the worldwide
recession on its leading markets.
Mr James Treybig, Tandem founder and chief executive, made it clear that
adverse market conditions would continue: 'We remain cautious about the
future,' he wrote, introducing the results. 'Historical experience would
indicate a slower first quarter and uncertainty in Europe and Japan
continues.'
The bald figures, however, give little indication of Tandem's position and
continuing potential in the financial services world. In two decades it has
become as clearly identified with 'mission critical' systems in banking and
finance as International Business Machines and Digital Equipment are
identified with 'back office' accounting machinery. Its customers include
big banks and stock exchanges. One of the best-known examples of a
Tandem-based system is the London clearing banks 'Chaps' same day payments
system.
There have been three phases in the history of Tandem. Its earliest role was
as a pioneer of fault-tolerant systems. It was the first minicomputer
manufacturer to understand that a market existed for systems which could be
guaranteed never to fail. Customers for such systems included financial
institutions, newspapers and the armed forces.
Tandem's approach was to duplicate all the essential hardware elements,
controlling the allocation of resources through the 'Guardian' operating
system; Tandem computers, like any others, failed on occasion, but in a
controlled manner without loss of data. It was an expensive approach, but
for some applications there was no alternative.
In its next phase, beginning in the early 1980s, Tandem emphasised its
expertise in on-line transaction processing (OLTP). It reasoned that
fault-tolerance was of such advantage that within a few years, all computers
would be fault-tolerant. At the same time, a rash of competitors emerged in
the fault-tolerant arena, of which the most tenacious has proved to be
Stratus, based in Marlboro, Massachusetts.
The threat failed to materialise. Perhaps because of the increasing
reliability of computer hardware, few other manufacturers made much of
fault-tolerance and Tandem and Stratus - which supplies its machines under a
marketing agreement to IBM, Olivetti and ICL - remain market leaders.
On-line transaction processing, however, is the key to productivity in
applications from payment processing, airline reservations, telephone
networks, operations management, time and attendance and customer
information. According to the Gartner Group, OLTP is the fastest developing
sector of the computer industry with an annual growth rate of 20 per cent;
it is expected to be worth over Dollars 70bn by 1994.
Tandem claims that OLTP run on its fault-tolerant systems is more
cost-effective than OLTP run on its competitors' non-fault-tolerant (and
therefore less expensive) machines.
In its third phase, Tandem is moving into 'continuous availability', a stage
beyond fault tolerance, where the system is never out of action. Components
will, of course, continue to fail, but in such a way that they can be
removed and repaired while processing continues.
Mr Roger Bellass, managing director of Tandem UK, one of the company's
biggest markets outside the US, says that few companies have so far tried to
design a continuously available system. 'It is possible to create a
continuously available system if you buy enough equipment, but that is quite
different from designing a continuously available system from scratch.'
Tandem typically spends 13-14 per cent of revenues on research and
development and intends to maintain its investment; it is looking for
economies elsewhere in the organisation as the recession continues to bite.
Mr Treybig points out, for example, that the company has moved out of
printed circuit board (PCB) manufacture, and sold off its PCB factory. It
will now buy in its boards, fully populated with microchips and other
electronic components: 'We can never be happy with our costs,' Mr Treybig
says.
A big feature of the company's product line has been its ability to offer
liner expandability - where performance increases in direct proportion to
system size. In the past few years, moreover, Tandem has developed products
to match industry trends to 'open systems'.
It offers a family called 'Integrity' which provides fault-tolerance on the
Unix operating system. Announced early in 1990, it was a startling
development for a company whose success had been closely tied to the quality
and reliability of its proprietary operating system, but its acceptance in
the market is further evidence of the appeal of standard software.
Mr Treybig says: 'After several years of investment in building a Unix-based
product division, our Integrity systems division more than doubled revenues
in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago and contributed to profits.'
It has also recently moved into reduced instruction set (Risc) architectures
which offer high performance at low cost. Its chosen partner in Risc
technology is Mips, now a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics. Mr Treybig seemed
confident of Mips despite the company's recent indifferent performance.
Referring to a new microprocessor from Digital Equipment which, on paper at
least, is the world's fastest, he says: 'I don't think that the Alpha chip
is going to run away with the market.' At the top of the range is the
Cyclone/R, which Tandem says is the first Risc-based mainframe for high
volume OLTP.
Mr Treybig believes Tandem's survival and success stems from its ability to
provide scalable systems, fault-tolerance and data integrity: 'It is not
just the work of a few people. it is a whole culture,' he concludes.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Interest fall hurts Yamanouchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YAMANOUCHI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese ethical drug manufacturer,
yesterday revealed that non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six
months to September were hit by a fall in interest income.
Interim taxable profits fell by 4.4 per cent to Y30.24bn (Dollars 247.86m)
from Y31.62bn, on a 6.6 per cent growth in sales to Y119.87bn from
Y112.42bn. Yamanouchi attributed the sales growth to a rise in demand for
Gaster, its anti-ulcer drug.
Operating profits grew 3.1 per cent to Y25.61bn from Y24.85bn, while net
profits fell 4.8 per cent to Y15.62bn.
Profits fell because of a Y1.2bn fall in interest income. However,
Yamanouchi is to increase its interim dividend by Y1 a share to Y6.50.
For the full year to March, Yamanouchi expects pre-tax profits to edge up
0.7 per cent to Y61.5bn on an 8.5 per cent rise in sales to Y245bn.
Shionogi, another Japanese pharmaceutical company mainly engaged in
antibiotics, reported an 8.1 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the first
six months to Y9.3bn from Y10.11bn, on a 2.6 per cent rise in sales to
Y114.04bn. Operating profits rose 22.6 per cent to Y7.44bn from Y6.07bn,
while net profits fell 16.3 per cent to Y3.94bn from Y4.71bn.
For the full year to March, Shionogi expects pre-tax profits to fall 5.6 per
cent to Y18.3bn on a 3.3 per cent rise in sales to Y233bn.
Tanabe Seiyaku, which mainly makes drugs for circulatory organs, saw a sharp
rise in interim profits thanks to increased exports of Herbesser, its
cardiac remedy. Pre-tax profits grew 13.2 per cent to Y7.58bn from Y6.69bn,
on a 3.7 per cent sales increase to Y109.61bn from Y105.73. Net profits
advanced by 7.8 per cent to Y2.32bn from Y2.15bn.
For the full year, Tanabe projects a 5.3 per cent rise in taxable profits to
Y13.7bn on a 0.9 per cent rise in sales to Y212bn.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical, another leading Japanese ethical drugs producer, was
hit by official medicine price cuts, and saw pre-tax profits for the first
six months fall 7.4 per cent to Y19.1bn from Y20.63bn on a 7.5 per cent rise
in sales to Y101.94bn from Y94.85bn. Net profits fell 7 per cent to Y9.09bn
from Y9.78bn.

<TEXT>
RELIANCE Industries, the fast-growing Indian chemicals and textiles
conglomerate, yesterday reported a 119 per cent rise in net profits to
Rs1.82bn (Dollars 64m), for the six months to September, from Rs831m a year
earlier, due to a sharp increase in sales and a substantial increase in
earnings from financial investments.
Reliance, which this year became the first Indian company to raise equity in
international markets through the issue of global depository receipts,
reported a 26 per cent advance in sales to Rs13.48bn, excluding inter-group
transactions, from Rs10.66bn. Profits from financial transactions were
Rs522m, compared with none in the same period last year. Gross profits were
Rs3.09bn, an increase of 73 per cent over the previous Rs1.79bn.
Reliance expects further growth in profits in the second half of the year,
as long as the government presses ahead with the deregulation of the
petrochemicals industry. The group said it was suffering from the fact that
the government, which is in the middle of economic reform, had cut subsidies
on certain chemical feedstocks, thereby raising Reliance's input prices.
But it had not yet liberalised imports of these products - depriving
Reliance of access to cheaper imported feedstocks. Also, the Indian industry
was suffering from 'large-scale dumping' and 'severe unfair competition'
from foreign chemicals producers who were selling their products in India.
However, Reliance expects the government to act soon on both these problems.
The company is raising funds on the Bombay stock market for two subsidiaries
which will make plastics in partnership with Itochu, the Japanese trading
company.

ENERGIE-Versorgung Niedersterreich (EVN), the Austrian electricity and gas
utility, reported a 5.9 per cent rise in net profit to Sch181m (Dollars
16.2m) for the year to end-August, thanks mainly to the resilience of the
Austrian economy.
EVN, which operates in the province of Lower Austria surrounding Vienna,
said revenues rose 6.1 per cent to Sch9.85bn and operating profit gained
13.2 per cent to Sch677m. Pre-tax profits were Sch712m, up 0.7 per cent.
'Even in these difficult times of global economic slowdown, our company's
performance was satisfactory,' Mr Rudolf Gruber, chairman, said. The
directors have recommended a 5.6 per cent rise in the dividend to Sch19 per
share.
Revenues from electricity rose 10.2 per cent to Sch6.7bn but gas revenues
eased 3.5 per cent to Sch2.8bn. Demand from gas-fired power stations
declined because hydro stations were more productive.

FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Getting ready for take-off - Gatwick
expects a boost from the Dan-Air deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised airport group, is expecting to see London's Gatwick
airport stage a revival following the recent takeover of Dan-Air, the
airport's single biggest operator, by British Airways.
Long regarded as a poor relation to Heathrow, which continues to account for
about three quarters of BAA's group profits, Gatwick has suffered during the
past two years not only from the recession but from the government's
decision to scrap its London air traffic distribution rules, the collapse of
Air Europe and now the demise of Dan-Air.
Big international airlines have taken advantage of the removal of London air
traffic restrictions to transfer all or a large portion of their operations
from Gatwick to Heathrow. The lack of a dense network of connecting flights
has made it hard for carriers to operate a profitable scheduled network out
of Gatwick. And the lingering recession has inevitably had a dampening
effect on the airport's charter business.
But it has been the lack of a strong national carrier underpinning the
airport's business which has been at the heart of Gatwick's problems. 'The
strong commitment of a major carrier at an airport is an incalculable
advantage,' said BAA.
Even after its takeover of British Caledonian five years ago, BA continued
to adopt a half-hearted approach to Gatwick, concentrating most of its
efforts in developing its profitable operations out of its main Heathrow
hub. But BA has now clearly indicated its intention to develop a new
low-cost short-haul airline operation at Gatwick, amalgamating the former
Dan-Air scheduled operations it is absorbing with its own short-haul
operations.
BAA believes this new short-haul airline subsidiary being set up by BA will
give Gatwick the boost it has been seeking. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief
executive said yesterday: 'It is clear that over the years scheduled
operators have found it difficult to operate viable short-haul networks out
of Gatwick, but we believe that such short-haul routes are important to the
successful development of the whole airport.'
'The worldwide marketing strength of BA offers the best chance of fully
developing the available runway and terminal capacity at the airport,' he
added.
BA's takeover of Dan-Air has been fiercely criticised on anti-competitive
grounds by other UK independent airlines including Virgin Atlantic, British
Midland Airways, Air UK and Britannia. But none have the same marketing
muscle required to revive Gatwick, according to BAA and many other airline
industry analysts.
Although BA is not taking over Dan-Air's charter business, which is being
shut down, and is picking up directly only about 70 per cent of its
scheduled operations, BAA expects the merger to boost in the longer term
overall traffic at Gatwick. It also believes the new BA operation will
ultimately provide greater opportunities at Gatwick for airline passenger
transfer business which already accounts for one third of total activity at
Heathrow.
BAA expects Dan-Air's charter services to be picked up quickly by other
charter operators as was the case with Air Europe after it failed two years
ago. The process is not likely to be as swift for the Dan-Air scheduled
services which BA is not taking over.

AVONMORE FOODS, the acquisitive Kilkenny-based dairy and meat products
company, is buying two liquid milk businesses in the UK, for a total of
Pounds 11.4m.
The acquisitions will add 17m gallons a year of liquid milk to Avonmore's
sales in the UK, taking it to nearly 50m gallons.
The companies being acquired are Churchfields Dairies, based in Salisbury,
Wiltshire, for which Avonmore is paying Pounds 6.13m, and Tom Parker
Dairies, of Fareham, Hampshire, costing Pounds 5.25m. Avonmore plans to
integrate the operations with its existing milk business.
The milk is sold both door to door and through supermarkets. Mr Pat O'Neill,
group managing director, said the acquisitions would 'enhance our presence
with major national multiples'.
Avonmore is paying Pounds 5m cash immediately with the balance due by
November next year. Total net assets being acquired are Pounds 3.98m.
Churchfields made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 510,000 in the nine months to
March 31 this year, while Parker made Pounds 600,000 in the year to
September 30 1991.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Observer: Black magic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the Canadian media mogul has learnt a thing or two. Since Conrad
Black rescued the Fairfax group at the end of last year, the nervousness
among senior editors at Australia's second largest newspaper publisher has
been palpable.
However, news yesterday of the arrival of two old Fairfax hands to the
vacant chairs at both the Australian Financial Review and The (Melbourne)
Age neatly disarms those critics who feared Black might be poised to impose
the sort of controversial changes that so upset journalists in the aftermath
of his acquisition of the Jerusalem Post.
The moves see John Alexander, editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald,
replacing Gerard Noonan as editor-in-chief of the Review. Meanwhile, Alan
Kohler, himself once on the Review, is leaving Rupert Murdoch's The
Australian to edit The Age following the resignation of Mike Smith - who
left for (genuine) personal reasons.
Kohler's return is something of a coup for Black, since the widely respected
commentator on economics and business affairs had only recently jumped ship
from Fairfax to The Australian.
The big loser in all this is Noonan, a popular editor who several times
tried to interest potential white knights such as Pearson, publisher of the
FT, in saving the Review from the receiver. Noonan was given no reason for
his dismissal, though Fairfax managers have apparently been unhappy with the
Review's performance.
While the reshuffle will be greeted less than enthusiastically by the bevy
of unreconstructed protectionists in The Age's Melbourne office, it should
go some way to soothing fears about any excessive Black meddling down under.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: International community must back Somalia relief
effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS HINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Given the tense situation currently prevailing in Somalia, it is vital
to correct an inaccuracy in Julian Ozanne's report ('Somali gunmen hold aid
agencies to ransom as thousands starve to death', November 6). Only six of
Save the Children's feeding centres have been affected by the current strike
by feeding supervisors, not 12 as Mr Ozanne asserts.
Save the Children does not believe that this strike has been politically
inspired by General Aideed or by any other political leader. The strike is
over the level of incentives paid to the staff and is not related to threats
against the United Nations or other agencies.
Mr Ozanne is right to be alarmed about the increasing insecurity which
threatens the relief effort as a whole. World attention must not fall off at
this crucial time: indeed, authoritative leadership from the international
community is required now more than ever.

director general,

FT  10 NOV 92 / Technology: Latest gadgets jump the gun - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT promises to be the electronics product of the 1990s, if its eager
developers are to be believed. For busy managers on the move, the 'personal
communicator' - a portable battery-operated device able to send or receive
written or spoken messages at any time, from almost anywhere - could be just
what they have been waiting for.
'We believe personal communicators will have as much impact on
person-to-person communications as the telephone had in the early 1900s,'
enthuses Alain Rossmann, president and chief executive of Eo, an ambitious
Silicon Valley start-up company which last week unveiled what it claims are
the world's first personal communicators.
These all-purpose communications tools combine the functions of a cellular
telephone, a facsimile machine and a pen computer. The question, however, is
not so much whether the market is ready for them, but whether they are ready
for the market.
Rossmann projects there will be 100m personal communicators in use by the
end of the decade. He aims to make Eo a leader in the emerging market. It is
not alone in pursuing this dream. Over the next few months, several of the
world's largest personal computer and consumer electronics manufacturers as
well as other new ventures are expected to jump on the bandwagon.
The concept of an integrated wireless personal communicator is exciting.
Imagine being able to scribble a note with an electronic notepad and
transmit it directly via facsimile or electronic mail while waiting in an
airport lounge, or retrieving messages left in an 'electronic mailbox' from
a hotel room without connecting a computer to the telephone socket. You also
have instant access to remote databases and on-line information systems.
But for all the exciting potential, the promise and reality of personal
communications technology remain some distance apart. For one thing, Eo's
first-generation personal communicators are far from being mass-market
products. Priced at Dollars 2,000-Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 1,300-Pounds 2,500)
they are targeted at 'mobile professionals' whose work frequently takes them
out of the office.
In this segment, Eo predicts 1m users by 1994. Prices will come down, Eo
promises. Yet even 'early adopters' of the latest technology gadgets may
have some misgivings. Critical elements of the technology required to make
personal communicators live up to expectations are still wanting. And
cellular telephone networks do not yet provide a reliable medium for
wireless data communications.
Sending data on the move is particularly prone to problems. Eventually,
Europe's GSM digital cellular system and the growth of Cellular Digital
Packet Data systems in the US should provide a more reliable method of
sending data, but these are some years off.
Communications 'anytime and anywhere' is Eo's goal, but do not even think of
using a personal communicator on an airline flight. Although the
manufacturer suggests that busy executives will be able to prepare notes and
messages during a flight and then send them when the aeroplane lands, this
will depend upon the dispensation of airlines.
However, only about 10 to 20 per cent of buyers of the first generation of
personal communicators are expected to opt for the add-on cellular telephone
link, Eo says. Most users, therefore, will have to find a telephone jack to
plug in their personal communicator, making on-the-move communications less
convenient.
The fundamental weakness of these early versions of the personal
communicator lie, however, with the limitations of today's hand-writing
recognition programs. Like all 'pen computers', Eo's personal communicators
are irritatingly poor at reading the hand-written word, frequently
misinterpreting even carefully printed characters. With some practice, users
can improve their ability to write clearly on a computer slate, Eo
maintains, but it takes some getting used to.
Instead, many 'mobile professionals' may for the time being opt for a
conventional and cheaper notebook computer, equipped with a modem. If you
have to sit down by a telephone to send and receive your messages, then
tapping out notes and commands on a keyboard becomes less of a drawback.
Like early personal computers, Eo's first generation of personal
communicators promise more than they can yet deliver. In its rush to be
first to market, the company appears to have jumped the gun.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Government challenged to fulfil
pledges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Michael Angus, president of the CBI, challenged the government to use
Thursday's Autumn Statement to prove it is ready to convert its pledge to
support British industry into practical action.
He told the conference that ministerial recognition of the need to stimulate
economic growth had been widely welcomed.
He was finally able to say he really believed the government was on
industry's side after a period of apparent indifference to its problems.
Sir Michael welcomed the recent cuts in interest rates, and echoed the CBI's
calls for further reductions.
He said it was already clear that the CBI's calls to protect public
expenditure had been heard and there was a case for increasing capital
spending at national and local authority level to provide new jobs and
encourage longer-term competitiveness.
Sir Michael emphasised that the total public-sector pay bill should not be
raised, and that any pay rises should be funded out of productivity. He said
the private sector had to restrict pay pressures to stay competitive, and
the same principle had to apply to the 'shop floor, the office and the
boardroom'. He criticised the proposed 4 per cent rise in MPs' pay.
Sir Michael welcomed the arrival of Mr Michael Heseltine at the Department
of Trade and Industry as 'a breath of fresh air', but said the CBI expected
a clear definition of Mr Heseltine's pledge to intervene in industry when he
addressed the conference today.
He said: 'We are not seeking hand-outs, winner-spotting or soft options. We
are seeking understanding and selective help based on a desire to restore
and enhance the manufacturing base of this country'.
Sir Michael said the government had to negotiate robustly in Europe to
remove unfair competitive advantages.
He said Britain needed to be a powerful and central part of Europe, able to
attract internal and inward investment. But it also had to fight 'petty
bureaucracy from Brussels, combined with arrogance and rigidity'.
He added: 'We have infuriating interference with local decisions and
national customs. We have trendy, well-meaning do-gooders threatening to
overburden industry with social projects which we just cannot afford'.

FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Howard rejects call for planning code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, yesterday rejected a call from
the CBI for the government to produce an annual policy paper on land use and
infrastructure planning.
The plan forms one of the main proposals in the recent report of the CBI's
planning task force which proposes a national policy framework for planning.
The report says strategic failure to put such a policy in place has led to
unacceptable but avoidable costs to British business and the economy.
The CBI plan would draw up a framework for land use and infrastructure
development over a five-year period, identifying priorities for the coming
year. It also recommends that the Treasury should make a core funding
commitment to back priority schemes identified by the five-year plan.
But Mr Howard told the CBI conference it would be 'quite wrong' for the
government to make promises which could not be delivered.
He said: 'The government simply cannot offer a five-year commitment on
infrastructure investment'.
Mr Howard said he accepted industry needed more certainty in planning but
emphasised there had been a 'radical overhaul' of the planning process in
the last four years. The government already provided three-year public
expenditure totals and annual road programme statements.
These, combined with white papers, regional strategies and development plans
meant, there was 'more certainty in planning than ever before'.
Mr Howard echoed the recommendation of the CBI task force that business
should work more closely with planning authorities at local level to help
bring about recovery.
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass and chairman of the task force, accepted
that business could not leave land-use planning issues to the planning
profession. 'Planners, government and business have tended to communicate by
semaphore. Major decisions have been left for local debate in a strategic
policy vacuum.'
Mr Prosser said the planning system worked well for smaller applications but
the real difficulty involved the costs, time-scales and conflicts generated
by large business and infrastructure developments.
Mr Prosser said the CBI, in recommending an integrated strategic framework,
was not talking about central planning. It wanted the government to provide
a policy lead by defining priorities within and between different government
departments.
He said many significant planning applications were in danger of being left
for local decision in a partial policy vacuum. They should be considered
within a clearly prioritised national framework.
He said: 'The problem we face is that major business and infrastructure
developments become bogged down in the pursuit of planning approval. This
has substantial negative implications for business development and
competitiveness.'

FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Fight against inflation is
'yesterday's battle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIGHT against inflation was 'yesterday's battle' and has been replaced
by the fight to restore confidence, Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, told
the Confederation of British Industry annual conference in Harrogate, North
Yorkshire.
Sir David opened the CBI debate on UK economic recovery by saying the
government could not 'go soft' on inflation, but it should cease to be the
dominant theme of policy.
He told delegates: 'The battle we need to win now is against the lack of
confidence which is holding back growth and investment in the UK economy'.
He called for a package of measures in the Autumn Statement to release the
economy from 'the grip of a vicious recession that shows little sign of
abating'.
Sir David indicated that the CBI has decided to press for the improvement of
investment allowances.
He said next year threatened to be the fourth consecutive year when
investment in plant and machinery would be lower than in the previous year.
The CBI is thus renewing its call for depreciation allowances to be doubled
to 40 per cent.
Sir David said the move would involve no fiscal cost in 1993-94. The later
impact on public finances would be 'a price worth paying'.
He emphasised that, if the government found it necessary to raise taxes to
cut borrowing, tax increases for the business sector had to be avoided if
Britain was to emerge from recession.
Continuing divisions of opinion on the value of higher investment allowances
were reflected in the debate. Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive of
Rentokil, the environmental and property group, rejected the 'old chestnut'
of allowances, pointing out that Britain now had the benefit of what was in
effect a devaluation in the currency of 15 per cent and the lowest interest
rates in Europe.
Mr Thompson, who voiced fears that further big cuts in interest rates would
stoke inflationary pressures, called instead for lower rates of corporate
tax to encourage entrepreneurs and small businesses to expand and create
jobs.
Mr Andrew Buxton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, said Britain should
still aim to rejoin the ERM once the economy had improved and stabilised. He
asked whether any company seriously believed that a 15 per cent devaluation,
with the consequent threat of a rise in inflation, could be good for the UK
in the longer term. However, it could kick-start the economy.
Sir Ian Wrigglesworth of John Livingston, the north-east engineering group,
said industry needed a clear statement of government economic objectives and
a long-term commitment to help rebuild Britain's industrial base.
His view was echoed by many other speakers in the debate, but none went as
far as Mr Alf Gooding, chairman of the Gooding investment and management
group, who called for a coalition government united by a single objective -
the revival of the British economy.

FT  10 NOV 92 / Maxwell US units attract Dollars 1.2bn bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT BASS, the Texan billionaire whose 1988 intervention prompted Mr
Robert Maxwell to increase his bid for Macmillan, is leading a new Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 788m) offer for the US publisher and for Official Airline
Guides. The two companies are the main US business of Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, has rejected the offer by Mr Bass
and other investors, claiming that it can raise more money for creditors by
selling the companies separately.
In 1988, Mr Bass cleared an estimated Dollars 75m after bidding for
Macmillan and then pulling out after Maxwell increased his offer to Dollars
2.6bn. Although asset sales later recouped part of the purchase price, it
was a 'victory' that put Maxwell on the road to ruin. He paid Dollars 750m
for OAG at about the same time.
The latest offer involves Dollars 750m in cash, the balance coming from
assuming commercial liabilities such as OAG preferred stock and a mortgage
on Macmillan's New York headquarters. The Bass-led investment group is
pushing for a meeting with the steering committee of banks such as Credit
Lyonnais and Chase Manhattan, which effectively own MCC, and has set a
two-week deadline from November 6.
Earlier this year, Price Waterhouse said the best way to raise the maximum
amount of money for MCC creditors, owed around Pounds 1.5bn, was to split
the business. OAG is to be sold, a process that has already begun, and the
Macmillan publishing businesses floated sometime next year.
The administrators said they hoped the sale of the US businesses would bring
in between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1.1bn net of tax and other charges.
The Dollars 1.2m Bass offer includes such commercial liabilities.
Mr Alan Jamieson, joint administrator, confirmed yesterday there had been an
approach from parties interested in buying the whole group. The approach, Mr
Jamieson said, is 'so much at the bottom end of our expectations' that they
were not going to be diverted from their strategy of breaking up the group.
The investor group is led by Acadia Partners, a Dollars 1.7bn investment
partnership including Mr Bass and Keystone, formerly the Robert M. Bass
group. It includes Bain Capital, Bear Stearns and DLJ Merchant Banking. It
has committed Dollars 200m of equity capital and Chemical Bank says it will
underwrite Dollars 300m in credit and provide working capital. DLJ and Bear
Stearns have expressed confidence that the remaining Dollars 300m needed to
finalise the deal can be raised.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Cesar Gaviria of Colombia has outlined a series of security
measures designed to strike at the financial heart of Colombia's guerrilla
groups.
In particular, the government will be able to cancel contracts with foreign
and domestic companies found to be paying protection money to the
guerrillas. Banks will be held responsible for accounts containing ransom
money.
The measures, outlined at the weekend in response to a wave of attacks by
the country's guerrilla groups, are part of a 90-day state of emergency.
Mr Gaviria virtually shut the door on any further peace dialogue with the
rebels, warning that officials who maintained contacts with the guerrillas
might be sacked.
The guerrillas, he said, were no longer the vanguard of the revolution but
the rearguard of the drugs traffickers, pursuing riches through kidnaps,
blackmail and paid killings.
Over the last four years some 17,000 people have died in Colombia's
political violence. The two main guerrilla armies - the old-style
Soviet-line Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the
Castro-oriented National Liberation Army (ELN) - have some 80 fronts with
over 8,000 combatants between them and control large areas of the country.
Both the FARC and the ELN exact payments from companies working in areas
they control. Documents captured by the security forces apparently show that
the ELN gained nearly Dollars 30m from kidnapping and extortion in 1991. The
government now plans to embargo funds and properties linked to guerrilla
groups and to support an anti-kidnap law which would allow the freezing of
all bank accounts belonging to kidnap victims.
The guerrillas' power in oil-producing areas is such that they have forced
local governments into handing over money from oil royalties. The royalties
will now be administered by the central government. Mr Garivia also
announced restrictions on the press.
All these measures will go hand in hand with the strengthening of
counter-guerrilla units, improved intelligence and a nationwide
communications network to supply information on guerrillas.

<TEXT>
KENYA'S opposition parties, worried the government might try dirty tricks,
are considering a boycott of the country's first multi-party elections in 26
years, raising doubts about the electoral process.
Senior opposition officials are angry and frustrated by the lack of
transparency in the National Electoral Commission, which is organising the
polls, and by the government's continued harassment of the opposition and
blocking of opposition campaigning in a number of provinces.
Over the weekend four opposition parties accused the government of preparing
to rig the elections.
The Democratic party said it was clear the NEC was incapable of organising
free and fair elections. Mr Martin Shikuku, secretary general of Ford-Asili,
called for the postponement of elections and the immediate resignation of Mr
Justice Chesoni, chairman of the NEC.
Mr Robert Shaw, an economic adviser to the main opposition party,
Ford-Kenya, warned that if elections went ahead under current conditions,
'the prospects for social discord and post-electoral instability are
significant.'
The opposition also say the government has not agreed a plan of monitoring
for international observers.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Management: At the cutting edge of budget plans - Civil
servants making hard choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Cabinet puts the finishing touches to next year's public expenditure
plans, senior civil servants all over Whitehall are preparing contingency
plans for implementing budget cuts.
The decisions are often agonising and can be particularly hard when
comparisons between different projects depend on subjective judgments about
their merits.
How, for example, to decide between an extra 1,000 places in nursery schools
or spending the same amount on improved teacher training?
Or between competing research proposals in different technical areas, all of
which might bring benefits to British industry - the problem faced by one
branch of the Research and Technology Division of the Department of Trade
and Industry?
'We have to set priorities among a dozen or so programmes,' says Richard
King, the head of the branch. 'Without some comparative indicator of
cost-benefit, we had to rely on subjective advice, with all the difficulties
of reading across from one field to another.'
This year, the branch has used a new system to decide priorities on these
programmes using much more objective criteria.
Developed with Generics Group, the Cambridge-based consultants, it converts
a wide variety of expert opinion and judgment into a single quantitative
measure - the expected benefit indicator.
The EBI has two elements.
A policy score which evaluates how much each project contributes to meeting
policy objectives. For the DTI, these objectives are the seven set for the
department in the 1989 white paper - for example, improving quality in UK
industry and assisting innovation. The extent to which each project meets
these seven policy objectives is assessed by the DTI's own expert advisers
using common criteria.
These assessments are then weighted and standardised, producing scores which
are comparable between different projects.
An economic importance indicator, reflecting the value of the industrial
activities which might be affected by the project. The inclusion of this
element means that projects which are attractive on policy grounds are
downgraded if they would have only a marginal impact on the economy.
Again, expert advice is used to decide which sectors of the economy are
likely to be affected by each project and the degree to which they will be
affected. The current gross sales figures for each sector are projected
forward to give a snapshot of the economic benefits of each project in 10
years' time. Multiplying these two elements together produces the EBI which
can be set against the anticipated costs to produce a cost/benefit ranking
of projects. The results so far have been promising, according to King.
'Not only did it succeed in producing a ranking for programmes, it also did
so in a way which seems to make sense to our advisers and specialists. It is
clearly important that they should respect the methodology if it is to be
useful in establishing consensus over priorities.'
For now, the system is used only in this one branch of the DTI. But with
increasing emphasis on value for money in public spending, interest is
likely from other budget-holders looking to optimise the allocation of
scarce resources.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Advocacy request rejected by Bar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW between the Bar and Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, was looming last
night after the Bar's ruling council rejected a request from Lord Mackay to
rethink its rule prohibiting barristers employed by the Crown Prosecution
Service appearing as advocates in the Crown Court.
Lord Mackay made his request to the Bar early last month. He ruled out wider
rights of audience for CPS lawyers in the immediate future, and asked the
Bar to consider putting a time limit of December 1994 on its ruling. He
suggested that the Bar should join discussions once the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice has reported next year.
Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said that the stance had nothing to
do with Bar trying to maintain its monopoly over advocacy in the higher
courts. Solicitors would soon have rights of audience.
'Ours is a point of principle,' he added. 'We don't think the state as
monopoly prosecutor should have its cases presented in court by its own
employees.'
The Bar is confident of success because applications for wider rights of
audience have to be decided not only by Lord Mackay but by the four
designated senior judges, any one of whom can in effect block an
application. Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, is one of the four and he
he is strongly opposed to CPS lawyers having rights of audience.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Advisers to companies are accused of overcharging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY solicitors, accountants and banks are overcharging their corporate
clients and providing an inadequate service according to a survey by Gallup,
the polling organisation.
The survey of 200 senior executives from large and medium-sized UK companies
for Eversheds, the national law firm, showed that 25 per cent had recently
considered or were considering changing their professional advisers.
Banks were the most heavily criticised. Only 12 per cent of the executives
said their banks had provided better service than solicitors and accountants
over the past year. Almost half the executives said their accountants were
the best professional advisers, and 36 per cent rated their solicitors as
the best.
Complaints focused on overcharging, repeated mistakes and lack of personal
contact. Only just over half of the companies felt they were being charged
reasonable fees for professional advice. Accountants were considered to be
overcharging by more than 40 per cent of the sample, banks by 47 per cent
and solicitors by 48 per cent.
A third of the companies covered by the survey have changed their solicitors
in the past, with smaller companies being more likely to have made a change.
The most common reasons cited were poor service, the need for specialist
advice and cost.
For those companies thinking of changing their lawyers the reasons most
cited were poor advice or inefficient service and high and rising costs.
The survey found that executives felt regional law firms provided the best
value for money, the most efficient service, the best working relationship
between solicitor and client and the most speedy responses to problems.
The survey also showed that only 23 per cent of companies felt London firms
understood the issues facing clients' businesses even though they are
traditionally regarded as providing the best quality and expertise.
Only 6 per cent felt London law firms provided the best value for money.
More than half of those companies using a London-based solicitor said they
would consider using a regional firm for the main part of their company's
legal work.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Scots concern on accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of Scottish businesses believe the standard of service offered by
accountancy firms has declined according to a survey from CA Magazine and
Capital House.
A third said the decline was the result of too much fee-chasing by
accountants, and a further 18 per cent said it because the audit service
offered had deteriorated. Fifteen per cent said the firms had become more
impersonal.
Fifty-six per cent of businesses believed the standards of service from
accountants had not changed, and 17 per cent believed they had changed for
the better.
They said the most important factors in assessing auditors were regular
contact with a partner, experience of the business sector, a capacity to
offer a wide range of services, and clarity of fee structure. The least
significant factor demanded was the lowest competitive price. The businesses
ranked corporate and personal tax advice, accounts preparation and corporate
financial advice the most important additional services offered by audit
firms.
Commercial pressures are impeding the quality of independence demonstrated
by small and medium-sized accountancy firms, a survey has shown. Thirty-two
per cent of a sample of 492 firms said the current economic climate
inhibited them qualifying clients' accounts - or expressing reservations
about the accuracy of the figures in them.
Thirty-eight per cent said client pressure inhibited the honest assessment
of whether a company was a going concern, while 79 per cent said that making
judgment on going concern was an increasing problem. The survey, carried out
for the Management Information Centre, also showed there were significant
increases in staff time to prepare for inspections under audit regulation
requirements introduced last year. Assets and liabilities should appear in
company balance sheets even if there is doubt over how to measure them, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. The
comments come in a submission to the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) from
the Financial Reporting and Auditing Group of the institute in response to
two draft documents on the framework for new accounting standards.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Charity's her middle name - Julia
Cleverdon, chief executive of Business in the Community, talks to Michael
Cassell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any executive who thinks that signing up for Business in the Community just
means cucumber sandwiches on the lawn at Highgrove House is in for a nasty
shock,' warns Julia Cleverdon.
The chief executive of Bitc, the organisation formed 10 years ago to
convince companies that broader community responsibilities go hand in hand
with making an honest buck, knows that having the Prince of Wales for a
president can attract the wrong sort of people.
'He is well aware that he is a bit like a fish hook, intended to catch
businessmen. But once they find themselves marching behind him around a
council estate, the glamour quickly wears off. We make them work hard.'
So any companies preparing to enact an elaborate charade as public
benefactor in the hope of effortlessly winning princely plaudits can, says
Cleverdon, forget it.
The executives wading through muddy construction sites or visiting inmates
at Pentonville prison are all participating in Seeing is Believing, the
latest Bitc programme intended to show industry leaders first-hand what they
can do for their community.
A decade ago, when Bitc was established after the inner-city riots in
Toxteth and Brixton, the hands-on involvement of companies in regenerating
the communities they served commercially was still seen primarily as a
philanthropic gesture.
The Bitc mission to help what the Prince has described as Britain's 'bruised
communities' is based on working partnerships with national and local
government, voluntary organisations, schools and colleges.
According to Cleverdon: 'The more enlightened companies would let the
chairman's wife decide where to direct whatever limited funds were
available. Now employees at every level are getting involved. Many companies
see it as a sort of corporate glue to bind together their employees.'
The woman whose middle name, literally, is Charity, dismisses any suggestion
that Bitc might be viewed by sceptics as little more than a bunch of
well-meaning 'do-gooders'.
'The generation of executives who started the process of active community
involvement are now coasting into gold-plated retirement. Their successors
are leading a revolution in attitudes which sees the issue in terms of a
real business benefit.'
Bitc believes that, increasingly, employees expect their companies to
demonstrate broader responsibilities: 'Graduate entrants are concerned about
corporate ethics and want to know what a business actually does for its
community. Enough companies have got the message to convince me that we are
on an unstoppable train.'
The theory championed by the Prince of Wales, by Cleverdon and by the band
of 400 top-ranking executives who help carry the banner, is that companies
which care about their community will ultimately prosper in it. In
Cleverdon's words: 'Make profits on six days and reinvest some of them in
your community on the seventh. If your customers think well of you, you will
be rewarded.'
Companies can give hard cash, equipment, staff or professional experience to
help a range of initiatives targeted on local economic development, the
environment and education.
Some contribute at least a half per cent of pre-tax profits or one per cent
of dividends to community-based projects. But Bitc's emphasis is as much on
muscle-power as money.
'We expect performance from those who pledge help but it is not a matter of
just throwing money around. It is cost-effective action we want', Cleverdon
says.
Hotel groups have given blankets to hostels for the homeless, derelict
community centres have been rebuilt, and schools and colleges receive
equipment and advice from future employers.
The pressures of recession have recently caused a few departures by
companies with more pressing priorities, such as Jaguar and Rosehaugh, the
property group. But overall, participation has increased this year: 'We
expected more casualties but companies clearly believe our message remains
relevant, whatever their short-term prospects,' says Cleverdon.
Excited by the challenge of a good campaign and fascinated by what makes
business tick, she is now battling to ensure that Bitc is not cast as an
exclusive club for the business top brass who started it.
. 'It is not just for blue-chip companies with millions at their behest. We
have a small Lincolnshire builder, for example, who got a good name locally
by agreeing to provide affordable housing for first-time buyers. As a direct
result, he's won more work.'
While Bitc tries to encourage more small and medium-sized companies to join
in, it is simultaneously trying to extend its influence in larger companies
by getting more middle-managers involved.
'You can get all sorts of things done at the bottom and at the top. The
challenge is galvanising the marsh-mallow layer of middle management; if you
fail to achieve change in the middle, everything else is a lot of froth.'
Born 42 years ago into the arty, London home of a BBC Radio third programme
producer - 'Dad encouraging Dylan Thomas to write Under Milk Wood, that sort
of thing' - Cleverdon's view on the key to effective management was formed
early. As a Cambridge history graduate who envisaged a career in compassion,
she ended up at British Leyland's Swindon assembly plant in the industrial
relations department.
'There were 25,000 people on one site, 42 trade unions and absolutely no
communication between men and management,' she recalls. 'I sympathised with
the shop stewards.'
She suggested to one lugubrious boss that some of the men could be taken to
the London motor show to see the company's new models. She was told to stop
trying to change things.
Cleverdon changed her job instead, moving to the Industrial Society in 1973
with the encouragement of John Garnett, its director and her future husband.
The marriage made her stepmother to Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary.
She arrived at Bitc in 1988 to mastermind the organisation's efforts to
improve links between industry and education. Two years later she became
responsible for a clutch of campaigns designed to give Bitc fresh direction
and momentum. Last year, Cleverdon became chief executive.
The organisation she now runs will be increasingly happy to take a back seat
and let companies do most of the running. 'It is not our profile which will
need raising but that of the companies who do the work and who can encourage
others to follow,' Cleverdon says.
'The real answer to success now lies in the amount of muscle which companies
employ in improving the level of business involvement in their communities.
The work does not necessarily have to be done by us. We may be the catalyst
but we want people, talent and resources increasingly injected directly into
the community,' she says.
Despite Bitc's success in spreading the gospel, Cleverdon says that British
business still has some way to go to emulate the enthusiasm and level of
community involvement by US companies.
'American business thinks it is fun to be involved and the spirit is
infectious. Here, secondees from companies working in schools are called
'AOTs' - adults other than teachers. In the US they are called business
partners and wear little pins to prove it.' Britain is, however, being asked
to advise EC officials on what member states can learn from its experiences.
Bitc is also noisily banging the 'equal opportunities for women' drum, with
some success. Though the Opportunity 2000 campaign, aimed at improving the
position of women in the workforce, was the fruit of the organisation's own
hard work, it has been publicly hijacked by Mr John Major's government. Next
week will see the results of its first year's efforts.
Cleverdon brushes off the government's decision to muscle in and prefers to
look ahead: 'We struck a nerve in the 1980s which will be increasingly
relevant in the 1990s. If the nanny state continues to be rolled back, there
is a big role to play for an organisation which can help business and
community think as one.'

FT  09 NOV 92 / Fresh focus at the White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first report a US president gets each morning is prepared by the Central
Intelligence Agency and tells him about potential trouble spots overseas.
This tradition is part of a web of institutional arrangements that focus a
president's attention on foreign policy and defence rather than the economy
or domestic issues. Mr Bill Clinton says his presidency will be different.
He intends to 'focus like a laser beam on the economy' and has told his
transition team to concentrate initially on economic appointments, such as
secretary of the Treasury, rather than secretary of state.
Politicians of President George Bush's generation were young adults during
the 1950s when the US enjoyed an overwhelming economic advantage. Confronted
by a hostile Soviet Union, they naturally took the economy for granted and
focused on diplomatic and military challenges.
The world looks different to a baby-boomer such as Mr Clinton. In the two
decades since he left Yale, the US has lurched from one economic crisis to
another: productivity growth has slumped, imports have soared and the living
standards of many families have stagnated. After the cold war it makes sense
for him to focus on economic renewal. Without faster growth, he can neither
make good his social promises nor, ultimately, preserve the US's status as
the world's sole superpower.
Yet Mr Clinton's hopes of focusing on economic and social challenges could
be dashed once he reaches the Oval Office. Even if he is spared a foreign
policy crisis in the first months of his presidency, there are enough
simmering kettles - from the Middle East to the Balkans and the former
Soviet republics - to occupy him 24 hours a day.
To keep economics to the fore, Mr Clinton's advisers are planning to create
an economic security council headed by a economic security adviser, that
would play an economic role somewhat analogous to that of the National
Security Council and national security adviser.
The hope is that a high-powered economic council would devise a strategy for
US economic renewal in the post- cold war world rather as the NSC developed
the 'containment of communism' defence strategy in the late 1940s. Just as
General Brent Scowcroft, the current national security adviser, hovers at Mr
Bush's elbow, so an economic security adviser would stick like glue to
President Clinton, ensuring that he always took the economic effects of
decisions into account.
To replace experts on arms control by experts on trade and financial markets
has a certain appeal given that the main threat to American hegemony is now
economic weakness. The objection to a new advisory body, however, is that
there are already too many centres of economic power, including the Treasury
secretary, the budget director and the chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers. Conceivably one of these could play the hands-on advisory role of
an economic Scowcroft; alternatively, the president could redefine the role
of existing agencies such as the NSC and insist that candidates for top
foreign policy posts have economic expertise.
If Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, say, were to become Secretary of
State and an economist were appointed in place of Gen Scowcroft, the Clinton
administration might not need an a new advisory body. On the other hand, the
difficulty of co-ordinating advice from different economic agencies - which
frequently disagree on policy matters - would remain. All the relevant
cabinet officers, including the trade representative, the commerce and
labour secretaries and perhaps a new industrial policy czar could have seats
on an economic security council and thus help formulate long-term
strategies.
Some analogies between foreign and economic policy, however, are false. A
president can order swift action to counter a military threat; he cannot
exert the same rapid leverage over the economy. (The only individual with
real executive power over the economy is the Federal Reserve chairman and he
must consult fellow governors and regional Fed presidents before acting.)
On economics, the challenge Mr Clinton faces is less in restructuring White
House institutions than in changing attitudes - in convincing both the
public and Congress that 'quick fixes' do not work. After labouring for a
decade to promote growth in Arkansas, Mr Clinton must know that a quick
fiscal stimulus next year will not solve US problems. As president, his main
long-run challenges are to raise the secular national savings and investment
rate, reform the healthcare system and improve the quality of education and
training.
Raising the savings and investment rate will require more than an investment
tax credit. Much tougher budgetary controls, perhaps including the explicit
means-testing of popular entitlement programmes, such as pensions, as well
as controversial tax reforms to deter consumption will be essential. If Mr
Clinton is to fulfil pledges on infrastructure, education and healthcare he
may even need a new source of revenue such as a national value added tax.
This economic campaign will be at least as tough as the fight against
communism; it will require consummate negotiating skill, congressional
co-operation and sustained effort over years, if not decades.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Maastricht minimalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the British government first announced that there would be a 'paving
debate' on the Maastricht treaty, we were told that this was an essential
way of regaining momentum, and rebuilding government authority. A case, you
might say, of reculer pour mieux sauter.
Now that the debate has taken place, all those original doubts have been
reinforced. Once more the target date for final ratification has been
postponed; by now it is clear that all target dates are largely fictitious;
once more the government is using the Danes as an excuse for running away
from the treaty. A case, you might say, of reculer pour mieux reculer.
Retreat need not in itself mean defeat; for there is a large potential
majority in the House of Commons in favour of Maastricht. Yet after the
latest cave-in to the anti-European rebels, can John Major really be
expected to get to the end of the ratification process without sounding more
convinced of the intrinsic merits of the treaty?
Mr Major has repeatedly said that he wants Britain to be 'at the heart of
Europe'. But as time passes, it seems clear that his only real reason for
wanting to be inside the Community, is that he does not want to be outside.
His public utterances do not suggest any single positive reason for wanting
the treaty to come into force.
Some will discount the government's apologetic defence of Maastricht as a
cynical device to avoid provoking the Euro-sceptics. The sad fact is that
the British government did not want this treaty when it was first mooted
four years ago, and it does not want it now.
The consistency of the government's Maastricht minimalism is confirmed in a
recent article by Philippe de Schoutheete, Belgian ambassador to the
Community and one of the central negotiators of the treaty. Different member
states, he points out, had different objectives: France and Germany were
keen on foreign policy, Denmark on the environment, Italy and Belgium on
majority voting, and so on.
'But a very important fact must not be overlooked: one major player was keen
on nothing] Britain had gone along reluctantly with the preliminary studies
on economic and monetary union, and its reluctance had increased with time .
. . The outcome of the negotiation cannot be understood if one forgets that
one of the main partners did not, in fact, desire any specific result either
on the economic and monetary side or on the political.'
No doubt Mr Major is not as hostile to the treaty as Mrs Margaret Thatcher
would have been. But there is no trace in his public discourse since
becoming prime minister of any positive endorsement of any aspect of the
treaty.
The first problem with this minimalist stance is that it leads inevitably to
crude misrepresentation. The government periodically claims that the
Maastricht treaty will make the Community less federal or less
supra-national than it would otherwise be. Yet everyone knows that the new
objectives laid down by the treaty include a single currency, stronger
collective discipline on economic and monetary policies, closer co-operation
on immigration and law and order, and the development of a common foreign
and security policy, leading perhaps in time to a common defence policy. It
is surely odd to deny what anyone can easily find in the treaty. Success in
politics may not depend on telling the truth; but it must be reckless to
engage in self-evident mendacity.
The second problem, potentially more serious, is that minimalism may become
a self-fulfilling prophecy. Last December Mr Major demanded and got an
opt-out from the single currency, as well as an opt-out from the social
chapter. In fact, if a single currency were to be created without British
participation, he would regard it as a national disaster; but if he is not
careful he may yet succeed in manoeuvring Britain into a generalised opt-out
from the mainstream of the Community.
The Danish government has put forward a list of special exemptions to enable
it to hold a second popular referendum on the Maastricht treaty; these
include opt-outs on monetary union, European defence, immigration and
national security. If these concessions could be discreetly handed over in a
brown paper bag on some dark Tuesday night, no doubt the others would not
mind too much, because Denmark is a peripheral country; but there are just
three difficulties.
First, the Danish demands add up cumulatively to a comprehensive rejection
of all the main objectives of the treaty. Second, this Danish rejection is
virtually identical in spirit to Mr Major's minimalism. Third, if France and
Germany and Italy and the Benelux believe that the treaty is being voided of
all operational significance, it is a racing certainty that they will move
ahead to form a two-tier Europe, leaving Britain and Denmark where they
really would be more comfortable - in a minimal world outside.
Britain's dilemma is that it must be 'at the heart of Europe', because it
has nowhere else to go; but the dilemma of the British is that they do not
like the Community which has been formed by others; they do not sympathise
with its objectives; and apparently they still do not understand that they
cannot change these objectives.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS are certain to focus this week on whether the dollar can continue
its rise against the D-Mark and break through the DM1.60 barrier, writes
James Blitz.
Last week, the dollar's ascent to a high of DM1.5965 confirmed predictions
that there would be a gradual rise in the wake of Mr Bill Clinton's election
as US President. Some analysts believe that DM1.67 or DM1.70 could be
reached before Christmas, but others wonder whether the rise will take place
that quickly.
Economic indicators this week will give clues to the scale of the US
recovery. The October producer prices figures, due out tomorrow, are
expected to show stable inflation. This will encourage the market to invest
in the 10 year note auction and 30 year bond auction due tomorrow and
Thursday.
According to Mr Mark Brett, investors will be attracted by the high real
yields on Treasury bonds, averaging 5 per cent, which is historically high.
The dollar/D-Mark rate could get a further boost as investors buy the bonds.
In Europe, attention will focus on the British chancellor's autumn
statement, due on Thursday, which is expected to outline the government's
economic strategy in more detail. Sterling rallied to a close of DM2.45
against the D-Mark last week, following the government's victory in the vote
on European union held in parliament.
Analysts believe there is no likelihood of a cut in official German rates at
this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. Bundesbank council members have
hinted in recent days that an easing of policy is unlikely.
However, the Bank of France could cut its intervention rate for the second
time this month when it holds its securities repurchase tenders today and
Thursday.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: A gravity-free stroll through the financial
market revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE days, in the financial markets, it can sometimes seem as though the
laws of gravity have been rewritten. A whole generation of computer-assisted
traders seems bent on disproving the old Newtonian law of investing, that to
earn higher returns, you have to take on bigger risks. As a result, today's
financial traders sometimes seem to be walking on air, buoyed by theories
that to an average investor are unintelligible.
Imagine, for instance, holding a portfolio of securities that made you money
no matter which way the market moved. Impossible? Maybe not. Consider the
prospectus for a hedge fund launched recently by Cresvale, a London-based
asset management and securities company. It claims to follow hedging
strategies, the result of which 'is to maximise the value of the underlying
securities and warrants in rising, falling and sideways markets'. So where's
the catch? 'At all times the fund is anticipated to be market neutral,'
Cresvale says.
Sounds too good to be true? Not if you listen to some of the claims coming
from the derivatives markets. The modern armoury of interest rate, foreign
currency and equity instruments should make it possible to hedge away any
particular element of risk, leaving an investor or trader carrying only
those risks they feel comfortable with. If you're holding Japanese equities,
why not protect yourself against a falling yen and only carry the equity
exposure? Or why not eliminate the equity risk by buying a few put options
on the Nikkei stock market average? Better still, if linkages between the
various financial markets are not working efficiently, why not hedge away
the risks altogether and get left with a residual return?
This selective approach to risk is now driving a large amount of trading in
all financial markets. A barrage of new trading approaches and a lot of
computer power has been brought to bear on areas which were once left to
traders who had little more to guide them than their own gut-feelings plus
the comforting words of an analyst or economist looking over their shoulder.
Everyone from the fund manager who uses quantitative techniques to the
equity trader who hedges his position by buying options is now relying on
greater computer power and sophisticated modelling to develop an investment
or trading approach.
The growth of derivatives markets - and the growth of the derivatives
industry, among the most profitable in the financial sector - are one
result. Yet this revolution has had other, less obvious results.
One has been the greater opaqueness of financial markets, and the
institutions which deal in them. Over-the-counter markets are private places
where it is sometimes difficult for an outsider to discover even what is
being traded, let alone who is trading it or for how much. Also, not much of
what goes on is reflected in banks' balance sheets. At the end of last year
Bankers Trust, the US bank which has been at the forefront of the move into
derivatives, recorded Dollars 59bn of credit risk on its off-balance sheet
activities. This compared with Dollars 58bn on its traditional on-balance
sheet business - the first time its off-balance sheet risks had been
greater.
If things are becoming opaque for outsiders, then more worrying is the fact
that they are becoming equally opaque for regulators and senior managers in
financial institutions. A report from the Bank for International Settlements
pointed last week to the worrying lack of statistics on what is happening in
some derivative markets, and the risks banks are taking on as a result.
A second result has been a change in the way financial markets move.
Volatility has increased as fewer, bigger traders, driven often by technical
trading methods, seek to move ever-larger sums between markets. Closer
linkages between markets - one result of the growth of derivatives - has
meant that any shocks can be transmitted faster through the machine.
In future weeks, this column will explore the revolution in the financial
markets. It will look at the new financial instruments and markets that have
developed, and the trading strategies of the people who use them - whether
fund managers, bankers or corporate treasurers.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Japanese Equity Warrants: Issuers forced to seek more
capital for repayment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFINANCING the Japanese equity warrant binge of the late 1980s may cause
less of a log-jam in the public capital markets than expected, if experience
so far is any guide.
The rush started in earnest this summer. After running at around Dollars
1.5bn-Dollars 2bn a quarter, the value of warrant bonds falling due leaped
to Dollars 8bn in the March-June period and Dollars 14bn in the following
three months. Most of the warrants have expired worthless, forcing the
issuers to raise additional capital to repay bondholders.
Yet the markets have so far taken it in their stride: against a background
of inactivity in the equity-linked sector of the Euromarkets, and without
any significant pick-up in the Japanese domestic corporate bond market, many
issuers have turned to commercial paper or private placements to plug the
gaps.
The crunch year will be 1993, when some Dollars 75bn of such issues mature,
according to figures from IFR Securities Data. Equity warrant issues, which
typically have a four-year maturity, peaked in popularity in 1989 with
Japanese issuers attracted by very cheap financing, and with Japanese retail
investors eager to place their shirts on what looked like a one-way bet.
Of the 13 deals the market has seen worth Dollars 1bn or more, all but one
were in 1989. The slump in the Tokyo stock market means that warrants linked
to deals brought out around that time are not being exercised and the
issuers are having to face up to refinancing the bonds.
There are five main avenues to explore for refinancing purposes:
like-for-like equity warrant issues, convertible bonds, Euroyen bonds,
straight bonds in the domestic market and bank loans. In addition,
medium-term notes and commercial paper could be used as a temporary measure.
Companies like Toyota might, it is thought, simply redeem the bonds out of
their petty cash.
The exact distribution of the refinancing burden will depend upon prevailing
market conditions and the differing requirements of the borrowers, but it is
probably safe to say that bank loans will be the smallest part of the
solution, given the problems Japanese banks are having with their loan books
and the constraints imposed by capital adequacy guidelines. Straight
Eurodollar issues are being ruled out for all but the best known names with
good ratings.
Nor has the domestic bond market come to the rescue of warrant bond issuers.
Liberalisation measures, designed to make the market more accessible to
Japanese companies, have so far failed to prompt issuance on a large scale.
'Efforts to stimulate domestic issuance by the Ministry of Finance may fall
short of meeting Japanese issuers' real needs,' concludes Moody's Investors
Service, the rating agency, in a report on the Japanese shelf registration
system.
Refinancings in the warrant market have also been running at a very low ebb
this year. Just Dollars 9bn of warrant bonds were issued in the first nine
months, only a third of the amount raised in the same period in 1991. Most
bankers agree that the market, while still fragile, is strong enough to
absorb considerably more than this - say Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn of new
issues a year.
According to Mr Doug Howland, of Goldman Sachs: 'The warrant market remains
a viable sector with a good investor base. Demand is outstripping the
current limited supply, notwithstanding the recent softness in the new issue
market.'
The buyer profile today looks very different from 1989, when around
three-quarters of the warrants quickly flowed back to Japanese retail
investors. Today, according to some estimates, 50 per cent is being bought
by UK institutions, 30 per cent by continental Europe including Switzerland
and just 10 per cent by Japan.
'Japan looks attractive now,' says Mr Paul Sauvary, deputy chief executive
of Schroder Securities. 'To have a four-year option on Japanese stock at
this stage in the cycle has to look an attractive investment.'
Issuers and their bankers will be hoping that this message is getting
through: according to one estimate, some Dollars 3bn of warrant-linked
issues is scheduled for the coming weeks, representing a sudden pick-up
after a very quiet year. Sumitomo Rubber and Canon are among the biggest
issuers waiting in the wings.
In the meantime, private placements and the US commercial paper market have
been used to take much of the strain of the refinancing wave, as public
markets have shrunk in significance.
The saviour for the original warrant bond issuers would, of course, be a
revival in the Tokyo market. Baring Securities says that the Nikkei would
have to recover to 33,000 from today's levels of around 17,000 to make any
significant reductions in the amount of debt that needs to be refinanced.
But the message from one Japanese banker in London is to forget it. 'Issuers
will not be bailed out by a recovery in the stock market.'

FT  09 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to drop Ecu bond
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
to abandon its Ecu bond futures contract. Trade in the contract has dried up
because of uncertainty over the prospects for European economic and monetary
union, and competition from the Paris-based Matif exchange.
The Matif's Ecu bond future has an average daily volume of 2,644 contracts.
However, in June - the month when the European bond markets were in turmoil
following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on European economic
and monetary union - the average daily volume rose to 10,114 contracts,
according to the Matif.
By contrast, Liffe said its Ecu bond contract, launched in March 1991, has
not traded at all since June 2.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Spanish Bonds: Challenge of primary market reopening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manuel Conthe, director-general of the Spanish treasury, sees the
reopening of the primary market for medium and long-term debt as an
important challenge for his department.
Mr Conthe, who pioneered longer-dated debt instruments, watched them
flourish and then fall in popularity with international investors as
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty prompted foreigners - the chief
buyers of Spanish long bonds - to switch out of the high-yielding European
bond markets into the D-Mark zone. As a result, the Spanish treasury, unable
to sell long-dated bonds, was forced to issue short-term paper instead.
Spain was one of the countries to suffer from the bout of currency
speculation which hit Europe's weaker members in September. The government
devalued the peseta and came under attack for temporarily re-introducing
exchange restrictions.
Mr Conthe believes that stability has returned at last. Faced with a growing
deficit and hemmed in by a tough repayment schedule, he wants to start
issuing three, five and 10-year bonds again.
His problem, and hence the challenge, is that the market seems to have
forgotten about Spain's medium and long-term issues of six months ago as
doubts linger over whether stability really has returned.
Last month, the government tested the market's appetite at the first
treasury auction to deal in medium and long-term primary debt since May 28.
Only a small amount of paper was allotted, but it did serve as an indicator
for what the market can expect at the next auction, on November 25.
'Essentially the primary market was put in line with the secondary one,'
says Mr Alvaro Villacieros, of James Capel's securities house in Madrid. At
the October 29 auction, three-year paper yielded 13.20 per cent, the
five-year bonds 12.92 per cent, and the 10-year bonds 12.50 per cent. A
total of Pta11.4bn was allotted, with the treasury pointing the market
towards lower yields.
An auction for three-month and six-month paper last week showed just how
inverted the yield curve has become. A total of Pta334bn was allotted, with
the three-month paper yielding 13.214 per cent and six-month paper 13.41 per
cent.
Mr Robert Barry, of Barclays, points out that 10-year Spanish bonds now
yield 533 basis points over comparable German issues - 'a generous premium
by anyone's standard'. In common with other dealers, he believes it may
still be 'perhaps a little early' to come into the market. Foreigners are
wary of the currency risk and the broadly-based anticipation of a second
devaluation is spurred by outbursts of pressure on the peseta as it lies
close to its ERM floor.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Governor of the Bank of Spain, argues that the
peseta's depreciation against the D-Mark and the dollar makes any further
devaluation unnecessary. Earlier comments by Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance
minister, suggested that the peseta will be pegged down as part of a general
realignment of the ERM timed to coincide with the lira's return.
In the absence of further currency turmoil, foreigners may be tempted back
to the market. At least, that is what the treasury is hoping. In January
alone, the treasury will be required to refinance Pta2.3bn worth of debt as
the short-term paper of the past months matures. Once that hurdle is over an
easing of interest rates could be on line.

FT  09 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Investors wait for 'Clintonomics'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of Governor Clinton's impending presidency had a decidedly muted effect
on bond markets last week. In fact, it would be tempting to conclude that
the regular monthly employment figures had more impact overall than did the
outcome of the presidential election. After all, Friday's revelation that
the national unemployment rate had fallen from 7.5 per cent to 7.4 per cent
caused the benchmark 30-year long bond to lose  3/4 of a point and the yield
to rise 7.76 per cent. By contrast, Tuesday night's election results left
the long bond unchanged in the following day's trading.
But in large part, the lack of reaction on Wednesday simply reflected lack
of surprise. The presidential election result was so well signalled in
advance, that it would have been astonishing if the market had not
discounted a Clinton victory. After all, in mid-September - when the
hullabaloo from the two party conventions had died away and the serious race
was starting, the long bond yield stood at around 7.3 per cent. By the time
the polls closed, it had already risen to 7.65 per cent.
The more interesting issue is where the market moves now. For the immediate
future, a heightened nervousness seems likely, but with little underlying
sense of direction. That was already evident on Friday, when the market
reacted negatively to some fairly ambiguous jobs figures. On the plus side,
the October data did suggest the nation's unemployment rate had dipped for a
fourth consecutive month. The figures were also released in the wake of some
moderately encouraging news from other parts of the economy - the store
sales results for October, for example.
Nevertheless, Friday's data also revealed that payroll jobs, although rising
by a modest 27,000 overall last month, were still declining in the
'productive' sector. Factory jobs, for example, tumbled by 56,000 last
month, following a 38,000 drop in September. The overall rise, then, came
through growth in health-related jobs, business services, and construction -
which, in turn, reflected the rebuilding efforts in Florida following
Hurricane Andrew.
Nevertheless, the market, with its increased wariness. seemed more inclined
to react to the headline unemployment number than to the finer details of
the jobs data. By the time trading ended on Friday, the long bond yield was
at its highest level since June.
So what will determine where the market goes in the longer-term? One key
issue is the personalities selected by Mr Clinton to run the economy. While
the shape of the Cabinet overall is plainly crucial, the markets will focus
first on the new treasury secretary. There has been some speculation that Mr
Paul Volcker might be a candidate for the post, a move which the markets
would plainly welcome. But, at the very least, the investment community
generally is looking for 'one of its own' - an individual who has long
experience of dealing with the financial markets, rather than, say, a
liberal economist or academic.
A second issue is how 'Clintonomics' shapes up in practice - something which
analysts acknowledge will be hard to assess for several months. At present,
some commentators are relatively sanguine, arguing that the programme, as
already indicated, has more to do with redistributing federal expenditures
than delivering a full-scale fiscal stimulus to the economy. In this
respect, the very tentative signs of improvement in the US economy - the
falling unemployment rate, the pick-up in store sales - may be no bad thing.
A slow revival, it is argued, might remove some of the political pressures
on the Clinton White House.
That said, everyone is anxious to hedge their bets - a policy which brought
action to the municipal bond market last week. Prices of tax-free muni-bonds
and notes started to rise sharply on Monday, and the rally snowballed
thereafter. If the President-Elect follows through on plans to increase
taxes on high-earners, runs the reasoning, tax-exempt munis look to be a
winner.

FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Rate cut hopes lift short-dated end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG view that interest rates will come down as part of a package of
measures to accompany this week's Autumn Statement was behind the continued
rise in prices for short-dated gilts, although longer-maturing securities
saw something of a setback.
Although the thought that base rates are almost certain to come down from
their current 8 per cent bolstered the market, there was also some concern
that Thursday's statement from the Treasury will produce bigger than
expected projections for the public spending borrowing requirement for the
1992-1993 and 1993-1994 financial years. Such a development would probably
depress prices because of the implications that a large amount of gilt
funding might be needed over the next two years.
Such worries had little impact on slowing the recent steady rise in prices
at the short end of the market, where yields for most classes of gilts fell
by around 50 basis points. That tied in with the feeling that base rates are
set to come down to perhaps 7 per cent this week and possibly to as low as 5
per cent by early next year, in a bid by the government to get the economy
moving and end the two-year recession.
For longer dated securities, however, yields stayed generally unmoved on the
week, a result of lingering fears that the recent devaluation of sterling
and the interest rate cuts that may be in the pipeline could unleash some
upsurge in inflation in the medium term.
According to Mr James Barty, an economist at Morgan Grenfell in London, such
fears may be founded on an incorrect view of how the atmosphere for wage
rises throughout the economy will develop.
He reckons that underlying inflation - as measured by the retail price index
less the effect of mortgage interest payments - is likely to accelerate
somewhat over the next year. It might edge up to a year-on-year rate of just
over 4 per cent by the end of 1993, above the current 4 per cent. However,
headline inflation - measured by the RPI by itself - will continue to be
extremely weak due to the effects of likely cuts in mortgage rates feeding
their way into the calculation of the index.
That, Mr Barty thinks, should keep headline inflation down to 2 per cent or
less for much of next year, giving wage bargainers few reasons to push for
large increases in pay. That would help the current climate of disinflation.
As a result, prospects for prices at the long end of the yield curve could
be distinctly better than some in the markets now believe, with yields being
kept correspondingly low.
However, this prediction - which involves a flattening of the yield curve,
the opposite of what has happened in recent weeks in which the curve has
become progressively more upward-sloping - could be blown off course by the
large rises in the PSBR being postulated for the next year or so. While the
Treasury's Budget forecast in March was for a deficit for 1992-1993 of
Pounds 28bn, many economists reckon the updated forecast coming out on
Thursday will be for about Pounds 35bn, while the PSBR for the year after
could rise to nearly Pounds 50bn. The large amounts of gilts that the
Treasury would be forced to issue could push down yields at virtually all
parts of the curve.
As though with an eye on the future funding needs, the Bank of England
announced on Friday that Pounds 1bn of long-dated gilts are to be issued
from today. They are 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2009 and will sell for
94.75. Of this, 25 per cent will be payable immediately, 35 per cent on
December 14 and 34.75 per cent on February 1993. The first dividend of
1.9834 sterling will be paid on March 25 1993. An additional Pounds 200m of
the stock will be reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.

FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Investment income behind profits rise at
Munich Re
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES in mainstream reinsurance business improved only slightly from the
very high levels of last year, Munich Re reported, although income from
capital investments enabled the group to improve overall profits
substantially in the year ended June 1992.
At the parent company - which accounts for some 80 per cent of group
business - the reinsurance loss was DM922.5m (Dollars 578.7m), down from
DM962.3m in 1990-1991. Mr Horst Jannott, chief executive, blamed the scale
of these losses chiefly on large claims in the European fire insurance
sector, as well on natural disasters such as Typhoon Mireille which caused
Dollars 5.2bn damage to Japan in September 1991.
In the parent company, income from capital investments rose to DM1.98bn from
DM1.69bn in the previous year. This helped ensure that profits for the group
as a whole rose to DM177.6m in 1991-1992 compared with DM104.9m. Group
premium income rose by 11.3 per cent to DM15.8bn and the dividend for this
year would once again be DM10 per share, Mr Jannott said.
He said that the group would once again report reinsurance losses in the
current year, partly because of Hurricane Andrew which hit the US at the end
of August, but also because of industrial fire risks and the sharply
increased number of car thefts in Germany. But this would be compensated for
by investment income and it was likely that the dividend for 1992-1993 would
also be DM10 a share.
The impetus for turnover growth last year came from expansion into the
eastern part of Germany, with the result that parent company domestic fee
income rose by 12.6 per cent.
Mr Jannott warned that this year's fee income figures would be hit by the
translation effects of a higher D-Mark.

<TEXT>
TAKEDA Chemical Industries, Japan's largest pharmaceutical company, has seen
sales and profits rise due to brisk demand for its new anti-hepatitis drug.
For the six months to September, Takeda posted a 1.8 per cent rise in
non-consolidated sales to Y284.2bn (Dollars 2.3bn), while pre-tax profits
rose 2.9 per cent to Y36.2bn. After-tax profits grew 16.1 per cent to
Y16.3bn, as the company suffered extraordinary losses of some Y4bn due to
typhoon damage the previous year.
Takeda said a steady 4 per cent rise in drug sales offset the 7.5 per cent
fall in sales of chemicals. For the full year to March, the company expects
a 0.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y71.5bn on a 1.6 per cent increase
in sales to Y570bn.
Eisai, another leading drugs company, said profits were affected by rising
costs, while sales were hit by official cuts in drug prices last April.
Overall sales rose by a mere 0.6 per cent to Y111bn, while pre-tax profits
fell 1.9 per cent to Y17.2bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL, the French state-controlled oil group, yesterday bolstered its
takeover defences and warned that write-downs and restructuring would cost
it FFr600m (Dollars 111.3m) this year.
The news, two months after Total announced a 47 per cent fall in first-half
net profits to FFr1.9bn, hit the share price, which closed last week at
FFr239.50, slightly above the FFr230 at which the French state sold a
FFr9.5bn stake in Total last June.
This deal reduced the government's direct holding from 31.6 per cent to 5
per cent. Including other state institutions, the public sector owns 15 per
cent of Total.
The group, which made a FFr5.8bn net profit last year, up 41.5 per cent,
warned, after a board meeting, that it was holding to a conservative view on
how markets would develop in coming months, although refining margins had
improved in recent weeks. Accordingly, Total had decided to revise the book
value of some non-strategic assets.
Total, the latest French company to reinforce its takeover defences, is to
limit individual shareholders' voting rights to 10 per cent of the total, or
20 per cent for investors whose shares have acquired double voting rights.
The limitation does not apply to an investor with more than two thirds of
the capital.
Others to have used a similar defence technique include BSN, France's
leading foods group, and Alcatel Alsthom, the
telecommunications-to-engineering giant, to the anxiety of the French stock
exchange authorities who fear that voting restrictions could deter foreign
investors. The government owns a golden share in Total, which already gives
it the power to reject a hostile bid.
Separately, Total announced that initial appraisals of the Peciko gas field
in Indonesia showed possible reserves of 100bn cubic metres. This, plus
another big recent discovery in Colombia, in which Total has a 15 per cent
stake, marks a big step in the French group's strategy of increasing its
reserves outside the Middle East.

record

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOLSON, the Canadian brewing, special chemicals and retailing group,
suffered from sluggish economic recovery in north America and weak consumer
confidence during the first half of 1992.
'However, our earnings held within the range of last year's record levels
and the future looks positive,' said Mr Marshall Cohen, president.
Revenues rose 5 per cent to CDollars 1.6bn, while net profit slipped to
CDollars 74.8m (USDollars 59.7m), or CDollars 1.26 a share, from CDollars
77m, or CDollars 1.38, a year earlier. Operating profit was up sharply at
Diversey, the special chemicals unit.
Second quarter results, showing the same trend at the operating level, were
CDollars 36.4m, or 60 cents a share, against CDollars 37.7m, or 67 cents, on
revenues of CDollars 812m, against CDollars 767m.
Following a CDollars 120m equity financing, part of which was used to reduce
debt, interest expense for the six months was down sharply.
The recession and a poor summer in eastern Canada depressed brewing in the
first half. Industry volume fell 3.8 per cent while Molson's domestic market
share fell slightly to 49.5 per cent.
Molson has reduced costs and an industry price increase earlier this year
helped. US sales rose slightly.
Diversey sales rose 8 per cent and operating profit 20 per cent with strong
performance in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America, but margins
contracted in north America.
Retailing revenues rose 10 per cent but the big Ontario market was weak and
operating profit dipped 14 per
cent.
CAE Industries is maintaining its world leadership in commercial flight
simulators, but its first half results highlight the decline in this market
due to the airline industry's financial problems.
Second quarter profit was CDollars 6.9m, or 6 cents a share, against
CDollars 7m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 260m, down
7.8 per cent. Results were helped by lower interest rates and taxes and
exchange gains.
First half profit was CDollars 12.7m, or 12 cents a share, against CDollars
13.7m, or 13 cents, a year earlier.

FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fuel lift for Japanese ship lines

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE shipping companies yesterday reported that lower fuel costs helped
to support earnings during a difficult first half. Nippon Yusen, the largest
line, reported a 6.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y7bn (Dollars 57m).
Nippon Yusen, part of the Mitsubishi group of companies, said operating
profit during the six months to end September rose by 28.9 per cent to
Y12.9bn and sales rose 8.7 per cent to Y299bn, but profits were hit by
appraisal losses on securities holdings and the appreciation of the yen.
Nippon Yusen said container services to the US increased, reflecting the
rise in Japanese exports, but cargo movements to Europe slowed and
'competition intensified'. Asian business remained strong, and demand for
tankers 'proceeded steadily'.
'Prospects for greater cargo movement during the rest of the year are not
bright, as the general stagnation of the world economy and the uncertainty
of the Japanese economy have combined to put the industry in a difficult
situation,' NYK said.
Mitsui OSK Lines, the second largest Japanese line, reported a 15.7 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y3.6bn and a 48.3 per cent fall in operating
profit to Y4.8bn, in spite of a 2.4 per cent rise in sales to Y244bn.
The company's profits were eroded by heavier interest payments and
depreciation charges, while the market value of its short and long-term
holdings of stocks fell in tandem with prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
For the full year, Mitsui expects sales 1.8 per cent higher at Y490bn, and a
5.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit at Y7bn. It had previously forecast a
pre-tax profit of Y10bn.
Kawasaki Kisen reported a 63.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y559m
after a 1.7 per cent fall in sales to Y187.6bn during the first half. The
company blamed the international recession for the plunge in profit, but it
also reflected sharply lower income on financial items.
The shipping line said yen appreciation and slower demand from Europe would
continue to hurt earnings over the full year, for which it forecasts a
pre-tax profit of Y2.5bn, down from Y4bn, on sales of Y377bn, compared to
Y384bn last year.

Pounds 1.28m

<TEXT>
CRITCHLEY Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer which is
seeking a stock market listing through a share placing later this month,
yesterday reported higher interim profits.
At the pre-tax level they rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 1.28m on turnover 23
per cent ahead at Pounds 11.2m. Fully diluted earnings worked through at
8.4p.
The figures for the six months to end-September included a contribution from
EPC Identification Systems, a US-based company which was acquired at the
start of April.
Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive who led a Pounds 4.5m management buy-out of
the company backed by a consortium of five institutional investors in 1984,
said the interim results 'show that sales and profits are strongly ahead'
and the business continues to expand.
The group also issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday ahead of the
placing which is designed to raise up to Pounds 15m, valuing the
Stroud-based concern at about Pounds 25m.

FT  09 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hard look in the 'right
direction' - Allied-Lyons'quest to squeeze more growth out of its many
assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS' decision to sell Chateau Latour, one of the four leading
Bordeaux vineyards, reflects the new hard-headed management strategy
designed to restore City confidence in the drinks, food, and retailing
group, after the Pounds 147m currency trading debacle early last year.
Just a year ago, Mr Michael Jackaman, newly-installed as chairman, described
Latour as 'the jewel in the crown' of Allied's brands, suffusing the group's
entire drinks portfolio with its reputation for quality.
But Latour's prestige value has now been weighed against the 3-4 per cent
return on the capital tied up in the Medoc estate and found wanting.
When the market spotlight turned on Allied after the currency loss, it was
widely seen as a group with strong but underperforming assets.
It had one of the best-balanced portfolios in the international drinks
industry; dominant niche positions in the food industry; a solid base in UK
brewing; and large scale retailing operations. Yet since the late 1980s,
growth in earnings per share and return on assets had failed to keep pace
with the progress of rivals Guinness and Grand Metropolitan.
The City looked to the new management team in July last year for a strategy
that would improve operating performance and prise more cash out of the
business.
Mr Jackaman, and Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, promptly set out to achieve
those objectives by narrowing the focus of the group's operations, cutting
costs and concentrating resources on brands with international growth
potential and strong market positions.
Eighteen months on, Allied's progress has been sufficiently promising to
persuade most industry analysts to predict that the group's profit growth
over the next three years will outperform the rest of the drinks sector. Its
shares are generally rated a strong hold or buy.
Allied has brought new blood into the boardroom - Peter Macfarlane, finance
director, from Rolls Royce; and non-executive directors, John Robb, chief
executive of Wellcome, and Miles Rivett-Carnac, deputy chairman of Barings.
The group has been restructured into four divisions to sharpen operational
focus: spirits and wine, retailing, brewing and wholesaling, and food
manufacturing.
In each sector, peripheral businesses have been sold and acquisitions made
to strengthen core operations.
The biggest changes are taking place in brewing with the Pounds 510m merger
of Allied's breweries with Carlsberg's UK lager business.
The deal, still awaiting final approval from the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission after 13 months, will form the third largest brewing group in the
UK with a turnover of Pounds 1.1bn and about 18 per cent of the market.
When it goes through, the merger will also remove Pounds 135m of debt from
Allied's books.
The wines and spirits division, which accounts for 50 per cent of group
trading profits, has sold one of the founding businesses, Showerings cider
and VPW British wine, to a management buy-out group for Pounds 140m, and
disposed of several local whisky brands.
Allied exchanged its Centenario Spanish brandy business for more shares in
Domecq, a joint venture partner which has helped to build its business in
Spain and will be important to future growth in Mexico and South America.
Acquisition of a 24 per cent stake in Champagne Lanson strengthened the
international brands portfolio; and investments have been made in the
European distribution network.
Retailing in the UK has had to contend with the MMC-enforced disposal of
pubs in the midst of a recession. Allied has sold 1,350 pubs and leased
another 950, including 734 to Brent Walker. Its tied estate, in which it has
invested Pounds 615m in the past four years and which contributed 25 per
cent of profits last year, now comprises 4,400 outlets.
Acquisitions have extended the Victoria Wine chain to 950 outlets. The
expansion of international franchise operations has been driven hard.
Dunkin' Donuts now has 2,900 outlets, and Baskin Robbins, with 3,500
ice-cream stores, is building factories in Russia, Korea and Thailand.
The food division, accounting for 13 per cent of profits last year, sold
Lyons Maid ice-cream in the UK and Sapori confectionery in Italy; but
reinforced its bakery and ingredients operations in the US and Europe with
add-on acquisitions. Tetley's round teabags have been pushed into more
overseas markets.
Across the entire group, the search for cost savings and efficiency gains
has been vigorously pursued. Last year, Allied's workforce was reduced by
6,000 and operating profit per employee rose 8 per cent. Productivity in the
brewing business improved by 9 per cent.
All this intense activity has begun to establish a solid platform from which
the bid for higher growth can be launched.
Marketing expenditure, which last year totalled Pounds 366m, has been
increased and is being concentrated behind fewer brands: international
spirits such as Ballantine's Scotch whisky, Beefeater gin, and Courvoisier
cognac; Tetley tea; Tetley beer and Castlemaine lager; and Dunkin' Donuts
and Baskin Robbins.
Regional councils have been set up to ensure that synergies across the range
of businesses are exploited and opportunities for growth identified in world
markets.
With 57 per cent of its profits earned in the UK, and 23 per cent in North
America, Allied is targeting the markets of the Pacific Rim and Central and
South America. Extra impetus is being given to its alliances with Suntory
and Domecq, and its 48 other joint ventures around the world.
Not until hard numbers emerge can the success of the group's aggressive
drive be judged; but the market agrees it is going in the right direction.
Some industry observers suggest that, if Allied is to maintain long-term
momentum, it will have to make significant acquisitions to its spirits and
food operations.
Allied's cash resources are likely to be tight - 'but if the opportunity for
a major acquisition arises,' says Mr Jackaman, 'we shall not be frightened
to go and ask our shareholders for the money.'

FT  09 NOV 92 / International Company News: Harland Simon sale to German
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HARLAND SIMON's UK-based automation systems business has been sold by its
joint administrative receivers to Carl Schenck, the German engineering group
specialising in the design and production of high precision equipment for
use in the industrial sec-tor.
Harland was placed in receivership by its bankers two weeks ago after its
proposals for a financial restructuring were turned down. The company's
problems began in February when it issued a profits warning, leading to a
slump in the share price. In the wake of the resignation of its former
chairman, Mr Roy Ashman, the group announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m
in the year to March 31.
Schenck's UK subsidiary has acquired Harland Simon Automation Systems which
was part of the group's core automation division. The division, which also
included Bauteil Holdings, a supplier of North Sea drilling rig controls,
and two US operations, posted a Pounds 189,000 pre-tax loss before
exceptional items on sales of Pounds 24.7m in the latest full year.
Commenting on the sale Mr Nick Lyle, one of the two Touche Ross joint
administrative receivers, said Schenck should be well placed to provide
Harland Simon Automation Systems with 'the financial and commercial
stability which is required.'

BDA Holdings, architects, consultants and property developers, has stayed in
profit, making Pounds 6,000 pre-tax for the half year ended July 31 1992.
Mr Brian Duker, chairman, said the profit - Pounds 1,000 down on last time -
was achieved despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 733,000
and the ongoing effects of the recession in London and the south-east.
No provisions have been made for any reduction in values of property and
sites, as it was considered the current values reflected their value to the
group.
Earnings per share were 0.03p (0.04p).
The marketing of the two remaining areas of office accommodation at
Chingford and Ilford continued, the chairman said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Youghal Carpets went further into the red in the half year ended July 5,
reflecting lower turnover, higher operating losses and exceptional charges.
The group is based in Ireland but 75 per cent of sales are made in the UK.
Pre-tax loss for the period was IPounds 2.17m, or Pounds 2.35m, against
IPounds 1.69m. Reorganisation costs this time accounted for IPounds 121,000.
Turnover fell 6 per cent to IPounds 22m (IPounds 23.4m) reflecting the
depressed UK market and a slow down in Ireland. Operating losses were up
from IPounds 660,000 to IPounds 977,000.
The benefits of cost savings offset the lower volumes to produce an overall
operating result for UK activities in line with the previous year.
Lower consumer demand in Ireland affected volumes and margins leading to a
deterioration in the trading performance. Short time working also affected
the result.
Losses per share came to 4.82p (3.8p).

FT  09 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Sober views of the legacy of communism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago today, the Berlin Wall came down. But all the implications
of that momentous event are only slowly becoming apparent.
It is debatable, for example, whether the US electorate would have chosen
Governor Bill Clinton as the next president if communism and the Cold War
were still alive.
Even staunch pro-Europeans can question the wisdom of the European Community
countries turning inwards and expending vast efforts first to ratify and
then implement the Maastricht treaty. The particular vision of European
union that grew out of the Hanover European summit in June 1988 is difficult
to reconcile with the challenges facing Europe since the disappearance of
the Iron Curtain.
The economic development of eastern Europe has been a sobering experience.
Governments and peoples have found the going harder than anticipated. Many
free market missionaries who set off for Warsaw, Prague and points east with
high hopes of profit and glory have returned chastened.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the economic problems of eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union feature strongly among this year's Amex
Bank Review Awards for new writing on current economic and financial
issues*. What is interesting is a new sobriety among the winners of this,
the sixth annual Amex essay competition, where eastern Europe is concerned.
The award-winning essays (the order of the prize winners will be announced
later today) suggest a broad consensus that market forces alone are not
enough to overcome the legacy of communism.
Professor Richard Rose of the University of Strathclyde makes a powerful
case that the achievement of sustained growth and western levels of
consumption and social benefit in eastern Europe requires a 'civil economy'
in the region.
Prof Michael Dooley and Mr Peter Isard, respectively of the University of
California, Santa Cruz, and the International Monetary Fund, argue that
special care must be given to institutions, incentives and planning if the
former communist states are to be turned into market-based economies.
Professor Rose says that in some aspects of policy-making - such as taxation
 -the former communist countries can learn more from the newly
industrialising countries of Asia than the mature western economies. But
more important is his question: Are east European economies in transition
moving toward a civil or uncivil economy.
By a civil economy, he means one based on the rule of law. It is not enough
to have free elections and introduce a private sector by dismantling the
controls of the command economy so that individuals can freely buy and sell
goods.
'A market also requires the enforcement of laws.' Reformers must ensure that
the state legislates property rights, sees contracts are enforced, creates
an effective tax system and maintains public order so enterprises can invest
with security.
Western-trained experts may not provide the best advice in these
circumstances. 'So accustomed are economists to operating within a framework
of a lawful society where corporate and national income accounts both have
integrity that they mistakenly assume that the collapse of a command economy
automatically creates a civil economy,' Prof Rose says.
He warns that east European societies have a mixed economy, but with a
different mix to the industrial member states of the OECD. 'It is a mixture
of civil and uncivil elements.'
Some uncivil activities might appear benign: who hasn't made use of a
moonlighting craftsman? But the uncivil economy can extend to trafficking in
illegal goods and services, extortion and bribery, and is an obstacle to
investment in long-term growth. For these reasons, it must be attacked.
However, it is typical of Prof Rose's approach that he pleads for a slow
transition. In particular, eastern Europe should avoid the high tax, high
government spending policies of OECD countries because these would be
difficult to implement and could undermine the nascent democracies.
Messrs Dooley and Isard are similarly cautious about leaving transition to
market forces. 'Although we have great respect for the power of markets to
help countries in transition join the rest of the world in the benefits of
market-oriented institutions, we see great danger in overlooking the
nonmarket institutional structure upon which markets depend,' they write.
A successful transformation of eastern Europe will require reforms of what
they call the economic 'woodwork' - employment contracts, banking
regulations, bankruptcy laws, payments systems and such like - 'that
typically receive little attention in discussion of macroeconomic policy
design'. Otherwise, the east European economies could face economic
hardship, including high unemployment and inflation, and political
instability.
The two US economists also argue that the east European states will have to
subsidise the consumption of employees of the large industrial companies
that can no longer survive in the post-communist environment and provide
much of the credit needed to restructure these companies.
As another Amex prize winner, Prof Sweder van Wijnbergen of the University
of Amsterdam and the London School of Economics, says: 'Eastern Europe is
not well served with straight textbook advice.'
The conclusion to be drawn from the essays is that pragmatism and
flexibility in policy-making are required before Adam Smith's invisible hand
can be left to get on with its work.
That is a big change in attitudes. If the Amex essays are a guide,
experiences in eastern Europe in the years ahead could hasten the swing from
dogmatic support for free market ideals in Britain and the US.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Searching for the right recipe: Tomkins' options for
reviving RHM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By refusing last week to raise its offer for RHM, the baking and grocery
group, Hanson has left Tomkins, its smaller rival bidder, free to show
whether the formula it has applied to businesses such as bicycles, handguns
and valves can also work in food.
But in bidding Pounds 935m for RHM, is Tomkins biting off more than it can
chew? Though the conglomerate has lined up the financing it needs, its
reputation will ride on whether it can quickly extract from the deal the
superior returns expected by its own shareholders.
Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chairman, has ruled out selling RHM's businesses
piecemeal. Everything will depend on finding ways to cut costs and build
profitable business which have eluded RHM's own management.
Critics argue that RHM's management has failed to exploit opportunities. The
question is whether Tomkins, with no previous experience in the food
industry, is better placed to do so.
It could undoubtedly cut costs by closing RHM's head offices in Windsor and
by rationalising production further. However, savings are likely to be small
relative to Tomkins' planned investment. The labour content of RHM's
manufacturing is already low and at least half its costs are in materials
and packaging, which are not easily controllable.
Hence, Tomkins' hopes for improving RHM's performance seem likely to depend
heavily on enhancing the performance of its branded groceries, cakes and
food services divisions and - above all - on stemming the steep profits
decline in its flour-milling and bread-baking businesses.
RHM is widely thought to have imposed unduly tight head office controls on
the managers of its main divisions, none of whom sits on its main board. By
introducing a more devolved management structure, Tomkins might perhaps
unleash hitherto suppressed initiative.
However, it will be difficult quickly to wring higher returns from its mixed
bag of branded businesses. Of these, probably only the Sharwood's chutney
and condiments range enjoys a really strong position in a fast-growing
sector. But although highly profitable, Sharwood's had sales of only Pounds
32m last year.
Others, such as Saxa salt, Atora suet, Paxo stuffing and McDougalls flour,
are brand leaders, but in mature or declining sectors, while Bisto gravy and
Mr Kipling cakes and pastries face increasingly powerful competition, both
from branded manufacturers and supermarkets' own-label products.
One dilemma about owning such a diverse stable of small niche brands is the
wide spread of advertising and marketing support. Many other food
manufacturers have found it more profitable to concentrate on selected areas
of strength.
Tomkins may decide to rationalise RHM's portfolio, possibly by trading some
brands for those of other manufacturers. But it will need to maintain - if
not increase - marketing expenditure if it is to hold its own.
Most industry analysts think the chances of sharply increasing returns from
these businesses are relatively modest. 'If Tomkins continue to develop the
brands, they can expect growth - but it will not be dramatic,' says Mr David
Lang of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite.
Nor does RHM's own-label production offer much prospect of increased
rewards: supermarkets are careful to ensure operating margins on this
business do not go much above 7 per cent.
The key to RHM's fortunes may lie in the milling and baking side. As the
greatest source of problems, these hold out the promise of greatest reward.
But the problems run deep.
As the chart shows, operating profits in the division have slumped. Analysts
believe the year to Aug 1992 will show a fall to Pounds 19.4m and many think
the division next year could show no operating profit.
The industry believes there is between 10 per cent and 15 per cent too much
baking capacity in the UK. Tomkins has hinted that taking capacity out may
form part of the plan; business development director, Mr Geoffrey Eaton,
said last week that Tomkins was driven by profits, not market share.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, RHM has reduced its bakeries from about 60
to 18 - or 21 after the recent purchase of three from Dalgety. It has also
spent Pounds 115m to increase efficiency in the past three years.
With drastic further rationalisation it might be possible to service most of
the market without losing too much revenue base. But that would require
heavy capital expenditure on new plant.
It is also uncertain whether the approach would work, given the special
characteristics of the bread market. Associated British Foods, RHM's biggest
competitor, is insulated by large family shareholdings from short-term
market pressures.
Tomkins insists the planned acquisition will not dilute its earnings -
apparently on the assumption that milling and baking profits do not go into
free fall. But there is a danger Tomkins will be saddled with a large slice
of business that performs sluggishly for some time, even if it eventually
turns round.
If this were the case, the first casualty would be Tomkins' rating, which
was a heady 17 times prospective earnings before the bid. As a company which
depends heavily on bold acquisitions to sustain its growth, the capacity to
raise large amounts of capital quickly is essential.
To risk this carefully nurtured rating, Mr Hutchings must believe he has a
rabbit to pull from his hat. The problem is that many City of London
observers of the food sector cannot guess what sort of rabbit. What they all
recognise, however, is that both Lord Hanson and Tomkins dreamed up the same
idea at about the same time and had in mind a similar price. Someone has to
have got it wrong.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Bronfmans battle to restore market confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE industrial, property and financial services empire controlled by
Toronto's Bronfman family is battling to shore up investor confidence
following a sharp decline in share prices of companies within the group.
Several Bronfman companies as well as their main banker issued a barrage of
denials on Friday to counter rumours that they are in severe financial
difficulty.
The slump in the share prices complicates efforts by at least one Bronfman
company, the financial services group Royal Trust, to raise new equity.
Royal Trust's share price tumbled more than a third on the Toronto stock
exchange last week after the company announced a large third-quarter
writedown. Royal Trust also said its board had approved a CDollars 200m
(Pounds 99.5m) equity issue.
Royal Trust shares closed at CDollars 2.87 on Friday, down from more than
CDollars 9 last January. Among the Bronfmans' holding companies, the share
price of Brascan fell CDollars 1.38 on Friday to CDollars 16.25. Edper
Enterprises lost 35 cents to CDollars 4.50.
The latest nervousness stems partly from difficulties at Royal Trust and
Bramalea, a property developer. Bramalea, whose share price has sunk this
year from more than CDollars 5 to 41 cents, has warned it might file for
bankruptcy protection if creditors fail to approve debt-restructuring
proposals.
Pressure on the Bronfman shares is said to have come from short-sellers in
the US. A Bronfman group spokesman also linked the rumours to recent
developments among other families which dominate much of Canadian business.
Property and property finance markets have been unsettled since the collapse
last May of Olympia &amp; York, controlled by the Reichmanns. Last Thursday, the
Thomson family, controlling shareholders of Thomson Corp, the international
travel and publishing group, said it had raised CDollars 545m by selling a
large chunk of its stake in Hudson's Bay Co, Canada's biggest department
store group.
The businesses controlled by brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman are
estimated to account for between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of the total
market capitalisation of the Toronto stock exchange. The 'Toronto Bronfmans'
are cousins of the family which controls Seagram, the international drinks
company. The businesses of the two branches are separate.
Hees International, the Bronfmans' merchant banking arm, said the group knew
of no material developments not already disclosed. Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce said rumours it had withdrawn lines of credit to the Bronfman group
were 'totally unfounded'.

FT  09 NOV 92 / GPA may show debt plan to banks soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the Irish aircraft leasing group which aborted its international
public flotation in June, will be approaching its banks 'relatively shortly'
with proposals to reschedule its debts, said a director yesterday.
GPA, which ranks as the world's largest aircraft lessor, said yesterday
negotiations with its banks would continue this week, but denied there had
been any 'crisis talks' over the weekend. One of the group's biggest bank
creditors said: 'We are not involved in any formal crisis talks.'
Mr James King, a GPA executive director, said there had been no emergency
discussions with the group's bankers. 'It's all poppycock. I've spent the
weekend shooting and gardening.'
He added that the group had made two informal presentations to its more than
100 bankers and hoped to put formal proposals shortly, although it was
unlikely rescheduling could be completed before Christmas.
The group acknowledged last month it had to begin negotiations with banks on
its borrowing arrangements after failing to raise new funds from the sale of
18 aircraft leases.
Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder, said more than a week ago: 'We are
conducting a matrix of wide-ranging negotiations with a significant level of
interdependence and this will take time to complete.'
GPA is reviewing its financial position and the company and others close to
the negotiations reiterated yesterday that any new proposals put to the
banks were not expected to be implemented until at least the first quarter
of 1993. 'Whatever discussions there are with banks will last well into next
year,' the adviser said.
GPA's debt is thought to have risen significantly since June when the
prospectus for its failed flotation listed borrowings of Dollars 2.7bn
(Pounds 1.7bn) against shareholders' funds of Dollars 1.2bn. As a result its
fund-raising efforts have been hit by investor fears that it might breach
its banking covenants.
Its financial strategy, put together with shareholders, lenders and aircraft
suppliers after its shelved Dollars 800m flotation, has been complicated by
its failure to sell the aircraft leases, and subsequent postponement of
plans to raise Dollars 752m from its second issue of securitised aircraft
leases.

<TEXT>
THE outcome of a bidding contest for Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest
US carrier which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since
late-1990, is expected to be announced today. Board members met over the
weekend, and are due to present the winning proposal to the bankruptcy court
today.
Only two groups are known to have submitted proposals in the final round of
the auction: Air Canada, in conjunction with Air Partners, a Texan
investment partnership, and Mr Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam consortium, which
includes Aeromexico, one of the largest Mexican carriers. By late yesterday,
Air Canada and representatives of Air Partners were still waiting to learn
of Continental's decision.
'We haven't heard anything,' said Mr John Ricketts, Air Canada's finance
director. He said the airline expected to know the outcome this morning. Air
Partners also said there had been no word from Continental.
The Maxxam-led offer opened the bidding for Continental in early July, when
the chairman of the Houston-based natural resources group, Mr Charles
Hurwitz, presented a Dollars 350m (Pounds 225.80m) investment plan to the
airline, giving his consortium a 72 per cent stake in the carrier once it
emerged from bankruptcy.
In October, this offer was improved when Aeromexico and other Mexican
investors joined the consortium.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Heathrow rail link threatened by track fee dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO build a Pounds 300m express rail link from Heathrow airport to
Paddington station are being threatened by an arcane dispute over what BAA,
the privatised airport group, should pay for use of British Rail track.
The Department of Transport, BR and BAA are to resume negotiations later
this month after failing to agree last week.
BAA, which will today report its first-half financial figures - expected to
show a 30-35 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 200m-Pounds 220m -
is anxious to reach a compromise with BR by the end of the month. This would
enable construction work on the link to start next spring.
The airport group is arguing that it cannot put together a financing package
for the project unless it can first secure an agreement.
BAA has completed about 95 per cent of the design work for the service which
would link Heathrow, the only big European airport still without a direct
city rail connection, to central London in 14 minutes. It has just finished
a Pounds 1.2m trial tunnel at Heathrow for the planned link.
BAA is planning to raise most of the Pounds 300m by selling equity in the
new Heathrow Express company to financial institutions, construction
companies, airlines and, possibly, foreign railways.
But it says it cannot approach investors until it has resolved the issue of
track fees, which will represent a significant element in overall operating
costs.
The project was conceived four years ago as a joint venture between BAA and
BR, with the airport operator taking a majority 80 per cent stake and BR the
rest.
However, this proposal was derailed by BR's financial constraints and the
uncertainty over the government's railway privatisation plans, as well as
BAA's new strategy of focusing on its core airport activities. Sir John
Egan, BAA's chief executive, has made it clear he has no desire to run
railways.
But he regards the project, in which BAA would ultimately hold a minority
stake, as crucial for improving access to one of the world's busiest
international airports, used by more than 40m travellers a year.
If a deal on track fees is reached with BR this month, BAA expects to
complete financing arrangements quickly, enabling the service to open in
1997. BAA expects between 6m and 7m passengers a year to use the rail link.

FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Sugar's Pounds 113m bid for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does not
already own equates almost exactly to the cash in the company's last balance
sheet. Since much of the cash for the offer is being lent or guaranteed by
the company, shareholders have every right to feel short-changed. In other
circumstances it would certainly be worth pressing for a better price. Yet
Mr Sugar maintains there is nothing more available - presumably because
Amstrad cannot afford to lend him more. His scheme is perfectly legal, but
it is more than disquieting to see the company lending the chief executive
cash to buy its shares.
The offer also raises old worries about the ethics of management buy-outs.
The terms certainly look generous compared to the 19p share price before the
intention to take the company private was announced. But then Mr Sugar was
in the privileged position of knowing whether that price fairly valued the
company. Amstrad will not pay a dividend for the foreseeable future if it
remains a public company, but Mr Sugar will repay the bank out of dividends
if the deal goes through. With no prospect of an outside bid, and the
unpalatable alternative being to live with a disgruntled Mr Sugar, investors
may just be glad to see the back of Amstrad. Mr Sugar's legendary antipathy
towards the City must by now be fully reciprocated.

FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: German banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German banks are gaining ground in their battle with the authorities over
new capital requirements due to come into force from January 1. Until
recently, the federal supervisors have been pressing for a minimum tier 1
capital ratio of 5 per cent for banks which wanted to count revaluation
reserves on their securities holdings towards tier 2 capital. Last week,
they appear to have quietly shifted to a 4 per cent minimum while still
allowing banks to count revaluation reserves for up to a quarter of the tier
2 requirement.
Provided the authorities stick to this line, German requirements will not
exceed the standards applying under international and European Community
rules. The resulting level playing field matters more to most institutions
than the actual level of the tier 1 requirement in the short run. Most could
meet a 5 per cent requirement with the possible exception of Commerzbank
with its exposure to Russia, Olympia &amp; York and Hafnia.
Admittedly Deutsche and BHF Bank would probably be the only large banks
comfortable with a 5 per cent ratio. Others such as Dresdner and the
Bavarian banks would not have much room for balance sheet growth. By
insisting on 5 per cent, the authorities risked compounding the German
slowdown by constraining banks' capacity to lend. But it is not as if a 4
per cent requirement would do much to stem the regular flow of bank share
issues. A low return on equity and high payout ratios have long stymied
German banks' ability to build capital through retained profit.

FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Telephone and Telegraph's purchase of a stake in the US group McCaw
Cellular has excited interest in the prospects for the mobile phone business
in Britain. AT&amp;T wants to be in cellular telephony around the world, and
technological development offers a way into the UK market. New digital
personal communication networks will begin to be established in the next
year or so which will allow much larger numbers of callers to use the
networks.
At present PCN licences have been granted to Mercury and Microtel; AT&amp;T
could apply for a third or throw in its lot with either of the existing
licensees. PCN is expensive to establish, but offers high capacity
immediately, so these networks will be driven to offer low prices to attract
high volumes, undermining the existing networks' margins. If AT&amp;T were
prepared to take a long view, it might favour this approach.
Of course, another way into the UK market for AT&amp;T would be to buy Vodafone.
Indeed, the price it was prepared to pay for control of McCaw makes Vodafone
look cheap: hence the latter's price rise last week. However, AT&amp;T would
have to pay well over Pounds 4bn for Vodafone, while a PCN network might
cost only Pounds 1bn to build. The marketing budget needed to establish PCN
is unlikely to cost anything like the difference. Vodafone is currently
trying to broaden its base in the UK while retaining its profitable
customers. It may also be interested in expanding into Europe, but is
equally likely to run into AT&amp;T there. In the long run, Vodafone's
exceptional returns will fall victim to the tide.

FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Dividend deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the actuaries are right, UK pension funds' heavy exposure to equities is
starting to look excessive. Dividends are not growing fast enough to keep
pace with liabilities. At best, contribution holidays will end sooner than
anticipated. If the worst comes to the worst - which may be only a couple of
years of low dividend growth away - some companies will have to make up
pension fund deficiencies out of profits. Little wonder that the great and
the good of the profession are sounding warnings.
Most immediately at risk are companies with 'mature' pension schemes -
paying more to pensioners than is covered by contributions from employees.
The engineering and metals industries are the obvious sectors here.
Redundancies and early retirements in the service sector, though, will
spread the problem. Simple arithmetic dictates that making up pension fund
deficits will take a big slice out of some companies' profits. And the
practice of valuing pension schemes every three years points to some nasty
surprises to come.
One answer may be for mature pension funds to switch some cash from equities
into bonds, which are a better match for their liabilities. Yet fund
managers will be wary of an investment strategy which leaves them exposed to
surprise bouts of inflation. Index-linked gilts may be a more palatable
solution since they provide guaranteed cash flow and protection against
inflation. Little surprise, then, that the government has found ready buyers
for index-linked since Black Wednesday. The risk for the stock market is
that pension fund managers might all jump at once. Since pension funds own
about Pounds 200bn of UK equities, even a 10 per cent shift into bonds would
act as a serious drag on prices.

FT  09 NOV 92 / DTI to support exporters as part of recovery plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT intends to give greater support to British exporters as part
of its plans for economic recovery.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday he was
sympathetic to helping industry more with export credits, adding that the
Department of Trade and Industry would recruit 100 people from the private
sector to help exports.
He told BBC Television's On The Record that it was a government priority to
enable industry to seize opportunities created by sterling's devaluation and
that the new personnel would 'dramatically increase' the DTI support for the
export drive.
Mr Heseltine, however, declined to give further details ahead of Thursday's
announcement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of the Autumn Statement
and a package of measures to aid recovery. The package, described by one
official as a 'handful of measures', will be targeted at specific problems,
including the housing market.
A cut in bank base rates from 8 per cent is expected this week. A poll of
City analysts by MMS International, the financial information company, found
that 80 per cent expect Mr Lamont to cut rates by a full point 'around the
time of the Autumn Statement'.
The government is also due to announce help for industry, including an
easing of Treasury restrictions on private sector investment in
infrastructure. These moves will be balanced by a tough fiscal package. The
cabinet has agreed to hold the public spending planning total within the
limit of Pounds 244.5bn in 1993-94 and subject public sector pay to a tight
squeeze.
Pay review bodies for groups such as teachers and nurses will not be
suspended but their work will, in effect, be overruled. The Treasury is also
determined to keep MPs' pay increases in line with the strict controls to be
imposed on the public sector.
The Treasury now supports a more expansionary policy because of growing
worries about recessionary tendencies around the world. However, officials
fear that some more radical proposals - such as a 2 point cut in interest
rates - would risk pushing sterling into a free fall with negative long-term
consequences for the government's inflation battle.
At the weekend, government officials expressed concern that expectations had
become exaggerated ahead of the statement. They pointed out that the
government had already presided over a substantial policy relaxation, with 2
points off base rates and a 13 per cent devaluation of sterling since Black
Wednesday. The high public sector borrowing requirement - Pounds 18.4bn so
far this year and expected to rise to well over Pounds 40bn in 1993-94 - is
a further constraint.
The rising borrowing requirement has encouraged suggestions that the
government might raise revenues to plug the hole in its finances. The
Treasury last night dismissed reports that the top level of employees'
National Insurance contributions might rise to 10.4 per cent from 9 per cent
as 'pure speculation'.
The Autumn Statement is the occasion when National Insurance changes are
announced, usually to take effect the following spring. While consideration
may still be given this week to National Insurance in 1993-94 it is thought
ministers would be unwilling to order an increase in the levy when the
economy may just be emerging from recession.
Officials stressed yesterday that Mr Lamont was committed to holding
inflation in the 1-4 per cent band over the life of the parliament and
providing a stable economic framework in which businesses can make
decisions.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Classroom reform fails the freedom test: John Patten's
Education Bill promises schools more independence but it may actually reduce
their power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Education Bill, which starts its progress through the
Commons this afternoon, is designed to make state schools in England and
Wales fit for the 21st century. Since, by general consent, too many of them
are unfit for the late 20th, it is an ambitious but imperative goal.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, claims that 'choice and diversity'
lie at the heart of his bill. His aim? To make all schools self-governing,
busting the monopoly of local education authorities (LEAs), putting parents
and teachers in the driving seat, and creating a market in education to
increase opportunity for all.
The means? Grant-maintained (GM) status, by which head teachers and school
governors are set free from their local council bureaucrats, made
accountable to parents, given a block grant from the state broadly related
to their numbers, then left to get on with it.
That is the rhetoric. The reality is different. As with so many of the
reforms of the Thatcher decade, the Education Bill and wider government
education policy reflect contradictory pressures. On the one hand they laud
the market; on the other, they shackle it at every turn.
Consider the position of Mr Patten's self-governing grant-maintained
schools.
Undeniably, GM schools will have greater control of their finances and
internal management than under the old LEA regime. This can only be
positive. Under the local management of schools policy, most schools already
enjoy wide budgetary discretion. But a visit to most GM schools reveals an
extra sense of pride and commitment among the staff at running their own
show entirely free from local bureaucrats.
There are fears that the proposed Funding Agency for Schools, which will
distribute grants to GM schools, will yield a new set of unelected officials
to replace the old. On that the jury is out. Mr Patten's bill deliberately
makes no provision for regional agencies, and he is adamant that the
national agency will largely confine itself to sending out the cheques.
Even if that proves to be so, the powers of the state over schools remains
vast - and under the current bill, they will be increased in crucial
respects.
Some of the new powers relate to regulation, notably the provision for
regular inspections under the aegis of the new Office for Standards in
Education (Ofsted). For all the controversy over 'private' inspectors -
Ofsted's licensing procedure will make them public in all but name - this
aspect enjoys wide support. So does the plan for 'education associations' -
task forces - to take control of schools certified by Ofsted that fail to
provide an acceptable standard of education. The associations could hardly
do other than improve such schools, provided high-calibre staff can be
recruited.
However, the government has taken, or plans to take in the current bill, a
whole panoply of powers which run contrary to the self-governing notion,
even admitting the need for strong regulation.
First, Mr Patten intends to exercise far-reaching powers to reorganise
schools. He argues that the expense of 1.5m surplus places in schools
nationwide obliges him to do so. Under the bill, he will have the right to
by-pass LEAs and GM schools and draw up his own reorganisation proposals for
any locality. Where the locals object, a public inquiry will be held. But
whatever its findings, Mr Patten is allowed to do what he likes apparently
without having to give reasons for any decision to over-ride opposition.
This approach offends even the haziest notions of the market and local
accountability. As one prominent Tory educationalist put it, if Mr Patten
really had faith in a numbers-related funding formula plus the work of
Ofsted, surplus places should take care of themselves without leading to
unacceptably low standards in those small schools which survived. Mr Kenneth
Clarke, Mr Patten's predecessor, was attracted to the idea, and proposed to
earmark funds for successful schools wanting to expand - the reverse side of
the coin. One of Mr Patten's first acts on taking office was to cancel that
proposal.
As to accountability, parents and schools - GM or not - will have no redress
against an education secretary determined to reshape their education system.
At present, they can lobby their LEA and vote it out of office if they want.
They can also appeal to the education secretary as a last check against
their LEAs. Such is the government's distrust of local councils that Mr
Patten is not prepared to give LEAs any role in checking his discretion. Nor
is he prepared to consider other democratic devices. Local referendums have
a long tradition in British local government; the argument for them in the
case of a wholesale school reorganisation is potent - it is the kind of
issue which dominates the consciousness of a locality.
The second area of unrestrained government authority relates to the
curriculum and examinations. In the 1980s, almost everyone agreed that a
national curriculum of some sort was necessary, and its inclusion in Mr
Kenneth Baker's 1988 Education Reform Act caused little controversy.
It was generally assumed then, however, that the government would introduce
a loose framework curriculum and leave schools a large measure of freedom.
Not so. With every year, state interference has increased. Last year, Mr
Clarke appointed Lord Griffiths, former head of Lady Thatcher's policy unit,
as head of the quango responsible for school assessment. He proceeded to
reshape large parts of the post-1988 system. Mr Patten has gone further
still. This summer he even decreed that all 14-year-olds would be forced to
study one of three Shakespeare plays - including Julius Caesar - for their
national English tests.
It is the same tale with exams. Last year Mr Clarke, after no consultation
and to the consternation of most teachers, announced that the course work
component of the GCSE, the exam taken by all 16-year-olds, was to be
slashed. Schools had to change courses at short notice. Yet both he and Mr
Patten to date have ruled out of court any reform of A-levels, despite the
overwhelming consensus for change among teachers, educationalists and
businessmen, who are concerned that a fifth of all candidates are left with
little to show for their work, with even the successful obliged to
specialise far earlier and more narrowly than their Continental
counterparts.
So 'choice and diversity' operate within narrow confines. Local bureaucrats
and the education establishment are being shown the door. But education is
evidently too important to be left to parents and teachers. It is no
surprise that Mr Patten has taken to dubbing himself 'the nation's
headmaster'.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Global security now inseparable from economic issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD KOZUL-WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's open letter to the president-elect of the US ('Dear
Mr President', November 4) well describes some familiar and not so familiar
challenges which will be faced by a new administration in Washington.
Of particular interest, given the lack of any detailed discussion of foreign
policy issues during the election campaign, are his recommendations to
bolster the role of multilateral institutions and particularly the United
Nations. However, Mr Mortimer's emphasis on multilateral policing operations
is unduly one-sided.
In this respect, Governor Clinton's stated recognition that, in an
increasingly interdependent world, foreign policy concerns and domestic
economic strength are inseparable, offers a far more hopeful message than Mr
Mortimer's exclusive concern simply to double the number of bobbies on the
(global) beat by enhancing the UN's military role. Indeed, Governor
Clinton's message echoes a long-standing recognition in large parts of the
international community, including agencies, that global security is
inseparable from economic and social development.
The urgency of forging an international economic perspective to match that
likely to emerge from Washington in the coming months cannot be understated
at a time of continued economic uncertainty in the world economy. What
better way of matching the renewed activism in Washington than enhancing the
multilateral economic structures already in place with a long-standing
commitment to international co-operation, political pluralism and global
economic development. Moreover, it is precisely through support to such
institutions that Mr Mortimer's laudable ideal of a world citizen is most
likely to be achieved.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON PAUL HEDIGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are two forms of federation principle which can be applied:
1) All powers, which have not been specifically retained by individual
states, automatically are transferred to the central federal organisation.
2) All powers, which have not been specifically granted to the central
federal organisation, remain with the individual states.
Which principle does Europe want to apply?
In the interests of clarity, many years ago, the Americans opted for the
former, Switzerland for the latter.
From the declarations of Mr. Martin Bangermann, vice-president of the
European Commission, contradicting Mr Major, it would appear that Europe has
opted for neither solution, which would seem to be a solid base for current
and future confusion.

Sir, Far more worrying than the slippage of the timetable for the
ratification of the Maastricht treaty is the threatened outbreak of
protectionism unless progress in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks can be swiftly resumed.
The consequences of a trade war would be disproportionately serious for
Britain, which is more dependent on trade than almost any other
industrialised nation.
Surely even the most dogged Euro-sceptic can now understand that, if we
remain on the fringes of the European Community, or even if we pull right
out of it, we shall be worse hit than any by a world trade war; that it is
therefore more than ever vital for us to be at the heart of the European
Community trying to influence it towards compromise in Gatt and to open

FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Simple answers to restraining wage growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WOODTHORPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Two cheers for Professors Layard and Bean for correctly identifying,
first, inflationary wage awards as the basic problem of the British economy
and, second, employers as the guilty party. However, their solution is
neither far-reaching nor effective enough.
Quite apart from the public sector, the services sector - now the dominant
sector in the economy - is notorious for no productivity improvement. In
industry, cutting out profligate excess manning hardly justifies pay
increases for the remainder. Nowhere in the economy does labour have much,
if any, impact on productivity. Instead, R&amp;D, good design and new investment
make the difference.
So, nipping wage inflation in the bud is critical. A way would be for the
chancellor to announce that tax rates will be indexed to wage inflation, per
cent for per cent, above achieved national productivity improvement.
A crude penalty, perhaps, for that small minority who achieve above-average
productivity, but then drastic action is needed if I am not to see the pound
worth a dollar or a D-mark in my lifetime.

   From Mr DAVID LAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Professors Layard and Bean's personal views ('Shut the
stable door', November 4). I do not feel competent to argue about the
macro-economics of wage push inflation and stop-go history, and do not
propose to do so. If, however, one is looking for a simple policy to
restrain pay growth, then I suggest that it is easier to get general
agreement and effective action about the timing of increases rather than
about their size.
Why not have a generally agreed recommendation, or guideline, to postpone
all increases whenever they come up by three months without any backdating.
In a situation of low inflation this delaying would not cause hardship and
need not call for any complicated policing, but would have an important
effect. In a year, one could, perhaps, look afresh at the situation created
and possible improvements to the simple process of modifying the intervals
between settlements.

<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Not accountable yet' (November 2), Samuel Brittan says
that in my article 'Disarming the Treasury' I proposed that the Treasury
should cease to be a forecasting organisation.
In that article (which I wrote while I was at the London Business School), I
said that there should be a considerable widening of the sources of advice
for the chancellor and a reduction in the weight placed on the Treasury's
internally generated views. But I added: 'This would not exclude the
Treasury from offering independent advice, based on its own analysis and
forecasts.'

Interviewing patients at a psychiatric nursing home, a researcher asked the
first what was 3 times 3. 'Friday,' came the reply. Sighing, the interviewer
called the next one and inquired what was 5 times 5. This time the answer
was '133'. When the third one responded to 4 times 4 with '16', the
researcher brightened up. 'How did you work it out?' he asked. 'Easy' said
the patient. 'I just took Friday away from 133.'

To anyone working outside the financial sector, job-titles in the City of
London can often be not only bemusing but awe-some. Where else, for
instance, could people be arrogant enough to style themselves 'heads of
global custody'?
So it's comforting to learn from Day Associates' latest pay-survey of London
banks that the Square Mile still harbours one type of employee who can be
found existing, as distinct from working, in organisations of all sorts
throughout the world - the 'position-keeper'.
To the City's credit, such people seem unusually rare there. Only 25 of the
111 banks surveyed employed them. Moreover, with an average salary of Pounds
13,468, they look to be less well paid just for being there than are their
counter-parts in other fields of work.

In what could lead to the greatest turn-off of all time, the European
Community is considering televising its ministerial meetings on such topics
as the maximum net speed, torque and power permissible for two or
three-wheeled vehicles.
The proposal, intended to show that the EC is not a secretive power-hungry
bureaucracy, is to be discussed by member countries' foreign ministers today
 -behind closed doors, of course.
Progress is likely to be delayed, however, not only by ministerial
disagreements about how far to open up community business to the public, but
also because Brussels' diplomats are unenthusiastic.
'If you open it all, you run the risk that people will simply play to the
crowd all the time,' said one of them. 'Anything really important will be
settled by telephone, in the corridors or, God help us, in the toilets.'

<TEXT>
What is the Yorkshire Post doing for Europe? Furnishing the community with
straight-talking PR men from the ranks of its past employees, it would seem.
Following indications that former Downing Street press spokesman and
strident Euro-sceptic Sir Bernard Ingham may be off to the European
Commission to help improve its image, fellow Yorkshireman John Wright, head
of press relations at the Central Statistical Office, reveals that he has
decided to jump on to the Euro-bandwagon.
Wright, 49, is off to Luxembourg to take charge of press contacts at
Eurostat, which co-ordinates statistics for all EC member states. Like
Ingham, Wright worked on the Yorkshire Post, and, while his private views on
the grand European endeavour are not known, he does share something of his
more famous former colleague's well-known irascibility.
While Sir Bernard gained notoriety through acting as Lady Thatcher's
mouthpiece, Wright too has had to work in recent months for a sometimes
unpredictable boss in the shape of Australian Bill McLennan, who took over
as head of the CSO in March.
McLennan, CSO officials say, actively encouraged Wright to seek glory on a
broader plane. What does that mean?

A small problem of 200 per cent inflation faces members of Ireland's
outgoing parliament who wish to stand for re-election. The deposit for
candidates, which has stood at IPounds 100 since the 1920s, is going up to
more than IPounds 300.
Still, it might have been worse. Environment minister Michael Smith had
wanted to up the ante to IPounds 500 until he bowed to opposition protests.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Observer: Forecasting the forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Deciding what numbers to extract from a forecast is, for the UK Treasury, as
much a function of psychology as it is of correctly interpreting economic
reality.
For this reason, just about everyone should be able to enjoy Observer's
latest competition. This is to anticipate the Treasury's forecast which will
be contained in Thursday's Autumn Statement.
In the past two years, official forecasters have sounded foolishly bullish
in their predictions of growth and demand - not that they have been short of
the company of City economists in their erroneous predictions,
However, those infamous green shoots still stay stubbornly underground, and
the need to calm the country ahead of an imminent general election has, for
the moment, passed. How gloomy can the boffins afford to be?
Equipped with the latest City projections, and a mild bent for amateur
psychology, readers are invited to fax, to 071-873-3926, their best attempts
to get inside the Treasury mind.
Forecasts of the forecast should encompass the following economic indicators
during 1993: growth in gross domestic product, in fixed investment, in
consumer spending and in manufacturing output; the size of the current
account deficit; and the year-on-year change in the retail prices index as
measured in the fourth quarter.
Entries should arrive by noon on Thursday and a bottle of malt whisky awaits
the set of numbers that most accurately reflects the official version of the
near-term fate of the UK economy.
To encourage the new spirit of glasnost inside the department, Observer
extends a special invitation to the denizens of Great George Street to enter
the contest themselves. It is, after all, possible that the numbers will be
altered at the 11th hour.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Spending dilemmas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT that aims to achieve credibility by sticking to pre-announced
targets is doomed to discomfort. Either it abandons its targets, which makes
it look ridiculous, or its sticks to them, which makes it look dogmatic. In
the case of the often-repeated commitment to the ERM, the UK government now
looks ridiculous. By all accounts, this week's Autumn Statement on public
spending will make it look dogmatic.
Yet dogmatism would be better than succumbing to the now pervasive sense of
panic. In an all too familiar volte face, erstwhile emulators of the Germans
have switched unblushingly to 'go go' economics. What the chancellor of the
exchequer needs to do is ignore the panic and elaborate, instead, his still
sketchy medium- term framework for policy.
With the loss of government's main economic policy and the economy teetering
between recovery and depression, the details of Mr Lamont's spending
proposals are a second-order issue. What matters most is to get the right
relationship between fiscal and other policies and to put forward credible
proposals for dealing with the dismal long-term prospects for the public
finances.
In resisting a fiscal splurge, the chancellor should stress once more the
substantial easing of monetary policy that has occurred since September 16.
In all probability, a further easing of monetary policy would be more
appropriate than the fiscal alternatives. It is too early to argue that
further monetary loosening will, in Keynes' famous phrase, be like pushing
on a string.
Deficit danger
Mr Lamont should also stress the link between inflation, pay, devaluation
and the prospects for sustained recovery. Particularly after a devaluation
which is now 13 per cent on the trade weighted effective exchange rate,
inflation cannot be assumed to be a thing of the past. The devaluation will
also fail to provide an enduring improvement in competitiveness if the rate
of growth of real wages does not fall and profitability in the production of
tradable goods does not rise.
Where does fiscal policy and public spending fit into the picture? The main
point here is the dire prospects for public finances in the longer term. The
public sector borrowing requirement this year may be about Pounds 35bn (5
1/2 per cent of gross domestic product) and well over Pounds 40bn next year
(6 to 7 per cent of GDP). That looks bad, but oceans of red ink can be
tolerated in a slump. More worryingly, such deficits could become
structural, partly because of the permanent increase in the interest bill
(some Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn for each year of such deficits), but still more
because of what has been happening to the economy.
Inaccurate forecasts
In March 1990, the Treasury believed that real GDP in 1993-94 would be 8 to
9 per cent larger than now seems likely. Unless the UK enjoys a long
recovery at a faster rate than the 2 3/4 per cent a year that the Treasury
then thought to be the trend, the economy will remain almost 10 per cent
smaller than was expected only 2 1/2 years ago. Self-evidently, the UK will
also be unable to afford the public spending plans of that time, let alone
increases that are more than cyclical. Even the increase in unemployment
does not, it should be noted, necessarily fall into the cyclical category.
The question for the government, part political and part economic, is how
much of the pain to impose now and how much in future years. Higher taxes
and spending cuts would seem inevitable, though now does not look like the
ideal time for either. But that is not what the government is proposing. Its
planning total of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94 represents a real increase of
around 4 per cent. Provided it delivers the needed monetary loosening, that
target should be met.
Yet failure to do so would not be the end of the fiscal world. An enfeebled
government must be careful not to lay itself open to the accusation of
starving poor widows and orphans. Maintaining existing investment projects
must also be sensible. Even control over public-sector pay cannot be
isolated from what is happening elsewhere in the economy.
Mr Major inherited a strong fiscal position. His challenge is to use the
fiscal flexibility he has now, while putting forward a credible plan for
reducing the scale of borrowing in the future.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Welcome, Mr Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, who arrives in London today for his first
official visit, is the bulwark protecting Russia's young reformers. With his
reformist government under siege from a coalition of conservatives similar
to, but more intelligent than, the one that mounted last year's failed
August coup, he deserves as much support as he can get from the west, and
especially from the European Community, of which Britain is part.
His welcome visit should be used as an opportunity to underline that,
despite domestic distractions and recessionary trends throughout Europe,
Britain and the Community understand that the fate of Europe, as well as of
Russia, is linked to the success of Russia's pursuance of market reforms.
The post-communist governments of central Europe have already shown that the
kind of reforms attempted by the government of Mr Yegor Gaidar are able to
bring tangible material and moral benefits within a reasonable period of
time. Earlier this year Russia itself started to see the first signs that
market reforms and a tight monetary policy could help to put goods into
shops and provide the indispensable incentives for people to assume the
risks of entrepreneurship.
The task facing Russia, mired in a uniquely destructive economic and
political system of its own creation for over seven decades, is much greater
than that confronted by central European countries. The latter's cultural
roots are in western Europe and they were forced to adopt a clearly alien
system for 'only' four decades.
Western backing
Nevertheless, the way that central Europe is dealing with the problems of
creating new market institutions, modernising the banks, privatising state
assets and attracting foreign equity investment is relevant to the long-term
solution of Russia's problems. What Mr Yeltsin needs is western backing to
help tailor these reforms to Russian circumstances, supported by far greater
western equity investment, as well as more governmental and institutional
help.
Mr Yeltsin, not an economist, must be reassured that he and his government
were on the right track before the military-industrial complex, the 'red
barons' of the collective farms and the old party-security bosses, aided and
abetted by a compliant central bank, prised open monetary discipline in
July. This sent a flood of inflationary credits surging through the
unreconstructed military and heavy industries, followed in short order by a
collapse of the rouble and approaching hyper-inflation.
Siren calls
Understandably distracted by the US elections, the debate over Maastricht, a
looming EC-US trade war, and gathering recessionary clouds, the west has
thus far failed to do enough to stiffen Mr Yeltsin's resolve. Mr Yeltsin
needs help to stay the course and ignore the siren calls from powerful
potential rivals such as Mr Arkady Volsky to prop up the old system.
There must be no illusions. Dismantling the old militarised economy to free
up resources for a capitalist economy attuned to supplying the pent-up needs
of the Russian people will lead to unemployment and great social strain.
Most of the effort will have to be made by Russians themselves.
Yet the alternative, easy credit to prop up the old system, is already
leading to hyper-inflation. Further down this ruinous path lie increasing
authoritarianism, economic collapse and ultimately perhaps some form of
military dictatorship or even civil war. The post-communist countries of
central Europe see this appalling prospect with far greater clarity than
those further away.
It is beyond the power of Britain alone to avert such a fate. But bilateral
relations are better now than they have been for decades and many Russians
believe that Britain retains significant influence. Mr Yeltsin also comes to
London as a new administration is being formed in the US. It is time for the
US, the European Community and Japan to place the future of Russia, and the
other former Soviet republics, higher up their scale of priorities. London
is as good a place as any to signal a new western commitment to helping
Russia help itself.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Too early for requiem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The majority of people who operate in the media have never been slow to
pronounce the doom of competitive liberal capitalism. This majority includes
many of those who write for financial institutions, admittedly in more
guarded style, but whose views are regarded by politicians as representative
of the markets. Indeed market participants themselves are often bad at
making the case for what they are doing and too often give the impression of
turkeys celebrating the coming of Christmas.
The combination of prolonged recession, boom and bust in financial markets,
and above all Bill Clinton's victory in the US presidential election has put
new heart into the anti-capitalist forces, and the sound of their
celebrations will go on awhile.
Let me not begrudge people their moments of happiness. Those of us who take
seriously the adjective 'liberal' before capitalism will not shed any tears
over the failure of Mr Bush's campaign, with its mobilisation of intolerant
religious fundamentalism and its near-McCarthyite search for dirt against
those who opposed the Vietnam war and who experimented with stimulants other
than tobacco and alcohol.
The best antidote to anti-capitalist triumphalism, as to most fads, is a
little history. The present swing of the pendulum is mild indeed compared
with the permanent state of opinion up to a decade or two ago. Go into any
library and pick up at random political or economic books written between
the wars or in the first postwar decades. You will find in most of them the
assumption that some form of collectivism - in the shape of more government
intervention, ownership and control - is the wave of the future and the only
argument was how quickly and by what route it would arrive.
Today the great shadow over comprehensive planning and state ownership is
the ignominious collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellites. Only a fool
would have expected a successful capitalism to emerge from the ashes in a
couple of years. The fact that a carefully nurtured system of law,
legislation, customs and habits and - of course infrastructure - is required
should surprise no-one except a few equilibrium economists. There is,
moreover, no beckoning 'third way' between communism and capitalism. The
country which most nearly offered this, Sweden, is busily dismantling many
of its most interventionist institutions, reducing public spending and tax
percentages, and is suffering from the recession and unemployment usual in
an attempt to squeeze inflation out of the economy.
The one large country enjoying successful growth appears to be China, which
combines an emergent capitalism with a ruthless political dictatorship
reminiscent of the Pinochet regime in Chile. It may appeal to those
capitalists - certainly not liberal ones - who put measured economic growth
above personal liberty and civil rights. Moreover China's success is so far
merely relative. It is growing rapidly from a low level.
Too many capitalist supporters allow their views to be guyed by opponents.
For instance, the taxation of the bulk of the population to help the least
well off or the victims of change is of course part of a civilised
capitalism. Ideally, redistribution should take the form of cash - which
respects the choices of the recipient. But when, as in the case of medical
services, cash transfers do not work well, a publicly funded system does not
take us along the road to serfdom. The fatal stage is later, where in the
name of preventing that most British of crimes - queue jumping - the
provision of private alternatives is prevented.
When it comes to evils such as environmental pollution, remedies which use
the price mechanism or redefine property rights are infinitely better than
the top-down approach that have caused such havoc in eastern Europe. The US
has been unable to afford a decent safety net, not because of capitalism,
but because of interest group democracy that purloins an excessive share of
resources for the middle-class welfare state and the military-industrial
complex. If Bill Clinton can roll back these interest groups I shall be the
first to go to Washington as a humble and penitent pilgrim.
The most recent war cry of those who realise that old style socialism is
dead is to say that the supposedly planned Japanese and German variants of
capitalism are better than the more buccaneering Anglo-American variety.
(How about the Italian, which is the most buccaneering of all?) These
slogan-mongers seem not to have noticed the hash which the German social
partnership has made of reunification or the financial collapse in Japan.
It is no longer so fashionable to praise the French system. Yet what aspects
of it are threatening the Gatt round? It is not the more competitive spirit
in industry and commerce, but state support for French farmers. If there is
to be a requiem it should be for knee-jerk and producer-driven
interventionism.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Bad blood in Brussels: National leaders need to make painful
choices to rescue the cause of European unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cause of European unity has always been a fragile enterprise. With the
Gatt world trade talks in the balance, and the prospects for ratification of
the Maastricht treaty cloudier than ever, the row last week over whether Mr
Jacques Delors had sabotaged a US-EC agricultural deal was a damaging blow
to an already bruised Community.
Mr Delors' position as president of the European Commission appears secure,
as long as Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agricultural commissioner and a lead
Gatt negotiator, fails to produce unequivocal evidence to support his
charges against the Frenchman. But the recrimination over Mr MacSharry's
allegations will linger, fuelling the atmosphere of mutual suspicion inside
the Commission and among member states, and strengthening the impression of
disarray.
Faced with some of the bleakest economic prospects since 1945, Europe's
politicians are increasingly held hostage by domestic political pressures,
whether they be from French farmers, a handful of Tory Euro-sceptics or the
need to maintain high interest rates to pay for the costs of German
reunification. The question being raised in Brussels is whether EC leaders
will recover their nerve in time to take the decisions necessary to end the
current crisis of confidence inside the Community.
'We need convincing action on the issues at hand,' said a senior EC official
last Friday, warning that the future of the Maastricht treaty was at stake,
'but people are going back to the bad old days when they do not expect much
from the European Community.'
The Gatt debacle underlined the EC's near-paralysis. The stand-off on
agricultural policy between France, tacitly supported by Germany, and
Brussels, in the shape of the redoubtable Mr MacSharry, has been one of the
worst-kept secrets. If weekend efforts to relaunch the EC-US talks succeed,
there may still be a chance of averting a transatlantic trade war which no
one wants. However, the way in which member-states have meddled in the
Commission's negotiating efforts has revealed institutional weaknesses in
the Community.
Even if a Gatt breakthrough materialises, a host of other problems is piling
up before the next EC summit in Edinburgh early next month, starting with
the UK government's decision last week to delay final ratification of the
Maastricht treaty until after a second Danish referendum next year.
Mr John Major's decision to delay ratification caused consternation in
European capitals. Most officials believed they had a solid British
commitment to press ahead with Maastricht as fast as possible, without
renegotiation. Mr Major was, in fact, more circumspect, leaving open the
possibility of proceeding after Christmas.
Despite his caveats, several European governments felt misled. The narrow
Commons majority on Wednesday night in favour of proceeding with Maastricht
was to their mind a victory for the treaty. In the event, the three-strong
majority showed how close Mr Major had come to defeat.
Yet the real importance of the British delay is that it adds to the
uncertainty which has been sapping the strength of the European Community
for the past six months. Ever since the narrow Danish vote against
Maastricht, the EC has been engaged in internal crisis management, often to
the exclusion of more pressing external matters such as a Gatt agreement and
civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
The Community's recent attempts at 'Euro-building' have occasionally
appeared to be an uneasy mix of the very important and the very unimportant.
Efforts to promote 'transparency' in the aftermath of the narrow Yes vote in
the French referendum on Maastricht led to Mr Major's suggestion that EC
leaders should devote a five-minute speech in Birmingham to their vision of
Europe. This was greeted with gentle derision in Europe, but efforts to make
'subsidiarity' - devolving powers to the lowest appropriate level -
comprehensible to the ordinary public have been equally unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, leaders have found it easier to shuffle important business to one
side. The turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism in September,
which led to the withdrawal of the Italian lira and the British pound and to
the devaluation of the Spanish peseta, let loose shocks inside the European
Monetary System which are still reverberating. Yet member-states have so far
confined themselves to technical discussions, on the grounds that a public
debate about reform of the ERM could unsettle financial markets and
precipitate another currency crisis.
Similarly, there is little public debate on the acute economic problems
facing Europe - the accelerating downturn which in turn is raising questions
about the common drive for economic convergence and future European monetary
union laid out in the Maastricht treaty.
Some preliminary work on a new growth policy is being conducted by Mr Delors
and Mr Henning Christopherson, European commissioner responsible for
economic policy; but even the most idealistic Europhiles in Brussels know
that the burden for promoting growth lies with the member states.
A pivotal test of political will centres on member-states' approval of the
so-called Delors II package. This would authorise extra funding for the
poorer southern members and Ireland which Mr Delors insists must be extended
if they are to have any hope of surviving the deflationary impact of the
drive to monetary union.
The Commission's original proposal, based on 2.5 per cent annual growth, was
to increase EC spending by about 30 per cent over five years. The idea was
to lift spending from 1.2 per cent of the Community's gross domestic product
to 1.37 per cent of GDP by 1997. But several countries, led by Germany and
the UK, forced this proposal off the table last spring on the grounds that
is was too ambitious at a time of budget-tightening.
Now the 2.5 per cent growth forecasts look unrealistic. Therefore, in his
latest proposal, Mr Delors wants to revive his idea of spreading the
increase in funds over seven years, with a freeze on spending at 1.2 per
cent of GDP for the first two years. Close colleagues, who describe Mr
Delors as 'very bruised', believe that failure to agree a budget package
could prompt another resignation threat, possibly even an irrevocable
decision to quit.
Such a threat may work; but it is becoming increasingly clear that countries
such as Germany are hesitant about paying the high economic price for
political cohesion in the Community, particularly given the unexpectedly
high costs of German unification. 'The tensions between donors and
recipients in the Community is one of the coming big themes,' says a US
diplomat in Brussels.
The next big political test for the EC will be how it tackles the Danish
question. Already several member states, notably Spain, Germany, France and
Ireland, are suggesting privately that Danish requests for 'legally binding'
agreements on a UK-style opt-out on a single currency and an exemption from
a putative common European army will have to be watered down.
For all its seriousness, there is an Alice in Wonderland quality to the
debate. Mr Uffe-Ellemann Jensen, the Danish foreign minister charged with
explaining his country's position, is in reality presenting demands largely
dictated to his minority government by opposition parties; he himself has
little faith in those demands. At the same time, says one senior EC
official, member states are kidding themselves if they believe they can
significantly change the Danish demands, since they are almost certainly the
necessary price for securing ratification next year.
In this official's view, there are only three options to settle the Danish
question. First, a new document setting out in explicit detail the
post-Maastricht rights and obligations of Denmark to the EC, and vice versa.
Such special treatment would be enormously complicated and would almost
certainly prove unacceptable to the member states.
The second option is the threat of divorce - an ultimatum to Copenhagen that
unless it accepts a non-legally binding political declaration covering its
demands, it must leave the Community.
The third option is to accept the Danish terms, recognising that a good deal
of what the Danes are seeking is not explicitly required by the treaty. Thus
the Community, working with the Danes, would draw up a text on the basis of
which the Danish people would ratify Maastricht. And one expert view is that
such document could be legally binding upon the Danes, but would not require
re-ratification by other members states.
'Anything can be done from a legal point of view,' says the expert. 'In the
end it comes down to a political decision - and the words.'
One last alternative for the member states is the Micawber option - to
postpone a settlement of the Danish question until after the Edinburgh
summit in the hope that something turns up. This carries great risks. Along
with the Delors II package, Maastricht ratification by the 12 has a direct
bearing on the timetable for the next stage of European Union in 1996 - when
the Maastricht treaty is scheduled to be reviewed, and when some countries
may be ready to proceed to monetary union.
Approval of Maastricht and a Delors II package are also the pre-conditions
for opening EC membership negotiations with Austria, Finland and Sweden.
Until recently, it had been assumed that entry talks might proceed early
next year despite the problems with ratification.
The British delay, says one EC official, offers countries such as Spain a
ready-made excuse to block the negotiations. One good reason is that final
passage of Maastricht in the UK House of Lords might not be complete until
well into the autumn. If Austria, Finland and Sweden are forced to wait,
there is a danger that ratification of their own membership treaties will be
delayed until late 1994 or 1995. This could leave them in no man's land when
it comes to the Maastricht review conference in 1996 when they had, in fact,
hoped to be fully participating EC members.
The EC would thus risk becoming divided between members inside the
Community, members with one foot outside such as Denmark and Britain, and
would-be members from Scandinavia clamouring to come in. This uneasy
ambiguity bears more than a passing resemblance to the unhappy and
increasingly untenable position today.

It appears to be David Nobbs' Benefit Night. His comedy drama series A Bit
Of A Do, so popular when first shown on ITV, continues its repeat run on C4
(10.00). An hour earlier ITV begins another comedy drama adapted by Nobbs
from his own book, The Life And Times Of Henry Pratt. This is set in a small
Yorkshire town in 1935 and chronicles a young man's journey through the
British class system.
I still don't think there is anything funny about the Gestapo, and I suspect
some members of the resistance may be rightly offended at the idea that,
less than a full generation later, we can consider all parties in World War
Two equally ludicrous, equally hilarious. That said, even against my better
judgement, 'Allo 'Allo still makes me laugh. Tonight brings the first in
what we are told will be the last batch of this utterly British pantomime
(8.00 BBC1).
Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) investigates the Militant Tendency and Panorama (9.30
BBC1) Satanic abuse, phenomena which have received more than their fair
share of attention already. Let's hope today's programmes push both subjects
back where they belong.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: London's heritage in danger - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In all the rumpus about English Heritage engendered by its chairman Mr
Jocelyn Stevens's recent pronouncements about it's future, there is a whole
area that seems to deserve much closer attention, analysis and comment. That
area is London.
London's heritage of historic buildings is now supervised by English
Heritage. English Heritage was set up by Mr Michael Heseltine in 1984 as a
quango divorced from its natural home in the Department of the Environment.
In the world of conservation and the heritage, as in so many other areas,
the nation now suffers greatly from the impulsiveness of Mr Michael
Heseltine. He has never been a minister to think very thoroughly about the
consequences of his impulses. English Heritage, with its logo and management
teams, may have looked good, but it has never functioned well because of its
hybrid status: neither independent nor government; responsible to two
ministers - Environment and National Heritage; and run by civil servants
struggling to be 'independent.'
London's heritage had, until 1986, been increasingly well looked after by
the Historic Buildings Division of the Greater London Council. When the GLC
was abolished by the Conservative government under Mrs Thatcher, this
division found itself transported to the confused realm of English Heritage.
The abolition of the GLC left London as probably the only capital city in
the world with no form of metropolitan government. Mercifully the one
anomaly was in the area of historic buildings, where London continued to
receive special treatment by the transfer of the GLC's powers to English
Heritage.
From 1986 English Heritage has had the residual local authority powers to
'direct' the decisions of the London Boroughs in relation to listed building
consent applications; in other parts of the country English Heritage only
advise. In London English Heritage is concerned with applications for all
listed buildings; elsewhere English Heritage only deals with the top two
grades of listed buildings. This may seem technical and irrelevant, but what
it means is that London's historic buildings and conservation areas receive
the best possible protection and 'heritage advice.'
But in the recently issued 'Background paper 5' that accompanied the
strategy document 'Managing England's Heritage - Setting Our Priorities for
the 1990s', English Heritage announces that it intends to 'withdraw from
what are essentially local authorities' responsibilities, in relation to
Grade II buildings' - which in effect means the end of any special status
for London, and the end of the once superb London Division. How curious that
Mr Stevens, who has publicly stated that all his officials' proposed changes
are about 'raising our standards not dropping them', should deliver the fate
of the majority of London's listed buildings into the hands of the London
Boroughs who will be reluctant to find funds to protect them adequately.
It would be agreeable to think that back in 1986 the reason the GLC's
Historic Buildings Division was moved lock, stock and barrel to English
Heritage was because it was so good at its job. No one could possibly doubt
the quality of the staff and their work. The London Division should be the
exemplar for the rest of the country. Instead it is to be broken up to meet
the wishes of bureaucratic levellers who dislike exceptions to the rule. In
the recent report of the National Audit Office on English Heritage, while
the organisation as a whole was criticised for inefficiency and lethargy,
the London Division was said to be doing its job too well - and was
criticised for the quality of its work being too high] Of course, it has to
be abolished . . .
Mr Stevens is a man who wants quick results. He has not thought through the
question of London's heritage. Only a few of the London boroughs have
effective conservation officers and there is little likelihood of any more
government funds. Why is it that what was accepted for London in parliament
by the minister at the time in 1985, Mr Kenneth Baker, is suddenly seen as
too good to be workable.
The advantages of the London Division of English Heritage are clear - the
chief one being its independence. How can any London Borough, when its own
interests are at stake, act independently when it comes to the demolition of
listed buildings? Mr Stevens will no doubt point to other areas of the
country, but the pressures on the capital are different and need special
treatment.
London's historic areas are endangered by another Government measure which
was debated in Parliament last week. The leasehold reforms proposed in the
Housing and Urban Development Bill, are, if they are carried through, bound
to have very mixed consequences for London's architectural heritage. Much of
central London still belongs to the great estates that developed their
London properties in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Some of the most beautiful and well maintained squares and crescents are
managed by the estates to a remarkably high standard. Bedford, Grosvenor,
Cadogan, Thurloe, Howard de Walden, Portman - an historic litany of names
that have created the character of many of the best parts of the capital. No
landlord is perfect but it is hard to see any hint of intelligent
alternative management proposals in the current legislation.
Compare Belgravia with Pimlico and the environmental differences are
striking. Look at the parts of the Portman estate that are retained in
Marylebone and compare them with the condition of the streets to the north
that were sold after the war. Covenants seldom work effectively and
neighbourhood associations depend on volunteers or committees that seldom
agree. It has been said that Paris and Edinburgh show that cities can retain
architectural quality without a leasehold system. But in both those cities
there is a great deal of rented accommodation at the centre and the
buildings are simple maintained by landlords who own the buildings. London's
great estates are unique and valuable and have retained mixed residential
communities in the city centre. A freehold free for all is not the solution.
A fairer leasehold system perhaps with real safeguards for architectural
management and conservation is what is needed. The present Bill, if passed
in its present form, looks as though it will sweep away the good landlords
with the bad and, like the English Heritage proposals, weaken the protection
afforded to the delicate architectural fabric of the capital.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: A dragon with three heads - National Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pantomime season has started early at the Royal National Theatre, and a
very clever choice has been made. Dragon, by the Russian playwright Yevgeny
Shvarts, is actually more of a fairy tale than a panto. It also has more
than a touch of satire. Whichever way you look at it, it fulfils the
seasonal requirement of containing something for everyone.
Shvarts (1896-1958) was one of those writers who, however hard he tried to
write in code, was generally seen through by the censors, so that his works
were seldom performed in his lifetime. Dragon was stopped in its tracks in
Leningrad in 1944 and not publicly shown in the Soviet Union until 1962 -
after the denunciation of Stalin. There was an English-language version at
the Royal Court in 1967.
One can see why the censors objected. The dragon is plainly Stalin: he has
three heads and it is no use cutting off just one. Moreover, the moral goes
further: those who slay the dragon, or are accomplices to the act, are quite
capable of becoming dragons themselves and perhaps even more tyrannical than
the original.
So much for the politics. A dragon with three heads is a wonderful subject
for a fairy tale. In this new version by Alan Cumming and Ultz, everything
has been thrown together: the resources of the Olivier stage, villains, a
damsel in distress, a talking cat. Some assistance from the television
programme, Spitting Image, and the latest in rap from MC Kinky, who used to
work with Boy George.
There is a story as well. The dragon is slain by Lancelot who disappears
after the battle as mysteriously as he has arrived. That is when the new
tyranny sets in and the prisons become even fuller. After a year, however,
Lancelot returns and the ending is happy, even sententious: 'The dragon in
each and every one of us must be slain.'
I can't say I much liked the music, though others may disagree. Among the
parts that stood out for me were 'a spot of market research' by the new
villains. They consult a fish, a snake ('there's another slippery customer')
and a parrot, which simply repeats what they have just said. Then there is
the traditional pantomime technique in asking the audience (let's have a
referendum): 'Do you want us to kill the dragon?' Overwhelming shouts of
'yes'.
The revolving stage and all the resources of lighting and sound are used to
the full. There is the noise of an aerial battle involving helicopters and
light aircraft as the dragon is finally killed. When Lancelot is absent and
rumours start as to his whereabouts, the letter 'L' begins to appear all
over the theatre. Scott Brooker of Spitting Image has been at work on
dragon, whose three heads are separately cast, like giving a credit to the
hindlegs of the pantomime horse.
Minor delights include the talking blue cat, Lancelot bouncing up and down a
group of puppet dogs ('they set the dogs on me and we became friends') and
the piglets who turn out still to be alive on the banquet table.
Ultz directs as well as designs. The cast is changing parts each
performance, so Dragon is almost the ultimate in company playing. There is
no guarantee that it will be the same show every time. Saturday's was
delightful; parents might like to know that it lasts less than two hours
with an interval.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: Soleil's circus extravaganza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soleil's newest circus extravaganza, Saltimbanco, now playing in Los Angeles
at the beginning of a two-year North American tour, is a wonderful evening's
entertainment that can be enjoyed as pure spectacle, but contains some
subtle and profound messages as well. If only the Canadian troupe didn't try
so hard to convince us that Saltimbanco carries some deep, mysterious - and,
eventually - non-existent overall meaning.
Tying Saltimbanco's individual circus acts together with recurrent
characters, music, and even a story line is in theory a good idea, but the
performers play it all out with an air of self-importance and exultation
that is distracting and often downright silly.
Epitomising this is Francine Poitras, the chanteuse whose vocals mark the
first use of the human voice in any of Cirque's productions. She wafts and
struts around the stage, sweeping her arms in arcs with gossamer sleeves
floating along behind, her strong and well-trained voice singing -
gibberish. That she is singing nonsense words is never mentioned in the
programme; many audience members assumed that she was speaking Quebecois
Cirque's native French.
The performers of the spectacular circus acts carry off Cirque's trademark
attitude of exultation more successfully than the incidental players. Twins
Karyne and Sarah Steban gaze into each other's eyes with awe throughout
their trapeze act because their dexterity, daring and mutual trust is indeed
awesome.
Cirque's performers are surely at the forefront of their craft. Cuban Miguel
Herrera literally turns juggling upside down, bouncing seven balls off the
floor at once. A team of 15 acrobats performs a Chinese pole-climbing act
extraordinary not only in the acrobats' balance and strength but also in the
beauty of the pictures they create as they hang in the air.
As with all of Cirque's spectaculars, Saltimbanco is circus updated to be
politically correct - no animal acts nor scantily clad women sawn in half. A
rock band, spectacular lighting effects, gusts of dry-ice fog and the
inclusion of a child in the production makes Saltimbanco particularly
appealing to children.
Clown Rene Bazinet provides Saltimbanco's sublimest moments. Bazinet, who
looks like Goofy, takes an audience member - the evening I attended, an
average-looking thirty-something fellow - and trains him in clown tricks for
nearly half an hour. The Cirque band and unobtrusive microphone system help
Bazinet provide hilarious sound effects which makes the improvised act seem
rehearsed. His simple feat ofmaking an ordinary guy a hero carries a
longer-lasting message than all of Cirque's faux serious posturing.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Alexander Lazarev in charge, the BBC Symphony transmitted
Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony with singular power on Thursday, to a
Festival Hall audience arranged in the ideal way: all eagerly crowded around
the platform, front and sides, as close as numbers permitted.
Never mind the rows of empty seats at the back of the Terrace, and in the
Grand Tier (thrifty music-lovers know that every BBC concert will sooner or
later be broadcast in digital stereo); the BBC's new pricing-policy - a flat
Pounds 9 for any seat, all unreserved - has secured a heartening result.
Too many South Bank and Barbican concerts find themselves with little strips
of audience in the Stalls, arranged according to disposable income (or
pecking-order within a corporate patron) and insulated by unoccupied gaps,
while the cheaper seats far away may be crammed full.
Along with Valery Gergiev, whom we know so far chiefly in opera, Lazarev -
now the BBC's Principal Guest Conductor - is the happiest discovery among
the newer Russian maestros. This Shostakovich Fourth was superbly prepared
(the BBC Symphony, swollen for the occasion, on their best form - a serious
compliment these days) and enacted with knife-edge dramatic sense. The
composer finished it in 1936, after his popular triumph with Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk had been curdled by Stalin and Zhdanov's disapproval.
That was a crisis-point. It can be no accident that the Finale is so
restless and distracted, where his original intentions promised something
more incisively confident; nor that the lingering, frozen coda is so fraught
with passive foreboding. Willy-nilly, the Fourth became Shostakovich's first
large-scale exercise in compromise and concealment.
Yet it tingles with compositional vitality, which Lazarev rendered in vivid
colours (including the strangest, most haunted ones) and tautly ordered
succession. Even the best digital stereo cannot have captured the full force
of this searching performance.
Before it Ida Haendel played Britten's Violin Concerto with her usual grace
and flawless musicianship. In her silver-age years, she is becoming as much
of a prodigy again as at the precocious start of her career. The Concerto
remains the product of a fluently gifted young composer (he was 26, newly
self-exiled to America) with no pressing urge to write one thing rather than
another. The piece parades a lot of wry, ingenious detail without an
overriding purpose.
There is no particular reason why Lazarev should feel any special sympathy
for it, but he did it proud: I don't remember any previous performance in
which Britten's inventions have sounded so red-blooded and buoyant.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Management: Honda reaches accord in UK - Demarcation lines
are out and teamwork is in at a new car plant in Swindon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receptionist at Honda's manufacturing complex has not yet had to leave
her desk to help screw widgets together on the engine assembly line. But, if
asked, she is perfectly prepared to do so. Indeed, it would be expected in
the unlikely event of a sudden shop-floor crisis at the Japanese car-maker's
Pounds 370m plant at Swindon, 80 miles west of London.
The receptionist would even be appropriately dressed. As a matter of daily
routine she wears overalls similar to those of Shojiro Miyake, managing
director of Honda manufacturing in the UK and president of Honda Motor
Europe. They are the same overalls that are worn by the remaining 844
employees and directors currently working at the 360-acre site.
She could find herself swapping spanners on the assembly line with Andrew
Jones, the plant manager who was last week made a director Honda of the UK
Manufacturing. A former BT personnel director, with experience in the mining
industry, he has operational control of a complex that already inspects and
tests some 40,000 Honda Concertos built for it by its Rover Group partner.
The plant also makes more than 100,000 engines a year and has just started
producing the first of what, by the mid-1990s, will be 100,000 Honda cars a
year.
Jones makes clear that, if the need is sufficiently urgent, no one in the
plant is too senior, or exempt for any other reason, from helping out on
even the most humble tasks. He has no office or secretary. But then neither
do any other of the plant's most senior employees, including Miyake.
There are other cultural aspects of Honda's Swindon operation which, like
the status-shrouding overalls, have already acquired a familiar ring to
western ears through Japanese companies which have long preceded Honda into
Europe.
Everyone at Swindon is on the same pension scheme, sick pay conditions and
holiday entitlement. There is no reserved parking. Everyone uses the same
changing rooms and canteen. There are no formal job descriptions and there
are no workers or directors, only 'associates'.
Nothing better illustrates the attitudes being promoted by Honda than the
company's move to a shorter working week. During 1990, following a concerted
campaign by engineering unions, indigenous companies horse-traded with their
employees over the terms for moving from 40 hours to 39. At the same time,
Honda's Swindon employees were told they could move from a 40 to a 37-hour
week - without preconditions.
'What we said was, 'look, effectively we're giving you 5.1 per cent time at
the same rate of pay. Will you please make up the difference?'' recalls
Jones. 'And it came - in the form of hundreds of small ideas which improved
the way we work and our overall levels of efficiency.'
It was not just the shorter hours but the way in which they were organised
which has helped to foster good relations within a plant which has no union
representation or recognition - and no plans for any.
Says Jones: 'We have a young work force with an average age of 29. They're a
social lot. They mostly like a drink and the opposite sex and we quite
understood that on Friday nights they'd really like to leave early.
'Ordinarily, the second of the two shifts within the engine and vehicle
inspection plants finishes at midnight. But by making both morning and
evening shifts shorter by two hours, and cutting the normal gap between
first and second shifts from the usual one hour and 10 minutes to 10
minutes, everyone gets to go home on Friday by 6.30 at latest.'
Currently, only a handful of Accords are coming off the line each day - a
function of what Jones acknowledges to be an 'obsession' with quality, and
of the small teams grouped on the assembly line learning for themselves how
best to organise their work.
Jones says it will be 12 to 18 months before the Swindon plant is producing
at its single-shift capacity of 50,000 cars a year, so anxious is Honda to
set high quality standards from the start. Nevertheless, the build-up is
under way, and employment at the plant will pass the 1,000 mark in early
January, en route to 1,500 jobs by the end of next year as single-shift
capacity nears, and an eventual 2,000 in the mid-1990s.
'Teamwork' crops up in almost every sentence uttered by Jones: 'It is
critical. So many people talk of good teamwork as if it's some kind of
philosopher's stone. In our case it translates as an overriding objective to
develop together. If you were to go out on the line, you would find no work
study or industrial engineers timing everything - we expect our people to
develop their own jobs and functions.'
The car plant work force is being 'grown' organically from a core of about
100 people who were among the first employees at the pre-delivery inspection
(PDI) centre - operational since 1986 - and the engine plant which has been
on stream since 1989. 'The advantage is that the PDI people came with an
understanding of all aspects of the car, and people from the engine centre
came with an awareness of the importance of meeting production targets.'
Working in teams of four, they are said by Jones to have gained great
breadth of understanding and knowledge from each other. Initial teams were
formed by one Japanese training one 'Brit'. Both would then train two more
Britons. All four would train another four - and so the process continues
today.
'Teamwork means that we reject class differentiation and job demarcation. We
don't accept anyone as being more important than anyone else. If we are
recruiting at a senior level, that recruit spends at least one month on the
shop floor. So if you want high status, a secretary and an expensive desk to
keep everyone at a distance - don't come and work here,' says Jones.
The majority of the current work force has been recruited locally, many
during a period when unemployment in the Swindon region was under 3 per
cent. Now it is 9 per cent but the recruitment programme continues almost
invisibly, with initial recommendations spreading by word of mouth. Each
candidate has to pass two interviews and, more recently, an aptitude test.
All staff are involved in daily start-of-shift briefings and are fully
briefed from weekly management meetings. At the start of each month all
staff review with Jones and his closest associates the company's current
position and operating activities as well as welcoming new 'associates'.
There are also monthly 'birthday party' get-togethers in which all staff
with a birthday that month meet socially and to swap ideas with Miyake,
Jones and other senior colleagues.
There are also regular 'Y-Gaya' meetings involving all groups of employees.
The phrase stands for 'free, frank interchance of views'. The idea, says
Jones, is continually to widen understanding and spread knowledge.
There are now 52 'new Honda circles' - teams of six people looking for
continuous improvement within defined areas that the team itself selects.
They include new ideas, training, environment and safety. As an example, one
'associate' was burned while deep in the foundry area, undertaking
maintenance. His circle devised a new system which now means that no one
needs to enter the hazard area.
The sometimes roguishly self-named circles have plaques created in token of
their achievements. Honda, says Jones, has no problem publicly acknowledging
its gratitude to, among other teams, the 'Missionary Position' and 'Three
Men and a Ferret'.

FT  09 NOV 92 / People: New finance director for L&amp;M
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Manchester, the Exeter-based life insurance company recently fined
Pounds 80,000 by Lautro for breaches of sales regulations, has appointed a
new group finance director.
The job will entail having to cope with many changes over the next few
years.
Martin Jackson, 44, the new incumbent, is a chartered accountant who has
been with L&amp;M for the past four years. His work as an accountant took him
from Peat Marwick, where he worked for nine years from 1971 to 1980, to
Touche Ross.
Then he had rather more exotic work in internal audit in the Gulf for the
Emirates International Bank and advising the government of the Sultanate of
Oman.
The stresses and strains currently afflicting the UK's life industry should
give him plenty more work in the years ahead.
Apart from the current controversy over how the industry should be
regulated, Jackson also points to the introduction of accruals accounting,
announced this week by the Prudential, and to the criticism the industry has
received for high front-end charges on its products.
He said: 'Inevitably as a public quoted company we are bound to go the
accruals accounting route in the next few years, unless it fails miserably
with the companies which do introduce it.' The question of when L&amp;M times
its move, however, could be much more complicated.
On the broader problems for the industry, he believes that L&amp;M should not
keep its 'head in the sand', but stand up and be counted. He also believes
that technological advances, and the use of computers in the field, could
engineer a lot of change for the industry.

FT  09 NOV 92 / People: Heley - vice-chairman at Hill Samuel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Heley, head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, has been promoted
to vice chairman, enabling him to devote more time to generating new
business, while leaving others to run the day-to-day operations of the
department.
Heley, 44, who says his expertise is 'domestic transactions - from the
biggest and most complicated to the smallest and most complicated', claims
to be busier than he has been for a long time. While underwriting fee
income, a crucial constituent in the profitability of City corporate finance
departments, has dropped away almost completely, Heley says that, since
advising on the Brent Walker restructuring, there has been a steady stream
of other mandates, including Control Securities, as well as two other
restructurings which are not yet in the public domain.
Hill Samuel has one other vice chairman, Murray Stuart, who is also chairman
of Scottish Power.
Meanwhile the day-to-day running of the division will be taken on by three
directors, all of whom will report to Stuart: Edward Buchan will be in
charge of operations; Martin Anderson of international; and Sir Mark
Wrightson of marketing.
Originally an economist at Phillips &amp; Drew, Heley joined Hill Samuel for
first time in 1974, becoming a director in 1980. He moved to BZW in 1986, as
head of merchant banking corporate finance. He returned to Hill Samuel in
1990.

RESULTS DUE
BAA, the privatised UK airport operator, is expected to report higher
first-half pre-tax profits on Monday of Pounds 200m to Pounds 220m. However,
last year's Pounds 151m followed hefty provisions of Pounds 55m for property
write-offs and staff cuts.
Although traffic at BAA airports has recovered from the effects of the Gulf
war on air travel, the economic slowdown in the UK and other industrialised
countries has slowed the upturn. For the full year, City analysts are
forecasting pre-tax profits in a range of between Pounds 270m and Pounds
300m.
Composite insurers General Accident and Royal Insurancer, which report
nine-month results on Tuesday and Thursday respectively, are expected to
show improvements, but still be in the red.
GA is tipped to reduce losses to Pounds 20m (Pounds 133m), thanks to higher
premiums and the abating of rising claims costs. Depending on claims over
Hurricane Andrew, the third quarter could even be profitable. Royal should
cut its losses from Pounds 214m to about Pounds 106m, although it is still
being hit by mortgage indemnity losses.
Water company results are skewed towards the first half. Northumbrian, the
smallest of the 10 privatised bodies by market capitalisation, is expected
to show a 25 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 39m in the six months
to September 30 when it reports on Tuesday.
The interim dividend is forecast to go up by 9 per cent to 7.4p (6.8p).
At Anglian, where Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez sold its near-9 per cent stake in
October, sending tremors through sector share prices, the forecast profit
rise is from Pounds 91.2m to Pounds 101m, with dividend growth of about 8
per cent to 6.8p.
Dunhill, the luxury goods group which reports on Wednesday, is marked down
for flat to slightly lower interim pre-tax profits, compared with last
year's Pounds 31m. A cushioning effect will be higher interest receivable on
healthy cash balances of about Pounds 180m.
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group which has weathered the
recession better than most, is likely to report resilient interim profits on
Thursday.
Analysts believe pre-tax profits may edge ahead to around Pounds 180m as the
strength of the Boots the Chemists chain and the pharmaceuticals division
again shine through.
However, the businesses acquired through Ward White will probably continue
to look pretty sickly. BT is expected to show a 40 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 990m for the half year to September 30
when it announces its results on Thursday.
The main reason for the fall is exceptional charges for the sale of its
interest in Mitel Corporation, the troubled Canadian telephone equipment
maker, and for the voluntary retirement of 29,000 people.
Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, reports its third-quarter
figures on Thursday. Most analysts are forecasting a Pounds 550m to Pounds
750m profit on a replacement cost basis, compared with Pounds 523m in the
same quarter last year, and Pounds 481m in the last quarter.
The results are expected to be boosted by foreign currency gains and an
accounting adjustment at a subsidiary, forecast to net Pounds 50m.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Economics: Anxious markets look to No 11
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is back in the news with financial markets anxiously awaiting
Thursday when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will produce his Autumn
Statement and a package of measures to stimulate the economy against an
increasingly gloomy international background.
Any optimism engendered by Governor Bill Clinton's presidential election
victory last week has to be set against the threat of a transatlantic trade
war and increasingly bleak growth prospects in Europe and Japan.
These developments will be discussed today and tomorrow by senior finance
ministry officials from the main industrial countries at the OECD in Paris.
It is expected that the Autumn Statement detailing the UK government's
spending plans and economic forecast for next year will be unveiled against
a background of rising unemployment and falling output.
While there are high hopes of an early cut in UK interest rates, there is no
sign that German rates will be cut at Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.
The week's economic highlights and events follow with the median of
economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a financial information
company, in brackets.
Today: France, OECD economic policy committee (EPC) meets in Paris.
Switzerland, Group of 10 central bank governors meet in Basle. UK, September
consumer credit business (net Pounds 50m repayment). Australia, September
retail trade (up 0.3 per cent). Canada, October housing starts (169,000),
September vehicle sales (up 2.3 per cent on month), August labour income (up
0.1 per cent on month).
Tomorrow: France, EPC meeting continues. Switzerland, EC central bank
governors meet in Basle. UK, October manufacturers' input prices (up 1.2 per
cent on month, 0.9 per cent on year), output prices (up 0.1 per cent on
month, 3.2 per cent on year, up 2.6 per cent ex-food, drink and tobacco).
US, October producer prices (up 0.3 per cent), ex food and energy (up 0.2
per cent). Japan, September machinery orders.
Wednesday: Germany, parliamentary budget committee begins three-day meeting
in Bonn to finalise 1993 budget. UK, Bank of England governor lectures in
London on case for price stability. France, Armistice Day public holiday.
US, Veterans' Day - some markets closed.
Thursday: UK, Autumn Statement; October unemployment (up 40,000), September
average earnings (5.75 per cent); October provisional vehicle production.
Germany, fortnightly Bundesbank council meeting. US, October money supply
figures; money supply for week to November 2; initial claims week ended
October 31 (370,000). Australia, October unemployment (10.95 per cent).
Sweden, October consumer prices.
Friday: UK, October retail prices index (up 0.4 per cent on month, 3.5 per
cent on year, ex-mortgages up 3.9 per cent); September industrial production
(down 0.4 per cent on year), manufacturing output (down 0.1 per cent on
month, 0.3 per cent on year); 3rd quarter unit wage costs (up 2.1 per cent

FT  09 NOV 92 / Ford unions prepare to resist cuts: Compulsory redundancies
feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Ford, leader in the UK market for new cars, are expected to face
compulsory redundancies for the first time in almost 30 years following a
meeting today between management and unions.
Unions representing the 25,000 hourly paid workers say the company has
withdrawn its proposal for a six-month pay freeze in return for voluntary
job cuts, but expect Ford will still press for a 40 per cent pay cut for
workers on short-time until the end of 1994.
In September Ford said it would undertake to achieve the more than 1,500 job
losses voluntarily if unions agreed to the package. The company warned that
if there were insufficient volunteers by December 11 it would have to move
to compulsory redundancies if the deal was rejected.
Unions believe Ford can achieve job cuts voluntarily and say they will
resist compulsory redundancies and the cut in lay-off pay. They warned that
reductions in lay-off pay would affect productivity.
Ford said in September it needed to shed workers at UK car-assembly and
engine plants, saying it had 'half an assembly plant too much capacity'.
Ford's 10,000 salaried staff were told last week to expect compulsory
redundancies because of continuing weak demand. Ford's UK workforce fell
from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 39,500 by late last year and is
expected to fall below 34,900 by the end of this year. Last month the
company announced production cuts affecting 5,500 workers at Dagenham and
1,800 at Southampton. It stopped all car and van production at two of its
three UK assembly plants for a week and said it was extending the three-day
and four-day working weeks at Dagenham and Southampton respectively.
The job losses and production cuts underline Ford's European losses. In the
third quarter its European automotive operations fell to a deficit of
Dollars 479m because of continuing heavy losses at Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury
car subsidiary, and a sharp fall at Ford of Britain.
Ford's US automotive operations incurred a loss of Dollars 153m in the third
quarter. In September it announced it had returned to loss on its worldwide
operations in the third quarter with a deficit of Dollars 159m (Pounds
101m), compared with a net profit of Dollars 840m in the first half of the
year.
Ford recently cut production in Belgium and this month announced a programme

FT  09 NOV 92 / Spectre of water privatisation haunts Lang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE next few weeks Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, will have to reveal
his thinking on what has become the most controversial issue facing him
since the general election - the possible privatisation of Scottish water.
In July Mr Lang said the government was looking at 'alternative ways' of
organising water and sewerage services, including 'ways in which the private
sector might contribute enterprise and investment'. The following month he
appointed Quayle Munro, the small Edinburgh merchant bank, to advise on the
options.
Although Mr Lang did not use the terms 'privatisation' or 'sell-off', the
very mention of the words 'private sector' immediately led to accusations
that the Scottish Office was proposing to privatise Scotland's water and
sewerage services, which are operated by the regional and island councils.
Opposition parties have had a field day since Mr Lang's announcement. Lord
Ewing, formerly Mr Harry Ewing, Labour MP for Falkirk East, said
privatisation might mean that the water added to a dram of whisky could cost
as much as the whisky itself. Church ministers, he said, would have to
conduct mass baptisms of babies to save water bills.
The Scottish National party newspaper quoted an unnamed professor as saying
privatisation could lead to the first outbreaks of cholera in Scotland for
160 years.
Anxieties have even been voiced by prominent Conservative councillors, while
a System Three opinion poll early in September showed only 4 per cent in
favour of water services being privatised. Only 9 per cent of Tory
supporters polled favoured privatisation.
Mr Lang says water and sewerage in Scotland will have to be restructured for
two reasons. First, local government is to be reorganised with the
introduction by 1996 of a single-tier system to replace the nine regional
councils, 53 district councils and three single-tier island councils. Mr
Lang has suggested that between 15 and 51 new authorities would be set up.
Second, very heavy expenditure will be needed over the next 10 to 15 years
to comply with EC directives on drinking water, sewerage and beaches.
Meeting those requirements will cost Pounds 2.5bn in Scotland, and
maintenance, upgrading and improving unsatisfactory sewage discharges could
cost a further Pounds 2.5bn. Local authorities are already investing Pounds
703m over the three years to 1994-95.
Given the spending required, says Mr Lang, it is only sensible to see how
the private sector could provide capital, and thus avoid swelling the public
sector borrowing requirement.
But he must be aware that he has stepped into a hornet's nest. Scots believe
that the water which rains down from their skies and creates Scotland's
lochs is a gift from God. Furthermore they are mostly unaware that they pay
for it to be supplied to their homes as the water charge is incorporated in
their poll tax payments.
Privatisation is in any case regarded with suspicion in Scotland, and most
Scots are aware that the flotation of the 10 water companies in England and
Wales has been followed by much higher water bills - the average annual
water charge in England and Wales is Pounds 169 compared with Pounds 108 in
Scotland.
Furthermore at least 22,000 households south of the border have had their
water disconnected for not paying their bills, and many directors of the new
water companies have had vast salary increases.
In Scotland, Lord Ewing points out, it was the installation of water and
sewerage services that led to the creation of the first municipal councils
in the mid 19th century. 'Ever since those days no local authority could
disconnect water supplies to collect a debt - even with poll tax debts.'
It is hard for the government to defend its position because its water
policy has yet to be decided. Quayle Munro, which advised the Scottish
Office on privatising the Scottish Bus Group, recently delivered its report
and a consultation document is being prepared.
One option is likely to be the creation of around three water companies for
different areas to run water and sewerage and to finance investment.
These could be floated on the Stock Exchange, and a quango equivalent to
England's National Rivers Authority could be formed.
Another option would be to keep ownership of water services under council
control, albeit with restructuring because of the reorganisation of local
government. The operation of water services could be franchised to private
companies which would finance investment.
Another possibility would be to allow businesses such as construction
companies to finance and build new installations, and charge fees to the
public-sector water authorities for their use.
Mr Henry McLeish, a Labour frontbench spokesman on Scotland, argues that
water is a natural monopoly which ought to be left in the hands of local
authorities.
'We don't dispute the need for Pounds 5bn investment over 10 to 15 years,'
he says. 'We accept that water charges will have to rise to help pay for it.
But we don't want the higher charges to swell the profits of private
companies. The Treasury should allow the councils to borrow the extra money
needed.'
For Mr Lang the problem is that if he rejects privatisation outright it will
look like capitulation to the opposition, even though he did not propose a
sell-off in the first place.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Doubt over engineering groups' investment plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a small proportion of UK engineering companies have devised investment
strategies which will allow them to develop their core businesses and come
out of the recession in a strong position, according to a survey.
Beddows, the international consultancy, says the UK economic and legislative
environment is hindering companies from making key strategic investments.
'High interest rates mean a high cost of capital and a squeeze on cash
availability - two factors which have been preventing even investments with
good levels of return,' says the Beddows study.
'This, coupled with the impact of restructuring during the recession, places
a significant question mark against the potential for this sector to benefit
from any economic upturn.'
The survey is based on interviews with senior managers from 20 companies
with annual sales exceeding Pounds 25m each, along with analysts and
industry commentators. It will give ammunition to those arguing that the
recession is harming the engineering sector's ability to respond to
long-term factors such as internationalisation of markets, focus on core
businesses and technological change.
Beddows says a third of the companies surveyed had increased their
investments - which include everything from capital projects to new product
development - during the past five years, while 22 per cent reported a
decrease.
But the base levels of investment have been low for some time, says the
study. It adds that patterns of investment are changing, with most of it
geared to the removal of excess capacity and short-term survival.
Apart from high interest rates, managers believe that, amid intense
international competition, UK companies suffer from not being granted some
of the tax advantages which assist their competitors elsewhere. The study
also warns of the danger that the devaluation of sterling will lull some
companies into a sense of false security on the need for new investment.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Whitehall averts earmuff war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Whitehall staff due to transfer to the private sector in
contracting-out deals will have the right to claim tropical kit, earmuffs
and fur hats from their new employers.
An internal memo to the NUCPS Civil Service union reports the Treasury
Solicitor's advice that companies which win contracts to provide public
services will usually have to honour all 11,099 paragraphs of the
three-volume Civil Service code that documents staff terms and conditions of
employment.
Civil servants had feared they would lose their rights to allowances under
the code. When working anywhere in the tropics or tropical conditions they
can claim for special kit, but they may claim their Pounds 10 for earmuffs
or the hire of a fur hat only when working in Moscow or St Petersburg.
Closer to home, the code allows staff to claim 80 per cent of the fees for
studying with the Open University and take special leave for training
courses in youth leadership.
Many of the terms in the code are comparable with what the best
private-sector employers offer, but the NUCPS said it was 'delighted' with
the Treasury Solicitor's advice because it believed 'a lot of cowboys will
be scared off'.
The memo is certainly cold comfort for contractors who have usually sought
to meet efficiency targets by cutting wage costs. Some companies are likely
to be deterred from bidding for contracts because about 80 per cent of the
cost of government services is labour.
Potential contract bidders have been warned about a European directive which
means that they will not normally be able to cut the pay and conditions of
staff trans-ferring to the private sector and that they may also be liable
for accumulated redundancy pay.
The government had argued the Acquired Rights directive only protects staff
transferring between 'commercial ventures', but last week it amended the UK
regulations in line with the view of the European Commission that all staff
are covered.
In accepting that the UK regulations did not comply with the directive the
government may have opened the way for thousands of claims for damages from
those who have lost jobs, pay and conditions in contracting out since 1983.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Property warning on corporate borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLINE in commercial property values could force corporate borrowing to
fall by a third over the coming year, the Centre for Economics and Business
Research, an economic consultancy, says in a report.
The document is one of the first attempts to study the impact of commercial
property prices on corporate economic activity. It finds a 'strong link'
between company borrowings and property prices and suggests that a further
10 per cent drop in property prices would reduce corporate borrowing by
Pounds 9.7bn over two years.
Mr Douglas McWilliams, the report's author, concludes that companies are
unlikely to resume borrowing on a significant scale until 1995 at the
earliest. 'This will hold back economic growth and make a recovery in
industrial capacity more difficult to achieve,' he says.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which commissioned the report,
said it would use the research to convince policymakers of the wider
economic implications of changing commercial property values.
The report says commercial property values strongly influence the
willingness of banks to make loans and the willingness of companies to take
on extra debt. Property, which represents 44 per cent of the non-financial
assets in corporate balance sheets, comprises a large part of the security
for corporate borrowing.
A further effect on the economy from falling commercial property prices
stems from the impact of low levels of corporate borrowing on monetary
growth, the report says.
A depressed level of corporate borrowing would also mean that companies
would have to raise their profit margins to fund the investments they need
to be internationally competitive.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Pay squeeze in public sector to include MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS FACE the prospect of a small pay rise or a freeze next year as Whitehall
officials confirmed yesterday that they could be subject to the same
pressure on pay as other public-sector workers.
Salaries for MPs, now Pounds 30,854, usually increase in line with those of
senior civil servants, and were expected to rise by 3.9 per cent from
January.
But the Treasury is anxious that MPs should not be exempt from the financial
curbs it will place on Whitehall departments. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, is expected to allow room in Thursday's Autumn Statement for pay
rises for public-sector workers of, at best, 2 per cent and perhaps zero.
The pay review bodies which recommend rises for groups such as teachers and
nurses will not be suspended, but their recommendations are likely to be
overruled if they breach the Treasury's strictures on finances.
Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, will
meet Conservative backbenchers before the Autumn Statement to brief them on
the economic background against which spending and pay decisions have been
taken. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will meet other Tory MPs tomorrow.
One senior Whitehall official said yesterday: 'Because something is going to
happen to public-sector pay in the Autumn Statement, something is going to
have to happen to MPs' pay as well.' Future decisions are uncertain as civil
servants' pay, on which MPs' salaries are based, is moving towards the
increased use of performance pay.
Any decision would almost certainly have to be approved by the Commons. By
tradition MPs are given a free vote on the issue, but the economic
background against which the decision will be taken could mean the
government faces comparatively little difficulty in winning support for a
low or zero settlement.
One senior backbencher described a pay freeze for MPs as 'eminently
sensible', adding: 'It would certainly set the right sort of example.'
Many MPs were embarrassed by the row which erupted before the summer recess
over increases in their allowances for office services. The government was
defeated in its efforts to keep the rise to Pounds 4,000 by MPs who voted to
increase allowances by Pounds 11,000. That might persuade them to accept
smaller pay rises.
Cohse, the health-service union, says in a report today that, contrary to
government claims, public-sector workers - particularly health workers -
have not been pulling ahead of private industry on the pay front.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Revamped authorities 'will deter potential councillors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS, the self-employed and others with business experience will be
deterred from becoming councillors if plans to reform local authorities go
ahead, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body, says today.
It says in a report that the move to replace the two levels of local
government which exist in most of England and Wales with single-tier
authorities will reduce the number of councillors.
This will inevitably increase the workload of those who remain, making local
government too time-consuming for many potential candidates and undermining
the government's aim of attracting more able and experienced outsiders on to
councils.
The report also predicts that reducing the number of councillors will
heighten partisanship in local government and give the political parties a
tighter grip on town-hall politics.
This points to the demise of the independent councillor, who is most likely
to succeed in smaller councils.
Research carried out for the report shows that local authorities are already
experimenting with streamlining council business. The methods include small
executive boards of councillors acting as a sort of cabinet.
This has often not been balanced, however, by a worthwhile role for
'backbench' and opposition-party councillors. Among the options being
considered are select committees to scrutinise the executive, and area-based
management committees with ward councillors taking more decisions.

FT  09 NOV 92 / CBI revives its script for recovery / A look at industry's
call for action on a well-rehearsed programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW partnership between industry, government and the City to rebuild
Britain's manufacturing base and to eliminate the country's trade deficit is
called for today by the Confederation of British Industry.
Its blueprint to revive what it describes as the UK's 'economic backbone'
covers a great deal of well-rehearsed territory, with its thinly veiled
criticisms of the banks and the Department of Trade and Industry, and calls
for a new consensus and fresh priorities.
The employer's organisation has been calling for a tripartite programme of
co-operation to rebuild the manufacturing sector since the downturn began.
Now it believes its message has been given added urgency by the
record-breaking recession.
In its report, Making It In Britain, the CBI's national manufacturing
council acknowledges that some progress was achieved during the 1980s in a
sector that employs 10m people, accounts for 70 per cent of exports and
contributes Pounds 100bn to the nation's gross domestic product.
But in spite of improvements in output, productivity, export share and
investment, the document repeats the sad saga of Britain's continuing
failure to climb the league of international competitiveness. One of the
authors says: 'We have some of the best manufacturing companies but we still
have too many of the worst.'
The report identifies the poor image of manufacturing as one of industry's
main problems. It claims the sector still suffers from a Victorian image of
smoke-stacks and metal-bashing. 'Until it can show that industry represents
an exciting, rewarding and challenging career, it will struggle to attract
the country's best young people.'
The national manufacturing council sets a number of targets to be achieved
by the year 2000. These include: an increase in national productivity of
more than five per cent each year; investment in plant and machinery to
double per employee from the present Pounds 2,000 a year; an increase of 1
per cent in the UK's proportion of world exports; and a drive to replace
imports with UK-manufactured goods.
The report accepts that, in spite of industry's criticisms of Whitehall and
the City, the prime responsibility for improving manufacturing performance
lies with companies. It calls on them to do more to establish a clear sense
of strategic direction, to exploit new markets more rapidly, to place
emphasis on innovation and to communicate strategy more effectively to the
financial community.
Inevitably, much of the case for new thinking is directed at Whitehall and
the City. Apart from the now ritualistic calls for a more listening
government, the CBI wants conditions for sustainable growth - low inflation
and low interest rates. Its request for accompanying stable exchange rates
looks fanciful after British withdrawal from the ERM, a discipline which the
CBI supported but over which it now appears ambivalent.
The CBI also calls for enhanced tax allowances to boost the introduction of
new technology and energy-saving and pollution-control equipment. It wants
the government to continue to cut the overall tax burden on business - still
seen as high by international standards, in spite of lower corporate tax
rates.
The report revives some familiar criticisms of the City. It points out that
banks increased property lending by 800 per cent in the 1980s while advances
to manufacturing clients rose by only 50 per cent.
Institutional pressure to cough up on dividends meant that dividend growth
averaged 12 per cent annually in the 1980s, while profits rose by six per
cent and investment by only 2 per cent a year.
The banks, concludes the report, should take 'a more strategic view on
criteria for long-term lending'.
The CBI wants to see more effective partnerships between investors and
industry that would recognise the investment attractions of manufacturing,
ease pressure for excessive dividends and develop more packages for small
and medium-sized companies.
The logic of the CBI's case seems sound, and the renewed weakness of the
British economy suggests that its appraisal goes to the heart of many of
British manufacturing's problems. Whether its latest effort can help trigger
the type of critical sea-change in British attitudes towards manufacturing
that so far has stubbornly failed to materialise is much more difficult to
judge.

FOOD and drink prices might rise by up to 14 per cent at the end of the year
following the fall in the value of the pound, the Food and Drink Federation,
which represents manufacturers, said yesterday.
It explained that there was likely to be a sudden rise in prices of
ingredients because EC farm prices would be changed on January 1 - when the
European single market takes effect - to take account of the devaluation of
sterling. 'We had hoped that the price increases could be phased in after
January 1,' the federation said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party has accused the government of missing an opportunity to use
Thursday's Autumn Statement to boost jobs, investment, training and
education, Ralph Atkins writes.
As the party prepares today to launch its 'national recovery programme' it
is anxious to draw maximum political capital from the curbs to be imposed on
public spending.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will call for cuts in interest rates, an
employment package, a co-ordinated European recovery policy and tax
incentives for industry.
He will also stress Labour's commitment to boosting co-operation between the
private and public sectors on infrastructure projects amid signs that the
government will steal some of the party's political clothes with its own
proposals for joint projects.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said yesterday that the Autumn
Statement would consist of 'betrayed pledges and broken promises'. It would
mark 'lost opportunities for education, for training, for investment, for
transport infrastructure and much else'.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the health department would
try to disguise cuts planned in its spending by 'tricks' including
deliberately underestimating health-service inflation.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Confidence low in east Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in the east Midlands have given up hope of any improvement
in trading conditions over the next six months, a survey of more than 900
businesses has found.
The survey by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and Nottingham
Business School shows that only nine per cent of the businesses predict an
immediate improvement in business conditions. Indeed, 59 per cent of
companies believe they have not yet experienced the worst of the recession.
The study, published today, finds the faltering confidence of the business
community is set against a background of falling profitability, persistent
reductions in employment and uncertainty about future exchange-rate policy.
The survey shows that a reduction in interest rates is the main priority for
more than 80 per cent of the business leaders canvassed. This concern is
echoed in the attitude towards the withdrawal of sterling from the European
exchange rate mechanism in September.
More than 70 per cent feel that the withdrawal will be beneficial for their
business because they believe it clears the way for cuts in interest rates.
But there are divisions over the future management of sterling. Although 34
per cent favour a return to the exchange rate mechanism at some time, six
per cent want a return at the earliest opportunity and 38 per cent would
prefer a floating currency with interest rates at between 5 per cent and 7
per cent.
The value of sterling does not appear to be a matter of great concern, with
only 20 per cent of the sample favouring a lower exchange rate. There is
much greater anxiety about the future of the housing market, where 46 per
cent believe a revival is a prerequisite for recovery.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Watchdog bitten by both sides: A regulator caught in the
coal battle crossfire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, finds himself
caught in the crossfire of the battle over coal, and he may not escape
unscathed.
If the harrying he received at a Commons inquiry last week is anything to go
by, he is in for a rough time and could even, some observers speculate, be
edged out of a job. MPs from both sides of the House accused him of dragging
his feet, copping out and taking a blinkered view of his responsibilities.
The clash exposed sharply conflicting views of the role of the regulator.
Many MPs had hoped that Prof Littlechild, with his powerful position in the
electricity industry, could provide a convenient solution to the coal crisis
by forcing electricity generators to burn more coal or by cancelling their
plans to build gas-fired power stations. But Prof Littlechild takes a
different view.
He has stuck doggedly to his position that his statutory responsibility is
to protect the electricity consumer and not the coal industry. He has
repeatedly stressed that his brief does not run to saving miners' jobs, let
alone dictating where power stations should be built or what sort of fuel
they should use.
'Responsibility for the closures lies with the secretary of state and
British Coal,' he says simply. That was typical of the professor of commerce
at Birmingham University who has headed Offer, the Office of Electricity
Regulation, since it was formed in 1989.
He is an outright free-marketeer who was selected for the job by the
Thatcher government because of his belief that competition would foster the
most efficient power industry. While he sympathises with those who would be
hurt by the threatened pit closures, he does not intend to intervene. He
does not believe that the Electricity Act, which lays out his
responsibilities, authorises him to do so.
People who know Prof Littlechild well do not doubt the firmness of his
beliefs - which raises the questions of whether he has become an obstacle to
a political solution to the coal crisis.
Based in Birmingham, Prof Littlechild can afford to be remote from the
political process. He has not even met Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, who is grappling with the coal problem, though for some
people this is a welcome sign of his independence.
However, he is not totally insulated from politics. He has already said that
he will bring forward an inquiry which he is conducting into the relative
merits of gas and coal so that the results can be fed into Mr Heseltine's
policy review. He has also appointed an assessor to see whether electricity
generators are unfairly shutting down coal-fired stations.
Prof Littlechild stands in the government's way in another sense. One
possibility for boosting coal would be to delay the deregulation of the
electricity industry and slow the growth of other fuels such as gas. But
Prof Littlechild is not only personally committed to seeing the deregulation
process through, he maintains that the Electricity Act obliges him to do so.
So any change in the regulatory timetable would require a big shift in his
position, or new legislation. In either case, he might well have to go.
The government's mishandling of electricity privatisation and the resulting
distortions in the power market have raised serious doubts about the value
of his role. There are widespread complaints about rising prices, monopoly
practices in the generating industry and exorbitant pay for electricity
company executives. If Prof Littlechild has to be sacrificed on the altar of
coal, it is hard to see who would run to his rescue.
One idea that is gaining popularity among MPs is an Energy Commission to set
energy policy and oversee the regulators. This would oblige the regulators
to adhere to a government line rather than acting independently.
'It is clear that MPs would prefer a more interventionist approach,' says Mr
John Wilson, utilities analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house.
He believes that investors may be nervous about electricity shares
legislation may be changed.
Prof Littlechild is also unpopular with MPs because they think he is in
effect making policy decisions which impinge on the lives of millions - in
fact, usurping parliament's role. That may be so, but it is not necessarily
something for which Prof Littlechild can be blamed.
The job of electricity regulator is the result of the government's policy in
the late 1980s to phase out state intervention in the energy industry and to
appoint an independent figure to protect the consumer. Now, that arrangement
has become inconvenient for Westminster. The government finds that it needs
a policy to save coal, but the regulator says that is none of his affair.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Businesses criticise fees of advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY solicitors, accountants and banks overcharge their corporate clients
and provide an inadequate service, a survey of large and medium-sized UK
companies has found.
The survey of 200 senior executives by Gallup for Eversheds, the national
law firm, showed that 25 per cent had recently considered or were
considering changing their professional advisers.
Banks were the most heavily criticised. Only 12 per cent of the executives
said their banks had provided better service than solicitors and accountants
over the past year.
Complaints about advisers focused on overcharging, repeated mistakes and
lack of personal contact.
Only just over half of the companies felt they were being charged reasonable
fees. Accountants were considered to be overcharging by more than 40 per
cent of the sample, banks by 47 per cent and solicitors by 48 per cent.
A third of the companies surveyed have changed their solicitors in the past.
Companies thinking of changing their lawyers most frequently cited poor
advice or inefficient service and high and rising costs as reasons.
The survey found that executives felt regional law firms provided the best
value for money, the most efficient service and the best working
relationships.
Only 6 per cent felt London law firms provided the best value for money.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Payout near on Maxwell life policy: Pounds 6.5m no-liability
offer likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL insurance companies are understood to have agreed an out-of-court
settlement involving a Pounds 6.5m payout on the death just over a year ago
of Robert Maxwell.
Final agreement is being held up, however, because some insurers involved in
the original policy are arguing about the cause of Maxwell's death.
Under the terms of the policy - broked by Willis Wrightson, the subsidiary
of Willis Corroon - the full claim of Pounds 20m was payable if Maxwell died
from accidental causes or murder.
But most of the 150 insurers involved in the policy - mainly Lloyd's
syndicates and London market companies - are now thought to be in favour of
paying out Pounds 6.5m without accepting liability.
Insurance companies and the main beneficiaries have disagreed for months
about the cause of Maxwell's death. The main beneficiaries are two companies
in the private Maxwell business empire - Robert Maxwell Group and Headington
Investments, which are in administration - and the public companies Mirror
Group Newspapers, which is trading, and Maxwell Communication Corporation,
which is in administration.
The proposed settlement, which is believed to have the firm backing of 75
per cent of the insurers and beneficiaries, has been agreed as a way of
avoiding a potentially long and costly legal battle.
Some companies still holding out against the revised settlement could opt
for court action, but insurance sources believe this unlikely because of the
costs involved and the uncertain outcome.
Some companies have argued that the policy is invalidated because Maxwell
said he had no health problems.
According to Maxwell's doctors, he was healthy before starting his final
cruise. But he is known to have had part of one lung removed, and had been
suffering for years from fluid and respiratory ailments.
Loss adjusters acting for the insurers remain convinced that the most likely
cause of Maxwell's death was suicide, but investigators acting for the
beneficiaries believe he drowned after accidentally falling into the sea.
Accountants pursuing the assets of the Maxwell empire have identified a
further property which they are preparing to sell.
Buchler Phillips, administrators to Maxwell's personal estate, have asked
property agents and auctioneers Weatherbys to organise the sale of a large
apartment block owned by Maxwell and his wife Betty in the French ski resort
of Tignes.
No price has yet been fixed although the final asking price for the flats is
expected to be between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m.
The building consists of six apartments bought over several years and
consolidated into one property. It is thought that Buchler Phillips and Mrs
Maxwell have yet to agree on how the proceeds of the building should be
shared.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Auditors 'inhibited' by client pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE from clients is inhibiting many accountancy firms from qualifying
accounts or voicing reservations about the figures in them, says a survey of
492 small and medium-sized firms carried out for the Management Information
Centre.
Thirty-two per cent of the firms said they felt such inhibitions in the
present economic climate.
Thirty-eight per cent said client pressure inhibited the honest assessment
of whether a company was a going concern, while 79 per cent said that making
a judgment on whether a company was a going concern was an increasing
problem.
Twenty-eight of the firms also admitted that they employed staff who were
'not competent in the use of audit procedures'. That disclosure came in
answer to the question of whether firms were worried about the inspections
under the audit regulation requirements introduced last year. Most said that
they were. Assets and liabilities should appear in company balance sheets
even if there is doubt about how to measure them, the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. The comments come in a
submission to the Accounting Standards Board from the Financial Reporting
and Auditing Group of the institute in response to two draft documents on
the framework for new accounting standards.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Depressing growth prospect of a US-EC trade war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD ECONOMY is not suffering from a 1930s-style depression.
Nonetheless, the parallels between then and now are worrying, not least the
apparent willingness of US and EC governments to risk a collapse of the
world trading system and a descent into tit-for-tat protectionism.
A transatlantic trade war is not yet under way, but the signs are ominous.
US and EC negotiators are reported to be willing to keep talking to solve
the row over EC oilseed subsidies. But preparations for war are progressing.
The US has announced its intention to impose 200 per cent duties on Dollars
300m (Pounds 193.5m) of EC white wines and farm goods in a month. The French
trade minister, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, plans to ask the EC to compile a
list of US products for retaliation.
Would a US-EC trade war threaten a slide into a 1930s-style depression? The
Great Depression was undoubtedly prolonged and deepened by protectionism.
The Smoot-Hawley tariff, instituted by the US in 1930, sparked a rise in
tariff barriers in virtually every country, often reinforced by quantitative
restrictions. Protectionism combined with falling output and prices to cause
a spiralling collapse in the value of world trade. The value of world trade
collapsed from Dollars 3bn a month in January 1929 to less than Dollars 1bn
a month by 1933, as the chart shows.
There is still widespread disagreement about the underlying cause of the
Great Depression. Different explanations stress the collapse in demand
caused by the 1929 US stock market crash, the effects on confidence and the
availability of credit of the US banking crises of the early 1930s and the
combination of widespread debts and the deflationary monetary policies which
the gold standard exchange rate regime required in Europe, despite
contracting output and trade. The UK left the gold standard in September
1931 and subsequently experienced a considerably smaller output decline.
Yet the collapse in trade was not the root cause of the Depression. The US
suffered the deepest recession of any developed country - real US output
fell by a third - and its resort to protectionism was largely to blame for
spreading this contraction across the world. But trade played a small role
in the US decline. Exports constituted 7 per cent of gross national product
in 1929 and declined by 1.5 per cent of 1929 GNP over the next two years
while the real value of US GNP fell by 10 times more in the same period.
Despite the current gloom, the world economy is still a long way from
suffering an economic collapse on a 1930s scale. Between 1929 and 1932, the
GDP of the advanced developed countries fell by 17.1 per cent, world trade
in manufactures fell by 40 per cent and world prices fell by 6 per cent a
year. Developing countries were also badly affected. Between 1929 and 1932,
they suffered a 12 per cent fall in GDP. Output subsequently rose by 34 per
cent between 1932 and 1937 but trade expansion contributed only 6.6
percentage points of this growth, according to the World Bank.
Confidence today is certainly depressed in almost all developed countries,
while many countries have indebted consumers and banks with shaky balance
sheets. But the monetary authorities, at least in US and Japan and more
recently in the UK, have eased monetary policy, while world output, trade
and prices are rising.
But it is the eastern European countries that are suffering falls in output
and incomes on a depression scale. For these countries, and also for
developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America which saw their
average incomes per head fall in the 1980s, an outbreak of world
protectionism would be a disaster. The Bank expects rising real incomes per
head in Africa and Latin America as well as East Asia in the 1990s, but
these projections assume a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
The world is not threatened by a depression to rival the 1930s'. Even so, a
trade war now would deepen the world's current economic problems. For
developed and developing countries alike, a descent into protectionism is a
depressing prospect.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday said it would devalue the shekel by more than 10 per cent
over the next year and announced a package of tax cuts as part of the Labour
government's efforts to encourage export growth and investment, writes Hugh
Carnegy in Jerusalem.
An immediate 3 per cent rise in the shekel's target, or median, rate against
a basket of currencies to 2.9250 will be followed by a further 8 per cent
rise over the next 12 months. This continues a policy of a pre-announced
diagonal devaluation schedule intended to cut out speculative currency flows
and give exporters stable exchange rates.

FT  09 NOV 92 / MacSharry stresses need for restart of US-EC oilseed talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SLIGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SLIGO is the home town of Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner.
It was here that he was schooled in Irish politics and where he still
retreats for weekends away from the pressures of world farm trade
negotiations and Brussels bureaucracy.
The 140-mile journey from Dublin can be a tortuous drive, slowed by heavy
traffic and road works, but hoardings along the way identify the road
projects as financed from EC structural funds, part of a nationwide and
much-needed road improvement scheme.
Once you are there, however, the tranquillity of the views over the Atlantic
Ocean dispel the anger induced by the ubiquitous cattle trucks which seem to
have a queue of cars weaving in frustration behind them wherever they go.
Mr MacSharry set the cat among the pigeons in Brussels last week by
withdrawing as the EC negotiator in the farm trade talks with the US, then
beat a tactical retreat to Sligo while Mr Jaques Delors, EC Commission
president, took the heat for the breakdown in the talks.
He acceded to an interview to clarify the point at which the EC-US
negotiations have stalled. It was conducted in his black Mercedes limousine,
which comes with his job as commissioner. 'The house is full of Fianna Fail
people getting ready for the election campaign,' he apologised.
Never once referring to Mr Delors by name he said: 'My only concern, and I
want to stress and underline this, is that the US and the EC should come to
agreement as quickly as is possible on the outstanding point in agriculture
and get back to Geneva so that they can wrap it all up among the 108
countries before the end of the year. That is my only concern in the whole
affair.
'There is an amazing responsibility on the shoulders of all those directly
concerned, and particularly the bosses, to get on with the job,' he said.
'My only concern has been to do my part. We've brought (the negotiations) to
the stage where they can be concluded. It is necessary to do so now in the
interest of the world economy to help it out of recession.'
Discussing his decision not to continue as EC negotiator in talks with the
US, Mr MacSharry said: 'I have not resigned from the post of EC agriculture
commissioner. There are numerous responsibilities attached to (that job),
one of which is international negotiations on agricultural matters. That
responsibility I have asked the president to carry out. So it's a matter for
the president. I am satisfied that I have made my contribution. Now it is
just a matter of finalising the details and all together must do that and do
that quickly.'
Expressing optimism that agreement can be reached with the US, he said: 'Of
course there are differences, they want to get their way the same as the
Community wants to get its way. . . but the differences are slight enough.'
He pinpointed US insistence on oilseed tonnage rather than acreage limits as
the final hurdle to be cleared in the talks.
'To comply with the Gatt panel which has found against the (oilseeds export
subsidy) regime in operation in the EC, we are prepared in the context of
the Gatt negotiations. . . to extrapolate the oilseeds sector out separately
from the arable crops sector and treat it separately. . . to identify it as
a single sector,' he said.
This would imply that acreage limits on oilseeds would be negotiable, a
significant departure from the previous EC stance which treated the arable
crops sector as one package.
Asked whether the offer to separate out oilseeds from the arable crops
sector had led to the row with Mr Delors, Mr MacSharry said he did want to
become involved in personality clashes. 'Of course there are governments
that do not like the reform of the CAP and maybe would like that it would go
away, but it won't go away,' he said.
He insisted that the oilseeds offer to the US had been made in the context
of the CAP reform package. 'Outside of that I will not go because I have
made a solid commitment to the governments and the farmers, that we would
not ask that they pay twice - first to reform the CAP and secondly to comply
with Gatt obligations, so therefore we will do it the context of the reform
of the CAP,' he said.
Mr MacSharry declined to say whether he would resume his role of negotiator
if requested. 'It is a matter for the president (Delors). He allocates the
responsibilities. . . I am only interested in getting this thing back on the
rails and I think my action has highlighted the importance of it and that in
itself has been a good thing. It is now up to people much higher than me. .
. to see that the job is done.
'In fairness to the United States they have come a long way. . . they are
prepared to move on the four points of concern to the EC, which are lesser
export volume commitments, rebalancing, a proper peace clause, and most
important of all, to accept that the per hectare payments and livestock
premiums under the new CAP reform will not be disciplined and will not be
reduced. So in fairness to the US they have come a long way,' he said.
Mr MacSharry pointed out that the US administration's fast-track trade
negotiating procedure agreed with Congress expires next March, and that to
enable the US to ratify an agreement within that period,a farm trade deal
would have to be concluded rapidly, and an overall Gatt agreement concluded
by the end of the year. 'If it isn't wrapped up by Christmas. . . then we
are talking about another year lost, and where will the world economy be by
then?' he asked.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Tokyo expected to announce resumption of aid to Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government is expected this week to announce the resumption of
yen credits to Iran, ending a 17-year embargo and marking the second
important foreign policy change since the US presidential election, writes
Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
Provision of the fresh credits, apparently Y30bn (Pounds 152m) for a dam and
hydroelectric power project, will follow the government's decision on Friday
to end a 13-year ban on economic aid to Vietnam.
The timing of the two decisions reflects Tokyo's belief that the period
before Governor Bill Clinton's inauguration as president should be used to
announce potentially controversial policy changes.
Japanese companies have wanted the government to resume economic assistance
to Iran, which they believe offers potential for lucrative contracts for
infrastructure work and industrial equipment.
Most Japanese car makers have sharply increased their exports to Iran this
year, while Nissho Iwai, the trading house, has just won an Y8bn contract to
supply oil exploration equipment. Mitsubishi Corp, another trading house,
was part of an international consortium recently awarded rights to develop a
natural gas field.
Japan is aware that the new credits could prompt criticism from the US. The
ban on assistance was maintained in sympathy with US concerns about missing
military personnel in Vietnam.

INTERNATIONAL talks on a peace accord for Cambodia broke down yesterday with
the apparent failure to achieve agreement on disarming the four factions
before general elections next May .
'Time is running out on the implementation of the Paris accords,' said Mr
Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister, who co-chairs the Paris
International Conference on Cambodia with Mr Roland Dumas, the French
foreign minister. 'I would be less than truthful if I did not say that we
could not get full consensus on removing the obstacles to implementing the
accord,' Mr Alitas said. The foremost objective at 'this rather serious
stage of development' was to ensure the situation in Cambodia did not
relapse into renewed fighting, he added.
Mr Dumas said if no agreement was reached, the substance of the Paris
agreement was in jeopardy. Both co-chairmen made clear the main obstacle was
still the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to disarm.
Other Cambodian factions, who have already laid down their weapons, are
threatening to rearm unless the Maoist guerrillas step into line and allow
UN peacekeepers into their zones. The Khmer Rouge signed the accord with the
Vietnamese-installed government in October last year, ending almost 13 years
of civil war but it has since violated the accord in almost every aspect.
The three other Cambodian factions on the governing Supreme National Council
(SNC) have co-operated with UN peacekeepers in the run-up to elections. They
want the UN to abandon its disarmament plan, which they say would weaken
them if the Khmer Rouge renewed its military offensive. Cambodia's prime
minister, Hun Sen, has called for the expulsion of the Khmer Rouge from the
SNC, which comprises leaders of the four factions and works with the UN.
Khieu Samphan, a Khmer Rouge leader, joined yesterday's talks hosted by
Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chairman of the SNC. Also attending the
meetings were the five permanent members of the UN Security Council,
representatives from Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Germany and Australia,
which initiated the peace process adopted by the UN and the four Cambodian
factions.
They were joined by Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister,
who said: 'The situation in Cambodia is obviously still very fragile, but
the fact that these talks are taking place in Beijing gives us all, I think,
ground for optimism that a way can be found through the present
difficulties.'

FT  09 NOV 92 / South Korea and Japan seek thaw in relations

SOUTH KOREA and Japan yesterday sought to thaw a recent chill in their
relations and to promote closer co-operation on issues affecting North-east
Asia.
Meeting in Kyoto, Japan, the South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and Japanese
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa held the first of planned regular bilateral
discussions, modelled after the informal Franco-German consultations.
South Korea is trying to establish a new diplomatic role in the region,
serving as an intermediary in reducing tensions between Japan, China and
Russia.
Conflicts among these regional powers have harmed Korea over the past 400
years. But Seoul's recent overtures to China and Russia have caused problems
with Japan, South Korea's former colonial master.
The establishment of Sino-South Korean relations in August raised concerns
in Tokyo about the emergence of a possible alliance against Japanese
influence in the region.
The decision by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Seoul this month
after cancelling his trip to Japan over the Kurile Island dispute has added
to those fears.
South Korean officials said that President Roh wanted to reassure Japan of
Korean friendship in the wake of these diplomatic developments and to show
both Beijing and Moscow that Seoul-Tokyo relations remain close and
co-operative.
South Korea needs Japanese co-operation in forcing North Korea to accept
on-the-spot inspections of possible nuclear weapons facilities.
Japan has indicated that it will not normalise relations or promote economic
ties with Pyongyang until the nuclear issue is resolved.
But South Korea and Japan appeared to have made little progress yesterday in
settling their bilateral problems, including Korea's trade deficit with
Japan and financial compensation for the Japanese use of Korean women as
military prostitutes, or 'comfort girls', during the second world war.
South Korea's trade deficit with Japan this year is likely to be twice as
big as its total trade deficit of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.92bn). South Korea
relies heavily on Japan for machinery and industrial components.
The trade deficit would be even bigger if it was not for import restrictions
that South Korea places on Japanese products. Seoul is demanding that Japan
help reduce the persistent trade deficit by transferring technology to Korea
and increasing Korean imports through tariff cuts.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Yeltsin's UK talks to focus on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of Russia's economic reforms and ways to prevent a slide into
anarchy or civil war will be at the centre of talks President Boris Yeltsin
will have with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in London today.
Mr Yeltsin, who rallied democratic forces after the failed coup of August
1991, is under pressure to give stronger support to his reformist
government, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, which faces a strong challenge from
former communists and extreme nationalists at next month's session of the
Congress of People's Deputies.
In his entourage is Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of
foreign economic relations. In an interview before leaving Moscow, Mr
Shokhin revealed that Russia's reformers were pressing Mr Yeltsin to resist,
and threatening to resign if the conservatives were appeased.
Mr Yeltsin's first official visit to London, where he will lunch with the
Queen, address parliament and make a speech at the Stock Exchange, gives him
temporary respite from daunting domestic problems. These include ethnic
conflicts on Russia's southern borders, demands for autonomy from some of
the Russian Federation's most resource-rich regions, such as Tatarstan and
Sakha (the former autonomous region of Yakutia), and counter-pressures from
nationalists and military men. They want credits for military industry and
greater protection for 25m ethnic Russians, who have become foreigners in
the Baltic and other former Soviet states.
Mr Shokhin warned that easier credits for loss-making state industries, and
other measures proposed by the Civic Union, the most powerful
anti-government force, 'would cancel out the Gaidar cabinet's ideology. If
these measures are approved by parliament or the president, then in
accordance with civilised norms, we would have to go.'
He believed the Civic Union leaders had 'overreached themselves' in
demanding a list of resignations, including his own, and those of Mr Anatoly
Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign
minister, and Mr Andrei Nechayev, economics minister. Mr Yeltsin is said to
have been angered by the demands. But it remains a subject of speculation in
Moscow whether he will fight or accommodate the Civic Union challenge.
In London, Mr Yeltsin will receive encouragement to continue with economic
and other reforms. Bilateral ties have improved, and should be enhanced by
the first comprehensive treaty with Russia since 1766. But Mr Yeltsin will
also be looking for more practical, financial help, and closer business
ties.
With honourable exceptions, British business has steered clear of this
difficult market, though UK multinationals such as John Brown, ICI,
Rolls-Royce and several UK-based food companies have set up long-term links.
Shell, BP and British Gas are among UK-based energy companies keen to help
develop Russia's energy resources. For over 20 years the Soviet authorities
sought help from companies such as RTZ to develop the huge but distant
Udokan copper and polymetallic ore-body in Siberia and Mr Yeltsin's team is
expected to revive interest in this and other potential projects.
Bilateral trade remains small, with UK exports to the former Soviet Union
down to Pounds 288m in the first eight months of this year against Pounds
606m in 1990. Prospects for UK exporters have improved, with up to Dollars
500m of ECGD export credit and investment insurance available. Favoured
projects are those self-financed from hard-currency earnings.

FT  09 NOV 92 / A Hamlet forced to stay alive / Obituary of Alexander Dubcek
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AH HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDER Dubcek, who died on Saturday aged 70, believed in the humane,
pre-communist ethos of Czechoslovakia. But he was attached by an umbilical
cord to the Communist party and unable to lead a revolt against the Soviet
Union to its ultimate consequences.
The Prague Spring of 1968 was a misfired attempt to gain self-rule, not full
independence from Moscow. Dubcek had perseverance and skill, but proved too
weak when it came to the crunch, unable to refuse to sign under duress the
document of surrender in the last days of August 1968. His fate was to be a
Hamlet forced to watch the aftermath of his indecision. He rose to power
from an impeccable family background, on the ladder of local and regional
party appointments. A first-class diploma from Moscow's international party
university helped.
Alexander Dubcek was born in 1921 in a Slovak village, the second son of
Stefan Dubcek, a joiner who had emigrated to the US before the first world
war. Stefan returned home after the war and, at about the time Alexander was
born, joined the Communist party as one of its first members. He left again,
this time for the Soviet Union, to join other skilled foreign workers
helping to build communism. Alexander attended school in the Soviet Union.
But in 1938, rather than accept Soviet citizenship, the family returned to
Slovakia. Alexander found work as a locksmith in the Skoda works at Dubnica.
In 1955, he won a place at the Moscow international school for party
high-fliers, spending three years there, years which saw the Soviet Army's
suppression of the Hungarian uprising. Dubcek's further ascent, to
secretaryship of the Bratislava party organisation, came because of his
apparent docility and non-dangerous ability. His decisive promotion, to
first secretaryship of the Slovak Communist party and a sort of governorship
of Slovakia, occurred in 1963. Under pressure of an economic slump and
Khrushchev's revelations of Stalin's terror, the party looked for a man who,
unlike President Anton Novotny, had clean hands, liberal inclinations, and
the trust of Moscow.
From 1963 to 1967, recognition that Czechoslovakia's economic crisis was
structural, caused by Soviet exploitation and policies, led - along with
further disclosures of atrocities by Novotny and his secret service in the
1950s - to a gradual isolation of the ruling politburo and, at the end of
1967, to its split into two equally strong factions. One of these pressed
for the removal of Novotny. A stormy party congress, convened in December
1967, elected Dubcek his successor.
Dubcek's intelligence and humility, his halting speech, his broad and ready
smile, made him different from the stupid and cruel communist rulers of the
past. He quickly became popular with communists and non-communists alike.
Press censorship was lifted; travel abroad allowed, and the country seethed
with plans for a sort of market-led socialism, reinstatement of human rights
and, though never officially admitted, a neutral Czechoslovakia. But noise
exceeded action. The party district secretaries remained in control,
blocking real economic reform. Soviet pressure increased; the Soviet
generals saw a chance to move their army into Czechoslovakia to the West
German frontier.
After some resistance, Dubcek agreed to Soviet 'manoeuvres' in his country
and, later, dismissed the only general ready to organise a defence of
Czechoslovakia. Thus the ground was prepared for a walk-over by Soviet
tanks, and for the kidnapping of Dubcek and other reformist political
leaders to Moscow on August 21 1968. After some rough treatment in Moscow,
Dubcek signed a paper legitimising the Soviet invasion and granting the
Soviet Union an enormous tribute in the form of industrial plants and
lorries. Dubcek returned to Prague in tears. He retained his function for a
while, then being moved to Turkey as ambassador. Recalled soon after, he was
given a job in Bratislava's parks, looking after machine equipment.
His failure to say a loud 'no' when in Moscow in August 1968 overshadowed
the memory of his Prague Spring role. In 1989, a new generation of
dissidents who came to power consigned him to the lacklustre post of Federal
Assembly chairman. He continued to play a minor role on the left wing of
Slovak politics, unsuccessfully opposing the split of the federation. He
enters the history of his country as a figure not always admired, but much
loved.

FT  09 NOV 92 / ESA set to cancel manned space plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Space Agency (ESA) is set to announce virtual cancellation of
its manned space programme, as part of a plan to cut spending 18 per cent
over the next three years. Trade and science ministers attending ESA's
ministerial council meeting in Granada, Spain, will be asked to approve a
restructuring marking the end of ESA's five-year-old plan for
self-sufficiency in manned space technology.
Mr Jean-Marie Luton, ESA's director-general, will instead propose a 110m
accounting units outlay to assess the possibilities of a joint
European/Russian shuttle and space station. An accounting unit (AU) used by
ESA is similar in value to an Ecu but related to a wider European currency
basket. ESA's total budget for 1993-1995 will be AU7.7bn under the Luton
plan.
His proposals vindicate UK space policy. Five years ago, the UK refused to
join the manned space programme, preferring to concentrate on Earth
observation satellites. 'Now these programmes are over-subscribed,' Mr
Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's strategy director, said.
Germany has been the driving force behind the cost-cutting effort. As well
as the abandoning of the Hermes manned programme, the German space Agency
Dara insisted on better cost controls. Internal costs account for 6 per cent
of ESA's budget. Cancellation of Hermes and of much of the Columbus manned
space laboratory is a blow to main contractors Aerospatiale and Dassault of
France and MBB-Erno of Germany.
Projects likely to be approved at the meeting:
Polar Orbiting Earth Mission (Poem): two satellites for environmental
monitoring and meteorology costing AU1.8bn and to be launched by the year
2000. Prime contractor: the Anglo-French joint venture Matra-Marconi.
Polar platform: Part of Poem, costing AU700m; prime contractor: British
Aerospace.
Pressurised Module: the only remaining manned project, to be attached to the
US space station Freedom. Cost: AU2.5bn; prime contractors, MBB-Erno and
Aeritalia.
Data Relay Satellite: costing AU950m; allowing information from Poem
satellites to be sent to Europe from the other side of Earth.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Bonn faces bitter dispute on refugees: Debate on dealing
with outsiders brings back bad memories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY today commemorates Kristallnacht, when synagogues and Jewish
businesses were ransacked by the Nazis in 1938. It also celebrates the
collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
However, any sober reflection of these two events has been smothered in an
emotional and bitter dispute between the main political parties about how to
deal with the rapid influx of refugees seeking asylum in the country.
The debate is partly in response to the growing number of assaults by
right-wing extremists on foreigners, as well as increased vandalism of
Holocaust memorials. But it is primarily about the effect unification of the
two Germanys has had on the country's asylum policies.
'We now have an open border to the east,' said an official at the Interior
Ministry. 'We have a border which stretches nearly 1,300 kilometres. It is
impossible to guard this border. Those who cross, mostly from Romania,
Bulgaria, and the former Soviet Union, are claiming political asylum. That
is their right. We cannot turn them back. But many are coming here for
economic reasons,' he added.
The number of people seeking asylum in Germany has swelled over the past
three years, rising from 193,063 in 1990, 256,112 in 1991, to 319,674 for
the first nine months of this year.
The opposition Social Democratic party reckons that if additional refugees
fleeing from the former Yugoslavia (100,000), settlement of the ethnic
Germans from eastern Europe (200,000), unification of families (100,000),
and illegal immigrants (between 100,000 and 200,000) are taken into account,
nearly 1m people will have arrived in Germany by the end of the year.
The strain on the economy is growing, with the Interior Ministry estimating
that shelter for each refugee costs DM15,000 (over Pounds 6,000) a year.
Anyone can claim the right to asylum which is enshrined in article 16 of the
Basic Law, or Constitution, which states that 'persons persecuted on
political grounds shall enjoy the right of asylum.' Only about 5 per cent of
applicants are successful, but it can take three or four years for cases to
be dealt with.
About 30 per cent of those rejected under article 16 eventually claim asylum
under the more liberal terms of the 1951 UN Geneva Convention on the status
of Refugees.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party, and the
opposition SPD, are close to agreeing to amending Article 16 in a way which
would qualify the basis for refugee status. A proposed amendment would
include mention of the Geneva Convention, which defines a refugee as 'any
person fleeing from well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of
race, religion, nationality . . .'
The amendment would also make reference to the European Community evolving a
long-term policy on refugees.
However, at last weekend's annual congress of the Bavarian-based
conservative Christian Social Union, a junior partner in the coalition, it
voted to restrict the right of asylum and to appeal, echoing similar views
held by the Republican party.
According to a recent opinion poll, the latter party could win more than 10
per cent of the vote in an election now.
Whatever amendments are adopted, however, many believe it amounts to a
temporary measure because the government - and the opposition - remain
reluctant to address the fundamental issue: the absence of any immigration
legislation.
Government officials, so far, have ruled out any such law. 'If we had a
quota system, we would no longer be an open country. Our 1949 constitution
would be undermined. Quotas, or any form of selecting immigrants would
recall the Nazi period,' a ministry official said.
In addition Germany does not want to be seen as a country for would-be
immigrants.
Instead, the government may fudge the issue by amending the constitution,
and then later rely on Brussels to draw up plans to restrict the
European-wide flow of refugees.
'This will not solve the problem of how we will be able to cope with more
economic refugees, and genuine refugees coming from the former Soviet Union,
if it becomes more unstable there,' an economist said.

<TEXT>
GERMAN President Richard von Weizsacker was pelted with eggs and stones by
left-wing radicals at a mass rally in Berlin called to protest at the wave
of recent right-wing extremist attacks on asylum seekers.
Riot police held up their shields to protect Mr von Weizsacker, who had to
delay his speech for nearly 10 minutes. When he finally spoke he was
repeatedly interrupted by cat-calls as projectiles thumped against the
police shields.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also at the rally, said later the militants had
'tried to soil the image of people demonstrating peacefully against
violence.
'The mob wanted to damage the worldwide image of Berlin and Germany. They
will not succeed,' he said.
The rally was organised to show solidarity with foreigners in Germany but it
left an impression of a country polarised over the issue of asylum-seekers
and immigrants.
The disruption was provoked by several dozen young anarchists who manoeuvred
themselves to the front of an otherwise peaceful crowd of nearly 300,000
demonstrators.
They unfurled banners accusing Mr Kohl and Mr Weizsacker of hypocrisy in
attending the rally. Acting on orders not to use undue force, the riot
police tried without much success to push them back.
At one point, Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, the former head of the Social Democratic
(SPD) party, was thrown to the ground when he attempted to urge moderation
on the left-wingers. The police moved in with batons and encircled the
demonstrators. Ironically, the brunt of the abuse was borne by President von
Weizsacker, who has been outspoken in his condemnation of radical rightwing
violence. Yesterday he reminded the crowd that today was the anniversary of
a 'fateful German date', the burning of Jewish synagogues in Nazi Germany in
1938.
Mr Kohl, who has been criticised for not forcefully condemning the attacks
on asylum-seekers when they first took place, did not speak at the rally.
The incidents marred an otherwise peaceful display of tolerance by Berliners
and tens of thousands of Germans from east and west who came in special
trains and buses for the rally. Mr Max Streibl, the Bavarian prime minister,
was the sole state leader not to attend the rally.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Mitterrand TV talk on Aids row
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand will tonight try to take the initiative
from the government's critics by staging a television interview on the
recent scandal over the distribution of Aids-tainted blood to haemophiliacs.
This will be his first set-piece television appearance since a marathon
three-hour debate two months ago, shortly before the Maastricht referendum,
and his first since undergoing surgery for cancer of the prostate. It will
therefore give valuable clues to the mental and physical fitness of the
76-year-old president, said by government ministers to be on combative form.
Since he won a narrow victory in the referendum, Mr Mitterrand's popularity
ratings have improved. However, his government is dogged by minor internal
splits, continuing high unemployment and a sluggish economy and faces defeat
in next March's legislative elections.
Mr Mitterrand wants to use today's interview to hit back at criticisms of
Socialist ministers over the Aids scandal, relating to a period in 1985 when
the national blood transfusion service allowed infected blood to be given to
more than 1,200 haemophiliacs.
The president is also likely to face questions on other big issues of the
day, such as the looming trade war with the US and the British decision to
delay ratifying the Maastricht treaty until after Danish ratification.
Mr Mitterrand is also likely to be questioned on possible constitutional
reforms, including giving more influence to France's relatively powerless
parliament and shortening the president's renewable seven-year mandate. He
announced plans for such reforms on television a year ago, since when the
issue has been pushed aside by the debate on European monetary and political
union.

FT  09 NOV 92 / The European Market: East European countries 'should join
Efta before EC' - CEECs should look on the free trade association as a
half-way house, a study says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY, Czechoslovakia and Poland, the three central European countries
with bilateral European Community association agreements, went away from
their London EC summit meeting last month without any agreed timetable for
their full entry into the EC club. Next in line for entry remain the already
prosperous and secure European Free Trade Association countries, whose entry
will boost net contributions to EC coffers.
All three have pencilled in the turn of the century for full entry. But a
new academic study argues that a combination of EC farming interests and the
poorest current EC members will veto enlargement to the east for at least
two decades.
It suggests that the Central and East European Countries (CEECs) should drop
their EC fixation and opt for membership of Efta as a constructive interim
half-way house.
Efta membership 'would counter the economic and political marginalisation
implicit in the bilateral trade deals' that Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland (the Visegrad 3 countries) have signed with the EC. It would also
help enterprises in Efta countries 'to develop business ties in a market
with enormous growth potential', argues Mr Richard Baldwin professor of
economics at the Institut Universitaire des Hautes Etudes Internationales,
Geneva, in an occasional paper to be published by the London-based Centre
for Economic Policy Research.
Both old and new members of an enlarged Efta would find their bargaining
position with the EC improved, including those Efta members like Finland and
Austria which hope to join the EC within the next five to 10 years. But
until now the CEECs, including Romania and Bulgaria which are currently
negotiating Visegrad 3-style association agreements, have been 'afflicted
with tunnel vision' which makes them see EC membership as the only option
worth considering.
'The inescapable reality', however, is that the 100m CEEC citizens (of whom
64m are in the Visegrad 3) are poorer and more agricultural than the 3.5m in
Ireland. On average the CEECs are twice as dependent on agriculture as the
EC and the high and potentially growing level of farm output 'poses many
problems for the Common Agricultural Policy'. This makes an eastern EC
enlargement simply too costly for EC taxpayers and farmers until the CEEC's
get richer or present EC members more generous, he argues.
Joining Efta, however, would hasten the CEEC's entry into the Community. It
would help them to get richer faster and give them a track record in
European integration just as Efta membership in the 1960's helped the UK
overcome European doubts about its 'European-ness'.
While Efta membership would not provide automatic free access to the EC via
the European Economic Area (EEA) 'it is probably the shortest route to the
EEA which should be the CEEC's next step towards EC membership', Mr Baldwin
adds.
Joining Efta should be seen as a proven stepping stone to EC membership,
given the fact that four of the seven applications already accepted by the
EC have been from former Efta countries. However, the Efta countries'
intention to abandon Efta for the EC before the end of the decade, the
CEEC's will have to take the political initiative in seeking Efta
membership.
The most effective approach would be an appeal to self-interest. Efta
members, particularly Austria and Switzerland, already do a higher
proportion of their trade with CEEC countries than most EC countries, while
CEEC trade over the last three years has been expanding much faster than
sales in other markets.
In 1991 the CEEC5 (Visegrad 3 plus Romania and Bulgaria) took 1.6 per cent
of total EC exports but trade grew in double digits compared to the flat 0.1
per cent overall rise in EC exports last year. Although the volume of
Efta-CEEC5 trade is only 25 per cent of EC trade with the area, the five
countries took 2.7 per cent of Efta exports, nearly double the EC average,
while the volume of two trade with Efta rose 70 per cent between 1989-91.
The CEEC5 were particularly important for Austria with 8 per cent of its
total exports going to these markets.
On a final, historical note, Mr Baldwin compares actual trade volumes with
League of Nations trade statistics of 1928 to show how CEEC5 trade with
western Europe would have to expand by 500 per cent to reach the pre-war
levels, before trade was distorted by war and the Soviet takeover of eastern
Europe.
'It is not preposterous' to suggest that these pre-war patterns will
re-establish themselves, he writes. It is a tantalising prospect, and
provides a badly needed note of hope and optimism for a region which until
now has been seen by the EC more as a big problem than a great opportunity.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Bad omens for UN Bosnian relief effort: Troops trying to
protect supply routes are finding the going tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR Nato countries providing full battalions in the latest deployment
of United Nations forces for Bosnian relief must all think they have drawn
the short straw.
The little skirmish which made a party of British army Land Rovers abandon a
route-finding mission some way short of its destination in northern Bosnia
on Saturday morning was a foretaste of hazards ahead.
It was thought to be the first time in Bosnia-Hercegovina's seven-month -war
that UN soldiers had been involved in an exchange of fire. Brig Andrew
Cumming, senior UK commander, said yesterday it was 'not entirely
unexpected'.
Armoured British, French, Canadian and Spanish infantry units all face
difficulties - although of different kinds - along the supply routes they
are detailed to protect this winter.
The UN force of about 6,000 is in addition to 14,000 UN troops already in
Croatia and in Sarajevo.
The French and Canadians were allotted areas adjacent to ones where they
already had peacekeeping battalions in Croatia. For the French, whose 1,360
troops have already moved in with more than 100 armoured vehicles, this
means a stranded Moslem pocket in Bosnia's north-west corner. The 'UN
protected area' surrounding the enclave on the Croatian side is
Serb-controlled territory secured in last year's fighting. On the Bosnian
side the main French base at Bihac faces out onto Serb front lines.
The Canadians, who will have about 1,100 troops in Bosnia, are destined for
the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. The omens are not good. When the UN chose
Sarajevo as its first headquarters in former Yugoslavia (it has since moved
it to Zagreb), it used Banja Luka as a forward transport base. The local
Serb authorities now say the UN has bills outstanding and have obstructed
the initial Canadian deployment.
But the trickiest tasks are probably those confronting the British and
Spanish, working initially from the Croatian coast. Of all the planned
convoy operations, British troops have to cope with the longest lines of
communication. With a main base being set up at Vitez, 40 miles northwest of
Sarajevo, their main target is the northern town of Tuzla, where the pre-war
population of 130,000 has been swollen by 50,000 refugees. Representatives
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) class a further 50,000
there as destitute.
The first plan was to get there by a short route from Loznica over the
Serbian border, but that made no allowance for having to cross the lines of
Serb forces who are unlikely to take kindly to foreign troops providing
succour to their enemies.
Tuzla now lies in a northward-pointing salient of the remaining block of
Moslem- and Croat-controlled Bosnia, which is gradually melting like ice
enclosed by a warm hand. The main road up to it from the south is in Serb
hands. Cutting off the salient would be an obvious military target for the
Serbs in their effort to widen and secure a corridor across northern Bosnia.
The Spanish have an equally daunting task protecting the principal road from
the coast towards Sarajevo, with the aim of reaching Kiseljak, the small
town just west of Sarajevo where the UN is setting up its Bosnia
headquarters.
The main body of the 740-strong battalion was arriving by sea yesterday, the
largest Spanish force sent to a foreign land since the volunteer Blue
Division went to fight for Hitler. Like the Canadians, they have had
problems setting up. Croatian authorities would not let them go to the
obvious location at Ploce, which is reputed to be the country's main entry
port for clandestine arms shipments. They have had to join the British in
Split instead, an extra drive of 75 miles.
More serious is that the road past Mostar comes within Serb artillery range.
It is the best route north, essential for the volume of aid that will be
needed. According to aid officials lorries could make Sarajevo and back in a
day. Held up by Bosnian Croat militia checkpoints and by a treacherous
two-hour detour near Sarajevo - the local Moslem commander is refusing to
remove mines - it is now a two- to three-day turnaround.
Routes are having to be redrawn to take account of Serb advances. Convoys
will be at risk not only from Serbs but also from Moslem gunmen.
The UNHCR in Split says 770 tonnes of supplies will be required daily for
central Bosnia, western Hercegovina and Sarajevo. At present, with too few
lorries and too many security problems, it is managing about half.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Norway's ruling party votes for EC application
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S ruling Labour party voted yesterday to apply to join the European
Community, although the electorate remains firmly opposed to membership.
The party's conference in Oslo voted 183 to 106 in favour, a smaller
majority than expected. Opposition came mainly from northern delegates who
said their primary source of income - fishing and farming - would be
threatened by closer ties to Brussels.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, plans to deliver a fresh
application for membership this by the end of the month.
This would enable Norway to negotiate membership alongside Sweden and
Finland, which Mrs Brundtland argues is crucial to get the best deal
possible from Brussels.
Norway has applied three times before for EC membership. It was blocked by
France in 1960 and 1962; its third application was accepted, but the
electorate rejected membership in 1972 in a bitterly divisive referendum
dominated by opposition from the fishing and farming communities.
The electorate would vote even more heavily against membership if a
referendum took place today, according to a poll published yesterday in
Dagbladet newspaper. The poll put opposition to membership at a record 55
per cent, compared with 53 per cent in October and 53.5 per cent in 1972.
Only 35 per cent were in favour of joining. A new referendum is likely in
1995.
Yesterday's resolution was nearly overshadowed by the decision on Friday
night of Mrs Brundtland to resign as Labour's leader after almost 12 years.
The timing of the decision shocked the party's 300 conference delegates into
putting aside internal tensions over Europe which had started to build ahead
of yesterday's vote.
The party voted unanimously to appoint Mr Thorbjoern Jagland, a
pro-European, to succeed Mrs Brundtland. To help win support from the north,
Mrs Hill-Marta Solberg, a mayor from north Norway, was elected joint deputy
leader alongside Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the leader of the Oslo Labour party
contingent and son of foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg.
The party's endorsement of membership in the community has swung the
parliamentary balance in favour of joining. At least 100 out of 165 MPs are
expected soon to vote in support of the new membership application.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Hurd faces grilling from EC over ratification
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, foreign secretary, today faces a grilling from his European
Community partners anxious to establish when the British government intends
to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
Mr John Major's decision to delay ratification of the treaty until after a
second Danish referendum next May caused consternation in European capitals,
undermining hopes of a speedy approval of the treaty.
Senior European officials remain unmollifed by subsequent suggestions by the
UK government that it might proceed with a third reading of the Maastricht
bill if Denmark postpones its referendum until later in the year.
Mr Hurd is likely to stress at today's meeting of EC foreign ministers in
Brussels that Mr Major's concession to Tory Euro-sceptics was necessary to
avoid losing last Wednesday's vote in the House of Commons and thereby risk
scuppering the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, will present Denmark's
requests for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty, amid reservations among
certain member states about Denmark's demands.
The Danish question is rapidly shaping up as a battle of political wills
within the EC, as some member states urge flexibility while others adopt a
legalistic approach, warning that Denmark's demands for a UK-style opt-out
on a single European currency and an exemption on a common European defence
force amount to renegotiation of the treaty.
UK ministers hope to secure a basic understanding on the Danish question at
the EC summit in Edinburgh next month. But EC officials point out that the
Edinburgh agenda is becoming crowded, particularly if there is no progress
soon on the so-called Delors II package providing new funding for the poorer
EC member states.
In Brussels today, foreign ministers also face a heavy agenda. Mr Hurd will
be urging his EC partners to support efforts to bridge the gap with the US
on farm subsidies in order to reach a broader deal under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Efforts will be made to define the principle of subsidiarity - devolution of
powers to the lowest appropriate level - and ministers will try to break the
deadlock on the Delors II package.
Last week, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, revived his
compromise idea of spreading the increase in EC spending from five to seven
years, from 1997 to 1999.
This would entail a freeze in the spending ceiling of 1.2 per cent of the
Community's gross domestic product in the first two years, rising to 1.37
per cent of GDP in the next five years.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Clinton summons business leaders to Little Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton is to convene a summit of business leaders
and economists in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the next few weeks to advise him
on ways to tackle the country's economic crisis.
The summit is one of several steps which Mr Clinton's transition team
announced yesterday it would make before the new administration takes power
in late January.
The summit is 'in the planning stages', according to Mr Warren Christopher,
director of the transition team, but it will include an audit of 'where we
stand now'.
The transition team is also looking at the establishment of an Economic
Security Council to raise the priority of government economic
decision-making.
Mr Vernon Jordan, chairman of the transition team, said Mr Clinton would
appoint an assistant for economic security to co-ordinate the operations of
the proposed Economic Security Council, but the president will head it.
The new position is modelled on that of the national security adviser. It is
not clear how the proposed council would work in practice with the existing
Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr Jordan also said the first cabinet appointees are likely to be to
economic posts. They will be announced on December 1 or perhaps earlier,
according to Mr Jordan. It is expected that the top 25-30 appointees will be
announced next month.
Mr Clinton will travel to Washington to meet Congressional leaders before he
takes office. Mr George Mitchell, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has
offered to hold confirmation hearings after the new Congress convenes on
January 5 so Mr Clinton's cabinet can be ready to start work by his
inauguration on January 20.
The cabinet could include Republicans, and Mr Jordan did not rule out the
possibility that a Clinton administration would seek the services of Mr
James Baker, President George Bush's former secretary of state, as a special
envoy.
'We will be an equal opportunity employer,' Mr Jordan said. 'Diversity will
be the operative policy in the arrangement of the government.'
Both parties have expressed support for the incoming administration. But Mr
Mitchell said he would oppose Mr Clinton's request for a line item veto to
reduce the budget deficit, enabling Mr Clinton to delete specific programmes
but not reject the whole budget package.
Senator Robert Dole, the Senate minority leader, has promised to 'chaperon'
the administration's expected honeymoon with Congress. But he said he would
support the line item veto, which had been demanded by Mr Bush, and health
care reform.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Compromise on trade urged as EC tensions rise: EC
commissioner calls for concessions
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND European Community negotiators must make fresh compromises in their
farm trade dispute if trade war is to be averted, Mr Frans Andriessen, EC
external affairs commissioner, warned yesterday.
Mr Andriessen said on British television that neither the EC nor the US was
entitled to let the Uruguay Round fail. He said differences 'while not
insubstantial, can be breached'.
The call for further compromises from the EC's chief trade negotiator could
fuel controversy at an EC foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels today,
where France will ask for a hit-list to be drawn up of US farm exports that
could be triggered if the US goes ahead with threats to slap 200 per cent
tariffs on European white wine and other imports.
French demands for retaliation were fended off at the weekend during an
informal two-day meeting of EC trade ministers at Brocket Hall, north-west
of London, with German and British ministers calling for a quick return to
the negotiating table. France claims it has support from Ireland, Spain and
Belgium.
UK officials in Brussels indicated that ministers would today stop short of
a decision on retaliatory measures against the US, but Mr Roland Dumas,
French foreign minister, will appeal for Community solidarity on the issue.
'We will certainly have to give away something more,' Mr Andriessen said on
Dutch television. 'The US will also have to be a bit more obliging.'
He warned that France must be careful not to become isolated within the EC
in its fight to block settlement of a long-standing dispute with the US over
Europe's oilseeds subsidy regime. He refused to say whether the EC should
draw up a retaliation list, saying only that today's meeting of EC foreign
ministers would 'discuss how to deal with the totality of the issue'.
Negotiations to settle the dispute - which is at the heart of a wider US-EC
row over Europe's farm subsidy regime - have for two years blocked progress
towards a comprehensive world trade reform package that could stimulate an
additional Dollars 200bn (Pounds 129bn) a year in international trade.
Talks collapsed in Chicago on Tuesday as farm ministers from both sides
sought a last-ditch settlement ahead of the US presidential election. The US
swiftly announced it would impose 200 per cent tariffs on farm products
worth Dollars 300m if the dispute were not settled in 30 days.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French industry and foreign trade minister,
maintained that France was acting on behalf of all 12 EC governments in
asking Brussels to prepare counter sanctions, which should start with soya.
He added that France had 'numerous allies' including Spain, Belgium and
Ireland 'who like us refuse to submit'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, talked yesterday of a
wide range of dialogue going on behind the scenes at the weekend aimed at
'cooling the temperature'. He said Mr John Major, president of the EC, was
'doubling every effort to get talks back on the road.'
'The clock is ticking. It is a very dangerous situation,' he said.

FT  09 NOV 92 / Tory rifts reopen over Europe amid calls for reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH Conservative party skirmishing over Europe broke out yesterday,
testing the authority of Mr John Major amid continuing confusion over when
Britain will complete ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
As the prime minister faced calls from the right wing for a cabinet
reshuffle, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, appeared to retreat on a
concession offered last week to Euro-sceptic MPs.
He suggested on BBC radio that the Commons' consideration of the Maastricht
bill and the Danish referendum were 'not interdependent'.
However, Downing Street again said it regarded May as the most likely time
for the Danish poll and that would coincide with the Commons third reading
of the ratification legislation. The Maastricht bill would then go to the
House of Lords in time to complete all parliamentary stages by next October
or November.
Underlining the conflicting pressures on Mr Major, the apparent delay - even
if watered down - has angered the pro-European wing of the party and
dismayed Foreign Office ministers.
Mr Ray Whitney, MP for Wycombe and prominent Europe enthusiast, said: 'We
are all less happy than we would have been and we do have a problem.'
Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP for Leominster, said the delay would make the
Danes 'feel stronger than they actually are'.
However, an equally ferocious warning not to be cowed by pro-Europeans will
come on Thursday when Mr Major addresses the 60-strong Thatcherite '92
group' of Tory MPs.
Senior 92 members are calling for the promotion of right-wing ministers such
as Mr John Redwood, local government minister, to replace the more
pro-European Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, Mr Tony
Newton, leader of the Commons, and Mr John Gummer, agriculture secretary.
They are also calling for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to be
'reined in'.
One 92 member who spoke publicly yesterday, Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton
North, said: 'We have a centre-left cabinet and a centre-right parliamentary
party . . . The prime minister should have an early opportunity to redress
that balance and have a cabinet more representative of popular and party
opinion.'
Some right-wingers regard concessions by Mr Major as a quid pro quo for
their helping him avoid defeat after Wednesday's Maastricht debate. But
these are likely to inflame the party's internal rows.
Mr George Robertson, a Labour party foreign affairs spokesman, said the
prime minister was 'impotent', with his 'twisting and turning complicating
and worsening all the stresses and tensions which threaten Europe's ability
to solve its deep troubles'.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to oppose a new move to introduce a permanent international ban
on dumping radioactive waste at sea.
The government's stance follows its successful attempts in September to
persuade the Paris Convention governing dumping in the north-east Atlantic
to reject a permanent ban on radioactive waste dumping in favour of a
15-year moratorium.
Signatories to the London Dumping Convention, a world-wide dumping treaty,
are meeting in London this week. The LDC, which has a wider jurisdiction,
could override the provisions of the Paris Convention.
The London convention, which opens today, will report next year on the
effects of radioactive waste dumping in the sea. The UK wants any decision
to wait for the results of the study.

MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said yesterday that government
borrowing must not exceed DM45bn (Dollars 28.37bn) in 1993, Reuter reports
from Bonn.
Until recently, the government had been forecasting a 1993 budget deficit of
DM38bn compared with a projected DM40bn this year.
'There must be no increase in net borrowing above DM45bn,' Mr Waigel said in
Berlin's Sonntagspost newspaper. 'In just the same way as tax increases,
this would have a negative effect on the economy.
'In the first round of saving efforts we have managed to save DM7.5bn. That
is enough to pay for the German Unity fund, inherited debt from former East
Germany and to cover eastern European trade,' he added.
But Mr Waigel said: 'Without further drastic saving - including in subsidies
and in welfare policies - it won't be possible. Everyone has to carry their
part of the burden.'

FT  09 NOV 92 / Barre plea for stronger German links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH EUROPEAN EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany are likely to establish monetary union with a small
'core' of European countries if either Britain or Denmark fails to ratify
the Maastricht treaty, according to Mr Raymond Barre, the former French
prime minister.
Mr Barre, a stalwart of the centre-right UDF party in the French national
assembly, coupled this prediction with a plea for further measures to
strengthen Franco-German monetary co-operation.
He recommended that France should adopt a narrower fluctuation band within
the European Monetary System to tie the franc still closer to the D-Mark.
This compared with the present allowed margin for the franc against the
D-Mark of 2 1/4 per cent either side of the central rate.
Such a move to 'narrow bands' would strengthen the monetary solidarity by
the Bundesbank's support of the franc during the September currency
upheavals, Mr Barre said in an interview in London.
Mr Barre, prime minister for two spells in 1976-1978 and 1978-1981, prides
himself on providing part of the intellectual stimulus behind the 'hard
franc' policy followed by the present Socialist government.
Commenting on France's battle with the currency markets six weeks ago, Mr
Barre said 'international circles, men who can manage big flows of capital'
wanted to 'test the strength of the Franco-German (monetary) accord'.
Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, announced last week that the Bank
of France had succeeded in repaying all the funds borrowed from the
Bundesbank to finance franc support intervention.
'FFr160bn (Dollars 31.06bn) was spent by the Bank of France. But the funds
have been paid back quickly,' Mr Barre said. He declared that the Bundesbank
gave support to the franc not simply for political reasons, but also because
the German central bank was convinced that fundamental economic factors made
a franc devaluation undesirable.
Mr Barre, a strong supporter of the Maastricht treaty, campaigned for a Yes
vote in the French referendum on September 20. 'If the speculation (against
the franc) had been succeesful, the future of the Maastricht treaty would
have been more compromised than by a failure of the referendum,' he said.
Mr Barre said the EC wanted to proceed with a treaty on European union
acceptable to all 12 members. However, if some countries did not ratify the
treaty, 'the other countries can consider it justified to make something by
themselves which would be a more limited Community - a 'hard core,'' Mr
Barre said.
If 'two or three countries' rejected the treaty, the 'hard core' could
consider speeding up progress towards economic and monetary union (Emu), he
said.
Mr Barre urged the French government to make the Bank of France independent
in stage two of the drive towards Emu, due to start in 1994. He said stage
two should also bring about a gradual pooling of European central banks'
currency reserves - a step currently opposed by the Bundesbank.
Mr Barre criticised President Francois Mitterrand's statement during the
referendum campaign that the planned European central bank should be
subordinate to European governments.
'He (Mr Mitterrand) has accepted (in the Maastricht treaty) the independence
of the European central bank. If he thinks the central bank will be
dependent on the political authorities, I think he's wrong. He will never
get the result he wants.'
Mr Barre also cautioned about Britain's September departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling's devalution might produce
'artificial benefits' by boosting growth in the short term - but the
advantages would soon be swallowed up in higher inflation.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Cesar Gaviria declared a national state of emergency yesterday
after leftist rebels detonated more than 30 bombs across Colombia, killing
at least nine people and wounding 60, AP reports from Bogota.
Mr Gaviria made the announcement after calling an emergency Security Council
meeting with his cabinet yesterday to discuss measures to combat Colombia's
35-year-old rebel insurgency.
The state of emergency will last for 90 days, in which the government will
take extraordinary powers: Mr Gaviria will be able to order actions against
rebels without consulting Congress or the courts.
Before the meeting, Mr Gaviria's interior minister, Humberto de la Calle
Lombana, said the guerrilla attacks were unprecedented and called for a
state of emergency.
Earlier yesterday the president said: 'It's now the hour to confront,
without truces - in the military, judicial and legislative fields, and with
the support of citizens - those who have become the worst criminals of the
country.'
Leftist rebels of the Simon Bolvar Guerrilla Co-ordinator movement began an
offensive on Saturday, killing 26 policemen who were protecting oil drills
at a petroleum field in southern Colombia.
Drug dealers have also targeted police. They have killed 20 officers in the
past 10 days.
The Bolvar group comprises the three remaining rebel factions: the National
Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and a dissident
faction of the Peoples' Liberation Army.

<TEXT>
OMV, the state controlled Austrian energy and petrochemical group, returned
to profit in the third quarter and is now expecting to reach break-even in
the full year.
The group, which has suffered from boardroom strife and a slump in its
refining and petrochemical operations this year, said it made a pre-tax
profit of Sch201m (Dollars 189m) in the third quarter after a loss of
Sch584m in the first half.
For the nine months, pre-tax losses were Sch383m compared with a profit of
Sch1.19bn in the same period of last year. Turnover was down 2.4 per cent to
Sch60.7bn.
The energy division was responsible for the profit turnround, with both the
refining and marketing businesses returning to profit in the third quarter,
mainly as a result of cost cutting. The division as a whole made a profit of
Sch919m in the nine-month period, down 43 per cent.
The chemical division lost Sch46m in the third quarter as fertiliser and
melamine sales slumped, but a turnround is expected next year. The plastics
division lost Sch367m in the third quarter, as prices for polyolefins fell.
The group said at the interim stage that it was still expecting 'a positive
result' for the year, but this has been revised downward to break-even.
Verbund, the Austrian electricity utility, expects net profits to jump 24
per cent this year to Sch750m, Mr Walter Fremuth, chief executive, said in
Frankfurt.

AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, reported profits of SKr1.03bn
(Dollars 172m) for the first nine months, down 3 per cent from the same
period in 1991.
Sales fell to SKr8.56bn from SKr9.40bn, reflecting Aga's earlier merger of
its Uddeholm energy unit with Swedish power group Gullspangs Kraft. The
group's ongoing opera-tions, gas and the Frigoscandia food processing and
cold storage business, increased sales by 1.5 per cent during the period.
Operating income fell 9 per cent to SKr946m from SKr1.08bn, mainly because
Frigoscandia's equipment operations were affected by the international
recession.
The group said it was on target to produce full year profits of SKr1.43bn,
unchanged from last year and in line with an earlier prediction. It expects
the downturn at Frigoscandia to be offset by its share of earnings from the
new Gullspang.

YAMAHA, the world's largest musical instruments manufacturer, yesterday
confirmed the force of the downturn hitting Japanese manufacturers by
announcing its first dividend cut in 38 years.
Reporting a 43.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y3.87bn (Dollars 31m)
in the six months ended September, Yamaha said it would cut its interim
dividend from Y5 to Y3. The dividend for 1992-1993 would be cut to Y6 from
Y10 last year.
The company's pre-tax profit fell to Y3.87bn from Y6.87bn in the first half
of last year, on sales of Y180.9bn, about 11.2 per cent down on 1991.
Yamaha has been hit by a sharp downturn in consumer demand in Japan which
has been compounded by the recent strength of the yen.
However its capacity to weather the downturn in its consumer markets has
been diminished by a sharp fall in the value of its securities holdings
reflecting the fall in the Tokyo stock market.
Post-tax profits fell by 39.7 per cent to Y1.7bn. Earnings per share
declined to Y8.89 per share, down from Y14.75 per share in the first half of
last year.
Kao Oil, the Japanese affiliate of Caltex petroleum, reports modestly lower
pre-tax profits with recent yen strength offsetting a fall in demand.
Pre-tax profits fell 1.6 per cent from a year earlier to Y889m on sales of
Y115.19bn, down 7.8 per cent. Net profit more than doubled to Y616m, the
company said.

Lisbon Metro in Portugal.
The tender awarded for this section of the project is designated as
Restauradores - Baixa/Chiado and Rossio - Baixa/Chiado - Cais do Sodre.
The design and construct consortium consists of contractors Bento Pedroso
Construcoes (BCP), Somague and Agroman plus the design firms of Profabril,
Acer and Kaiser Engineers.
The project involves the construction of 2.6km of tunnel; two new
underground stations (Cais do Sodre and Baixa Chiado); and the expansion of
two stations (Restauradores and Rossio) to increase platform lengths to
receive six car trains.
The new works will split the present single metro line into two lines with
potential for future extensions.
It has been esimated that the expansion of this section will increase the
passenger capacity by 40 per cent, helping to alleviate road traffic and
parking in central Lisbon. Completion of the project is scheduled for May
1995.
Construction methods will include a combination of NATM, shield, cut and
cover (top down) and underpinning techniques.

FIGHTING flared up in southern Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, dealing a
further blow to UN efforts to bring aid overland to Sarajevo, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
Officials working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said some 10 trucks heading for the besieged Bosnian capital were
forced to turn back by heavy fighting at Buna, near Mostar, south-east of
Sarajevo.
It was the third setback to a UN aid effort in 24 hours.
Members of the UN peace-keeping forces said there was still heavy shelling
between rival Serb and Croat forces around Mostar and the 57km of
strategically important road which links the city to the Croatian border.
Serb army officials, who have consistently accused Croat and Moslem forces
of opening fire in the area, lodged an official written complaint with UN
peacekeeping forces and threatened to use heavy artillery if the shooting
continued.
In their complaint the Bosnian Serb army accused Croat forces of razing
three villages and murdering women, children and old people there. The
allegation could not be independently confirmed.

FT  09 NOV 92 / CBI calls for 2 point rate cut: 'Partnership for prosperity'
urged between industry and government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a 2 point cut in
interest rates to 6 per cent in conjunction with Mr Norman Lamont's Autumn
Statement on Thursday. It also renewed its call for maintained or increased
government spending on capital projects.
Speaking on the eve of the CBI's annual conference in Harrogate, Mr Howard
Davies, CBI director general, said the government was showing signs of a new
attitude to industry. 'What we are looking for from the chancellor on
Thursday is what that attitude actually means.'
Mr Davies said that while CBI members believed in principle that Britain
should rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, the necessary conditions
were unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future.
Mr Douglas McWilliam, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said: 'We can't go
back in when we want 6 per cent interest rates and German rates are still at
8.5 per cent.'
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said that, over the past few weeks,
ministers had listened intently and encouraged business leaders to present
fresh ideas. 'I think they really realise that something has to be done.'
Sir Michael called for action on electricity prices. Drawing attention to
the closure of two plants by Imperial Chemical Industries last week on
grounds of high electricity costs, he said that in certain European
countries electricity was subsidised.
'If other people are not prepared to play the game according to the rules,
we may have to do likewise.'
The CBI presented the first report from its new National Manufacturing
Council, calling for a 'partnership for prosperity' between industry and
government. The report, which aims to improve the UK's competitiveness in
manufacturing, calls for increased productivity, doubled investment per
employee and a higher share of world export markets.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, who is attending the conference, supported the CBI's
objectives in the report. But he described as 'extremely disappointing' its
lack of emphasis on the role of unions in reviving the economy.

FT  09 NOV 92 / OECD fear at private debt levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
expressed concern about the build-up of private-sector debt in the US, UK
and Japan over the past decade.
In its latest thrice-yearly review, Financial Market Trends, the Paris-based
think tank of 24 industrialised countries said it could not be argued that
private debt developments posed a menace to global financial stability.
'But in a number of major countries the volume of private indebtedness has
affected the soundness of the banking system and is a factor that hampers
economic recovery.'
The OECD singled out for concern 'the slump in real estate in the US, the UK
and Japan' and the low loan-loss provisions of Japanese banks.
The report said it was unclear whether deregulation of interest rates and
credit would lead to a lasting increase in instability in the financial
system, as some feared.

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (8): Fine words - and even finer print / Arnold
Wilson peruses the latest batch of travel agents' brochures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS perhaps fortunate that skiing tour operators are unable to follow the
progress of their expensive, lavishly produced brochures after they land on
my doormat at No 193.
They invariably arrive in such a flurry that they are unceremoniously dumped
in a rapidly-increasing pile by my right foot. There they remain for days
one end, mostly unread, with their press releases, launch and lunch
invitations and, for all I know, the odd Pounds 10 note left languishing
inside the front cover, preserved in Cellophane rather than aspic until they
are suddenly ripped open in time of need.
However, we do look at them eventually, I promise - and even keep them in
the attic for a year or two.
Sometimes perusing them too closely can backfire. I remember recently
discovering that one rather shameless operator had actually 'painted' a
snowdrift against the wall of a hotel - presumably because in a last minute
panic they could only find a slide of the hotel in summer. Perish the
thought that they were trying to pretend there was snow when there wasn't .
. .
For the tour operator, of course, brochures are their very lifeblood and a
major expense. So you could imagine how incensed Touralp and Silver Ski
were, for example, when their entries were partly transposed in a major
advertising feature in a certain newspaper the other day, and each ended up
with the other's telephone number.
One paper had an affectionate gloat at some of the errors they had spotted.
One company, they noted had inadvertently got the Matterhorn the wrong way
round. On closer inspection, however, it wasn't the main picture of the
mountain, but a small second picture in the brochure.
Currently, the problem with brochures is whether or not to reprint them in
order to increase prices to cope with the effects of the weakened pound
following the sterling crisis on Black Wednesday.
Brochures already printed with the slogan 'No Surcharges Guaranteed' can be
reprinted without the slogan, or - more cunningly - with the slogan (to make
it still look like a good offer) but with higher prices inside. Skiers
should make sure they are looking at the latest brochure when they book.
Some brochures are still desperately hard to decipher - others are
simplicity itself. And above all, most are riddled with superlatives.
Crystal Holidays, for example, claims to be the 'UK's top specialist ski
company' with 'an amazing choice of the finest and widest choice of the
world's top ski resorts' with service 'second to none'.
The Ski Company is slightly more poetical, quoting a guest who writes: 'We
woke up to a cat purring outside the closed shutters, the sound of church
bells and the aroma of freshly-baked bread.' Managing director David Kemp
responds in his brochure: 'That strikes as much of a chord with me as
endless pre-dinner champagne.' Apart from being considerably cheaper, of
course . . .
Ski Turkey, on the other hand, makes no bones about it: 'In Turkey
hospitality is a way of life, genuine and often overwhelming. A visitor is
accepted as a guest sent from God, and must be treated well.' Not that well,
surely?
Snowtime claims: 'We think of everything.' They certainly try to. 'Peruse
our brochure' they plead. 'Our service and facilities include free skiers'
shuttle buses, a creche run by professional nannies, free ski guiding, free
drinks parties and film shows, snow scooter excursions, guaranteed prices
and a snow guarantee that makes all the others laughable]'
Andrew Dunn writes more modestly in his brochure: 'A Ski Scott Dunn chalet
holiday makes no outlandish claims.' But elsewhere in the brochure he
changes his mind and claims his company: 'Offer the very best in skiing
holidays . . . there really is no winter travel alternative . . . our chalet
girls really are the best.'
Mr Dunn adds: 'Please note that none of our chalet girls live in the chalets
with you, benefiting both you and them.' One can certainly see how it would
benefit them] Maybe I'll book with Snowtime. After all, it thinks of
everything.

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (6): The fast road to the Alps - Stuart
Marshall tells you how to avoid hazards when taking your car abroad this
winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLETION OF two missing motorway links, one in Britain, the other in
France, has made driving to ski resorts in the French Alps and Switzerland
easier than ever.
We can thank the start of work on the Channel Tunnel for the decision to
close the M20 gap between Maidstone and Ashford. Disgracefully, this had
existed for years after the rest of the motorway between London and (almost)
Folkestone had been built.
By far the best stepping off point for France is Dover. P &amp; 0 and Sealink
Stena have their best and biggest ships on this 75-minute journey. Or try
the faster SeaCat, but only if the sea is calm or you have a cast-iron
stomach.
Dover is now an easy day's drive from any part of Britain on the motorway
network. The worst part is from the end of the M20 near Folkestone to Dover
docks; the Capel-le-Ferne by-pass which will extend the M20 right into Dover
will not be open until next year. But Calais docks are the Western terminal
of the A26 autoroute. Within a few minutes of driving off the ferry one can
be cruising legally at 80 mph (68 mph in wet weather) toward the slopes.
Last summer, the missing 47-mile stretch of the A26 autoroute between
Chalons-sur-Marne and Troyes was completed. This has revolutionised travel
across France south-eastwards from Calais. No longer does one have to use
the lorry-infested A1 between Lille and Paris and the A6 south from Paris.
Even better, one can forget all about the notorious boulevard peripherique
around Paris which joins the A1 to the A6, rather as our M25 links, say, the
M3 and M4 with the M1 and A1(M).
To be fair, it was not essential to use it on a north-south journey via
Paris if you had a good map and a confident navigator. But most Britons just
followed the signs and stuck to the peripherique, with its demon drivers,
weaving motorcyclists, poor signposting and frequent hold-ups.
Now, you leave Calais and head for Reims, 172 miles and about 2 1/2 hours
away. From Reims, the autoroute flows uninterruptedly around
Chalons-sur-Marne, Troyes and Dijon to intersect with the A36 and A6 at
Beaune. Now it is decision time. If you prefer to stay on the autoroute all
the way to resorts in, for example, the Chamonix and Megeve areas - and in
winter it has much to recommend it - you must head south on A6 to Macon and
then turn east on A40.
For Chambery or Grenoble, stay on the A6 until just north of Lyon and then
take the A46. This bypasses Lyon to the east and joins with the A43 for
Chambery and A48 for Grenoble. The alternative route to Geneva, Chamonix and
Megeve from Beaune is by N5 via Dole, Poligny, Champagnole and Morez. It
means crossing either the Col de la Givrine or Col de la Faucille.
In spite of the best efforts of snowploughs, there is a risk of these passes
being blocked when the autoroutes are still open. If in doubt, take the
autoroute. It is further and means paying more tolls but probably quicker in
the end.
Unless the weather is exceptionally severe, you are unlikely to be seriously
troubled by snow on the autoroutes. But it is wise to buy or hire a set of
tyre chains for use on minor roads and resort areas.
Driving to the ski slopes in winter need be nothing more than a routine
journey if a few sensible precautions are taken.
Make sure your tyres have at least 2mm of pattern all over the tread and are
at the right pressure for the load you are carrying. Replace worn wiper
blades. Add plenty of the correct kind of antifreeze (not radiator
antifreeze) to the screenwash reservoir. Have cans of de-icer and a good
scraper.
If your car is a diesel, tank up only with winter grade fuel that does not
go waxy until the temperature falls below - 20' Celsius. It is available
everywhere in France.
Take a tip from the Scandinavians and carry a soft brush. After a heavy
overnight fall, sweep all the snow off the car before clearing the windows
and driving away. Leaving a foot of snow on the roof is dangerous - it can
blow off in one great lump and blind the driver of a following car.
Sealink Stena's Pounds 159 'Ski-Link' offer from December 1 to March 31

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (7): Packing for the piste - Lucia van der Post
advises on skiwear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRESSING for the slopes, if you are to get it right, involves, like most
decisions in life, a little contemplation first. Honesty helps, too.
Are you, for instance, a beginner, likely to be floundering in the sticky
stuff that passes for snow on most nursery slopes? Or are you addicted to
black runs, likely to be out all day long in tough conditions? Or are you
really much, much more interested in how you look than how you ski?
If you are not a serious skier and are more addicted to the afternoon
passegiata than the piste, then you can afford to direct all your attention
to how you look. The high-technology debate about which of the many
micro-fibres is best for you and how to look chic and keep warm need not
trouble you.
As a broad rule of thumb the more fashionable the garment the less it is
likely to perform in the severe conditions the piste poses. To get a
combination of high fashion and the latest technology will mean paying
higher prices.
High fashion looks are copied from the catwalks. The silhouette remains
based on the lean legging and the big, blousy, parka-style top. For real
snow bunnies the lean, black ski pant topped by an eye-stopping gold jacket
will ensure they are not overlooked.
The problem, though, for beginners is that all that falling about means that
they do need skiwear that really keeps the snow and damp out. The answer to
this is layers. A modest outlay will bring you an outer layer which, though
thin and not very warm, is waterproof. Pack under it layers, possibly a
polar fleece jacket or shirt, or just thermal underwear and several sweaters
and you could be reasonably economically equipped.
Once you are off the beginners slope and start to take the big lifts up to
the high pistes, the problems change a bit - now you will need gloves that
really keep the cold out (double layers again are best, silk linings inside
proper ski mittens) and anoraks that are wind as well as snow-proof.
If you think this is a sport you are going to stick with you could probably
afford to spend more on an outfit now and go for one of the newer microfibre
fabrics.
C &amp; A is much looked down upon in snooty circles (spot the C &amp; A is, I
gather, a popular game among the Sloane chalet party set) but I think the
company gives excellent value for money and if you keep to the less
eye-catching and less obvious shapes and styles they are hard to beat.
Prices are friendly - slim cord skipants for Pounds 22.50 and a belted biker
skijacket for Pounds 59.99 means that even the most tentative would-be skier
need not spend too much.
When you reach that much-to-be-desired state of hardly falling down at all
then you can afford, rather like the ski bunny, to think about fashion once
again. You will, of course, need to keep out the damp and to keep warm. What
you need now are lean, lean trousers (so aerodynamically effective) and a
puffy, warm belted parka-style anorak.
Of course, we all know that what the really expert show-off wears hasn't
changed for years - 501s, a much-worn sweater and not much more. That's just
to signal to us all that he never falls down, that feeling cold is for wimps
and that whilst the rest of us may lumber our way down he whizzes down so
fast that he hasn't time to catch pneumonia.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Putting the colour back into art's faded cheeks: Antony
Thorncroft questions Sotheby's timing in raising its buyers' premium just as
a selection of important items are coming under the auctioneer's hammer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S shocked and angered the art world this week by raising the premium
it charges to buyers at its sales from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the
hammer price on lots which go for Pounds 30,000 (Dollars 50,000) or less,
which means the vast majority.
Lord Gowrie, the London chairman, was quick to point out that, with the 10
per cent remaining on anything paid over Pounds 30,000, the maximum
additional charge for a buyer will be Pounds 1,500. But in the current
market, when auction houses are seeking desperately for new collectors to
make good the loss of bidding by the debt-ridden dealers, any extra expense
looks suicidal.
Sotheby's has been forced into raising its prices - which, added to the 10
per cent that sellers pay (in theory), means that it takes a weighty 25 per
cent of any object sold - because it continues to trade at a loss and the
hoped-for improvement in business in the autumn has proved a chimera.
Michael Ainslie, its president, said: 'Although we have succeeded in cutting
our costs by 20 per cent in the last two years, the market has not bounced
back as quickly as we expected.'
Also, in today's intensely competitive climate, anyone offering a valuable
collection at auction would be mad if they did not negotiate a reduction in
the seller's charge, so buyers are, in effect, being asked to subsidise
sellers.
Christie's and Phillips are holding off for the moment but will probably
follow suit and raise their premiums, but Bonhams, which is riding the
recession better than its bigger rivals, is pegging prices.
Sotheby's timing is surprising because in recent weeks there have been signs
of green shoots in the art market. Even those rare words 'auction record'
have crept back into the language, admittedly usually in such specialist
areas as Chinese modern paintings (Pounds 614,000 was paid in Hong Kong for
a work by Zhang Daqian), and 20th century photographs (Pounds 115,500 at
Christie's for a portrait by Rodchenko).
But some popular artists have also achieved records, like the Dollars
528,000 paid in New York for a work by the French 19th century Salon painter
Bouguereau and, this week in London, Pounds 66,000 for a sculpture by Eric
Gill.
By all accounts, the London and Provincial Antique Dealers Show in London
last month was not at all bad and there was brisk buying at the Contemporary
Art Society's supermarket of inexpensive art at Smiths last weekend.
Even the London dealers are beginning to think the worst is past, and, more
to the point, are starting to get out and sell. Sixteen of the galleries
left in Cork Street are co-operating on an open weekend on November 28 and
29.
Throw in the Olympia autumn antiques fair, from November 18, at which almost
200 dealers will be looking to make pre-Christmas sales; the Barbican fair
from November 26 with another 200 dealers offering antiques valued at Pounds
25 million; and Artmart at the Business Design Centre in Islington from
November 19, and the supply side is well taken care of.
Serious connoisseurs, who were frozen out by the spiralling prices of the
late 1980s, are now at least attending fairs and, as prices continue to
fall, especially for pictures, this really is the time for bargains.
All that is missing is confidence, which can best come from keen bidding at
auction, where works of art are publicly seen to be in demand. In the next
month, some really important items arrive on the market. They will confirm
that the art world slump, which in areas such as Impressionist paintings has
reduced prices by 50 per cent in two years, is over, or whether there is
more misery to come.
The Grim Reaper has been kind to Sotheby's and Christie's. Few owners of
masterpieces are keen to sell in today's lacklustre market place (unless
they are badgered by Lloyds of London or their banks), but the auction
houses have some fine offerings thanks to death and executors - and the
mounting inheritance problems in maintaining the UK's stately mansions.
Lord Mountbatten's former home at Broadlands and the new heirs to Luton Hoo
are among the consignors in London this month.
Death has particularly favoured New York's major winter Impressionist and
modern art sales next week. Dorothy Rodgers, the widow of the popular
composer, has died and Christie's is offering 26 works on Wednesday from her
collection, including a Cubist Picasso 'Guitare et journal' estimated at up
to Dollars 4 million and a cheerful work by Picasso painted aged 20 in 1901
while he was still in Barcelona (estimated at up to Dollars 2 million); plus
paintings by Vlaminck and Matisse which might also top Dollars 1 million.
The previous night, Sotheby's big occasion is boosted by paintings from two
more dead collectors, Mollie Livingston, who designed clothes for the wives
of Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson, and Wright Ludington. The highlight
from the former's collection is another Matisse, 'L'Asie', a 1946 portrait
of an oriental girl which could make Dollars 8 million, and a Dollars 4
million Picasso, while Ludington contributes his 1905 Matisse, estimated at
around Dollars 1.5 million.
In terms of quality of stock, next week's Impressionist and modern sales in
New York are the best for over two years, but, even if the art sells on
target, prices will only have returned to the levels prevailing five years
ago, before the short-lived boom.
London can hardly compete with this array of costly art, but there are
re-assuringly familiar British names in the auctions of Victorian pictures
next week. Sotheby's and Christie's have sadly accepted that they cannot
sell 19th century British artists alongside French, Spanish and the rest in
general 19th century European art catalogues - their attempt to create a
common market for art among European collectors has failed - so Leighton and
Burne-Jones, Rossetti and Alma-Tadema have been restored to their exclusive
catalogues.
The highlight of Christie's sale on Friday is 'Moorish garden: a dream of
Granada' by Lord Leighton, which depicts a young girl in eastern finery
leading two peacocks. It is being sold by an Australian museum, the Armidale
in New South Wales, which should be at least Pounds 500,000 richer as a
consequence. Lord Leighton's 'oriental' pictures rarely appear at auction.
This one has actually appeared twice before at Christie's.
In 1903, it went for 888 guineas and in 1931, with the Victorians out of
favour, for just 190 guineas. Another work by Leighton, 'The bracelet',
showing a Greek maid examining a bangle, also reflects the vagaries of taste
for Victorian pictures. It made just 21 guineas at Christie's in 1956; now
it could top Pounds 500,000.
The sale contains Frederick Watts's famous portrait of Lord Tennyson and one
of Alma-Tadema's rare female nudes. 'A sculptor's model' caused a sensation
when it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1878 and the Bishop of
Carlisle described it as 'mischievious'. To deflect criticism, Alma-Tadema
rather unsatisfactorily added a smock, not to the model but to the watching
sculptor. Estimated at around Pounds 250,000, it is being sold by a Japanese
company, confirming that these days the Japanese are sellers rather than
buyers. The highlight at Sotheby's is one of Leighton's rare nudes, 'The
antique juggling girl', which could make Pounds 500,000.
And there are more goodies to come. . . The first dispersal in a general
Pounds 30 million clear-out by one of Europe's richest families, the Princes
of Thurn and Taxis, at Sotheby's Geneva on November 17, when a gold and
hardstone snuff box created for Frederick the Great should sell for Pounds 1
million; the seven works by Cezanne at Christie's on November 30, which
should make Pounds 12 million between them; the Pounds 5 million Pieter de
Hooch view of a Delft courtyard at Christie's on December 11, with a 'lost'
Rubens portrait in the same sale; a rare bullfighting scene by Goya at
Sotheby's on December 9 which has been in the same family since it was
painted in 1824 and should sell for around Pounds 5 million; one of the two
finest Kandinskys to appear at auction in 30 years is also in the Pounds 5
million class at Sotheby's on December 1; and a Turner watercolour of
Venice, which when it last appeared in the saleroom in 1988 set an English
watercolour record of Pounds 440,000: on November 19 at Sotheby's it is
modestly expected to make Pounds 500,000, reflecting the convalescent
market.
In the same sale is a Constable view of Salisbury cathedral, despatched to
raise Pounds 1 million to ease the financial problems at Luton Hoo.
The most important Mountbatten picture up for grabs, Joseph Wright of
Derby's 'An Iron Forge', has thankfully found a permanent home in the Tate,
thanks to the generosity of the National Heritage Fund and the National Art
Collections Fund.
If there are rich buyers out there, they must be tempted by these master
works. Already Italian and Swiss furniture dealers have been bidding heavily
again at furniture auctions in the UK, one area which has largely ridden out
the recession; the Americans are definitely coming back, thanks to the fall
in value of sterling.
There could still be problems for the London art market if Brussels succeeds
in imposing VAT on the import of works of art but a combination of excellent
items with international appeal in the salerooms and competitively priced
general antiques at the fairs and in the dealers' windows should provide the
combination to lift the art market out of its two-year malaise.

THE celestial 11th century South Indian bronzes had no takers; the naughty
European enamel cigarette boxes were all snapped up. And the bidding for the
novelties such as the Carl Kauba bronze chrysalis ashtray which parts
mechanically to reveal a nymphet, or the Austrian Franz Bergman bronze
figure of a girl whose skirt lifts up went very well, thank you.
But Sotheby's first auction in India, at a luxury hotel in New Delhi, didn't
go quite as well as the British auctioneers, and their Indian partners, the
Modis, had hoped, even if they are not admitting it.
The two-day extravaganza - for it was that for much of the motley crowd in
event-starved Delhi - raked in a total of Rs56.4m (Pounds 1.3m), half the
estimated figure for the collection of 521 objects.
Mr Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's Asian division, who skilfully
presided over the proceedings, announced at the end that nearly 63 per cent
of the lots were sold and that Sotheby's had been particularly encouraged by
the sale of European paintings.
Godward's 'Bath of Venus', a 1901 oil of a disrobed beauty, fetched a
handsome Rs2.86m (Pounds 57,200) and another work by the last of the British
neo-classicists, whose naked ladies were the mild pornography of the day,
fetched Rs2.31m (Pounds 46,200).
The European paintings, which attracted mostly foreign buyers, sold at full
international value, according to Mr Thompson.
India's veritable treasure trove of non-Indian art was displayed at the sale
and collectors hope that more will emerge, thanks to Sotheby's pressure. In
the days of the British Raj, hundreds of European paintings were brought to
India, mostly by Indian art collectors or British civil servants to
embellish their buildings.
Sotheby's in the early 1980s had tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the
Indian government to auction works of art of non-Indian origin, much of
which lay neglected in the country's grand old bureaucratic residences.
Now it has had its way although India's strict antiquity laws still do not
permit antiquities of over 100 years to leave the country, which accounts
for the restrained bidding in this area.
The South Indian Chola bronzes, including two 11th and 12th century bronze
figures of the Hindu god, Shiva, were unsold when bidders offered less than
half of the estimated prices of Rs5m to Rs8.5m.
The bronzes, which span centuries of Indian art, were from the collection of
a shipping magnate, Mrs Sumati Morarjee, who confessed she had bought over
the years to prevent works of art from leaving the country, but could no
longer maintain her collection.
The contemporary Indian art section did dismally, but some early 20th
century paintings fetched prices considerably higher than their estimates.
Amrita Sher-Gil's Village Group (1938) designated, like the artist herself,
an Indian art treasure, fetched Rs1.1m (Pounds 22,000), a record price for
any modern Indian painting.
The European clocks and watches were indiscriminately snapped up by foreign
buyers; Indian bidders were more discerning, bidding heavily for single
pieces they had set their hearts on. The curiosities and knick-knacks, which
one collector termed 'flea-market junk', attracted spirited bidding.
The next auction, says Suzanne Tory, Sotheby's India managing director, will
be held in a year's time. Doubtless more Indians will be tempted to part
with their treasures by then.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Gardening: A leaf from rich men's books - Robin Lane Fox
chooses the grandeur of the arboretum to bid his annual farewell to the
trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEKEND is our last chance to say goodbye to the trees. In a very few
days, they will be a bare tracery of branches, like the pillars of tall
cathedrals, reaching for the light. While there is still time, put down your
tools, pull on the wellingtons and head for a good arboretum.
Arboretums begin as the extended vistas of very rich men: they end as
enclosures with signposts and trail stickers and committed men with beards,
striding out through mud-tracks with walking-sticks of natural wood.
An arboretum's public is not merely keeping its children quiet. It likes
picnicking on low round tables, recycled by the local hobbits, or lunching
in anoraks and rain hats beside a car-boot which is locked in four-wheel
drive.
Against the burnished glow of the beech trees, I have seen the picnickers
ushering out the season, passing vegetarian pancakes across tables with
chairs sunk into the wet grass so that the paper plates are at eye-level.
Arboretums have shops, nowadays, like log cabins. If you want a set of
badger transfers or a walking-stick of cherry wood with a head carved like a
duck, you will find it, this weekend, on sale at an arboretum where the oaks
are turning rusty yellow.
From May until mid-October, we can usually be happy in our own gardens:
then, for a month, we are all better for a tree-park where somebody once
spent masses of money. Arboretums are reservations of grandeur and
mid-Victorian planting which have finally reached a peak. Among them, you
can always find trees of a modest scale, such as Chinese forms of Sorbus
with this year's exceptional berries or the yellow and scarlet leaves on the
smaller forms of maple.
Arboretums make me pine for a deep, less alkaline soil so that Acer Palmatum
would grow freely and turn to a brilliant colour in my long grass. Gardeners
are sometimes wary of this tree, imagining that all its forms look like the
best-known relation, that feathery mound of purple foliage which looks
stranded in small front gardens or in the Japanese corners of rockeries
planted 100 years ago.
Acer Palmatum does not have to be purple at all. The forms with Japanese
names are much more subtle, holding tiny leaves in clusters or extending
them like long fingers on branches which will often grow no more than 15 ft
in a lifetime. My pin-ups are the yellow-leaved forms which are set with
airy, narrow leaves and turn to a fiery colour on a slope of roughly-mown
grass.
Nurseries publicise bigger trees for autumn colour, Malus Bonfire or the
more alarming forms of Prunus. Three or four of these fine Acers would go a
very long way in gardens of half an acre or more, on the edge of a wood, in
an orchard or on a bank beside the drive.
Arboretums are also an introduction to new friends as well as a reminder of
older attractions. I have just vowed that I must plant a Pterocarya
somewhere because its long leaves and straight trunk are so remarkably fine.
Its popular name is the Caucasian Wing Nut and in time it makes a very tall
tree, upright and always dignified without obscuring too much light. It
thrives on soils which also favour walnuts and is seriously underestimated
in Britain.
The leaves look like huge versions of a common ash, but they are earlier
into leaf and much more emphatic. In a big space, a pair of Pterocaryas
would be a bold frame at the further end of a long lawn.
In an arboretum, these discoveries always happen, from flaming maples to
Caucasian Nuts with wings. For me, the arboretum experience has a further
dimension: time, and a humbling awareness of past years.
Like the temple gardens of the pre-Christian world, these rich men's parks
house trees of exceptional straightness, age and stature. To some eyes, they
may seem to be a warning. If a Tulip Tree will grow 100 ft high in a 100
years' time, should we not hesitate before planting one in our own more
modest gardens?
These warnings pass me by, so long as the roots of the tree will not
unsettle nearby buildings. You and I will not be here 100 years hence and
meanwhile, a Tulip Tree will give us years of pleasure. If it is too tall
for posterity, they can always cut it down. No doubt they will be less hung
up about 'heritage', to judge from the legacy which we are parcelling up for
them.
Last weekend, I looked upwards into an ancient case in point. Above me, on
millionaire's ground, towered a tremendous Thuja Plicata, planted in the
Victorian past and left to soar upwards to a height of 70 ft or more. On the
lower branches, a few feathery leaves lay thinly: would any unwary visitor
assume that this enormous tree could be used as an evergreen hedge,
responsive to clipping and feeding in any moderate garden?
Chastened by its age, I had a vision of the clipped hedges of my childhood
growing on into forests as their clipping ceased. These sights make you feel
extremely small, until you turn round and there behind you are visitors in
deer-stalker hats, trying to feed the grey squirrels and romanticise the
hungry rabbits.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Gardening: Rare varieties are blooming / A look at new
marketing methods and specialist services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONALLY, most nurseries both grew their plants and sold them retail to
the gardening public, many of them in the dormant or semi-dormant period
between early October and the end of March.
Then, some 30 years ago, came the development of container grown plants,
which made it possible to sell plant varieties throughout the year. This
brought a great increase in the number of retail outlets, most of which
bought in the majority of the plants they sold.
To supply them, many large wholesale nurseries developed, some of them the
old multi-purpose nurseries, and there was a great increase in the total
number of plants sold. But the range of plants tended to diminish since for
some there was only a limited demand and this kind of trading favoured the
popular, fast-selling plants.
But the demand for specialities was still there and actually increased as a
result of many people becoming interested in gardening who would not
previously have been attracted to it. Such specialist nurseries began to
appear in increasing numbers, each with its own range of plants and often
based on a family who supplied all the labour, so that costs could be kept
low. Though most of these grew plants in containers so that they could be
planted on impulse at any time of the year, some also carried on a
mail-order trade in the traditional way and were greatly helped by the
appearance of The Plant Finder.
This is an annual publication which lists alphabetically all the plants that
are known to be available and gives the names and addresses of the
nurseries, large and small, from which they can be obtained. From just small
beginnings, it has grown rapidly until it now contains 55,000 varieties of
plants, cross-referenced to many hundreds of nursery addresses.
The 1992 edition costs Pounds 10.99, is published by Headmain Ltd in
association with The Hardy Plant Society and can be obtained through any
bookshop.
Now comes Hillier Nurseries, Ampfield House, Romsey, Hampshire, with an
entirely new method of marketing plants, which is intended to combine the
best of the old with the best of the new. Hillier's Nurseries have for a
good many years been one of the great nurseries of the country, probably
with the longest list of rare species of trees, shrubs and climbing plants
of anyone, but facing the difficulty that if varieties were only in small
demand, it did not pay to propagate them. The basic idea behind the new way
is to make the Hillier specialities more familiar to the gardening public
and much more readily available.
In the changing conditions of recent years, Hillier Nurseries have become
wholesale suppliers to many retail nurseries and garden centres. Some of
these have been organised as suppliers of Hillier's specialities under
special order direct from the customer, just as one might order a special
book from a bookseller who might not be prepared to stock it on the
off-chance that someone would come along and buy it.
A special list has been prepared known as Hillier Nurseries Premier Plants
and will be revised quite frequently so that it can be kept right up to date
with plants of which the nurseries do have stock available for immediate
supply. This list contains simply the names of the plants, the sizes
available and the price ready for collection at the supplier of the
customer's choice.
Further information, if required, can be had from a variety of other
sources, including several well-illustrated books published by Hillier
Nurseries and also the excellent Illustrated Encyclopedia of Gardening
published by the Royal Horticultural Society.
The Hillier Nurseries Premier Plants edition which I have before me is the
autumn and winter edition 1992 and another is promised by February and will
include plants for the conservatory and other tender species. This one is
concerned primarily with trees and shrubs but also includes some bamboos,
grasses and just a few roses.
The special catalogue lists 78 retail outlets in Britain, one in Jersey,
Channel Islands, and one at Lisieux, France. The plants supplied are
bare-rooted which is possible by this form of delivery direct by lorry from
Hillier Nurseries to the point of sale. There is considerable advantage to
this, especially with trees and the larger shrubs, since the roots have not
all become bound together in an unnatural ball.
They are protected by polythene film during travel but must either be
planted promptly on arrival or heeled-in temporarily if the soil is not in a
suitable condition for permanent planting. Heeling-in involves digging a
wide trench, laying the plants at an angle with their roots in this trench
and covering with soil, treading well down. Treated in this way they will
remain in good condition for weeks.
It would, of course, be possible for any wholesale nursery to do something
similar and it will be interesting to see if the idea catches on.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Property: Controlled rewards of going Dutch - Rebecca
Stephens examines the peculiar nature of investing in the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE property prices determined in the market?
Not in the Netherlands. Here the price of tenanted properties, and most
properties are tenanted, is calculated using a formula based on the
controlled rent: take the net rent for the year, say, Fl 13,000, multiply
this by a predetermined net annual return on investment, say 9 per cent, and
there you have it - your purchase price at Fl 144,400. Easy.
And cheap. For example one actual property in the centre of Rotterdam, a
block of three good-sized one and two-bed flats, is Fl 144,400,
approximately Pounds 48,000.
Why so cheap?
Most people rent rather than buy in the Netherlands; and rents are held low
 -a three-bedroomed flat, can be rented for as little as Pounds 90 a month.
This is in the 'controlled' market, in which rents are set by the government
according to a point system, and index-linked.
About 80 per cent of all Dutch property falls into this category. The rest -
owner-occupied or rented - is in the free market where the rules of supply
and demand apply. Only rented properties commanding a monthly rent over a Fl
730 (Pounds 240) threshold fall into this latter category.
Of the properties rented, most are owned by institutions - insurance
companies, pension funds and so on - that went into construction in a big
way around the time of world war two, building row after row of dull,
functional apartment blocks for the rental market.
Until a few years ago, Dutch institutions investing in property had no
choice but to do so within Dutch borders. When this restriction was lifted
many off loaded residential property to finance diversification abroad.
Whole blocks, even streets of properties are available to the private
investor.
'There's a high potential for the individual investor to realise large
capital gain on the resale of vacant property,' explains Simon Malster of
Osbornes Solicitors. 'But,' he says, wary of the British paranoia of sitting
tenants, 'the investment doesn't rely on the expectation of selling
vacant-flats. You make money even keeping the tenants.'
In his view Rotterdam is the place to be. It is not as pretty as Amsterdam,
but there are ambitious plans for its development, property is cheap and
rental yields - at about 9 per cent - are high enough to cover a 50 per cent
mortgage.
He says that as the years pass it grows easier. Rents may have been set
decades ago, but when a tenant leave a new controlled rent is determined.
This may be 50 per cent to 100 per cent more. Changes of tenant mean net
annual yields can be pushed up to 14 or 15 per cent.
Even where a tenant remains in occupation the rent is increased, by law, by
a minimum of 5.5 per cent a year.
Generally the rent pays off a 50 per cent mortgage in seven to ten years.
So what is the catch?
There could be periods when you are without a tenant and rental income, but
this is unlikely in Rotterdam where there is a two-year waiting list.
Interest rates might go up, but fixed-rate mortgages are easy to arrange.
Rates in the Netherlands are about 10.5 per cent. There is no currency risk
since the rental income and mortgage are both in guilders. Only when you
repatriate the proceeds is there an exchange rate risk.
The investment should be looked at over five years, suggests Malster. The
Dutch government recently lowered the ceiling for controlled rents and could
cut it further. This, together with rising rents, means that more and more
properties will topple into the free market.
There is no capital gains tax in the Netherlands for the small investor.
Rents, however, will be taxed as income, and if you are resident in the UK
you cannot offset interest payable on the mortgage against rental income.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Property: Deep in the Italian countryside - a village
prepares to dance again - Audrey Powell meets a developer who stumbled on an
opportunity in Le Marche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS rare in these recession-ridden times for a developer to promote a
project and come out on the winning side.
David Coates is a director of Edinburgh-based design consultants McIlroy
Coates (which planned the bookshop in the new Sainsbury wing of London's
National Gallery).
He and his wife, picture restorer Josephine Maxwell, decided to buy a
holiday retreat in Italy. They discovered the Le Marche region, east of
Umbria, green and hilly and reaching to the Adriatic,
The Coates looked at a dozen houses, but none was right. Then they were
shown a large property with dusty-terracotta coloured walls and faded blue
shutters. It was locked. This was late evening. They could not see inside.
But this, in its rural setting, was the house they wanted.
By now they had learnt of the usefulness of a geometra, whom David Coates
describes as 'part architect, part quantity surveyor, part planning
consultant' - a profession with no direct equivalent in Britain. The
geometra had shown them the properties and explained that with the
blue-shuttered house, once the home of an Italian general, came three vacant
farm houses, one inhabited farm and 100 acres. It was beyond the Coates'
budget.
They returned to Scotland and put advertisements in several newspapers. The
geometra took his own line of action. He asked the tenant farmer if he would
like to buy the farm - for a fraction of its worth.
He offered agricultural land, similarly cheaply, to tenants or neighbouring
farmers. Deals were struck.
Coates, also asking attractive prices, found buyers through friends or the
advertisements, for the dilapidated farm houses, with suitable amounts of
land. One went to an accountant, another to the head of a midlands green
grocery chain.
In five months the estate was split and sold and Coates had effectively
bought his own house, and the six acres he kept, for nothing. However, the
old property, with its cellars with huge casks for wine and presses for
extracting olive oil, its numerous rooms with brick-paved floors, will need
a host of modern additions to turn to the home they visualise and will take
a lot of money.
Meanwhile, friends, and friends-of-friends, kept asking Coates about the
Italian properties that he was 'offering for knockdown prices.'
Coates asked the geometra to look for something suitable for another
project. He came up with an abandoned hamlet, deep in the Marche
countryside, called Campodanzo ('field of dance'). Its 40 acres include a
collection of rural buildings, some 200 years old, which Coates is turning
into 15 mostly small and mainly detached leisure homes, grouped in two
sections.
As is the practice in much of Europe, the land and property had been passed
down through families and ownership had become fragmented. It took the
geometra a year to trace the 23 people who had rights over the property and
get them to agree to sell.
Then planning matters had to be dealt with. Coates, in his new part-time
occupation of developer, is using local materials, local tradesmen and
traditional building materials and the authorities are happy to see the
hamlet come to life again. It has been empty for 25 years.
Campodanzo is for those who like a true country setting. Its meadows sweep
down to a shallow river in a gorge. Its fields produce up to three crops a
year. Plums, apricots, apples, figs and vines grow close to the houses.
There is the scent of jasmine. The occasional bat is disturbed . . .
The houses take their shapes from the original uses of the buildings and all
are different. Some were always cottages, some were homes where animals
occupied the ground level. Some were barns.
They are mostly of stone with beamed ceilings and interior shutters, They
are getting modern kitchens, bathrooms, double-glazing. Each property will
have a small private garden area. Prices range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds
98,000 for one to three bedrooms.
There will be swimming pools and tennis courts, hidden in woods where sounds
of their use will not annoy residents.
Ownership of the properties is freehold. The land and amenities are owned
jointly. A maintenance company to look after these will be run by the
geometra and there will be an annual charge.
A nearby village caters for simple needs. A little farther away are such as
like Sarnano, which has both its boutiques and its restored 'old town.'
The nearest beach is about 45 minutes from Campodanzo and there are ski
slopes about 30 minutes in the opposite direction.
In summer charter flights go from Gatwick (London) to Ancona, an hour's
drive from the estate. Scheduled flights go to Rimini, two hours' drive
away, and Bologna, half an hour further.
Coates says he can catch the daily 2pm Sabena flight from Edinburgh to
Brussels, then fly on to Bologna. With the two-and-a-half-hour motorway
drive, he can be at his property near Campodanzo, by 10.30 pm. The return
fare is Pounds 250.
Italy's autostrada network is being extended. Within a few years links
should be built from the route along the Adriatic coast across to Assisi and
Perugia and the Rome-Florence autostrada, to bring Le Marche further out of
obscurity.

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (5): The FT Top 100 resorts - Arnold Wilson's
guide to the most perfect pistes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON

ALTA
Even all the blood once spilt in countless bar-room brawls and shoot-outs
(eg at the Bucket Of Blood Saloon) could not soak up Alta's 'greatest snow
on earth.' Once a lawless Utah mining town destroyed by fire and avalanche,
Alta's reputation is now whiter-than-white. When the snow - sometimes as dry
as talcum powder after crossing the US West Coast deserts - falls deep, Alta
is a mecca for ski-bums. It is criss-crossed with chutes and bowls and
secret powder caches within hiking distance of Wildcat, Supreme, Westward Ho
and Eagles Nest. But there is plenty of good skiing for beginners and
intermediates too, and it has one of the cheapest lift passes in the
Rockies.
Heights: Resort 8,500 ft. Skiing: 10,550 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
25% Intermediate 40% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 32 miles from Salt Lake City
airport.
LES ARCS
Les Arcs is a great ski area posing as merely a good one. It is probably
France's most innovative resort, known principally for its Flying Kilometre
Olympic course, which recreational skiers can try from a half-way stage, and
 -at the other end of the scale - the ski evolutif short-ski learning
programme, which the resort pioneered. In the middle ground, Les Arcs has
dozens of fast cruising runs and its off-piste is virtually limitless. The
long run down to Villaroger is one of the classic off-piste descents in the
alps, and its focal mountain - the Aiguille Rouge - has superb off-piste
runs off both shoulders. One of the classic purpose-built resorts, Les Arcs
is built on three levels: 1,600, 1,800 and 2,000.
Heights: Resort 5,904 ft Skiing 10,580 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 17 per
cent Intermediate 49 per cent Advanced 34 per cent
ALPE D'HUEZ
The Dauphine region is not as well known as the Tarentaise resorts, but Alpe
d'Huez and its neighbour Les Deux Alpes are unquestionably major ski
resorts. Alpe d'Huez is a large, sunny, many-splendoured expanse of
enormously varied skiing with half a dozen different areas containing
everything from dramatic off-piste, long, steep black runs, swooping
motorway skiing, and gentle nursery slopes. The focal point is the Pic
Blanc, from which gloriously long off piste itineraries right down to the
village can be attempted. There are also off-piste of unusual quality right
down to the villages of Oz en Oisans and Vaujany. The Pic Blanc is the
starting point for some of the longest black runs in the alps including the
Sarenne, which ten miles long. La Combe du Loup is another tough, long black
run with an even tougher variant, the Chateau Noir. The Signal area - linked
with Villard-Reculas - will excite intermediates who want to bomb in wide
open spaces.
Heights: Resort 6,100 ft Skiing 10,998 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 65 per
cent, Intermediate 23 per cent, Advanced 12 per cent.
ST ANTON
Most Austrian resorts are moderate in size and big on Alpine charm. St Anton
is not typical. Austria's No 1 resort spirals alongside the mainline route
from Switzerland to Italy (you can travel home from the slopes on the
Venice-Simplon Orient Express) and although far from charmless it is too
towny to be quintessential picture postcard material, although its near
neighbour and tiny satellite St Christoph is as delicate and pretty as St
Anton is big and bustling.
There are compensations however. The skiing and scenery are outstanding. Of
the four main areas, the most sought-after is the Valuga, which is networked
with meaty red runs and testing blacks. And for those with nerves of steel
there is a little known route down to Zurs via the North Face which is
accessed by a small yellow cable car in which you can only travel if
accompanied by a qualified high-mountain guide.
Some of the lifts in St Anton - such as the Schindlerspitze - seem to have
been constructed in mind-bogglingly difficult but awe-inspiringly beautiful
terrain.
Heights: Resort 4,210 ft. Skiing: 9,222 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 30%
Intermediate 52% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich. Mainline
station in St Anton. (606 miles from Calais).
ARGENTIERE/CHAMONIX
Is this famous French area the greatest show on ice? Many keen skiers regard
Argentiere's Grands Montets as the best ski mountain in Europe, particularly
in powder. For slightly less intrepid skiers, one of the many other ski
areas dotted around the spectacular Chamonix Valley - such as Brevent,
Flegere and Les Houches - is bound to offer appropriate terrain.
Much of Argentiere is off-piste. If you ski the top section you are on the
glacier and there is a danger from crevasses. If you plan to ski it
properly, a guide will considerably enhance your chances of pleasure - and
survival.
One of the highlights is the possibility of venturing - at your guide's
discretion - into the edge of the Argentiere Glacier. There are places near
the Point de Vue where you can ski a little way through the surreal,
dreamlike ice-scape of seracs - a sort of petrified forest of ice-blocs. The
challenging Pas de chevre (Goat's Hop) is one of Europe's classics, leading
down to the Mer de Glace, a dramatic glacier that forms a border between the
skiing at Argentiere and the Vallee Blanche, Chamonix's best known run. This
is a spectacular and quite gruelling off-piste descent although the skiing
itself is not difficult. It enables intermediates to enjoy one of the
longest (13 miles) and most scenic off-piste adventures without having to
worry too much about technique. A guide is essential because of crevasse
danger.
Heights: Resort 4,067 ft. Skiing: 12,431 ft. Difficulty of runs: On piste:
Beginner 10% Intermediate 70% Advanced 20%. Off-piste: 100%
intermediate/advanced. Transfer: 1+ hours from Geneva. Train station in
Chamonix (562 miles from Calais).
ARABBA
Although not a large resort - the population is only around 350 and tourist
beds are scarce - Arabba is perhaps the best of the rest (after Selva and
Cortina) of the huge collection of ski resorts that form the central crown
of the Italian Dolomites, the Sella Ronda. Arabba, at the base of the
spectacular Sella Massif, is linked with the Passo Pordoi (with good
off-piste opportunities on the Gruppo Sella) and Alta Badia. The resort is
one of the main calling points for skiers doing the Sella circuit, and its
north-facing mountain provides a number of long and quite breathtaking runs.
Heights: Resort 5,254 ft. Skiing: 9,676 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 41 %
Intermediate 45% Advanced 14%. Transfer: Approx 4 hours from Verona, 6 hours
from Milan, Munich or Treviso. (766 miles from Calais).
THE ASPENS
For all the American glitz and hype, Aspen is difficult to hate and easy to
love. It can't help its starry image and it is trying to get rid of it
rather than scare jetless mortals away with its perceived 'don't bother to
come unless you're rich or famous' attitudes. These days Aspen is trying to
return just a little to its humble roots - or at least take itself a little
less seriously.
It was tatty and ramshackle enough when the early miners shivered in the
camp that was once called Ute City. Even its location - in Roaring Fork
Valley - sounds more like a TV soap opera than real life. But do go. The
skiing is great, the atmosphere is fun, the town is pretty and the natives
are actually quite friendly. They have to be if Aspen isn't to miss the bus.
With 'upstart' resorts like Breckenridge and Vail doing so well, Aspen has
had to own up to more than a touch of 'fat cat' arrogance in the past that
has alienated some of its clients - something even Aspen can ill-afford
during a recession.
There's only one town - with almost 100 restaurants offering every kind of
cuisine - but four separate resorts. The skiing at Aspen itself is on Aspen
Mountain - also known as Ajax. At the bottom of the mountain is Little
Nell's hotel, whose sundeck is the location for the nightly gathering of
skiers relaxing with their apres-ski drinks to the sound of heavy metal as
the sun goes down after a day of excitement on Ajax.
Seventy five picturesque trails are squeezed and cut into a fairly steep
forested mountain served by a fast, modern gondola, the Silver Queen. Many
are fast cruising runs like Copper Bowl, Spar Gulch and the exhilarating
Ruthie's: others are short, steep double-diamond (extra-difficult) mogul
chutes, like Zaugg Dump and Last Dollar, some of which were made by miners
shovelling debris down the slopes as they tunnelled into the mountain.
The next resort along - Aspen Highlands - is the maverick resort of the
four, the only one which is not controlled by the Aspen Ski Company. It's
hard-up, with old fashioned lifts, but it has the highest skiing - some
would say even the best, and with its view of the stunning Maroon Bells
range, the best scenery. The chutes, moguls and tree skiing on both sides of
the ridge around Steeplechase, (like Snyders Ridge and Sodbuster) and
Olympic Bowl are outstanding, and one steep trail, that gets steeper:
Deception. A cut-price lift pass is proving a big attraction.
The next resort is Tiehack-Buttermilk, a mountain tailor-made for beginners
but with secret powder caches where you might find a few wise skiers who
have drifted across surreptitiously from Aspen. Aspen's powder tends to get
'skied out' on the day it falls. If you know where to look at Tiehack, you
can find powder days after a snowfall.
Last of the four is Snowmass, a big all-round ski resort that is a lot less
fashionable and more recent than its famous neighbour, but now has more ski
visitors than the other three resorts put together. Known fundamentally as a
vast intermediate playground, Snowmass is famous for its Big Burn area,
which comprises several parallel runs (Whispering Jesse, Wineskin, Mick's
Gulley, Dallas Freeway, etc) which virtually merge to form one huge trail as
much as a mile across in places. It also has some severe chutes off The
Cirque and steep tree skiing in the Hanging Valley Glades. Unlike Aspen,
Snowmass also has some excellent nursery slopes.
Aspen: Heights: Resort 7,945 ft. Skiing: 11,212 ft Difficulty of runs:
Beginner 0% Intermediate 35% Advanced 65% Aspen Highlands: Heights: Resort
8,000 ft. Skiing: 11,800 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 23% Intermediate

Difficulty of runs: Beginner 9% Intermediate 51% Advanced 40%.
Tiehack/Buttermilk: Heights: Resort 7,870 ft. Skiing: 9,900 ft. Difficulty
of runs: All Beginner/Intermediate. Transfer: Aspen is 204 miles from
Denver. Local airport.
AVORIAZ
purpose-built resorts, Avoriaz, with its space-age architecture, is arguably
the most exciting. In good weather it has a colourful Riviera flavour, but
during its not infrequent and rather spooky white-outs the mist-shrouded
tower blocks of of its apartments pierce the heavens like some Martian film
set, giving it a sinister and surrealistic quality.
Avoriaz is the jewel in the crown of the vast Portes du Soleil region, a
circuit which takes in more than a dozen resorts along the French-Swiss
border. It is also the location for one of the classic decents - the
Chavanette, or Swiss wall, down into Les Crosets. The wall has a fairly
fearful reputation. It is in fact a very unforgiving long and steep mogul
field, where it is easy to fall, but not normally terribly dangerous except
for the problem of falling skiers crashing into others making better
progress. It is usually closed when conditions are seriously unpleasant.
Avoriaz and the rest of the Portes du Soleil provide endless terrain for
average-to-good skiers and the opportunity to enjoy the supreme satisfaction
of skiing endlessly from one resort to another. Conversely, off-piste
enthusiasts who might prefer quality to quantity will have a treat if they
can find the secret powder fields off the Ripaille above Chambery's Grand
Paradis area.
Heights: Resort 5,904 ft. Skiing: 7,743 ft. Beginner 18% Intermediate 64%
Advanced 18%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. (555 miles from Calais).
BAQUEIRA BERET
Roughly mid-way between the pounding Atlantic Ocean and the calmer waters of
the Mediterranean, locked in right against the French border in the remote
and rugged Valle de Aran in the Spanish Pyrenees is the resort of
Baqueira-Beret. Although purpose-built, the ski area - two villages
separated by five miles - is Spain's answer to Cortina, and the biggest in
the Pyrenees. it is also the most upmarket, complete with the obligatory
furs and Ferraris, and is not a cheap place to ski in. But being on the
northern side of the mountains - almost cut off from the rest of Spain but
with easy if spectacularly scenic access to France it does have one of the
best snow records in the region, plus made-made snow.
There is some engrossing skiing for all grades, mostly west-facing, but some
facing north. A new detachable quad chair, the Mirador Express, has been
installed. The ski area is in two halves, and both have a good assortment of
runs. The restaurants are excellent.
Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing: 8,235 ft. Runs: Easy 43% Intermediate 47%
Advanced 10%. Transfer: Nearest international airport: Tarbes.
BARILOCHE
Bariloche's ski area at Gran Catedral is South America's biggest and oldest
mechanised ski resort. (According to Chris Lizza's informative new South
American Ski Guide, the first cable-car bound for its slopes went down with
a cargo boat which was sunk in the Atlantic on its way from Italy in 1939.)
Half way down the vast length of the magnificent Andes, close to Lake Nahuel
Huapi, the city of San Carlos de Bariloche has a decidedly cosmopolitan feel
about it.
Although the season normally runs from early June until early October,
Bariloche's snow record is not outstanding, either for quantity or quality.
With a maximum elevation of 6,725 feet and a fairly warm winter climate, the
slopes tend to experience snow that is heavy and soft. But with 32 lifts and
50 runs, it is a significant resort. Most of the runs are intermediate, but
advanced skiers will be able to enjoy high-speed cruising on the upper
slopes. The city of Bariloche is 12 miles from the slopes (there is a
regular bus service) but there are lodging facilities at the resort base.
Bariloche Heights: Resort 3,378 ft. Skiing: 6,725 ft. Difficulty of runs:
Easy 15% Intermediate 65% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 10 miles from Bariloche.
1,048 miles from Buenos Aires.
BEAVER CREEK
Even newer and more up-market than its big Colorado sister, Vail, Beaver
Creek is like a scaled-down version of its neighbour - nine miles away -
without the bowls. It is a fairly straightforward, slightly sanitised
resort, with uncomplicated fast skiing on superbly-groomed slopes. The
toughest runs are the so-called Birds Of Prey, with trail names like Golden
Eagle, Peregrine and Goshawk. Last winter the resort added 100 acres of
intermediate/advanced skiing on Grouse Mountain, served by a new high-speed
quad chair. Further expansion is in the pipeline.
Like Vail, Beaver Creek has an entire area devoted to special runs for
children. Children and adults get a complimentary cup of hot chocolate to
start the day. Other highlights are the restaurant where they enquire 'may
we choreograph your meal now?' at Beano's Cabin which is reached after dark
by snowcat-driven sleighs, and Trapper's - a small, luxurious and expensive
cabin where you can dine on such delicacies as buffalo and rattlesnake meat,
soak yourself in a hot whirlpool under the stars and spend the night in
splendid isolation without the distraction of television or telephone.
Heights: Resort 8,100 ft. Skiing: 11,440 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
23% Intermediate 43% Advanced 34%. Transfer: 110 miles from Denver. Avon
Stolport 1 mile.
BORMIO
Bormio is an unpretentious but interesting old spa resort at the foot of the
Stelvio pass in a remote corner of Lombardy. It has a considerable amount of
honest-to-goodness intermediate slopes in a sunny, sheltered bowl, with some
unusually long runs - including an enjoyable off-piste descent to
neighbouring Santa Caterina - and some excellent summer skiing terrain.
Oddly, perhaps, the Which? Good Skiing Guide claims Bormio is short of both
easy runs and tough runs: that the 'easy' runs are a bit tough for skiers
just off the nursery slopes, and the more difficult ones are only a
challenge when they become icy. They have a point, but many people have
learned to ski quite happily in Bormio, and it gets considerable repeat
business among an affectionate clientele.
Facilities - particularly lifts and snowmaking - were spruced up for the
1985 World Championships. Most of the important skiing takes place on Monte
Vallecetta, where the top of the cable car at Cima Bianca is known as Bormio
3000. (The middle stage is Bormio 2000.) The run from top to bottom is 14
kilometres long. As well as Santa Caterina, the even more remote resort of
Livigno is also on the lift pass, and you can also have a day's excursion
across the Swiss border into St Mortiz. The old village centre, with its
cobbled streets, is delightful.
Heights: Resort 4,018 ft. Skiing: 9,095 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 38%
Intermediate 50% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 4+ hours from Milan. (Other
airports: Verona, Bergamo). (716 miles from Calais).
BRECKENRIDGE
How British skiers relish American trail names in the Rockies] In
Breckenridge, strong skiers can ski Devil's Crotch and Mineshaft on Peak 9,
Goodbye Girl and Psychopath on Peak 8 and Blackhawk and Mustang on Peak 10.
There are many more Britons here than there were native Americans during the
post gold-rush days when the population was reduced to just seven people and
it became a ghost town. The British are - or certainly were until the
sterling crisis - buying up condominiums here faster than any other non-US
nations.
Breckenridge, Colorado, is the focal point of the Ski The Summit area that
takes in Copper Mountain, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin on the same lift pass.
Its three mountains have well over 100 trails between them. A blueprint for
a fourth, Peak 7 is on the drawing board.
Peak 8, the first mountain to open, offers a good mix of terrain, plus the
highest resort skiing in America - at a couple of feet below 13,000 feet -
in the newly opened up Imperial Bowl. Peak 9 tends to be easier and 10, with
some good tree-skiing in The Burn, more difficult. Breckenridge also has a
charmingly renovated mainstreet. Stop Press; Breckenridge is up for sale.
Heights: Resort 9,603 ft. Skiing: Just under 13,000 ft. Difficulty of runs:
Beginner 21% Intermediate 32% Advanced 47%. Transfer: 85 miles from Denver.
CERVINIA
Cervinia is a rather bleak, not terribly pretty Italian resort that most
people know about because of skiing excursions from Zermatt, just across the
Swiss border. Unfortunately it is not a mirror image of Zermatt.
The celebrated Matterhorn, or Mont Cervin, from which the resort takes its
name, is 'built the wrong way round' and looks pretty uninspiring compared
with the 'real thing.' The lift system is somewhat antiquated and there can
be an irritating amount of queueing.
However, Cervinia has some long, sunny slopes ('such marvellous geriatric
skiing' was one reader's comment). And of course just as skiers in Zermatt
can reach the resort (unless bad weather interferes with the connection) via
Europe's highest cable-car on the Klein Matterhorn or the Theodul Glacier,
the whole expedition can be done in reverse. And perhaps surprisingly -
mountain restaurant prices in Cervinia are sometimes so steep that lunch in
Zermatt can actually be cheaper.
Heights: Resort 6,760 ft. Skiing: 11,500 ft Difficulty of runs: Easy 34%
Intermediate 50% Advanced 16%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Turin. (Other
airports: Milan, Geneva). (625 miles from Calais).
CHATEL
Although Chatel/Super Chatel is a good entry point to the vast Portes du
Soleil ski area which runs along the borders of France and Switzerland, it
is also the circuit's weakest link.
When approached in reverse it does not really connect, and you have to walk
or take a bus. Chatel, a much expanding old Savoyarde village with some
excellent restaurants is, however, a picturesque ski resort.
The Linga valley is particularly good. It includes a breathtaking gun-barrel
run on which skiers can execute big giant slalom turns all the way down. On
the negative side, the homeward runs from Super Chatel, which are south
facing, can become very patchy. The town is slightly spoilt by having a fair
amount of through traffic, but there's a free navette service to help skiers
get about. The other Portes du Soleil resorts are fairly close at hand.

COPPER MOUNTAIN
Copper Mountain in Colorado - once a copper mining centre - is a rather
unattractive purpose-built village: an uninspiring, drab collection of brown
brick buildings and the least pretty of the Summit County resorts. But
there's some attractive skiing, neatly 'arranged' strategically so that the
more difficult of Copper's 76 trails, like Formidable, are on the left, easy
slopes like Loverly are on the right and intermediate trails are in the
middle.
Reasonable skiers can try trails like Copperopolis or Oh No in the middle
area, moving left or right depending on whether they want to change up or
down. There's also an exciting Extreme Experience area of bowl, glade and
tree skiing - once the exclusive haunt of the ski patrol - off the back of
Copper Peak. Experts who do not want to take young children down such
difficult terrain can leave them at the Belly Button Nursery.

COURMAYEUR
On a superficial level, Courmayeur in Italy is a smallish resort above an
attractive, medium sized town with a big cable car - somewhat lacking in
breadth and vertical drop, though there is quite a testing 12 kilometre run
down to Dolonne. There are one or two reasonably challenging runs in
Checrouit/Cresta d'Arp - and some inspiring scenery. it is the scenery that
gives a clue to one big gun the resort has up its sleeve: Mont Blanc. This
great hulk of a mountain overlooking Courmayeur's slopes brings all kinds of
interesting possibilities into play.
The Italian version of France's famous 18-kilometre Vallee Blanche off-piste
excursion is achieved by taking another cable car from Entreves. Elsewhere,
there is some goodish helicopter skiing to be had at nearby Valgrisensche.
Epicurians will be fascinated with a different sort of Entreves challenge -
how to consume a 36-course meal at the Maison de Filippo. Courmayeur is
good-food country, with excellent restaurants both on and off the slopes.
One major snag - you cannot ski back to town. You have to take that giant
cable car both ways.

CORTINA
It is often said that many people who visit glitzy ski resorts such as
Cortina in Italy have not the slightest intention of skiing. Late in the
afternoon, as the sun dips behind the Dolomites, you will find the main
pedestrian precinct, the Corso Italia, crowded with beautiful people wearing
the inevitable jewellery and ubiquitous fur coats - but surprisingly few of
them seem to find their way to the slopes the following morning.
The skiing is largely intermediate and widely spread out in beautiful
surroundings. There are four main ski areas. Faloria, which links with
Cristallo/Staunies, an exhilarating, quite steep but wide gulley, is
probably the most easily accessible from to the town and therefore one of
the most popular. Tofana, Pocol and Socrepes are also linked and can also be
reached from town. Some of the more testing skiing is at Cinque Tori and
Lagazuoi and the upper section of Cristallo. Cortina is also part of the
vast Dolomiti Super Ski area which can be skied with one lift pass.
Heights: Resort 4,078 ft. Skiing: 10,543 ft. Difficulty of runs:

CRANS MONTANA
Crans Montana is a wonderfully sun-drenched, wide-open picturesque and
rather expensive Swiss ski resort perched above the Rhone Valley - roughly
mid-way between the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc - where you can ski fast and
furiously with great gusto in a giant, largely treeless arena which contains
a hundred miles of pistes. However, apart from a handful of black runs, it
has rather a lack of seriously testing slopes.
One of the most spectacular is the Faverge off-piste run from the very top
of the ski area at Plaine Morte (the 9,840 feet glacier from where Arnold
Lunn launched the nine-mile long precursor of the Kandahar race) all the way
down to the neighbouring resort of Aminona - a vertical drop of almost 5,000
feet. Crans, the posher of the two, with most of the smart boutiques, and
Montana, the older and more rustic, have merged and now form what is claimed
to be the largest ski resort in Switzerland. The resort is reputed to have
more five-star hotels than Gstaad.

CRESTED BUTTE
A real Jekyll and Hyde resort, although the Hyde section - dramatic terrain
called the Extreme Limits - lurks out of harm's way above the normal ski
area. Families and intermediates gliding around on much less daunting slopes
below need never be aware of the thrills and terrors associated with the
dramatic change in the character of the terrain around the North Face and
recently opened Headwall.
Like Steamboat, Crested Butte (a butte is a solitary mountain) has an
attractive old wild-west town - scarcely more than a village - a mile or so
from the ski resort. It is colourful and rustic, with quaint old bars hotels
and shops all snuggling up together and a delightful frontier town
atmosphere. Although you can fly there direct in 20 minutes from Aspen in a
light aircraft - past the Maroon Bells and some of the most stunning peaks
in Colorado - Crested Butte is in a remote corner of Colorado and winters
used to be hard for the miners. Now they are good for skiers.

DAVOS
Davos - one of quite a few resorts claiming to be the cradle of skiing  -
also claims to be the highest ski town in Europe and Switzerland's largest
ski resort.
Sprawling pleasantly enough along a picturesque valley in Eastern
Switzerland, there is little of the cowbell-and-yodelling flavour normally
associated with a traditional Swiss ski resort. The five skiing areas,
however, are extensive - but considerably spread out. Only the famous
Parsenn area and Schatzalp-Strelapass are linked and, as in St Moritz, it is
as well to have a car at your disposal, although there are trains and buses.
The Parsenn is a huge network of runs almost the size of Manhattan,
including one long excursion all the way from the Weissfluhjoch to Kublis,
14 kilometres away. Other pistes lead down to neighbouring Klosters. Two
separate mountains, the Jakobshorn and Rinerhorn, provide some good skiing,
with some testing off-piste runs on the back of Rinerhorn.

DEER VALLEY
Deer Valley in Utah is Park City's new neighbour (it only opened in 1981)
and the villages are like chalk and cheese. Deer Valley is much prettier,
with a preponderence of evergreens and far fewer aspens. It is also built to
pander: many of its clients are well-heeled and getting on in years. It is
not just the two mountains - Bald Mountain and Bald Eagle Mountain - that
are going thin on top. A third mountain  - Flagstaff - is available for
snowcat skiing. Holidaymakers' skis are collected and returned the following
morning by 'ski valets.' But such a product has to be paid for and the lift
pass is more expensive than most, having already broken through the Dollars
40 a day barrier last winter.
However, it would be wrong to think of Deer Valley as just smooth-as-silk
easy skiing. There are a couple of black runs and more than 60 acres of bowl
skiing. Good food is one of the few things to lure skiers of the slopes
here. America's Bon Appetit magazine said not long ago that 'Deer valley has
the best cuisine at any altitude anywhere in this country.'

FLAINE
Poor old Flaine. Traditionally it has always borne the brunt of criticism
over purpose-built French resorts, with claims that it is 'even uglier' than
Tignes, Les Menuires or the worst excesses of La Plagne. But much as La
Plagne started doing some years ago, Flaine is now building any fresh
accommodation in a much gentler, 'sympa' style - hence the new Le Hameau
development just two kilometres away from the original rather charmless
concrete village centre at Flaine Foret.
Ugly or not, Flaine is a great favourite with British skiers, and the resort
is celebrated for its children's facilities. Only 90 minutes or so from
Geneva, the Grand Massif area has a lot of honest-to-goodness skiing with
some unusually good off-piste (a guide is vital because some of the
off-piste areas are honeycombed with pot-holes). Though most of Flaine's
skiing is above the tree-line there are some delightful runs through the
trees down to the more traditional villages of Samoens and Les Carroz.

FLIMS LAAX
Still little known outside Switzerland, Flims Laax is a widely-spread and
attractive resort with a lot of quite testing slopes, balanced by a
considerable amount of happy-go-lucky skiing and a vertical drop of more
than 6,000 feet. Some of its best slopes are at La Siala, in the middle of
the joint ski terrain with some scorching long cruising runs. Experts will
be drawn to one particular area on the Laax side and another above Flims.
There is a classic long black run, Plaun Grond down from the Vorab glacier
to Midada Sut, and across the valley at Cassons Grat the cable car opens up
a huge, wide-open and exhilarating off-piste area with any number of
variations.
Flims - the prettier of the two villages - and Laax have formed a slightly
uneasy alliance. They still tend to argue over whose name should come first,
and have settled for Flims Laax in the winter and Laax Flims in the summer.
They are also linked with Falera, a delightfully rustic and picturesque
little satellite which is prettier than both of them.

FORMIGAL
Formigal is a rather bleak and windy purpose-built resort high in western
region of the Pyrenees above the old village of Sallent de Gallego.
Nevertheless, it has some of the best skiing in Spain, both on and
off-piste. Spain or not, on a cold day there can be a touch of Ice Station
Zebra about the small, one horse-town where apart from eating well and
getting drunk (alcohol is cheap) there is very little else to do apart from
ski.
But when all is bright and beautiful there are magnificent views across the
central Pyrenees, stretching across the Midi d'Ossau and Picos del Inferno.
The ski fields are wide-open pastures, uninterrupted by obstacles, offering
good cruising and some magical off-piste opportunities in numerous gullies,
nooks and crannies. Excellent intermediate runs almost five miles long
descend from the Pico Tres Hombres. Although small, the ski village has some
high quality hotels, especially the Formigal and Tyrolean-style Eguzki-Lore.

THE GASTEIN VALLEY
There are so many Gasteins in this beautiful Austrian Salzburgerland valley
 -from the pretty village of Dorfgastein at 2,755 feet to the chillier
slopes of Sportgastein with skiing up to 8,800 feet on the Kreuzkogel - that
it is less confusing just to call it the Gastein Valley. In between Dorf,
with its friendly, tree-clad slopes, and Sport are Bad Hofgastein and the
most interesting of all, Badgastein, famous as a spa resort for 600 years,
clinging to a steep hillside, through which the River Ache bubbles and
cascades.
The skiing is spread out across wide-open and sunny slopes, with a lot of
quite easy off-piste terrain. The toughest runs are off the Stubnerkogel and
Kreuzkogel at Sportgastein, and on the wooded slopes of the Graukogel on the
other side of the valley above Badgastein. The Schlossalm, a large bowl
above the tree line, provides most of Bad Hofgastein's skiing.

GUDAURI
Skiing in the Caucasus used to be - and in some resorts probably still is -
a fairly primitive affair with ancient lift equipment that frequently broke
down and spilt oil on your ski-suit. Gudauri has changed all that. The
Austrians built a new hotel complex, and installed a handful of
state-of-the-art Doppelmayr lifts. The Georgians added a couple of rather
ponderous, unwieldy and ancient ex-military Mir helicopters and the scene
was set for an exciting new ski resort, with the options of piste skiing,
helicopter skiing and even ski touring into one or two fascinating and
remote local villages.
Then the problems started. Within a matter of weeks the two helicopters were
involved in separate incidents, killing one young Austrian guide and
seriously injuring a flight technician and two Austrian tourists. Better
helicopters have been introduced, but because of the current unsettled
regime in Tbilisi - the gateway to Gudauri - the situation is unpredictable.
However, when the dust finally settles in the Georgian capital, Gudauri
should go from strength to strength as the showpiece of the Caucasus.

GRINDELWALD
Just as Zermatt has its Matterhorn, Grindelwald in Switzerland has its
Eiger, but if anything the impact of Europe's most famous North Wall is more
dramatic because it is so much closer to the village and is also flanked by
two more giants - the Jungfrau and Munch (Monk). The local skiing on First
is fun but a little limited. Fortunately Grindelwald shares much of its back
yard with neighbouring Wengen, so overall there is quite a lot of good,
robust but not terribly challenging skiing.
To all but the keenest skiers, however, the lack of really testing terrain
seems to be a minor consideration when you offset it with such breathtaking
scenery, fascinating history concerning the conquest of the mountains by
climbers and railway engineers, and quintessential Swiss-ness.
Heights: Resort 3,393 ft. Skiing: 8,157 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 33%

GSTAAD
In Gstaad, it is claimed, 'every guest is a king, but kings are only
guests.' Nice thought - but unfortunately skiers here are not kings, and
occasionally even paupers. Poor old Gstaad (though hardly poor - or cheap -
in cash terms). It is one of the great 'in-places' to ski, yet it has one of
the most indifferent local ski areas.
There are some quite decent runs on the Wasserngrat, close to the resort's
famous Eagle Club - perhaps the most expensive and exclusive luncheon club
in the world - and parts of Wispile are testing. But fortunately Gstaad can
share the glory of a whole network of satellite resorts in the Gstaad
Superski region like Saanenmoser and Videmanette, above Rougemont, and thus
convey the illusion that it has better skiing than than in reality it does.
Because of its reputation as a trendy place in which to be seen, this is a
very fortunate arrangement that spares its blushes as a ski resort. At
around 3,500 feet, Gstaad is quite low, but is fortunate to have the
Diablerets Glacier reasonably close to hand. Here, at 10,000 feet there is
excellent skiing. And when the snow is limited in Gstaad, the glacier can be
a godsend, though it is prone to be shut during bad weather.

HAPPO ONE
This charming and impressive ski resort in the Japan Alps has been chosen to
host the 1998 Winter Olympics with Shiga Kogen. Happo One - pronounced
'Happony' - is one of the few resorts in Japan capable of staging a decent
Men's Downhill. It is the best of a string of resorts in the spectacular
Hakuba Valley.
The village - a maze of narrow streets with colourful quasi-European shops
and bars - is most attractive, although skiers on foot and two-way traffic
causes severe congestion after the lifts have closed. Each resort in the
valley has a fire festival, when instructors carrying fiery torches give a
breathtaking display of synchronised skiing under floodlights. Some of them
leap through blazing hoops, while at the bottom of the mountain the
enthralled crowds watch to the accompaniment of hypnotic tribal drumming.

HEAVENLY
Of the 15 ski resorts surrounding Lake Tahoe, Heavenly has perhaps the
finest views of this magnificent stretch of cobalt blue water. Heavenly is
also the only resort that is in both California and Nevada. The border runs
along the ridge at the top of Monument Peak from where you look down on the
lake to your left and the rather less heavenly but no less inspiring
prospect of the Nevada desert to the right.
Apart from an entertaining selection of solid intermediate cruising runs on
both sides the Nevada side has recently opened up a tougher area, Mott
Canyon (for 'super experts') which is a lot of fun. In good powder
conditions, Heavenly is celebrated for its magnificent tree skiing, but the
snow in California isn't always light enough. Because gambling is only legal
in Nevada most of the apres ski action takes place in South Lake Tahoe.

INNSBRUCK
Although the beautiful Austrian city of Innsbruck itself is not really a ski
resort as such, it is surrounded by dramatic mountains and a lot of good
skiing - 65 miles of runs altogether, served by 35 lifts. And Innsbruck
staged the Winter Olympics in 1964 and in 1976, when Franz Klammer stormed
to glory in the downhill at Igls. From the Hungerburg plateau there is a
stunning view across the city and a very severe descent back to the
outskirts of Innsbruck which should be attempted only by experts. Axamer
Lizum, which staged the slalom events and the women's downhill, has 20 miles
of skiing, and there are some quite challenging runs at Igls-Patscherkofel.

ISCHGL
Ischgl in Austria has been described as coming close to having the perfect
ingredients for a ski resort, combining the best aspects of French, Austrian
and Italian skiing: plenty of long, fast and comparitively undemanding
skiing, the kind of snow reliability you normally hope for in Val
d'Isere/Tignes, the village charm of Alpbach, and the apres-ski vitality of
St Anton, all combined with the drinks prices of Livigno.
And what of the Swiss? They have not been missed out, because part of this
wonderful, swooping, wide-open ski area (sunny but like most exposed areas,
sometimes chilly too) with an exhilarating 4,000 foot vertical drop actually
crosses the wooded Swiss border into Samnaun, where duty-free prices really
do rival Livigno's.
As for charm, the smaller resort of neighbouring Galtur - once a haunt of
Ernest Hemingway - has more of the Alpbach flavour, although even Galtur's
ski terrain has doubled in size in recent years, and is probably better than
Ischgl for nursery slopes and a lack of queueing.

ISOLA 2000
Only 56 miles from Nice, and the most southerly of the main French resorts
(Isola offers self-catering clients a week's free accommodation next time if
the sun doesn't shine for three days) Isola is set high in the Chastillon
Valley, and from the top of Sistron at over 8,500 feet, there is a
remarkable view stretching from the Mediterranean to Mont Blanc. Isola has a
surprisingly good snow record. Another good gimmick comes into play if it
fails: there is a daily refund on the lift pass if it is not possible to ski
back to the village.
With well over 100 kilometres of pistes, Isola has plenty of scope for
beginners - who can take advantage of the ski evolutif (short ski) method -
with a few more testing runs through the trees at Mont Mene.
The adjoining Saint Sauveur area also has some more difficult terrain. Isola
 -purpose-built by a British property company and still popular with British
family skiers - even has night skiing once a week. Like other purpose-built
resorts trying, with hindsight, to limit the damage, Isola has constructed
rather prettier areas such as Le Hameau and Les Adrets. A handsome new
Chalet Hotel, the Diva, has culinary links with La Gavroche, and Albert Roux
makes guest appearances in the kitchen.

JACKSON HOLE
The moment you reach the remote airport at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, your
senses are spellbound by a scene that has stunned generations of trappers
and then tourists: the vast, wide open 600 square mile valley floor is
punctured by the magnificent Teton mountains which rise like a tidal wave of
granite from nowhere.
It is these mountains - giant, snow-clad sharks' teeth that glint in the
mid-day sun - that make Jackson Hole such a magical place. It may not be the
best ski resort in the world (though some would say so) but Jackson is a
good candidate for being the most enjoyable, exciting and one of the most
beautiful.
The skiing is at Teton Village, about 12 miles from the Wild West town of
Jackson, with its cowboy bars and wooden sidewalks. Sadly, the slopes are
one of the places where you can't really see the Tetons. Rendezvous - a
graceful brute of a ski mountain full of gulleys, chutes and couloirs,
exhilarating cruising runs and steep untracked powder-fields (do not miss
the Hobacks) - is an extension of the range, and all but obscures the Teton
peaks.
Jackson's most famous couloir is Corbet's, which mesmerises most strong
skiers as soon as they glimpse it from the red Tram (cable car) on their way
to the top of Rendezvous. Skiers must jump at least 15 feet to enter
Corbet's. There is no disgrace in turning back.
There is plenty of excitement in Jackson without hurling yourself into
Corbet's. And for less ambitious skiers, neighbouring Rendezvous Mountain
has a good mixture of nursery slopes and exhilarating but fairly easy
cruising runs.
Heights: Resort 6,311 ft. Skiing: 10,450 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner

KEYSTONE
For many years Keystone had a reputation for being a slightly tame but fun
resort for families and beginners. But it always had a few difficult runs on
North Peak and those who wanted to ski steeper terrain could alweays head a
little way up the road to Arapahoe Basin, a small but funky satellite with
such high skiing that it doesn't close until May or June.
Now the recently opened Outback area offers still more interesting terrain
for strong skiers, and the resort is seeking permission from the National
Forest Service to open up another big new bowl area.
Keystone has the biggest night skiing area in North America and probably the
world, with more than 300 high-pressure sodium lights illuminating 13 trails
like giant glow-worms down a 2,340 foot vertical drop.
This means fanatical European skiers can actually travel all the way to
Keystone and ski on the same day that they left home.

KILLINGTON
Killington in Vermont is a snow factory. It starts making it as soon as
possible - as early as October - and keeps churning the stuff out in such
proportions that each of its six mountains has its own stockpile of snow.
The most extraordinary example is Outer Limits, which drops down from the
top of Bear Mountain for more than half a mile. The run would be difficult
enough to ski normally, but when piled high with artificial snow, it becomes
the toughest mogul run in the East.
However, of Killington's 77 miles of trails, more than half are classified
as easy - although when the weather turns seriously cold, as it does in
Vermont, even the easiest slopes can bear more resemblance to skating rinks
than ski runs.
One of Killington's problems is that it has individual establishments with
considerable charm, but the resort itself has no real heart. Among the more
intriguing restaurants is Charity's, with its exquisite cherrywood bar and
Italian marble pillars, imported from France more than a century ago, when
the wooden floor had to be replaced as often as six times a year because of
the hobnailed boots worn by lumberjacks. The Wobbly Barn is an infamous
nightspot worth at least one visit.

KITSBUHEL
Kitsbuhel in Austria is a permanently Christmassy ski resort of the
Ding-Dong Merrily On Low variety rather than the Silent Night breed. Without
people it would be immensely charming: it is a walled, medieval town, with
archways, cobbled streets, gabled houses and colour-washed facades, and some
quintessential Austrian tea-rooms and coffee shops offering the most
deliciously gooey cakes, of which Praxmair's is the most famous. Kitzbuhel
also tends to be noisy and boisterous, and its altitude (less than 2,500
feet) means it sometimes struggles for snow. The resort also has some
serious queueing problems.
There are four main skiing areas which means that with transport (free bus
service or own car) one can enter the ski circuit at the Fleckalm, Jochberg
or Pass Thurn lifts, thus sometimes avoiding the worst queues and getting
better snow conditions. Unfortunately a lot of other people often have the
same idea. Gung-ho skiers might want to try the feared Streif run on the
Hahnenkamm, but most of the skiing is friendly-intermediate.

KLOSTERS
it is difficult to escape the influence of Prince Charles in this pretty but
now slightly sprawling Swiss resort. Britain's most famous skier almost got
himself killed in an avalanche here. However, with or without the prince,
Klosters has a lot to offer. Indeed, the Gotschnawang run - quite close to
the scene of the avalanche - is not quite the terror it is made out to be.
What makes it dangerous is not the difficulty but its proneness to avalanche
 -hence its frequent closure.
Klosters has skiing on both sides of the valley. The Gotschnagrat is most
famous, and is effectively a major flank of the adjoining Davos skiing area.
There are a number of routes down from the famous Parsenn area. Skiers of
virtually all grades can make the descent using one route or another, but
the most challenging is Drostobel. On the other side are the sunny, wide
open slopes of Madrisa with predominantly relaxed skiing.

LA GRAVE
La Grave is a pretty French climbing village perched on the Col de Lautaret,
an extraordinarily beautiful steep-sided mountain pass which links Grenoble
with Serre Chevalier and Briancon. Towering above the village is a vast
expanse of ungroomed glacial wilderness, crowned by the mighty Meije (13,065
feet) and served by five linked gondolas which seem, when viewed from the
road, to be journeying in to the very heavens. They were built for climbers,
not skiers, but over the years La Grave has attracted skiers enthralled by
its breathtaking scenery, savage and remote beauty and huge vertical drop of
some 7,000 vertical feet.
To all intents and purposes, there are no pistes (there are a handful of
easy lifts right at the top to help a rather inconclusive connection with
Les Deux Alpes.) You must take a guide, perhaps from Les Deux Alpes or Alpe
d'Huez. There are several routes down, all spectacular and all gruelling,
though not really extreme.

LA PLAGNE
La (Grande) Plagne is a vast snowy wilderness dotted with ten villages that
between them cover the entire spectrum of traditional and purpose-built
French architecture, from genuine farming settlements like Montchavin to
pseudo-rustic such as Belle Plagne and brave-(but not beautiful)new-world,
of which the most dramatic and controversial is Aime-la-Plagne. The highest
of all the villages, Aime resembles a huge ocean-going liner that has gone
ashore. This is now generally recognised to be something of a carbuncle, and
some of the more recently added satellites have been designed in much more
traditional style.
Apart from the quite steep piste and off-piste skiing on the Bellecote
Galcier, which offers ten-mile-long runs going through a vertical drop of
6,500 feet, La Plagne is a genuine intermediate's paradise, with the vast
majority of its 100 or so runs coloured red.

LECH/ZURS
Zurs in Austria is tiny, remote, bleak and trendy. What there is of it is
packed with expensive hotels. Lech is bigger, considerably older, more real
 -and also expensive. The two Arlberg villages, five kilometres apart, share
some interesting - though largely intermediate  - skiing across three
mountains, some excellent off-piste (particularly from the Rufikopf) and
attract Austria's glitterati. The shared (clockwise only) circuit is about
20 kilometres long.
Zurs skiing is all above the tree line. Although Lech has some higher skiing
in its satellite, Oberlech, many of its own slopes are below the tree line,
which in bad weather - when the Zurs skiing can become distinctly unpleasant
 -can be a godsend. In Lech some of the more challenging slopes are off the
Zuger Hochlicht. In Zurs more advanced skiers would enjoy the runs down from
the Trittkopf cable car.

LAS LENAS
The Vall de las Lenas in Argentina's Mendoza Province, at the southern end
of the Alto Cordillera close to the Chilean border, has slightly grisly
connections: it is just ten miles south of the spot where a plane carrying
Uruguayan soccer players crashed in the 70s, after which some passengers
resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. Developed only a year after the end
of the Falklands conflict, it is probably the biggest ski area served by
lifts in the Americas.
Although Las Lenas means 'firewood' the wood it refers to are in bush form
rather than trees and the terrain is wide-open and bleak, with some superb
off-piste bowl skiing. Many of the runs are tough, and the weather
frequently is too. Winds can be extreme and accompanied by fierce blizzards
which bring avalanche danger. Some areas are often closed, so that it is
quite rare to be able to ski the entire area even if you had the stamina.
Heights: Resort 7,349 ft. Skiing: 11,253 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
25% Intermediate 40% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 1+ hours flight from Buenos
Aires.
LES DEUX ALPES
This is conveyor belt skiing on a grand scale. Lifts whirr and hum like a
busy factory but two especially - the Jandry Express 20-person gondola and
the recently opened Dome Express funicular - carry thousands of skiers, a
substantial number of them British, to the bleak but widely spread slopes on
the Glacier du Mont de Lans. As often happens with glacial skiing terrain,
the flattest slopes are at the top of the ski area. This makes the resort
exciting for novices who can ski on the roof of their world until the last
run of the day, when they must either face steep and narrower lower slopes
above the village or descend by mechanical means. it is a long way down -
the vertical drop of over 7,500 feet is one of the highest in the alps.
Les Deux Alps is not in the most attractive ski resort in the world but it
is full of good but rather soul-less skiing. The scenery is rugged but it
becomes even more dramatic if you make the ten-minute walk to the
inter-connecting lifts with the La Grave slopes on the other side of the
glacier. This vast, ungroomed glacial area below the awe-inspiring Meije -
much steeper than the higher Deux Alpes terrain - should only be attempted
with a guide.
Heights: Resort 5,445 ft. Skiing: 11,775 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
30% Intermediate 61% Advanced 9%. Transfer: 3 hours from Lyon or Geneva, 1+
hours from Grenoble. (580 miles from Calais).
LIVIGNO
There are two images that give Livigno a touch of the Ice Station Zebras,
but the image is not as bad as it sounds. The journey from Milan is probably
the longest transfer in the Alps: Livigno is so remote that it was once a
penal colony. Its nickname is Little Tibet. However, once you are there it
is a warm, friendly place with quite reasonable skiing and plenty of duty
free goods.
The village - three villages combined, in fact - is rather narrow, long and
straggly. Skiing the south east facing slopes around Lago Salin is easier
than the other side of the valley around Mottolino where ice sometimes makes
conditions quite testing. Excursions across a 7,500 foot pass to Bormio.
Santa Caterina and - more significantly, St Moritz - can be organised with
the same lift pass. Predictably there is little to do but drink and visit
discos in Livigno apart from skiing.
Heights: Resort 5,969 ft. Skiing: 9,184 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 40%
Intermediate 50% Advanced 10%. Transfer: Up to 4 hours from Bergamo. 6 hours

BANFF/LAKE LOUISE
Banff/Lake Louise is the generic name for three quite separate resorts on
the border with British Columbia. In Alberta, Banff's local ski 'hill' -
also reputedly Canada's oldest resort - is Mount Norquay, known principally
for its short steep trails such as The Face and Lone Pine, although more
temperate slopes have recently been opened up. Whether skiing at night makes
it any easier is debatable, but there is night skiing three nights a week on
Prune Pickers, Shenanigan, Temptation and Speculation.
Fifteen miles away down the Trans-Canadian Highway is one of Canada's
highest and bleakest (in spite of its name) resorts, Sunshine, part of which
is in British Columbia. This is fairly intermediate open bowl skiing with so
much natural snow that they do not need to make their own.
Yet another 30 miles or so away is Lake Louise itself, by far the most
important of the three. With sumptuous scenery, Lake Louise has skiing on
four mountain faces: a hundred runs or more in all plus some high calibre
skiing in Boomerang, Whitehorn, Paradise and East Bowls, which rivals the
bowl skiing in Vail and Whistler. The off-piste de la resistance, however,
is in Purple Bowl - but it takes skiers an hour to hike up to it. Unlike
such resorts as Kirkwood (Lake Tahoe) every single lift in Lake Louise can
be ridden by novices. Skiers should not miss a visit to the great railway
hotels - the Banff Springs and the Chateau Lake Louise.

MAMMOTH
Mammoth Mountain rises like a great whale in California's High Sierras.
Interlacing the six miles that separate its boundaries are 150 trails of all
descriptions and difficulties, although the emphasis is on the more
difficult. There are some good nursery slopes, but beginners might prefer
neighbouring June Mountain, 30 miles away.
Good off-piste skiers in search of a challenge will relish Mammoth's
Avalanche Chutes (the Avies.) Those with stamina can attempt the challenge
of skiing off every major lift in a single day. This is complicated
strategically because the numbers are not consecutive. Consequently Lift 1
is next to 26, and lift 25 is on a separate mountain. The scenery is
spectacular, with views of the spikey Minarettes on one side and distant
Utah peaks on the other.
Heights: Resort 7,953 ft. Skiing: 11,053 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
30% Intermediate 40% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 4 miles from Mammoth Lakes
Airport. 300 miles from Los Angeles.
MAYRHOFEN
Encircled by steep mountains in a delightful setting in the picturesque
Zillertal valley, the lively old Tyrolean town of Mayrhofen is - with
Niederau - a great British favourite in Austria. Although much more
important as a resort for bringing on beginners and lower intermediates  -
its ski school has a wonderful reputation - with the introduction of the
Zillertal Super Ski pass, stronger skiers need no longer feel that they are
being compromised.
The local skiing, directly linked with the hamlet of Finckenberg, is on
three mountains and much of it includes pleasant, below the tree-line
descents. The skiing (and queueing) focuses on the Penken, a large, domed
mountain served by a cable car, a gondola, six chairlifts and six drag
lifts, and a number of lively mountain restaurants. Penken is connected with
the Horberg-Gerent network of lifts by the Larchwald double chair.

MEGEVE
Megeve was once perhaps France's most famous and certainly most chic ski
resort before being overshadowed by the wave of huge, purpose-built
ski-metropolises built in the 60s. It is still a popular (and expensive)
haunt for those skiers with fairly gentle aspirations who prefer the
traditional ambiance of this still-fashionable and upmarket resort where
'wood has not yet given way to concrete' to the tower blocks of France's
brave new world stations de ski.
Much of the local skiing - which is divided among three quite seperate areas
 -is pleasant and gentle, down tree-lined pastures, with a sprinkling of
quaint and quality resturants dotted around the lower slopes.
The area, which is linked with St Gervais and St Nicolas-de-Veroce, is also
included on the even more extensive Mont Blanc ski pass which altogether
covers 14 resorts with 190 lifts serving 425 miles of pistes.
Heights: Resort 3,608 ft. Skiing: 7,708 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner %

BIG SKY (MONTANA)
Montana rarely gets mentioned in skiing circles outside the Rockies, but it
has 13 small but often spectacular resorts, including Big Sky. The resort
has some dramatic terrain - steep bowls and chutes - and is often used by
ski extreme enthusiasts for derring-do videos. Its annual snow record - 400
inches - is also well above average.
Now that the resort is starting to be 'discovered' by outsiders it is adding
lifts at the rate of almost one a year.
One of the latest, a high-speed quad called Ram Charger which speeds you
from bottom to top of Andesite Mountain in under five minutes, gives you a
fairly unequivocal flavour of the kind of ambiance the resort exudes.
Heights: Resort 6,970 ft. Skiing: 10,900 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
20% Intermediate 50% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 45 miles from Bozeman.
MONTGENEVRE
High on a mountain pass on the French border with Italy, with a good snow
record, Montgenevre has a large, mainly intermediate ski area of its own,
but is also the starting point for a very scenic (though easy) tour deep
into Italy - the Milky Way.
This makes it possible to visit - out of curiosity - but not to stay in the
much-maligned 'Benidorm-on-Ice' resort of Sauze d'Oulx. En route one skis
through Claviere, said to be Italy's oldest ski resort, Cesana, Sansicario
and Sestriere.
The section between Montgenevre and Claviere is the most stunning visually,
with dramatic mountain views. But the skiing for the most part is bland and
reasonable intermediates will manage to get all the way to Sauze and back in
a day. For a strong beginner, the excitement of skiing to other resorts -
especially in a different country - is considerable.

MONT TREMBLANT
Mont Tremblant in Canada is a big, cold, double-peaked mountain which, with
Mont St Anne, dominates the Laurentians.
Although the top of the mountain is only just 3,000 feet, the longest trail
is 3.5 miles. Not far away is Mont St Sauveur, renowned not so much for its
skiing but its village - one of the prettiest ski villages in the world.
Heights: Resort 870 ft. Skiing: 3,001 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 20%

MORZINE
The most urban - though not unattractively so - of the dozen or so Portes du
Soleil resorts which thread their way along the Swiss/French border to the
south and south east of Lake Geneva, Morzine is a real old Savoyard town
with lots of character (in spite of and because of having through traffic)
and feels and sounds like a real mountain town should do - although if your
hotel room is near the centre, it feels more like being in a metropolis than
in the mountains.
Morzine is bright, bustling and a touch boisterous, with a lot of quaint old
chalets and other buildings - including some excellent restaurants - strung
across a picturesque river gorge. It is more attractive than its space-age
neighbour Avoriaz, the fulcrum of the Portes du Soleil circuit. Apart from
being part of the circuit - in which it is linked with Les Gets - Morzine
has its own extensive local ski area.

MOUNT BACHELOR
Mount Bachelor is in the Cascades, a volcanic range stretching down from St
Helens. The cone-shaped mountain, with 360 degree skiing and trails at more
than 9,000 feet, is on the Eastern side of the mountains where the snow is
lighter and drier than other resorts in the North West.
The steepest descent is down through The Pinnacles, a jagged rock formation
reached by hiking from the top of the Summit lift.
Cow's Face is another testing and exhilarating descent. Mount Bachelor has a
healthy vertical drop of more than 3,000 feet, achieved by skiing from the
top of Summit down to the Outback.
Heights: Resort 6,000 ft. Skiing: 9,060 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 15%
Intermediate 25% Advanced 60%. Transfer: 40 miles from Redmond Airport. 165

MOUNT HUTT
One of New Zealand's South Island's most expansive resorts, Mount Hutt -
recently bought by the Japanese - is a big open bowl, well above the tree
line with impressive views from the Virgin Mile ridge of the Southern Alps
and Canterbury Plains and a vertical drop of more than 2,000 feet.
Because of its height and exposure it is subject to strong winds, which
means some of the terrain is prone to be closed: hence the resort's rather
unkind sobriquet, Mount Shut. Conversly, however, when it is open it enjoys
the longest season in the whole of Australasia. The resort is also known for
its heliskiing. You can try an introductory flight here, giving you 2,500
vertical feet for a mere thirty New Zealand dollars a run.

MURREN
Spiritual home to Sir Arnold Lunn, who set the first modern slalom course on
the local slopes, and HQ for the Kandahar Club, Murren is a curate's egg of
a resort: very good in parts. Set on a steep high ledge, you realise just
how fragile its grip on the cliff-side seems when you fly over it in a
helicopter. The quaint, car-free village is very Swiss, very quaint, and
very traditional. It has one famous and testing mountain, the Schilthorn,
topped by one of the highest revolving restaurants in Europe at Piz Gloria.
The Schilthorn, which featured in the Bond Movie On Her Majesty's Secret
Service, is also the mightily mogulled and unnerving start of the famous
Inferno, the longest amateur skiing race in the world - over eight miles -
all the way down to Lauterbrunnen. Apart from some noteworthy exceptions
like Kanonenrohr, Murren's other slopes tend not to be terribly eventful,
but if you know where to look, or better still hire a guide, it has some
excellent off-piste opportunities.

OBERGURGL
Skiers swop sun for snow in this high, narrow and remote valley at the head
of the Oetztal close to the Italian frontier: in the depths of winter
Obergurgl, Austria's highest parish (described in a 19th century guidebook
as 'a hamlet of wretched cowherds' huts') only gets the sun for an hour or
so each day, but this means that the quality of the snow remains relatively
untampered with.
Today it is a cosy, pretty little village whose friendliness and snugness
contrasts with its chilling, sometimes arctic surroundings. It can be cold
and exposed and blankets are provided for some of the longer, higher
chairlifts. But aficionados return year after year to ski the bleak slopes
and then shelter snugly in the slightly claustrophobic stuben which
sometimes reek of schnapps fumes and the smoke of good cigars, and echo to
the sound of live music. As the Berlitz ski guide to Austria points out:
'Some children have inherited the Obergurgl bug from their great
grandfathers.' Hochgurgl can be skied on the same lift pass but is not
directly linked.

OBERTAUERN
Originally on the old Roman 'salt route' from Salzburg, such is the snow
record of Obertauern - built on the very summit of the pass - that the
locals could sometimes do with a few tons of industrial salt to keep their
footpaths and roads clear. Off-piste skiers are not infrequently greeted
with chest-high quantities of powder. On-piste, this is an intermediate
glider's paradise, with great cruising runs on both sides of the valley.
Apres-ski can start early - while you are still on the slopes. The
Edelweisshutte at the top of the Panorama-Dreiersesselbahn has some lively
tea-dancing, and I seem to remember being served something called Reindeer
Milk there: in reality a fairly potent concoction of hot milk and rum. After
such fare, it is helpful to find that Obertauern's lift system is one of the
few in Austria to allow ski-in, ski-out chalets and hotels. do not be
surprised if your instructor re-appears in the local bar that evening
playing the squeeze-box. It is that kind of resort.

SAALBACH/HINTERGLEMM
Saalbach and Hinterglemm are two villages which have finally sprawled into
each other's arms along the Glemm Valley and between them have one of the
best all-round circuits in Austria, with a 180 kilometre circuit. Although
much of the skiing is fast intermediate cruising, there are good nursery
slopes and some testing blacks, such as the Zwolferkogel. Intermediates can
ski their hearts out from dawn to dusk the length and breadth of the valley,
taking full advantage of the excellent 60-lift system. Later the nightlife
is brash and bright and very Tyrolean without becoming off-puttingly
boisterous.
SERRE CHEVALIER
If you drive over the splendidly picturesque Col de Lautaret in the Southern
Alps (or take the Frejus tunnel if the col is impassable) you will reach the
Alpe de Sud and the unfashionable but not un-charming resort of Serre
Chevalier, where you can cruise forever around a seemingly endless
collection of picturesque linked villages and hamlets, some old, some new.
The ski area revolves around Chantemerle, Villeneuve and Monetier, a small
spa town. There is no village called Serre Chevalier as such - the resort
takes its name from its loftiest peak at the far end of the system. This is
a intermediate paradise: fast cruising runs in open country, often with easy
powder slopes through well-spaced larch trees thrown in. (The slopes also
unfortunately attract large numbers of snowboarders).
Heights: Base: 4,428 - 4,920 ft. Skiing: 9,118 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy
42% Intermediate 46% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 3 hours from Lyon. 2+ hours

SIERRA NEVADA
It may seem a little bizarre to be able to ski in the High Sierras just
above Grenada, but the quite substantial bowl area - Europe's most southerly
ski resort (Sol y Neive) - is no imposter, as Spain's King Juan Carlos, who
often skis here, would testify.
On a clear day you can just about see North Africa as you cruise down the
rolling plateaux. Like Mount Hutt in New Zealand, Sierra Nevada is prone to
high winds which can shut down the lift system. This is usually a good time
to pop down to Grenada and explore this fascinating old city only 20 miles
from the slopes.

SNOWBIRD
Twin Peaks lives] Yes - part of the beautiful alpine backdrop behind this
Utah resort's ski area is called Twin Peaks. But what strikes you first
about Snowbird is the architecture - it is probably the closest thing to a
purpose-built French resort in the Rockies. The ski terrain itself is
compact, pretty and exhilarating.
Gad Valley and Peruvian Gulch have ideal contours in which to exploit Utah's
world-famous powder - steep-sided bowls with a few stunted, blizzard-lashed
pine trees to give you a little perspective in the blinding white arena.
Snowbird's pride is its Tram (cable car) which whisks 125 skiers up to the
top of Hidden Peak (11,000 feet) in eight minutes. From here there is a
wonderfully long run to the bottom for modest achievers, called Chip's Run.
All the other routes down are more difficult.

SOLL
Soll, like Niederau and Mayerhofen, is something of a mecca for British
skiers who frequently not only learn here but stay faithful year after year.
Apart from an agreeably laid-out ski area which fans out in all directions
rather like a vast clock face, Soll has the extra magic of being the
starting point for the captivating Skigrossraum circuit.
This takes in several other resorts that are all fairly easy to get to (but
not so easy to get back from - you must either retrace your steps or get a
bus).
It is, however, a joy for intermediates to be able to strike out from their
base and find themselves drifting triumphantly into the ski terrain of
another resort.

SQUAW VALLEY
Squaw Valley in California is a swashbuckling ski resort, with six chunky
granite mountains offering 4,000 acres of open-bowl terrain that lends
itself to the resort's 'ski wherever the whim takes you' concept. Squaw -
famous for the Winter Olympics of 1960 - is the most testing of the 15 or so
resorts that circle the picturesque waters of Lake Tahoe. Even their names
are stirring: Emigrant, Granite Chief, Squaw Peak, Snow King, Broken Arrow
and the most spectacular, KT22: so called because the original owner's wife
is reputed to have made 22 kick turns during her epic struggle down its
steep face.
The Palisades chutes off the shoulder of Squaw Peak are used for videos of
extreme skiers, who also hike to the top of Granite Chief. But in spite of
some tough terrain, beginners do rather well at Squaw because unlike so many
ski resorts, the nursery slopes are up amoung the higher slopes on Emigrant
Peak, rather than at the bottom of the mountain.

STEAMBOAT
This quaint old Colorado wild-west cow town is a particularly good resort
for families and intermediate skiers, with one important addition:
superlative powder in the aspens and pines. Steamboat has three main
mountains: Storm Peak, Sunshine Peak and Mount Werner. The skiing is
extensive without being dramatically difficult, with a lot of hugely
enjoyable and quite steep roller-coaster trails. Like many American ski
resorts it has a recently constructed (and rather soul-less) ski village and
a much older, original cosy and picturesque town two or three miles away,
Steamboat Springs.

ST MORITZ/PONTRESINA
You would never guess that Europe's most famous ski resort was once a tatty
mountain hamlet. What changed that were the spa waters which attracted
tourists from all over Europe, particularly the British. It was here that
Johannes Badrutt, owner of the Kulm Hotel, made his famous wager - or so
legend tells us - which started the British habit of holidaying in the
mountains in the winter. Traditionally the British took their holidays in
the summer, but just as one group was facing the dismal task of returning to
the autumnal fog of London, Herr Badrutt asked them if they realised that
the mountains were sunny in the winter. He offered them free accommodation
if they would stay. They did, and on returning in the spring, they told all
their friends. The fashion for winter sports holidays had been conceived.
Today, St Moritz's ski areas are scattered on both sides of the valley. It
is expensive, but probably no more so than Verbier and Crans Montana. The
local ski area is Corviglia, which has warm, fairly undemanding slopes
within easy reach of the centre of town. Corvatsch, across the valley, is
tougher. The short train journey to Pontresina is gorgeous.
If anything Pontresina's architecture is even more attractive than downtown
St Moritz. The skiing and scenery, especially at Lagalb and Diavolezza, is
outstanding.

STOWE
Sound Of Music or Peyton Place? Perhaps a mixture of both. If only one could
combine Stowe's charm with Killington's skiing, one would have manufactured
the ultimate New England ski resort. Stowe, where skiing started back in the
1930s, has the archetypal New England village, with 27 country inns,
complete with high-spired, white-weatherboard church. The skiing is seven
miles away on Mount Mansfield, famous for its so-called 'front four' trails,
which are a serious challenge, especially, in icy conditions (if they are
open).
Goat, Starr, National and Liftline are steep enough to make any skier pause
for a moment or two before venturing over the edge. Elsewhere on the
mountain, however - apart from International and Nosedive - the skiing is
much more relaxed. And there is a separate mountain opposite - Spruce Peak -
where the entire terrain is easy-going. Heights: Resort 1,300 ft. Skiing:

SUN VALLEY
Sun Valley was America's most famous ski resort before Aspen was really
thought of as a winter resort. In a magnificent but bizarre attempt to
recreate an Austrian ski village, to provide an exotic destination for the
pre-jet jetset, Averell Harriman, chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad,
asked an Austrian count to recreate the Austrian Tyrol in Idaho's remote
Sawtooth Mountains.
Sun Valley still has some of the best skiing in the Rockies, mainly on Baldy
Mountain, where seven or eight bowls allow skiers to drop off into some
excellent terrain. There is a second mountain, Dollar, where the skiing is
easier.

TAOS
Imagine a Swiss ski village picked up by a tornado and re-assembled in the
exotic Sangre De Cristo mountains of New Mexico and you will have some idea
of how wonderfully bizarre but beautiful Taos Ski Valley is. It was built by
a German-born Swiss, Ernie Blake and he made it a cult resort, with some
magnificent steep runs like Sir Arnold Lunn, Inferno, Powderhorn and
Walkyries Chute. Al's run, named after Dr Al Rosen, who used to ski with an
oxygen tank after suffering a heart attack, is legendary. Some of Taos's
best runs - a series of chutes off the Highline Ridge like Thunderbird Trees
 -can only be reached on foot. The most exiting and gruelling is the long
trek to Kachina Peak, which is rarely open but a glorious red-letter day
when it is.
Heights: Resort 9,207 ft. Skiing: 11,819 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner

miles from Denver. 20 miles from local airport in Taos.
TELLURIDE
Built at the end of a spectacular box-canyon once held sacred by the
Indians, Telluride today is a unique cocktail of slightly-sinister,
devil-may-care earthiness and slightly gung-ho, yee-ha American
boisterousness. The old town has a lot of traditional Wild West buildings
that have not been tarted up like so many old mining towns in the Rockies.
Today Telluride claims to be 'the most beautiful place you'll ever ski' and
this extravagant label may be only a little short of the truth. The skiing,
with runs like Spiral Staircase and The Plunge, is steep and scenic.
Heights: Resort 8,725 ft. Skiing: 11,890 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
28% Intermediate 54% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 65 miles from Montrose plus
local airport.
LES TROIS VALLEES:
Courchevel/Meribel/Les Menuires/Val Thorens
'If quaint atmosphere, old world charm and the chance to ski into an Alpine
village of ginger-bread houses and steepled churches is the Europe of your
ski dreams, under no circumstances book your vacation into Les Trois
Vallees' the American author of Ski Europe warns his compatriots.
Is he being a little churlish? Although this French region this is the
largest ski area in the world, it does not mean there are no picturesque
nooks and crannies tucked away in its vast terrain. Admittedly Val Thorens
and Les Menuires are no oil-paintings, but there are some delightful
endroits in Courchevel, particularly lower down at 1650 and 1350. And
Meribel Mottaret, although modern, has been put together with considerable
charm.
As for the skiing, there is every possible permutation, from the manicured
motorways of Courchevel to the manic mogul fields of Menuires. Courchevel,
with its network of colourful but aging bubble cars - gradually being
replaced - has 86 runs alone and the region as a whole has more than 300
miles of groomed pistes served by almost 200 lifts.
Perhaps the best way of getting familiar with the whole area is to stay in
Meribel, so that each day - depending on your mood - you can head for the
sophistication and variety of Courchevel or in the other direction for the
rather more stark lunar landscape of Val Thorens, Europe's highest ski
resort, where a giant cable-car takes you up to the Cime de Caron (almost
10,500 feet). Nearby Les Menuires has some powerful and quite testing skiing
on La Masse.
If you prefer gentler stuff, you could just stay in the middle valley and
enjoy Meribel's own skiing (although this too has some tough runs if you
chose to ski them). There are also two or three delightful runs down to the
new satellite resort of La Tania. Those interested in clocking up ski-miles
can sample all three valleys in a day.
VAIL
Vail in Colorado is Aspen minus history plus powder-bowls. However hard it
tries, Vail can never be an Aspen - even if it wanted to be - because it was
only invented 30 years ago. It sprang up almost without trace in the middle
of nowhere, but rapidly achieved star status without quite managing the
cachet of its rival. Like Sun Valley 26 years earlier, Vail modelled itself
on a European ski village, and unkind critics labelled it a 'plastic
Bavaria.'
Vail maintains it is America's largest single-mountain resort and has around
100 beautifully groomed trails (none seriously difficult.) What sets it
apart from all other US resorts are its fabulous back-bowls. It has seven:
Game Creek, Sun Up, Sun Down, Tea Cup and the recently opened-up China,
Siberia and Mongolia Bowls. These bowls are left ungroomed in all weathers.
When they are bad they are tough but when they are good they are superb.
Vail and Beaver Creek both devote part of their mountain to special ski runs
and features for children. This winter Vail/Beaver Creek and Aspen have
taken the unprecedented step of burying the hatchet and offering skiers a
two-centre ski holiday with a joint lift pass.
Heights: Resort 8,150 ft. Skiing: 11,450 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner
32% Intermediate 36% Advanced 32%. Transfer: 103 miles from Denver. Eagle
airport 30 miles.
VALMOREL
Perhaps the prettiest of the purpose-built French resorts, Valmorel is a
delight for beginners and intermediates with the option of some steeper,
challenging bowl skiing for stronger skiers. The resort is ingeniously laid
out: the main traffic-free shopping precinct, the cobbled-square of Bourg
Morel, is in the heart of the village, within easy-walking or shuttle-lift
distance of the little hamlets that make up the village, but far enough away
to prevent people staying in the chalets being disturbed by too much noise.
Valmorel - linked with St Francois-Lonchamps - is one of the friendliest
resorts in the Tarentaise, and has one of the best childrens' clubs. The
quaintly-named Saperlipopette teaches smaller children to ski in their own
special area, the Jardin des Neiges, where everything is scaled down to
children's size. Adults even stand in a dug-out - in the reverse of the Alan
Ladd principle - in order not to tower over the children. Not surprisingly,
families love coming here. With almost 50 lifts and 100 miles of pistes on
both sides of the resort, there is plenty to come back for.
Heights: Resort 4,592 ft. Skiing: 8,364 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 28%
Intermediate 62% Advanced 10%. Transfer: 4 hours from Geneva. 3+ hours from
Lyon. (568 miles from Calais).
VAL D'ISERE/TIGNES
If there is skiing in heaven, it may well be a replica - nay, the original -
of the awe-inspiring snow kingdom of the Espace Killy. Minus, of course, the
bleak and carbuncular - but not, to be honest, hellish - town of Tignes. If
only they had not drowned the original village under the waters of Lac
Chevril]
Even without its grim neighbour, Val d'Isere would be one of the great ski
resorts in the world. With Tignes, and the joint ski terrain named after
France's greatest ski gladiator, Jean-Claude Killy, the area is probably
unbeatable. It is a vast network of long and inspiring pistes where many of
the red runs would be black elsewhere and many of the blacks are at the
extreme end of the anxiety spectrum.
Val, as it is often abbreviated, is traditionally the location for the
Criterium De La Premiere Neige, the first world cup race of the season in
the northern hemisphere. The resort now has two world class downhill
courses: the dramatic Face on Bellevarde, which was redesigned for last
February's winter Olympics, and the old OK run where you can enjoy a
race-training programme with Top Ski, one of the Espace Killy's myriad
specialist ski schools.
The resorts also have a selection of nerve-jangling couloirs that are as
tough as you will find anywhere, plus a veritable white desert of delectable
off piste opportunities and tours which would take a resonably good skier
weeks to ski in its entirety. Tignes has the extra advantage of skiing 365
days a year on the Grande Motte Glacier, where the opening of the new
funicular is eagerly awaited in the later stages of this winter.
The disadvantage is that Tignes is fairly universally regarded as one of the
ugliest and bleakest of the French purpose-built resorts. Val d'Isere is no
picture postcard either, but it is considerably more pleasing to the eye and
does at least have an old quarter complete with a 16th century church. One
of the most British-influenced ski resorts in the French Alps, Val is a
bustling and lively ski town with plenty of good restaurants and a pulsating
night life. Dick's T Bar is only the beginning.
Heights: Val d'Isere 6,068 ft. Tignes 6,560 ft: Skiing: 11,280 feet.
Difficulty of runs: Easier 21% Strong Intermediate 69% Expert 10%. Transfer:
4+ hours from Geneva. (Other airport: Lyon) (600 miles from Calais).
VERBIER
Rarely do ski resorts inspire so many contradictory emotions as Verbier.
This sprawling collection of modern chalets (there are few hotels) built on
a sunny shelf beneath some of the most dramatic slopes in Europe has the
following qualities: fabulous, exciting skiing. Overtaxed lift systems that
can cause horrendous queueing. Avalanche problems that mean some of the best
slopes are often closed. And more than a sprinkling of loud, abrasive and
rather silly Hooray Henries and Sloane Rangers (although there is a feeling
that they are a dying breed).
Having said that, Verbier's skiing is so outstanding that these are perhaps
minor crosses to bear. Even when bad weather does close the best slopes
(Mont Fort, Tortin and Mont Gele) there is still such an ocean of skiing in
Verbier's 'four valleys' that for ordinary intermediates it hardly matters.
Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing: 10,915 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easier 39%
Intermediate 42% Advanced 19%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. (623 miles
from Calais).
WENGEN
Europe's highest rack railway, the Jungfraubahn, curls up to the
Jungfraujoch, to Europe's highest railway station, in the most dramatic
fashion - through the very heart of the Eiger. En route it halts at two
stations where passengers are allowed to peer out of the windows on to the
mind-numbingly steep North Face. When the Swiss built the railway soon after
the turn of the century there were no such things as chairlifts, and the
train represented a wonderful new alternative to slogging up the
mountainside with sealskins on the bottom of your skis. The triumphant
British were able to leap aboard the Jungfraubahn and ski downhill only.
This was the birth of The Down Hill Only Club. DHO members come back year
after year to this charming, almost traffic-free village and would never
venture anywhere else. It may not be the most exciting skiing in the world
but there are endless red runs and gorgeous scenery. There are, however, two
good off piste runs - the exquisite White Hare, which starts at the bottom
of the Eiger, and Oh God. The best of the blacks is Black Rock.
Heights: Resort 4,165 ft. Skiing: 9,744 ft. Difficulty of runs in Jungfrau
Region:Easy 33% Intermediate 47%. Advanced 20% Transfer: 3+ hours from
Zurich (other airports: Berne, Geneva. Station in resort. (521 miles from
Calais).
WHISTLER/BLACKCOMB
It is rare to find two excellent resorts right next door to each other.
Whistler and Blackcomb in British Colombia have the highest vertical drop in
North America - more than 5,000 feet. Both have a large and richly varied
selection of runs, but on the higher slopes each mountain specialises in
different terrain.
Whistler has six bowls, some of which are so spread out that skiers have
been known to be stranded for the night - huddled together for warmth -
defeating the attempts of search parties to find them. Blackcomb's big
feature is its glaciers and couloirs. Quite recently the Horstman glacier
was opened up and with Blackcomb Glacier provides top class powder skiing
when conditions are good. There is also a selection of excellent couloirs
such as Cougar, Soudan and Pakalolo.
The only snag about these resorts is that because of their maritime nature
the snow can sometimes be quite wet and heavy, and because of their northern
location it gets dark comparitively quickly, so that the runs close as early
as 3.30. This means long lunches are a luxury. Often you find that if you
have that final drink the lift network is starting to close down around you.
Even though the two resorts are run by the same company they are marketed
separately - and extremely competitively. The resorts are locked in serious
combat: as fast as one resort makes a big improvement, the other tries to
outgun it with something even more spectacular. Their conflict can only be
the skier's gain. Both resorts are served by Whistler village, an attractive
but purpose-built resort dominated by the Chateau Whistler resort, a vast
hotel in the style of the great Canadian Pacific hotels built before the war
to accommodate train passengers.
Heights: Resort 2,200 ft. Skiing: 7,494 ft. (Blackcomb) 7,140 ft (Whistler)
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 55% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 70
miles from Vancouver. Journey can be made by helicopter.
ZERMATT
Some people come to Zermatt just for the Matterhorn. Without it Zermatt
would still be a great ski resort, but the bewitching mountain is its
crowning glory. Even though there is no skiing on it, a handful of brilliant
ski extreme specialists, including the legendary Jean Marc Boivin, have
skied it. At least one skier has died in the attempt. Almost everywhere you
go in Zermatt, the Matterhorn is there watching over you, rather like an
alpine Mona Lisa.
Zermatt has three main ski areas, two of which - Schwarzsee and the Theodul
Glacier - bring you closest to this thrilling slab of granite.
Gornergrat/Stockhorm has some of Zermatt's most exciting skiing, including
Triftji, and Gornergrat provides some of the most stunning views in the Alps
 -across the chain of mountains to the left of the Matterhorn - the Klein
Matterhorn, Lyskamm, Breithorn, Castor, Pollux, and the mighty Monte Rosa.
The cable car to the base of the Klein Matterhorn Peak - the highest in
Europe - gives access to Cervinia, on the Italian side, which can also be
reached via the Theodulpass.
From Schwarzsee there are two excellent blacks - Tiefbach and Aroleid - plus
an exciting and very scenic descent, the Weisse Perle, which takes you
swooping past the the pretty villages of Stafelalp and Zmutt, where you will
be tempted to call in at cosy piste-side bars and restaurants as you drift
back to base. You might as well surrender: by common consensus Zermatt has
the best selection of mountain restaurants in Europe.
Heights: Resort 5,346 ft. Skiing: 12.610 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 27%
Intermediate 42% Advanced 31%. Transfer: 4+ hours from Geneva. Rail station
in resort. (672 miles from Calais.)

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (4): What if the snow fails to fall?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE straitened times, large numbers of Britons will give up dining out, or
other things, to pay for holidays abroad, according to a survey commissioned
by Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest chain of travel agents.
Among the types of holiday benefitting in this way are skiing trips, with
sales for this winter up 4 per cent on last year. Given the alternative
pleasures foregone, skiers will be even less happy than usual if the snows
fail to fall.
All the more reason, then, to book with a company that guarantees transport
to alternative resorts or pays compensation if the lifts are shut down, says
Owners Abroad, the UK's second biggest tour operator.
Unsurprisingly, Owners Abroad offers such guarantees, and this week attacked
its rivals for surrounding their no-snow compensation with restrictions.
Owners Abroad alleges that some companies only provide transport to other
resorts or pay compensation if skiers have bought the operators' own travel
insurance or paid a premium.
Privately, the other operators say Owners Abroad must be desperate for
business. Publicly, they say skiers are well-protected by their insurance
policies or premiums. The compensation they pay is also twice as high as
that offered by Owners Abroad.
Some point out that offers to transport skiers to other resorts are often
worth little as they only apply if all lifts at the original site are
closed. Alternative resorts with snow are often crowded.
Good snow over the past two years has meant that skiers have tended to be
less concerned about guarantees and compensation. In the late 1980s,
however, when there was a run of poor snow, offers of compensation and
transport to alternative resorts became important marketing ploys, says
David Hearns, a spokesman for the Ski Club of Great Britain.
Should snowfalls be poor this year, Owners Abroad says that all its
customers will be protected regardless of whether they have bought the
company's own travel insurance. If insufficient snow causes the closure of
all ski lifts, or of the ski school, the company says it will do its best to
arrange coach travel to a resort with snow. If this is impossible, skiers
will receive compensation of Pounds 15 for each day they were unable to ski,
up to the cost of their holiday.
Thomson, the biggest UK operator, agreed that it only provided guarantees to
purchasers of its own insurance policy, issued through General Accident. It
said it had offered automatic guarantees in the past but these had proved
unworkable. 'People were not taking out any insurance,' the company said.
'It was leaving us liable for the extra cost incurred.' Thomson said it
hoped to announce a new scheme next week providing guarantees to holders of
other insurance policies as well.
Inghams Travel said it only covered holders of its own travel insurance
policy. Skiers could insure against closure of resorts through lack of snow
at a cost of Pounds 4 a person.
Both Thomson and Inghams said that if transport to alternative resorts were
not possible, they would pay Pounds 30 compensation for each complete day
lost, double that offered by Owners Abroad.
Hearns defends the charging of premiums, particularly by smaller ski
companies. 'It's generally the bigger boys who have beds in other resorts,'
he says. 'If you don't have beds in other resorts you have to buy them. The
smaller operators can't do that, which is why they charge a premium.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (3): The ultimate chalet experience - Lucia van
der Post hand-picks a selection on the most pampered pistes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST

<TEXT>
THERE COMES a time in many skiers' lives when they tire of messy chalets
with too few bathrooms, of hotels filled with the braying of Sloanes at
play, of package deals and economy class. What they want, in other words, is
something special, something exclusive, which gives them, at least
temporarily, the illusion of being in a playground of their own.
Ever since the masses took to skiing these places have been harder to find.
The really rich and lucky solve the problem with chalets of their own in
resorts where they and their friends can gather, safely insulated from the
coach and package tour brigade.
Then there are the big and grand hotels - The Palace in Gstaad, Suvretta
House in St. Moritz, that sort of thing - sumptuous, glitzy, lots of fun -
but private, tucked away? No, indubitably no.
There are, however, a few special places that cater for those who want
something smaller, more intimate, more like a luxury lodge or chalet, which
can be filled with nothing but friends, family and like-minded companions.
The Ski Company has perfected the idea. It is run by David Kemp, whose
notion of what constitutes a truly comfortable skiing holiday coincides
almost exactly with mine. His company buys, restores and staffs chalets in
and around some of the most agreeable skiing resorts in France (Meribel,
Morzine, Val d'Isere and Chamonix).
The chalets are furnished as one would oneself had one but the time, the
money and the expertise. All the bedrooms have their own bathrooms (queueing
for inadequate numbers of bathrooms is, the van der Post sample reveals, the
chief reason why as people get older, better off and fonder of their
comfort, they abandon the chalet holiday). There are log fires and
sitting-rooms, television sets and stereo, books and fruit and magazines . .
. all the things that make it seem like home.
Many of the chalets, in particular Chalet Gueret, a 200-year-old Savoyard
farmhouse near Morzine, are off the beaten track, so The Ski Company
provides transport to and from the slopes, giving the best of both worlds -
a sense of quiet and privacy coupled with easy access to the lifts.
What truly lifts them into the luxury class is the quality of the food and
service - champagne before dinner, vintage wines, food that would have the
punters queueing up in most cities in the world.
Provided you want to ski the resorts the chalets are close to and the number
of people in your group coincides with the number of rooms in the chalet, I
cannot think of a more cossetted way to go. And as for the prices, for what
you get they still seem to me very reasonable - from Pounds 760 a week per
person, inclusive of everything except lift passes and ski tuition. For the
brochure write to The Ski Company, 41 Hyde Vale, Greenwich, London SE10 8QQ.
Tel: 081-305-2299.
Quite, quite different is Cordillera, way out West in the Colorado Rockies.
Here is a little-known, tucked away resort, set in 3,000 acres at 8,000 feet
with spectacular views of the Rockies in almost every direction. Just five
years ago there was nothing but mountain, forest and wilderness. Today there
are 15 miles of groomed cross-country trails, a pond for ice-skating, sleigh
rides through the forest, snowmobiling, snow-shoeing (the sort of thing the
pioneers did) and chances of wild back country skiing using snowcats or
helicopters.
Though private houses are being built at discreet intervals around the
resort for those who just want to drop in for a few days or a week or two
there are two possibilities - there is the small and intimate 27-bedroom
lodge, which can be booked in its entirety or used just like a hotel (prices
start at Dollars 175 - Pounds 107 - a night) or you could rent a small
private home. With five double bedrooms, every conceivable new-world
mod-con, it would cost Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 613) for a single night but the
longer you rent it the less it costs per night.
The food at The Lodge, rumour has it, is about the best in the West - a
Belgian chef is bringing in diners from the nearby resorts as well as those
who would not know a schuss from a snow-plough. And if all that food starts
putting on the pounds, head for the Spa at The Lodge where you can be honed
back into shape.
The piste-bashing brigade should note that Cordillera itself has no downhill
pistes of its own but it is just 10 minutes from Beaver Creek (where the
really classy set go to ski, right away from all louder, less well-bred
resorts) and 15 or 20 minutes from Vail. Buses (provided free) go to and
fro. It is, above all, the ideal resort for fanatical skiers who are always
worried about how their non-skiing partners or friends will be amused whilst
their are busy tackling black runs - in Cordillera there is more than enough
to keep them happy.
Flights from Europe go to Denver but within the US American Airlines flies
into a new airport, Eagle, just five minutes from Cordillera. For more
details about The Lodge or renting the private home write to PO Box 1110,
Edwards, Vail Valley, Colorado 81632. Tel: 303-926-2200.
Back in Europe, there are two hotels that really offer something special. In
Lenzerheide, Switzerland, there is the Hotel Guarda Val which is quite
unlike any other hotel - pitched right up the mountain, away from the bustle
of the village, on a 'mid-alp' (where the old Swiss farmers used to take the
cows for the spring thaw), the old Graubunden farm buildings have been
converted into a wonderfully idiosyncratic hotel.
The hotel can take some 80 guests but because they are all in rooms and
studios, in four-bedroomed chalets and gable rooms, the sense of privacy and
quiet is great. A big old barn has been converted into the restaurant and
another old building is now a pub. Not the place for the disco-hopping set,
this is for those who like to be surrounded by snow and mountains.
One week in January, half board, with scheduled flights is Pounds 776 per
person sharing a double room with own bathroom, through Made to Measure
Holidays, 43, East Street, Chichester, West Sussex PO19 1HX, England.
The other hotel worth knowing about is Le Chalet in Meribel, which no
serious skier needs reminding is one of the great French skiing resorts.
Housed in a grand Savoyarde farmhouse, with just 34 bedrooms, Le Chalet is a
great place for families - a huge log fire burns in the sitting-room, there
is a library, really comfortable bedrooms (some with jacuzzis, some suites
with sitting-rooms and your very own log-fires, yet others with a second
room on a mezzanine floor to make it like a family apartment) and lots of
thoughtful provision for the children (for instance, a games room, a film
every afternoon, special meals, where the children can all eat together
leaving the parents free to dine alone or with friends).
Close to the pistes of Meribel-les-Allues, surrounded by pine, spruce and
maple, but some distance from the town, Le Chalet manages to combine the
feeling of a private chalet with the services of a high-quality hotel.
Prices start at about Pounds 110 per person per night. Book direct at Le
Chalet, Le Belvedere, 73550 Meribel-les-Allues, France. Tel 79 00 55 71.

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (2): Be comfortable when you put the boot in -
David Goldsmith considers the technology that goes in to today's skis and
boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOLDSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR AN industry that has recently survived three near-snowless European
winters and a worldwide decline in ski sales, equipment manufacturers have
bounced back this winter with renewed evidence of research and development.
Skis are going through their third industrial 'revolution' since the second
world war. The metal and wood skis of the 1950s, which gave way to the
fibreglass and carbon fibre models of the 1960s and 1970s, are now being
replaced with shape-moulded skis.
Revolutionary heat moulding techniques produce skis with ribbed top
surfaces, angulated sidewalls, special platforms and isolated suspension
sections for ski bindings. Skis that demonstrate this trend are the Head's
F1 Flex control and K2 Velocity.
Head, innovator of the mass-produced metal skis, appears to be coming out of
a long trough in its fortunes. The Head F1 performs with more precision,
edge grip and hug of the terrain than any previous Head ski I can recall. It
can be recommended to any competent parallel or expert skier who does not
travel at very high speeds.
The K2 Velocity is one of several skis (Blizzard, Tyrolia and Fischer are
others) that isolate vibrations from the bindings by incorporating a
shock-absorbing section on the ski. Tyrolia has produced particularly
unusual skis with a cunning pre-drilled hold pattern that is compatible with
the company's own bindings. These shock-absorbed skis have been inspired by
the strange unit used by many World Cup ski racers - the Derbyflex platform,
which raises the bindings on a shock-absorbing platform.
Although innovative approaches to ski making vary, two European ski
manufacturers which pioneered the shape-moulding trend - Salomon and Elan -
appear to have hit on a method which points to the future. The expression
'monocoque' has been borrowed from motor racing to describe it. Both
factories use a method of wrapping a tough composite skin over the core of
the ski (skis normally have no strength in their outer surfaces), producing
a shell that becomes the key component of the ski's performance.
The monocoque shell is varied in thickness and shape to produce skis of
different flexibility and torque. The Salomon Force 9 3S became a hit last
winter with skiers that go for 'extreme' and tricky parts of the mountain.
The ski has an unusually quick, lively and sharp-cutting performance.
Salomon entered the ski manufacturing game only three years ago, financed by
the huge success of its dominant binding and boot divisions. The company's
Pounds 30m ski manufacturing investment could not have come at a worse time,
though, as it coincided with a general collapse in world ski sales.
The company has therefore had to work extra hard to establish an exclusive
identity, making skis with special attention to the all-important edge and
base preparation. A pack of special wax is shrink-wrapped on to each pair of
skis. The skis turn easily and carve superbly, but a few doubts remain
concerning durability and lightness of the foresections of the skis.
Interestingly, some models of the high-tech Salomon ski are now made with
wood cores. From a company that has traditionally avoided any contact with
natural materials this is particularly significant and points to a keenness
to dampen the skis and beef up their general performance.
In spite of numerous attempts to remove wood from ski manufacture and
replace it with foam plastic cores, it remains the key core component of
most quality skis. Volkl and K2, two up-and-coming manufacturers from
unconventional ski-making nations (Germany and the US) use wood extensively
in their ski construction.
They both subscribe to a form of ski construction the first came to fame
under the feet of Jean-Claude Killy at the 1968 Winter Olympics: torsion
box. This expensive way of making skis, pioneered by Dynamic, involves
wrapping the core with epoxy fibreglass and composite fibres. The result is
that any Volkl or K2 ski above Pounds 250 has above-average, and in some
cases exceptional, performance.
Still riding the tide of ski manufacturing trends stands Rossignol, the
French maker of consistently outstanding racing skis. The 4SK has been a
long term favourite, and this year's hot tip is the 7XK for high-speed
cruising of red and black runs, but excellent edge-to-edge reaction for
shorter turns.
BOOT BUYS
The relationship of skiers to ski boots tends to be inspired by Woody Allen:
intense but obsessive, fumbling, awkward and neurotic. Some skiers can take
the joke, but lack of comfort is not what one should find after spending
more than Pounds 200 on boots.
Buying comfortable ski boots does not have to be the problem it used to be.
Manufacturers that know how to seduce any easy sale line the rigid plastic
shells of their boots with lovely soft thick padding.
Nordica, the world leader in ski boot production, has pitched to the bulk of
the market with this philosophy for the past decade. Millions of happy
customers have resulted.
Nordica's success has encouraged many other manufacturers to follow a
similar design philosophy, but the wicked truth is that you can have too
much of a good thing. Just as a plastic bucket lined with foam rubber can be
comfortable to stand in, a ski boot does not necessarily function when it is
too comfortable. The importance of obtaining control, along with comfort,
has never been more important.
As ski racers have discovered, the best method is to have boots
custom-injected with foam that forms a near perfect mould around the foot.
The best ski shops have now had up to 20 years experience of this process
and its success rate is high.
Try branches of Snow and Rock (London, Hemel Hempstead or Birmingham) or
Ellis Brigham (nationwide) for boot foaming, or other dedicated specialists.
The boots I tend to revert to, after annual experimentation with others, are
a pair of Salomon SX92 Foam (now SX93 Foam Pounds 269.50). This is the only
good rear-entry boot with a foamed inner, but several other 'four-clip'
boots exists with this option - including the Rossignol R900, Dynafit 3F
912, Nordica Grand Prix 90 (an interesting revival and redesign), Tecnica
TNT (recommended) and Lange X9 (also good). Although no self-respecting and
professional ski shop should operate these days without specialist boot
'surgeons' and the equipment to modify boots, the reality is that most
skiers buy boots off the shelf. What should you look for?
My own choice remains rear-entry, because of its superb convenience and ease
of walking to the lifts. Although there has been a revival of traditional
clipped 'overlap' or 'four-clip' boots this winter, well-designed rear-entry
boots offer excellent transmission of movement to the skis.
Well designed rear-entry boots included the Salomon SX73 (or 83 for better
skiers) and Raichle RX 787. At a lower price, the Nordica 798 could be
considered by early intermediates. The Nordica Syntech range is an
interesting hybrid of rear-entry and four-clip.
Well-designed 'four-clip' boots include the Tecnica TC3 (for good
intermediates) and TLC (for women), and Nordica 883 or 983 for experienced
skiers. The Raichle Flexon boots, with their distinctive ribbed outer flex
tongues, have a strong following with expert skiers.
After 13 years of making only rear-entry boots, Salomon has bowed to market
trends by launching a large range of four-clip boots called Evolution and
Integral. These are worth investigating, too.

FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (1): Val d'Isere voted the king of the FT
mountain - Arnold Wilson analyses FT readers' views of the top skiing
resorts and finds that the old favourites come out best
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WE HAVE been deluged by a blizzard of Pink Snow questionnaires returned by
the Weekend FT's skiing readers. Almost 2,000 readers, aged on average
between 35 and 44 and with an average income of Pounds 35,000, filled in the
form in the hope of winning either the main prize of a skiing holiday in
Klosters, or at least some pink champagne.
FT readers have skied an average of 2.6 countries each and skied in 25
countries altogether. In spite of Austria's famous gemutlichkeit and the
charm and glitter of Switzerland, the French resorts dominate the FT
readers' choice of favourite skiing areas, with Val d'Isere and Tignes - the
celebrated Espace Killy - nosing ahead of the gigantic Trois Vallees:
Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens. There are five French
resorts in the readers' top ten.
But one has emerged unquestionably as king: Val d'Isere. The choice is no
surprise, and it is thoroughly deserved. Readers found both the vast network
of pistes and lift systems in Val d'Isere unbeatable. Tignes, Val d'Isere's
partner, also attracted praise for lifts and runs. Both resorts had
excellent feedback about ski schools.
Of the rival Trois Vallees system, Courchevel and Meribel emerged - again
unsurprisingly - as outstanding ski resorts. Indeed, on an individual resort
basis, both finished higher in the FT readers' top 20 than Tignes. Val
Thorens, also in the Trois Vallees, emerges as a creditable tenth.
The huge snow desert of La Plagne is 11th, and Flaine and Les Arcs fill 13th
and 14th slot. Chamonix/Argentiere is 16th. Alpe d'Huez, (18th), the less
well-known resort in the Dauphine region of France, achieves a strong rating
with its modern lift system.
In Switzerland, Verbier (fourth) wins the skiing Oscar, with Zermatt (sixth)
and Davos/Klosters (seventh) picking up most of the other votes. Wengen is
17th and St Moritz 19th. Zermatt, which has been criticised in the past for
its standard of ski instruction, seems to have overcome its problems and is
highly rated. Verbier also does well in this department. The ski schools at
Gstaad and Saas Fee are praised by many.
In Austria, St Anton, with its highly regarded ski school, is the
highest-placed Austrian resort at No. 8. Kitzbuhel/Kirchberg is 11th and
Lech/Zurs scrapes in at No. 20. Kitzbuhel's famous Red Devils ski school has
many admirers, and those at Alpbach, Obergurgl, Soll and Solden are much
praised. Italy does not get much of a look in - not, apparently, a big ski
destination for FT readers - but the ski school at Souze d'Oulx receives
several bouquets.
The US is predictable: Vail, whose ski school is praised to the skies, wins
by a mile and manages to get into the top ten table. However, Aspen, at No.
21, does not quite make it.
The French domination is reflected handsomely in the choice of the most
popular tour operators: Club Med averages a score of 6.8 out of 8 for every
mention. Among operators used by fewer readers, Touralp heads the field with
the best average of any in the entire table - 8 out of 8. Powder Byrne and
Over The Hill also did well among those with fewer mentions.
Many readers, we learn, make their own arrangements and do not use tour
operators. Mr MP Cunliffe, an intermediate skier from Evesham,
Worcestershire, marked himself 'A' for 'own arrangements', but a much
earlier school trip only earned a 'C'.
Ski Thomson, the market leader, achieved a healthy 5.5 out of 8. Others
mentioned frequently include Supertravel (Lotus) (5.9); Mark Warner (5.9);
Horizon (5.7); Inghams (5.7); Neilson 5.5); Bladon Lines (5.1).
We asked FT readers to rate operators from A (excellent) to D (poor). To
compile our score we counted A=8, B=6, C=2, D= - 2. We felt that there
should be a penalty for readers showing positive dissatisfaction. However,
this system enables smaller operators with satisfied customers to score
relatively highly compared with larger operators, which are bound to have at
least some dissatisfied users. Lower scores may represent patches of
dissatisfaction in a generally contented clientele.
Crystal (3.3) and Ski West (3.6) both received a poor rating from the
survey. Both operators believe they have improved substantially in the last
year or so and claim that because our survey goes back five years, poor
results do not represent present performance.
Andy Perrin, Crystal's marketing director says: 'Between 1989 and 1991 we
were involved in a period of enormous growth and experienced certain
volume-related problems. These occasionally left a sour taste in clients'
mouths even before they reached the resort, so that in the event of a
problem later - no matter how small - it could all be blown out of
proportion rather than just being settled by popping round to see the rep.
We have now installed a new computer system which we believe will prevent
further problems.'
John Parker, of Ski West, says: 'We were surprised and concerned at these
results. They contradict our own returns which last season reflected a very
high level of satisfaction and a negligible level of complaints - less than
1 per cent of our clients. We have invested heavily over the last 12 months
in resort staff training and quality control. We are convinced that our
choice of chalet accommodation is among the best on the market.'
And what of Powder Byrne, which provided our first prize of a week's chalet
holiday in Klosters? The company scored an excellent 7.8 out of 8. Ski Scott
Dunn, its rival in the world of up-market ski holidays, emerged with a
creditable 6.9.
Some tour operators mentioned by readers are no longer with us and these
have been omitted from the list. Mr H. Gray of Ashford, Kent, an
intermediate who also wants a better deal for 'mature' skiers, mentions four
operators but omits 'others no longer in business or too poor to qualify.'
Some, like Supertravel, are under new management.
As for apres-ski, several readers, including Mr DY Adams from Twickenham,
west London, a hard-skiing intermediate, wrote that they were 'too tired' to
visit nightclubs or discos. One reader even said he was 'too drunk' to
remember the names of the establishments he had found the energy to visit.
Mr John Dyet, a beginner, from Paignton, reports from Puy St Vincent: 'No
night life but none the worse for it.'
There were, however, more serious, though thankfully few, tales of woe. One
has to feel for Mr Keith Otto (intermediate), from Brighton who says of a
chalet holiday in Italy: 'Very disappointing. No snow. Poor food.' That just
about sums up the worst possible scenario for a skier.
At least Mr Otto survived unscathed, which is more than can be said for Mr
WP Kember (intermediate) a recently retired reader from Highgate, London,
who chose St Moritz as his favourite resort. 'But it might have been Vail
had the pistes been safer', he writes. 'Wife hit twice by out-of-control
snowboarders and needed hospital treatment. I was hit once.'
Mr Edgar Phillips, an expert skier from Kendal, showed some sympathy for
tour operators trying to deal with poor snow conditions - but there was a
sting in his tale. 'It wasn't their fault that there was no skiable snow,
but I booked a skiing holiday, not a walking or shopping trip. It was the
year during which, when checking snow guarantees and insurance small print,
I felt an air of fraud emanating from the pages of tour operators'
brochures.'
A number of readers used the form to campaign about what they perceive to be
problems and injustices in the industry. 'Help stamp out iniquitous single
room supplements]' says angry Mr P. Snook of Abingdon, Oxon.
'It is very random whether one acquires an instructor who suits,' writes Mrs
Margaret McAlpine, an intermediate from Enfield, Middlesex. 'Alpe d'Huez was
a happy combination of excellent snow and very conscientious instructor. St
Anton was a disaster of poor snow, a laid-back pensioner of a teacher and a
very mixed ability class. We were outstretched and experienced increasing
drop-outs after one fright too many.'
Sadly, Mr EA Coles, (intermediate) from Stevenage, Herts does not share Mrs
McAlpine's enthusiasm for French resorts. 'No problems anywhere except
French purpose-built resorts', he trumpets, noting that in his view these
had the worst restaurants, ski school and apartments. He chose Vail and
Breckenridge as his favourite resorts, but in spite of admitting that he is
comfortably off, thought America was expensive. He did rather grudgingly say
that one French ski village - Belle Plagne, in La Plagne - was pretty in
spite of being purpose-built and was among his favourites.
Mr Quintin Gardner, intermediate, of Croydon, thinks Mr Coles has got it all
wrong about France. He skis there four times a year (always with Touralp)
and likes it so much he has never bothered to try Austria, Switzerland or
the US. His favourites: Les Arcs and Flaine.
Mr JM Bray of Handcross, intermediate, of West Sussex chose Zermatt: 'Good
skiing, scenery - and no cars.' For Mr James Bardner, an expert skier from
London it was 'Aspen - but it's expensive.'
The merits of Europe versus the US was a popular theme. Dr JA Heyworth, a
'good intermediate' from Wilmslow, Cheshire, thought the US best for
'discipline of queues' but rated Courchevel's 'bubbles out of resort'
highly. Mr E. Brett, from London, admitted that he 'occasionally takes a
guide, to jump queues in France.'
The hotels, restaurants and apres-ski in Jackson Hole, Wyoming (my own
personal favourite) swept the board with Mr J. Hoseason, an expert skier
from Norwich, who has also skied in Gstaad, Kitzbuhel, Courmayeur, Val
Thorens and Meribel. But for European skiing his favourite was Val Thorens.
Jenny Fowle, from Jersey (intermediate) also rates Val Thorens highly. 'It
is impossible to beat the Trois Vallees in Europe, but I'll try the US
soon,' she says. A beginner, Mrs Moya Drummond, says that all the facilities
are good at big Canadian resorts such as Whistler and Mont Tremblant. But
then she would say that - she lives in Canada.
Swiss hotels come in for adulation, but also a little criticism. The Monte
Rosa and Zermatterhof - both in Zermatt - win most acclaim. In Wengen,
another popular haunt with FT skiers, the Regina, Silberhorn, Alpenrose and
Sunstar were extremely popular, and the Palace at Gstaad and St Moritz
attracted praise. The Rosalp in Verbier, the Park at Flims and the Margna at
Sils Maria were also popular.
The Kulm at Arosa and the Schweitzerhof at Gstaad, St Moritz, Davos and
Nendaz (Verbier) received a lot of votes from satisfied customers. But Mr RM
Dymond of Lymm, Cheshire (intermediate) was 'very disappointed by the
Schweizerhof in Zermatt. Cold and unfriendly.' There might be something in
this, because not a single reader has praised this well-known hotel. Other
Zermatt hotels which do receive bouquets include the Alex, Alpenhof, Mont
Cervin and Zermatterhof.
Mr David Hall, an expert skier from County Meath, Ireland, is unequivocal
about the Fluela in Davos. 'It's the best ski hotel in the world' he says.
Mr PD Carosone, an Edgware, Middlesex, intermediate writes: 'Please note
that the Llao-Llao Hotel will be opening in Bariloche (Argentina) very soon.
It will be the best hotel in South America - right in the best ski area in
the southern hemisphere.'
In France, Le Totem and Les Lindars in Flaine have many admirers among our
readers, and the Golf Hotel scored well in Les Arcs. Readers also enjoyed
the Christiania and Savoyard in Val d'Isere. Skiers in Austria liked the
Arlberg at St Anton, the Tannbergerhof in Lech and the Post at Soll. Mr CD
Cranmer, intermediate, of Wimbledon, chose the Wildbad in Bad Gastein,
adding: 'Please keep it quiet. I don't want to find I can't get in in
future.'
However, by and large readers skiing in Austria seem to have such eclectic
taste that few individual hotels appear more than once or twice. Perhaps
this reflects the wide choice of accommodation, from guesthouse and
bed-and-breakfast farmhouse to hotel, available in Austria.
Skiers who cross the Atlantic rate the Breckenridge Hilton and the
splendidly scenic Chateau Lake Louise in Canada highly, however, the Chateau
Whistler and the celebrated Lodge at Vail get the lion's share of the
laurels. Vail's Marriott Hotel also does well.
Restaurants singled out by more than one reader include Banff's Grizzly
Bear, and Siding 29 (Banff's original name when the railway but not the town
had been built in 1883.)
The Blue Moose at Breckenridge, the Chalet de Pierres, the Diva at Isola
2000, the Rustico and the Walliserhof (Klosters), Chez Kiki (Meribel),
Barking Frog and the River Horse (Park City, Utah), Tim's Stray Dog Cantina
(Taos, New Mexico), Sonnenalp (Vail), Crech'Ouna and Perdrix Blanche (Val
d'Isere), Rosalp and Vieux Verbier (Verbier) and the Wengernalp (Wengen) all
seem to have something special.
And in Zermatt, where there are more mountain restaurants than perhaps in
any ski resort in the world, Enzo's, Le Mazot, Simis and Stockhorn seem to
be the favourites among FT readers. I fancy the entry for the 'Forget'
establishment in Meribel Mottaret is probably a reader saying he forgets the
name of his favourite restaurant.
On the apres ski front, Dick's T-Bar in Val d'Isere seems to be preserving
its loyal following with 27 mentions. Verbier's Farm Club is praised by nine
readers and the boisterous Londoner in Kitzbuhel finds favour with five. The
Krazy Kangaruh at St Anton also has five admirers.
And finally, Mr W. Hall of Fordingbridge, Hampshire, who describes himself
as an expert, writes: 'Please do not ring unless I have won the major
prize.'
Sorry, Mr Hall, you forgot to send us your telephone number. So you may
never know . . .

(poor). We have converted these ratings to a score as follows: A=8, B=6,
C=2, D= -2 Total number of mentions for all operators still in
business: 1088.  Average score: 5.6. The survey relates to the
experiences of FT readers over the last five years. The management of
some companies changed in that period. Operators no longer in business
have been excluded from the survey.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Conservatives sell their birthright: Dominic Lawson says
that in the week's key vote the government betrayed property rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THIS week's most important vote in the House of Commons the Conservative
Party, with a few notable exceptions, betrayed one of its few remaining
principles. I am referring of course to the passing, on Tuesday, of the
second reading of the Housing and Urban Development bill.
The bill proposes that those holding the lease of any flat in the land may
compulsorily acquire the freehold, at a knock-down price, regardless of both
the wishes of the freeholders and any previous contract agreed between
leaseholder and freeholder.
The measure is a sweeping extension of the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act, a
proposal of the socialist Government of Harold Wilson. That law, however,
enabled only leaseholders of entire houses to expropriate their freeholders.
Even then, a number of Conservative Members of Parliament did not vote
against the measure. One of the leading Tories of the time, Sir Edward
Boyle, asked by an irate freeholder why he did not oppose the Bill, replied
in a letter of breathtaking cynicism: 'However much you and I may talk about
'robbing the rich to pay for the poor', it really is not going to help if
those like myself, with narrow margins in seats whose social complexion is
rapidly changing, fail to secure re-election at the next election.'
Present day Tories do not even have Sir Edward's tawdry excuse: the landlord
issue is not nearly as politically explosive as it was in the 1960s. The
pressure for change has come largely from MPs whose constituencies cover the
great central London Estates of Earl Cadogan and the Duke of Westminster.
Perhaps significantly, neither of these gentlemen has the vote.
Under the terms of the bill these and other freeholders can be compulsorily
bought out for what is described as a 'fair market price': a sum equivalent
to 50 per cent of the estimated free market value of combining the freehold
and leasehold on any given property.
According even to a Tory MP who voted for the bill (faithfully reported by
Hansard) 'It appears in a fashion which is not related to merit or to
reason, to take property assets from one party and to give them to another.
It is quite clear that there is a windfall element of profit in this process
of transformation. All that is being offered to the freeholder is 50 per
cent of the marriage value, whereas in the commercial market it would be 80
per cent. There would be a claim for injurious affection for the rest of his
estate . . .'
This MP, who, as I say, cast his vote for the expropriating measure, also
pointed out that the denuded freeholders were not just the likes of Cadogan
and Westminster, but also the Church Commissioners and the bulk of the
biggest pension funds and charities.
Another Conservative MP, Sir Michael Jopling, interrupted the sponsoring
Minister Michael Howard thus: 'Is the Secretary of State aware that many of
his honourable friends are astonished that the present Government, of all
governments, should be seeking to force people to sell their property and
have freely made agreements broken by the will of the House . . . the
concept of a 'fair market price' . . . will be nothing of the sort and gives
great offence to many of us.' Alas, Sir Michael Jopling too found it
inconvenient to stick around to cast his vote against the measure.
With only (so far as I could tell) one Tory prepared to vote against the
government, the bill passed its second reading with a majority of almost 70.
It is easy to see how this bill fits in with the Thatcherite interpretation
of a 'property owning democracy' - although Disraeli, who originated the
term, would have been horrified. It is clearly designed to ensure that the
middle classes - or at least those among them affluent enough to buy
leaseholds in Mayfair, Belgravia and Chelsea - have more and more property
assets to pass on to their children: tomorrow's electorate.
The freeholders will doubtless have entertained the hope that they could
have passed on the property they own to their children, just as they
inherited it from their fathers. Too bad for them, it seems.
During the debate ministers argued that it was legitimate to break a binding
commercial contract, such as that which exists between freeholder and
leaseholder, if it was in the general public interest. An interesting
argument, and one which will doubtless be used by a future Labour government
if and when it proposes terms for the state buyback of shares in privatised
utilities.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: Take me to your hologram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY time I visit the FT's London office I cross from the north bank of the
River Thames to the south bank: from civilisation and well-being to the
stinks and stews of Southwark; from probity and moral order to chaos and
licentiousness; from dancing and feasting and women in glass slippers to
dirt, danger, darkness and depravity.
I cross at Southwark Bridge, and always glance down - horrified at the
rubbish in the Thames and at the colour of the river. Filth-coloured.
Sludge-coloured. The colour of despair. There are times when the Thames
seems to glow with an apocalyptic sheen. I am sure it is radio-active.
Imagine my amazement, then, every time I read an article about efforts to
re-establish the Thames as a river fit for salmon. It is a story in which I
have an ancestral professional interest, for one black evening in the 1970s
I was dispatched by the News desk to a hastily-called press conference in
Fleet Street at which the Thames river authorities displayed - wrapped in
tin-foil and mildly refrigerated - the slim, still corpse of the first
salmon found in the Thames for many a long year.
As the corpse was unveiled, the Telegraph reporter, a mature and well-topped
woman, recoiled and almost wept. I wrote 400 words of story; put them over
to copy; was hailed by the News desk
for all-round speed and dash; replaced the receiver gently; checked my hair
in a mirror; adopted an innocent look; sidled across to the Telegraph; asked
sweetly if she was better, and offered to victual and comfort her. No limits
bound her gratitude.
Amidst all the shenanigans, I had not failed to detect that the purpose of
the press conference, the point of parading this salmon, was to foster the
impression that the Thames was on the road to recovery. It was no longer a
notorious sewer or a conduit for industrial waste but a gentler, fairer
river than at any time since the mid-19th century.
No doubt it is a gentler, fairer river than in 1850, say, when the sewage of
2m Londoners was emptied straight into the river and the famed Thames salmon
was extinct. (In 1822, the Art of Angling had claimed that Thames salmon
'surpassed all others in flavour' and rated the Thames England's principal
salmon river).
And no doubt the efforts by the authorities and the Thames Salmon Trust to
re-establish the Thames salmon run are admirable for their ingenuity and
single-mindedness in the face of maddening odds. But what a vexing and
costly business. What an extravagant piece of PR, for the Thames still looks
like trash, still looks radio-active, however many demented, returning fish
can be enticed to make the fatal run from the estuary to Teddington or
beyond.
The recorded number of salmon passing through the Thames Salmon Trust's fish
trap at Molesey this summer was 261, indicating, says the trust, that the
number that returned from the open sea to the river was about 500. Its
target is 1,000 returnees. But the effort is immense. This year, more than
200,000 parr and smolts will have been tipped into the Thames and its
tributaries. The cost of fish-passes on weirs is Pounds 40,000 or more.
Eleven have been installed; 11 more are needed. It is all amazingly silly -
PR at its finest, which means PR at its worst.
But I believe I have a solution: a run of mechanical salmon, a shoal of
clockwork fish. I am sure Japan would make them for a surprisingly modest
sum. I envisage about 400, some of 90lb, 20lb greater than the one landed
from the Thames in April 1789, which had a girth of 36in and was sold for a
shilling a pound. Three times a day, every day of the year, my clockwork run
of salmon would zip gleamingly up-river, leaping as they went - and then zip
down again.
But why stop there? In the era that lies before us, the age of virtual
reality, we won't need mechanical salmon; we will do it all with lasers.
Britain won't have nuclear submarines - just grey and ghostly illusions
diving beneath the waves. Above all, we won't have Laurel and Hardy to wreck
and crucify us. Our leaders will be holograms, and all the better for it.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Private View: The Reverend Soapbox - Lord Soper, Britain's
best-known preacher, is 90 next year. He explains why he still speaks every
week at Hyde Park and Tower Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'KNOCK it off, Soapy]', yelled a pugnacious little man in front of me. 'Get
back to the nursing home where you belong, you old windbag]'
Lord Soper seemed not to hear. He was leaning forward on his step-ladder to
dispute with someone on the far side of the small crowd. He looked very
frail and his voice was weak against the wind.
The Rev. Donald Soper, Methodist minister, 90 next January, may not be able
to dish it out quite as he used to - but he can certainly take it. With
occasional absences, he has spoken at Tower Hill in London every Wednesday
since 1926 and at Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park, every Sunday since the the
late 1930s.
Why on earth does he go on doing it?
I went to the run-down offices of the West London Methodist Mission at a
church not far from Oxford Street. Britain's best-known preacher was sunk in
an old armchair. 'Do you mind if I don't get up?' he said as he held out a
hand.
If he seems vulnerable in the open air, Soper is imposingly venerable
indoors. The clarity and frankness of his conversation testifies to the
rigours of nearly 6,000 open-air confrontations - what he calls 'the
fellowship of controversy'.
'You can't get away with it in the open air as you can in church,' he said.
'And don't I know it] I remember one little docker. He used to sit on the
wall beside me at Tower Hill (I stood on the wall for 30 years) and when I'd
been particularly obtuse - I can hear him now - he would say to the crowd in
an admonitory phrase: 'Now is that clear?' And of course I knew damn well it
wasn't'
He regrets the loss of his docker audience at the Tower ('very intelligent
and very vociferous') and the fact that he can no longer get an echo from
across the river Thames.
Speakers' Corner was always more raucous and has become even rougher with
the appearance of 'professional' hecklers who go from pitch to pitch in the
hope of creating a fracas. There was one in particular, he said, whose
language about women in the crowd was downright pornographic.
Why don't the police remove him?
'I have never called in the police and I never will. I hate to say this: but
I think I can see most of 'em off. You must be careful not to give the
impression that I'm cocky about it. But it's a fairly low-grade intelligence
you're dealing with and if you can keep them to what they are saying you can
generally get the better of them.
'One thing has to be admitted. I used to imagine it was the coruscating
quality of my mind. Now I've discovered when my voice is not nearly as good
as it used to be . . .'
Are you getting too weak to take them on?
'No. I'm physically disabled in some respects: for instance my legs are very
bad. But I think I've got enough sense to realise that you should give up
rather than dry up. You want to go out with a bang, not a whimper.'
What puzzles, I said, is why you should go on doing it.
'I am a Methodist preacher and I suppose in some respects I'm peculiar in
that I never wanted to do anything else. I never had any doubts - impudence,
of course, impudence - but no doubts that I was going to offer myself to the
church to be a preacher. Therefore you can say I'm an addict. Or you can say
I have a calling. But I'm committed. And that's not a credit to me. It's
just a condition.'
After a degree from Cambridge, a PhD from London and ordination, Donald
Soper was pitched into the working-class world of London's Old Kent Road. He
found himself answering questions that no one was asking. It was the same at
Tower Hill.
'The first question I was asked was about Karl Marx, and I'd never heard of
him. I told them I didn't want to give them a hasty answer,' he chuckled.
'I have a continuing conviction that a great many in contemporary society
are not evangelised in any sense because they don't go to the places where
the gospel is preached. And when they do go - I don't want to be unkind -
they are not necessarily brought into touch with the kingdom of God.'
I'm surprised you don't feel after all these years that what you do makes
not a ha'porth of difference.
'That, of course, is a temptation, particularly when you've had a bad time
in the open air. You think, what the Hell's the good of it?
'I don't want to sound pious or prudish but my responsibility is not so much
to count scalps as to proclaim something which I believe it is my duty and
my calling to proclaim. Therefore I am not hag-ridden by the question of
results.'
Wouldn't you say people today are more godless, more greedy?
'I think they are.'
So you should be in a state of some despair.
'I could easily fall for that feeling. I quite often find it very difficult
to keep my pecker up. On the other hand I have evidence of the help I have
been to people who have not at the time expressed any thanks but, meeting
them casually, sometimes years afterwards, have said they have been
influenced and altered in their conviction.'
It felt wrong to be provoking an old man. Then I reflected that Lord Soper
has faced worse - much worse.
He expatiated on war, how armed violence had infected our lives and how
violence had been allied to sex. ('I can speak with authority on sex for I'm
nearly 90').
Sex had become such a dominant ingredient of our diet that our stomachs
could not take it. 'In violence and sex we are in peril of an almost
terminal condition.'
Why did we get into this condition?
'The Christian church always had an inkling that original sin isn't a
sufficient explanation, that total depravity is much nearer the mark. This
may sound a little pompous and sentimental but I think we're going to Hell
because we're not saying our prayers.'
Why did we stop saying our prayers?
'Because the invitations of a modern society, whether they are fulfilled or
not - you've only to think of the advertisements - create a different
atmosphere. The peasant in an Indian village has very little to hope for,
very little to encourage him to greed or to the prospects of advancement.
'We are in a world where the invitation to pleasure or to happiness is very
largely separated from the responsibilities that go with that quest for
happiness. That is to say, pleasure, ultimately, is self-defeating.
'You can be a good capitalist and practise self-interest, pride, but you
can't be a good citizen - a socialist, as I would use the word - unless you
have a sense of moral responsibility. We are clever enough, almost, for
anything now. But we are certainly not good enough.'
Since you've mentioned socialism, I said, let me pursue a defeatist line.
You stand for socialism and pacifism and both have taken a severe hammering.
'You say 'hammering'. It depends who's doing the hammering, how he's
wielding the hammer. You don't discredit socialism by recognising the
collapse of Communism. What you do, in my judgment, is realise you've taken
the word socialism too easily.
'The socialism I believe is that which emerges from the teaching of Jesus,
particularly from the sermon on the Mount. I never believed in socialism as
state capitalism. I don't believe in the nonsense that we are all equal and
there is some divine quality of the proletariat and so on.'
After discoursing on the ethics of capitalism and socialism Soper concluded:
'I have no doubt that Christianity has not succeeded. But I am more than
ever convinced that we're in a hell of a mess now and that things are
getting worse. And they are getting worse because we are refusing to
consider the alternative to the kind of system which some people have
profited by.'
He accepted my labelling him an anachronism, adding that it was a
characteristic of Christianity.
'I'm by no means as lonely when I think of the saints as I am when I think
of the hecklers.'
He described the physical and psychological handicaps of age. 'When you're
looking forward there's always the inference that you can put it right if
it's wrong. When you get to my age, you look back and you realise that
things which were open-ended are now shut. And it's not a very pleasant
experience.'
So that's another temptation to despair?
'It is, yes. You refer to this quite a lot. I would be insincere if I said
that I'm not sometimes disappointed and rather bewildered that things
haven't gone better. But I still have this quite dominating background of
obedience. I find it is health-giving not worrying the whole time as to how
you are getting on.'
Would you confess that your appearances at Tower Hill and Hyde Park have
become a matter of pride?
'Of course. Let's be quite clear about that. I believe I ought to be there,
however badly I do. It is a matter of self-interest. I am serving a part of
myself which probably I ought to be more humble about.'
Which bit of you?
'Well, I'm fairly good at it. I've been a long time at it. And I've got into
the habit of doing it. And though I would indignantly repudiate the idea
that those are sufficient motives I've never been silly enough to say that
I'm not a mixture of motives.'
So there is a certain vanity attached to it?
'Y . . . es. Vanity, if you like. Yes. You're putting me in the confession
box and I will take your priestly office and accept it straight away that
I'm a mixture of good and bad, of pride and humility. But I find the
resolution of this complexity is the question of obedience.
'That is to say, I believe I must do it.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Tempestuous Russian with a lust for life - Poetry in
Performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST evening of this year's Poetry International Festival, which opened
at the South Bank last weekend, was given over to a centenary celebration of
the life and work of one of the most important Russian writers of the 20th
century, Marina Tsvetayeva. Of the quartet of great Russian poets of our
time - Pasternak, Mandelstam, Akhmatova and Tsvetayeva - Tsvetayeva was for
many years the least well known in the west, and the poet who was largely
responsible for introducing her work to English-speaking readers, Elaine
Feinstein, opened the evening with an account of her life and work.
Tsvetayeva was born in the comfortable bourgeois surroundings of fin de
siecle Moscow. Her father was an art historian (and the creator of what is
now known as the Pushkin Museum) and her mother a gifted pianist. But there
was little warmth or gaiety in her childhood; and the relationship with her
mother, though intense, was, like Tsvetayeva herself, extremely difficult.
The mother inculcated in her precocious daughter a love for German
romanticism, and Tsvetayeva's passionate devotion to all things German was
to prove a complicating influence upon her difficult later life. 'Mother
gave us to drink from the opened vein of lyricism,' she once wrote.
Her childhood was peripatetic, and her adolescence lonely. In 1912, she met
her future husband, Sergey Efron, in the Crimea, and recognised in him a
soul mate. He, the child of revolutionaries, had been orphaned. She had just
lost her mother. They clung together like children and were to do so for the
next 30 years.
It was a relationship of unequals. Tsvetayeva possessed the greater talent
and had a ruthless determination to succeed at the task she had set herself
of being a poet; Sergey, by comparison, was pallid and indecisive, and
proved incapable of supporting his family. They married in 1912.
Before the Revolution, life remained relatively privileged. Tsvetayeva's
talents burgeoned into exquisite lyrical poetry with seeming ease,
establishing the themes that would be her work's principal obsessions:
poetry, Russia and love. She also had innumerable affairs with poets and
actors in repeated attempts to slake her 'compulsive, feverish lust for
life'. Sergey, hurt, remained as faithful as a dog.
When the Revolution came, Sergey joined the White army and Tsvetayeva
espoused the White cause with fervour - though not for reasons of profound
political conviction. She feared the irresponsibility of the crowd, and was
never convinced that revolution could be a 'purifying force.' It was also a
humanist's response: sheer horror in the face of all that tragic waste of
human life.
Left behind in Moscow, she and her young family suffered the cold and famine
of those terrible years. She burnt her books for heat; and travelled into
the countryside to barter amber necklaces for scraps of food. Her domestic
life was marked by confusion. 'The flat,' wrote the widow of the poet
Mandelstam, 'is given over to dust, dirt and decay. There is an atmosphere
of witchcraft.' The whereabouts of her husband remained unknown for years.
One of her children starved to death in an orphanage.
After the Reds triumphed, Tsvetayeva discovered that Sergey had escaped to
Prague, where she joined him in 1923. It was no easy decision to leave
Russia, no matter how great the hardships. Parting represented a kind of
separation of the soul from the body. The Motherland, to the end, remained
'an absolute of memory and blood . . .' The experience proved a trigger for
some of her finest poetry.
Then began her 17 years of life as an emigre writer, spent in Berlin, Prague
and finally Paris.
The most intense moments of Tsvetayeva's life were lived through her writing
 -her long and impassioned 'mystical marriage' by letter with the poet Boris
Pasternak, for example, and the poetry that she never ceased to write.
Outwardly, she may have looked slovenly and unkempt. Inwardly, she remained
concentrated and resolved.
In 1937, fate played its most heartless card. Sergey was accused of
complicity in the murder of a Soviet agent who had refused to return to the
USSR. He disappeared - back to the Soviet Union. Tsvetayeva, now branded the
wife of a failed agent, followed him.
The last four years resemble the horrid and almost improbably brutal final
scenes of a Jacobean tragedy. Sergey was arrested and shot. Her daughter was
sentenced to eight years in a labour camp for 'espionage'. Tsvetayeva hanged
herself in August 1941. Earlier in that same day, according to Tsvetayeva's
latest biographer in an intimate psychological portrait that will be
published next month, Tsvetayeva's spoilt son may have harangued her for
ruining his life.
In the second half of the evening, 12 women poets - Wendy Cope, Fleur
Adcock, Carol Ann Duffy and others - read in turn their own new translations
of Tsvetayeva's poetry, and two Russian readers gave us the same poems in
the original versions - and how astonishing was the contrast]
On occasions like this one wonders how it is that English poets ever manage
to make great poetry out of a language that can sound as emotionally shy as
ours. But then perhaps it is not the fault of the language itself; perhaps
it is something to do with our national character. Tsvetayeva was a poet of
extreme emotionality, and listening to her poems in the Russian is like
watching a wrestling match on television - there is rage and violence
everywhere; sudden brutal lunges that can win the most hardened listener.
Only Mimi Khalvati, a young poet who was born in Tehran, seemed to measure
up to the challenge of representing her. When she read her translation of
'In Praise of the Rich', a wonderful piece of sustained sarcasm, the
emotional shape of the poem - its sudden twists and turns, its hushes and
its bellows - became immediately apparent.
The rest of the poets simply lacked the emotional training to go the full
distance with this tempestuous Russian.
Tsvetayeva by Victoria Schweitzer will be published by Harvill (Pounds 20)
at the end of November; Black Earth, a new collection of Tsvetayeva
translations by Elaine Feinstein, has just been published by the Menard
Press (Pounds 4.50).

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: High Gothic and lethal women - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK ago, the trauma of Halloween. Two days ago, the terror of Guy Fawkes.
Forty shopping days hence - Christmas.
At this time of year, when we are all at screaming point, entertainment
retailers take advantage. Horror is the style of the season and this year
the world is turning Gothic even as we speak. A tide of vampire films is
being readied for release across the Atlantic. And on video a flood of grand
guignol, ancient and modern, laps at our feet in this month's releases.
If you like your Gothic strong and self-parodic, you should try The Addams
Family (CIC). This is the hit movie of the TV series with Anjelica Huston as
'Morticia', crunching her one-liners like edible bats. The wit is variable,
but the sets and gewgaws are irresistible.
The film also pinpoints a post-feminist trend. Look at all the modern scream
movies in which women are the ghouls or evil genii. The unholy trinity of
Final Analysis (Warner), Fatal Attraction (CIC) and Basic Instinct (Guild)
makes the point thrice over. Trend-sensitive Hollywood, anxious to tap into
all those frayed male nerves in the age of Steinem and Millett and Dworkin,
hath no fury more lucrative than a woman scorned.
Here they are: Glenn Close wielding a kitchen knife in Fatal Attraction, Kim
Basinger a murderous dumb-bell in Final Analysis, Sharon Stone an ice-pick
in Basic Instinct.
Fatal women, of course, are not new: they merely seem new each time they
return to our screens reborn in a new zeitgeist. The cinema's first great
slayer-siren was surely Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, eating up
Professor Emil Jannings in the Sternberg masterpiece now reissued by Aikman
Archive Video.
This company also gives us Fritz Lang's Metropolis, in a 139-minute version
claimed as the most complete available. Lang's futurist-Gothic epic, with
its spectacular special-effect cityscapes, also has its own sci-fi version
of fatal femininity: Brigitte Helm's robot-enchantress, brought to life in
the greatest 'mad scientist' scene before Frankenstein.
Not all in November is high Gothic and lethal women. Two encouraging areas
in which the video market is expanding are art films and wide-screen films.
Movies like Bille August's Cannes prize-winning The Best Intentions
(Artificial Eye), with its majestic Ingmar Bergman script based on the life
of his family, or Jocelyn Moorhouse's witty fable of a blind photographer
Proof (Artificial Eye), or Lars Von Trier's eye-boggling essay in
Euro-baroque Europa (Electric) bounce from festival to cinema release to
video availability in three blinks of an eye.
As for widescreen films issued in their proper format - 'letterboxed' for
TV's squarer screen - their multiplying availability is music to purist's
ears. Tartan Video is a new company fearlessly blacking out the tops and
bottoms of screens so that in John Huston's Reflections In A Golden Eye
(Taylor and Brando going charismatically mad in the Deep South) or Jerry
Schatzberg's Honeysuckle Rose (Willie Nelson in a twangling road musical) or
John Milius's Big Wednesday (surfing and rites of passage in modern Malibu),
we can enjoy compositions as wide, true and felicitous as a Cheshire Cat's
grin.
You may of course wish to partake in the odd grin yourself: not an easy
request in the comedy-deprived weeks after Halloween. But there is the
Charlie Chaplin Collection (Fox). With the cheeky chappie about to bound
onto our screens in Richard Attenborough's bio-pic, here is the real
cane-twirling, baggy-trousered thing. Four cassettes comprising five films,
including The Great Dictator, City Lights and Modern Times: they offer The
chance to lock yourself away for six hours from all thoughts of vampires,
ghoulies and icepick-wielding ice maidens.

ANTONY AND Cleopatra is an uneven play at the best of times. It contains
some of the most magnificent lines of poetic drama written by Shakespeare
and - because of the poetry - the two central characters have huge potential
stature. Some of the best lines extend to their aides, Enobarbus and
Charmian. But apart from that, there are a lot of dreary battle scenes and
there is not much to be said for the bulk of the Romans. Who remembers parts
like Scarus and Tarus?
To play it as a drunken romp is therefore perverse. John Caird's production
at Stratford starts badly and improves only in the final 15 minutes. The
opening set looks like Son et Lumiere at the Sphinx. And if the set is weak,
the costumes are worse. This Roman-Egyptian ragbag could have come out of a
dressing up box kept in the attic in case somebody wanted to play charades.
Antony (Richard Johnson) is an ageing, lecherous slob. Cleopatra (Clare
Higgins) looks like a slut until she puts on her robes after Antony's death
and has her immortal longings.
I know that there is some justification for this in the text. Cleopatra is
referred to as a gypsy and Antony is clearly past his best. On the other
hand, this is not the Antony and Cleopatra that we know and love. It is
scarcely conceivable that a couple so sordid could speak the beautiful lines
that they are entrusted with. To be fair to them, they do not always try.
Most of the poetry is thrown away. When Antony says 'The long day's task is
done', he speaks as if he were Winston Churchill with a cigar in his mouth.
Paul Jesson as Enobarbus also suffers. He is a dull man with a beard. When
he makes his best-known speech ('the barge she sat in'), it seems wholly out
of character and one wonders what it is doing in a production like this.
We should not blame the actors. This is director's theatre and presumably
Caird took a decision to play up the weaknesses rather than the strengths.
There is no sense of the Roman machine, toy battles predominate and Rome
seems as drunk as Egypt. The Roman banquet is played like a seedy Boat Night
supper. Again, that possibility is in the text, but is hardly a central
theme.
This Antony and Cleopatra reminds me of a new play I saw in London earlier
in the week: Keith Waterhouse's Our Song starring Peter O'Toole. They have
the same subject: a man over the top falling for a younger mysterious,
wayward girl. It is to that level that Caird has reduced Antony and
Cleopatra. Someone in the RSC should have warned him early on that he was
going too far in the wrong direction.
Meanwhile, at the RSC's Other Place in Stratford was the premiere of School
of Night by Peter Whelan. This struck me as over-ambitious even for so
promising a playwright, mainly because Whelan is trying to do too much at
once.
At one level there is a lot of fun and games between Shakespeare,
Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd of the Revenger's Tragedy and it is
amusing to pick up the literary and biographical references. At another, he
is demonstrating that England, far from going through a golden age in the
last decade of Queen Elizabeth I, was more akin to a police state. Nothing
wrong with that: there is a good deal of evidence to support his thesis and
Whelan, we know from his Bright and Bold Design at The Pit last year, is
well versed in political history and theory.
At the same time, School of Night is presented as a thriller. As such, it is
mediocre and obscure. The biggest failing, however, comes from showing
Marlowe as a Faustus figure believing in Dog not God, leading to lines like
'Dog help me' and 'Dog Almighty'. These scenes are embarrassingly bad and
get in the way. The more interesting failing is the attempt to have a
dialogue between Marlowe and Shakespeare on how, while admiring each other's
work, they had different aims as playwrights. This dialogue is never
properly joined and it is unclear to me what Whelan is seeking to say.
Nevertheless, his work is worth watching.
School of Night is directed by Bill Alexander and Marlowe is played by
Richard McCabe who would find the task easier if Whelan had made up his mind
about what sort of character he was. Sometimes it seems that this Marlowe
was simply over-impressed by clever people at Cambridge.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Merchant updated, Seagull transported / Review of
Shakespeare and Chekhov in Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISRAELI was right: 'The age of Classical ruins is past. Have you seen
Manchester?' Dizzy might not have enjoyed the anti-semitism in The Merchant
of Venice at Manchester's Library Theatre, but he would have approved the
cultural diversity which the production witnesses in the city as a whole.
To walk south on Oxford Road past The Green Room, The Palace Theatre and The
Corner House towards the University is to see a mix of theatres, clubs,
exhibitions, film, and jazz venues. Off Albert Square sits The Library
Theatre, built as a lecture hall in 1934 under the magnificent Central
Library (modeled on the British Museum reading room); the lecture-room
became a small theatre in 1947.
Chris Honer's steady production places The Merchant in 1920s Venice,
according to Michael Taylor's deft design, connecting with market
speculation and cultural attitudes then current. Anti-semitism excepted,
perhaps 1990s Milan would have suited better, particularly since the ratio
of public to private debt in Italy and England are inversely proportional.
Back in the 1590s, the public world of Shylock's Rialto and the private
world of Antonio's indebtedness meet in court, Jew with knife, Christian
with bared breast, the Law looking on.
But the production style misses the mark by going for the lira. It lacks the
gathered intensity which makes Lorenzo and Jessica one of the most
enthralling mixed marriages in Shakespeare. The flash double-breasted suits,
panama hats and ticker tape tend to distract from the action; while the
Belmont scenes, all flapper-dresses and gramophones, feel semi-detached.
After all, this is a play about anti-semitism.
The fine performances of Peter Whitman as Shylock and Kate Paul as Portia
hold the action together. Whitman delivers Shakespeare's careful repetitions
with the studied attention of a man doing business while pretending not to,
firming the deal by repeating the details: 'Three thousand ducats, well.' -
'Ay, sir, for three months.' - 'For three months, well.' Then later in the
scene: 'I had forgot, three months, you told me so.' Whitman manages to move
from that quiet, steely beginning to his state of cold implacability in
court.
Opposite him, Paul's Portia handles her affairs with confident dispatch. Her
'mercy' speech in court, a special pleading unfamiliar to her, is a
rehearsed-spontaneous moment, the indulgence of someone who knows her
opponent's inferior hand. Other highlights include David Kelsey's Antonio
and Chris Wright's Bassanio, both men about town. David Solomon, doubling as
Shylock's friend and Lancelot Gobbo turns in a fine, versatile performance.
Eventually the production settles in court, presenting anti- semitism in its
rawest form, with Shylock humiliated, his possessions forfeited, his
daughter converted. Perhaps Disraeli should have the last word, addressing
the Commons: 'Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right
honourable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island mine were in
the temple of Solomon.'
Chekhov described The Seagull as 'A comedy - three f, six m, four acts,
rural scenery; much talk of literature, little action, five bushels of
love.' Now The Manchester Contact Theatre Company has cast a gentle Celtic
twilight over the play with an adaptation by Thomas Kilroy which transplants
Chekhov to Ireland. He does not travel well.
The journey west can be made, as Brian Friel's fine Dublin adaptation of
Turgenev's A Month in The Country proves. The Moscow-Dublin connection looks
plausible, until one compares the claustrophobia of feudal Ireland with the
expansiveness of Czarist Russia: distance means yearning, the province a
kind of personal isolation. Kilroy's adaptation rewrites the names, throws
in a few jokes, and glimmers in the Celtic past.
But whatever the news on Abbey St, Chekhov was not a Dubliner, even if he
does however resemble Sean O'Casey. They knew how to make happenings on
stage both as complex and as simple as in life. Everything turns on a
gesture, a look, a promise: 'Perhaps we'll be back next year. Perhaps not.'
None of the characters in this Seagull feels natural. Each lacks the mess
and mystery which Chekhov distills from the vapour of everyday life. In the
troubling worlds of The Cherry Orchard and The Three Sisters, a piece of
social banter can also be the cry of torment: insight and knowledge loiter
somewhere offstage, but rarely arrive. This Seagull has nothing in the
wings, as it were.
The production also lacks soul; in the anxiety to make each scene a polished
delight, Brigid Larmour's direction disrupts the gentler pace of Chekhov's
understanding. The play runs as if she has been reading too many of De
Maupassant's volte-face tales and not enough of Chekhov's own clever
insinuations.
The patchy acting leaves the stronger performances (Maggie Shevlin as
Arkadina, Paul Brightwell as Trigorin, and Kate Lonergan as Nina) stranded.
The ordinariness of the doctor, the schoolteacher and the local farmers is
essential to the play. As Chekhov said, 'theatricality is unnecessary. They
are all simple, ordinary people.' Appearing to act too much mars the
atmosphere. The advice which made Clint Eastwood also holds here: 'don't
just do something, stand there.'
The Mercant of Venice is at the Contact Theatre (061 274 4747) and The
Seagull at the Library Theatre, Manchester (061 236 7110), both until
November 21

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: A timely dig at American politics - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT could be more apt, on the eve of this bizarre American Presidential
election, than Ira and George Gershwins' musical, Of Thee of I Sing? The
book, by George S. Kaufman and Morris Ryskind, mocks every kind of American
political belief. John P. Wintergreen, the chosen candidate, is pressed for
issues. 'In the first four years,' he is told, 'you don't do anything except
try to get re-elected,' but a chambermaid says what is most important to
her: money. And love. So Wintergreen has to fall in love; more, he has to
marry Diana Devereux, the winner of the Miss America pageant. Unluckily, he
falls in love with a non-contestant, Mary Turner, who wins him with her
corn-muffins.
Wintergreen is to be impeached for his disloyalty to Diana, but when Mary
has twins, impeachment is forgotten. Kaufman and Ryskind come out better
than the Gershwins; even the theme song 'Of thee I sing, baby' (from which
Kaufman tried unsuccessfully to scrub the 'baby') is hardly a chart-buster.
But amiable fun is made of American affairs, and the Chicago production by
the National Radio Theatre, directed by Yuri Rasovski, was fine. The first
President to be elected after the 1931-2 Broadway run was Franklyn
Roosevelt, so the mockery did no harm.
To mark European Drug Prevention Week in a fortnight's time, Radio 1 is to
collaborate with Radio 5 in a warning against solvents. Meanwhile, on Radio
4's uncharacteristic Drunk last Sunday, Professor Laurie Taylor took three
average drinkers, in their late 20s, from a Paisley bar to an 'Intoxication
Workshop' at Paisley College. They were given a series of double
vodkas-and-orange and their reactions tested after each - memorising
numbers, reading tongue-twisters and so on, their speech and other reactions
observed. Tall Hugh, after four vodkas, besides the pint-and-a-half of lager
he had at the pub, was still legally fit to drive, whereas short Vic and
female Jackie were over the limit after three, and happy to go on drinking
after four. All three united at the end in singing 'Paper rose'. We should
have been told the conclusions.
Back to Radio 3. In its current series of plays from the 1960s, last Sunday
it gave David Halliwell's Little Malcolm and His Struggle against the
Eunuchs, which won him the Evening Standard Award for most promising
playwright in 1966. Malcolm, sacked from his art college in Huddersfield,
plans revenge on the principal. He and some fellow-students will kidnap him,
steal a famous picture from the city's art gallery (Stanley Spencer's Garden
at Cookham Rise) and compel him to destroy it, so revealing his real
contempt for art.
But Malcolm also plans to launch a Nazi-type political party, the Dynamic
Erection Party, dedicated to the end of discipline, though to little else.
In the event, despite his brave talk, he lacks the guts to make his effort;
the only action is the wretched beating-up of his girl by his mates, and the
party dissolves itself. What we liked at the time was the satirical vigour
of the talk - though my diary said we needed rather less of it, and now says
so again.
As well as a terrific Malcolm from John Hurt, the original company included
Halliwell himself and Philip Martin, here the director, so Sunday's
authenticity is guaranteed. The later, more active, scenes came over better
than the early 'political' parts, but I liked it all, even if some
reminiscence was involved. David Streames was a decent Malcolm, but the
young chaps' voices all had much the same quality.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Brilliant Byzantium - There is more to Byzantine art
than icons and mosaics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOUVRE has done it again. A year after exhibiting the treasures from the
abbey of Saint-Denis, Byzance is another show which anyone who cares for the
middle ages simply must try to see. Lucky indeed will be those visitors who
can pick up almost where they left off, immersed in contemplating artifacts
which according to the taste of our medieval ancestors were the most
precious human hands could make.
Two things are going on in this exhibition. On the one hand, it is a
chronological survey of a thousand years of Byzantine art, illustrating the
high peaks of its achievement between the Later Roman Empire and the Fall of
Constantinople to the Turks in 1453. And of course, it is absolutely right
that the first object you encounter in this superbly lit, impeccably
designed show, is a little agate cameo bust of Constantine.
Here is a virtually mass-produced image of the youthful commander who was
the first Christian Emperor and founder of the Eternal City on the shores of
the Bosphorus. In style, this little treasure returns to the classical
manner after the thick-set brutalism of third-century fashion which, from
Gibbon to Berenson, gave such a bad name to Later Roman art.
Constant turning back to classical inspiration is a dominant theme of the
exhibition, as time and again Byzantine craftsmen provided courtly patrons
with an art refreshed by copying and adapting pagan beauties. Carving
hardstone, a skill which was apparently lost under the century of
Iconoclasm, was revived under the reign of the great Macedonian emperors.
The central rooms are filled with manuscripts, carved ivory caskets and
plaques, jewellery and silks made from this great period of Byzantine art
which stretched from the later 9th to the 12th centuries. Their exquisite
craftsmanship and also the mixture of sacred and secular themes will surely
for many visitors be a revelation - there is, after all, so much more to
Byzantine art than mosaics and icons.
However, there is something even more absorbing about this exhibition. As
with the Saint-Denis show, the question that proposes itself over and over
again is, by what means did each of these treasures find their way west?
Each of the 400 exhibits has been borrowed from 'French public collections'
 -the Louvre itself, of course, being the major source. But in the majority
of cases, the museums are themselves heirs to the cathedrals and abbeys of
the pre-Revolutionary era. Some exhibits, such as the extraordinary Holy
Shrine from Sens, the miraculous 15th-century icon of Our Lady from Cambrai,
and the silks used to wrap holy relics, still belong to churches.
From Rheims cathedral comes something which, to my mind, is one of the most
affecting survivals of the entire middle ages; a cushion of Byzantine silk
embroidered, as the gold threads spell out, by Alpaidis, a 9th-century
princess, to pillow the 'sweet and blessed head' of St Remi. The saint's
winding-cloth, a length of wine-red samite the size of a sheet, still has
the opulent shimmer of the silks which Byzantine court official wore. What
more fitting to wrap the bones of the saint who baptised Clovis, the 'new
Constantine' of barbarian Gaul?
Look at the bust of Constantine again, and at once it is clear that a
medieval goldsmith has been up to the usual game of bending and bodging
prestigious remnants of Rome. In the late 14th century, with gold and
enamels, the cameo was made into a staff for an ecclesiastical dignitary
serving at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. One outstretched hand holds a
crudely twisted circle of metal, representing the Crown of Thorns. And where
did that numinous object come from? From Constantinople, purchased at a
crippling price by St Louis, king of France, who actually built the
Sainte-Chapelle to provide the fit setting for his fabulous purchase.
We meet the acquisitive St Louis later in the exhibition, as purchaser of a
reliquary made of gold actually in Byzantium. In low relief the figures are
shown of the angel appearing to the Holy Marys at the empty tomb. 'With what
brilliance did the angel appear to the women]', proclaims the inscription.
For centuries, the brilliance of Byzantine court art gave western kings and
nobles a kind of indigestion, so desperately did they crave the luxury of
those effeminate Greeks. In 1204, the Fourth Crusade turned aside and simply
swallowed the object of desire.
In this way, a large part of the history of the medieval west could be
spelled out from the objects in this memorable show. Sadly, however, objects
are labelled with such parsimony (a very French habit) that without the
sumptuous and costly catalogue (FFfs 490), you may miss the historical
reverberations. So breathe deeply, and buy - the stories it contains are
incredibly evocative as the barbarian west bought, smuggled, begged, and
ultimately pillaged Constantinople for its treasures.
Daily (not Tuesdays) 10 -22.00; until February 1.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: How to juggle artistically with money - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARTS world should Expect nothing in the way of extra Government funding
in 1993-94: that will ensure that it is not disappointed. The rumours from
Whitehall are depressing, with the new Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke,
being asked initially to report on the consequences of actual cuts in his
budget.
The comparative smallness of his empire, with largesse this year totalling
Pounds 931m, plus yet to be determined running costs for the expanded
department, may work in his favour - any savings would not be worth the
hassle. But arts companies will be lucky to get away with frozen grants in
1993. They were promised a 3.5 per cent increase under three year funding,
(former Minister Richard Luce's innovation which was to take the uncertainty
out of the future), but that was only a planning figure, and since the arts
has received increases in the past two years way ahead of the three year
plan, it can hardly complain if the cards fall the wrong way this time.
Peter Brooke will have some freedom to distribute funds around his new
conglomerate. This year his main clients were the performing arts, financed
through the Arts Council, which got Pounds 236m; museums and galleries which
took Pounds 214m; the heritage with Pounds 199m; and libraries with Pounds
141m. Brooke could switch heritage money, especially from unorganised areas
like the Royal Parks, to the performing arts. There could also be less
allocated to the new British Library, which seems to be out of favour with
the government.
But the easiest fudge could be over running costs. Nobody knows how much it
will cost to run the enlarged Heritage department which will move into a new
home next year. A few millions saved here could ensure that the major arts
organisations do not suffer real cuts in their grants.
This week the British Phonographic Industry held a celebratory dinner for
its director John Deacon which raised Pounds 300,000 for charity. It was the
kind of thing the record industry does well: the internecine battles between
record companies; between companies and artists; and artists and managers
hidden beneath well lubricated bonhomie.
And Deacon deserves a tribute for making the BPI one of the most effective
lobbyists in the UK, even if the Government still fails to acknowledge that
pop music has been the most lucrative British export market of the last 30
years, with one in five of every record sold in the world containing a bit
of Britain in its make up. Why no knighthood for Cliff?.
The record industry is amazing for the continuity which survives all the
changes. Retail outlets may shrink to less than 1,000; the hardware gets so
refined that the day fast approaches when anyone can summon into their home
the music they want at that moment; the software metamorphoses within five
years, yet the same few companies - EMI, Phonogram, Warner, and CBS-Sony -
stay supreme, with two thirds of sales.
This year the old vinyl LP will virtually disappear - only 10m were sold in
1991 and it is fading fast, while the CD has jumped 20m in two years to top
66m. The single is on a slower decline, but it now only requires sales of
6,000 to make the pop charts.
Deacon takes a pragmatic view of it all, and sees sales of pop music set to
rise, not because the songs are getting better but because the number of
teenagers is on the increase. In contrast the much trumpeted revival in
classics could already be faltering. Traditionally classical music held just
over 7 per cent of the market and the record companies largely ignored it.
Then came Pavarotti and Nigel Kennedy and sales rose to 12 per cent. This
year they are down to 11 per cent.
But as the number of teenagers is set to rise so are the ranks of
pensioners. It could be that the rock revival albums that currently dominate
the charts will fade as the middle aged swingers fall off their purchasing
perches.
It takes some imagination to see Jersey as a rival to Geneva as the main
European auction centre for top quality jewels. But Bonhams, the smallest
but cheekiest of the London salerooms, has managed the jump. It held a sale
there this week and found buyers prepared to pay up to Pounds 77,000 for an
emerald and diamond ring.
The attraction is that you pay no VAT in the Channel Islands. With London's
position as the world's leading art mart under threat from EC tax hounds,
anxious to impose VAT on art works imported there for sale, the Islands
could suddenly be the perfect off-shore haven. Not that Bonhams has yet
proved the point: half its jewels sale was unsold.
But it is trying again on November 16, this time with a house sale on
Guernsey. Antiques dealer Peter Heraty so loved his new home in St Peter
Port that he has beggared himself furnishing it. As a result he is forced to
sell the contents, and virtually squat. Being a dealer the mainly Georgian
furniture is of impeccable taste; being Irish it is also slightly oddball.
The Pounds 300,000 estimate seems modest.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Lost demons of Mexico - Gerald Cadogan bemoans a
missed opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO and Tibet, at the Hayward Gallery and the Royal Academy, are a
startling contrast. Both are superb displays, and both set out to reveal art
most of us know nothing of. But The Ancient Art of Mexico is a huge
disappointment.
I left angry and sad. The dramatically lit sculptures, with tongue-twister
names and a powerful sense of forces ruling human lives that humans cannot
control, are exciting works of art. And it was fun - if hardly news - to see
them influencing Henry Moore. It was also interesting to learn that early
this century in the Mexican Revolution people turned to these native demons
when they rejected Spain and Christianity, settling the score with the
conquistadors who had destroyed hundreds of pagan, temples and thousands of
statues in 1521. This is the background to Graham Greene's The Power and the
Glory.
But at the Hayward these demons are completely without context. It is a long
time since I have seen a show of works that really mattered for another
country made to look so trivial by western dilettante complacency. The
plaques and labels say almost nothing about the societies that made this
art, and what it meant to them - which leaves it meaning nothing to us.
Perhaps it is all in the catalogue, but that is expensive. It is in the
exhibition we want to learn about the harsh regimes behind the art. How does
the sculpture tie in with the ritual ball games played in 'ballcourts' when
the fate of sacrifice awaited the losers? What did people eat? How advanced
was their technology? What were ordinary houses like? And, most importantly
for this show, what are the places that have produced these pieces?
The result is inadequate. A dozen slides at the end, of stunning views
admittedly, seem an afterthought. There should be lots of them at the
beginning so that we see at once where we are and start to relate the art of
Mexico to the land and people.
The out of date, cavalier attitude behind this exhibition passed its Sell By
date years ago, as a quick visit to the Museum of Mankind could have shown.
Nowadays we cannot divorce art from country and society. If I were Mexican,
I should be sorry to think how little of Mexico this show puts over,
marvellous though the pieces are.
But if I were Tibetan, I should be delighted. Wisdom and Compassion - The
Sacred Art of Tibet starts straight off with the geography, and the people
and their Buddhism. A film fills the gaps in the picture. The labels are
packed with information, telling us what the hand gestures of Buddha mean,
and about the different beings in the holy world of this quietist religion.
All the Tibetan materials are identified. (I learnt that many of the statues
are of gilt brass.) In Mexico, unless it is semi-precious stone for small
objects, the labels just say 'stone' and not which stone. If they told us
that, we could learn how the tribes favoured different stones, and traded in
them, and the magical powers they had. In the most literal way that would
tell us how the early Mexicans coped with their environment and made holy
art from it.

THE LETTERS OF ARTHUR BALFOUR AND LADY ELCHO 1885-1917 edited by Jane Ridley
and Clayre Percy Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 370 pages
THE correspondence between Arthur Balfour and Mary Elcho has had a migratory
career. The confidential letters which they wrote to each other for more
than 50 years - or such of them as remain, for some were burnt, others have
pages torn away, or made illegible by heavy deletions - were sent from
Whittingehame, Balfour's home, to the British Museum, and then, at the
request of Mary Elcho's family, were returned to Stanway, the house where
most of them were written. There they were stored away. Because many of the
letters are private in character, and some marked 'Burn' or 'Destroy', I
doubted whether they would ever be published.
That they now appear is a bonus, for Mary Elcho's writings are a delight.
She was the most endearing of the female 'Souls', that group of high
spirited friends so starry in their youth, and sadly quenched by the tragedy
of the Great War. A natural writer if a little discursive, she has a
delicious spontaneity in describing the happiness of her daily life - her
beloved children, her Chows, ('How I love Fluffkins, Puffkins'), and merry
life at Stanway with her many guests. She always writes with affection and
sometimes emotion; her letters during the Great War are the most poignant I
have read.
Balfour's replies are coolly factual: they consist of timetables of his
activities, updated reports on his almost perpetual ailments, and lists of
dazzling 'social engagements.' 'Now you have my diary disguised as a
letter,' he once wrote. His cautious pages are filleted of all feeling - and
yet the relationship between himself and Mary is always present, tense like
a coiled spring.
Mary Elcho had always wanted to marry Arthur Balfour since they first met,
when she was 17 and he was 31. Mary was beautiful, intelligent, and her
vivacity attracted many suitors. When she was 21 she married Hugo Elcho, a
clever, droll character, keen on gambling on shares and horses. Like many
men of his class and time, he sought glamorous mistresses and had a long
liaison with the Duchess of Leinster, considered the greatest beauty of her
age. However, he and Mary both appreciated each other and loved their seven
children.
Eight years before he met Mary, Balfour had fallen in love with May
Lyttelton, a pretty, high-spirited girl who may not have been aware of his
feelings and had been engaged to another man. At her sudden death in 1875,
Balfour placed his mother's emerald ring in her grave and with it, so he
told his friends, his heart. Soon afterwards he communicated with her
through mediums, and was to receive affectionate spirit messages from her
until he died.
When Charlotte Gere and I were writing on the Souls 10 years ago, we had the
immense good fortune to be welcomed by Lady Elcho's two surviving daughters,
Lady Plymouth and Lady Mary Lyon. They absolutely adored their mother, who
had, in Souls parlance, given them a golden childhood. They had both known
Balfour well. It was they who, in great distress, withdrew the letters from
the British Museum after a biographer of Balfour had quoted from them to
establish that Balfour and Mary were lovers. (My one reservation about this
otherwise well edited book is the publication of letters not meant to be
preserved; that they survive at all is probably due to Balfour's inertia.)
The affectionate artlessness of Mary's letters was, they saw, vulnerable to
misinterpretation, and her frequent use of nursery language, such as 'I'll
box your ears,' or 'You deserve a good spanking' should be taken lightly and
not interpreted as any kind of chastisement. They were adamant that Mary and
Balfour had never been lovers in the accepted sense; that their relationship
was platonic, and that Balfour had always told Mary that the true romance of
his life was May Lyttelton.
After reading all the letters, I am convinced that their opinion is right.
What does emerge is a mutual affection that hovers between romance and
friendship, and as sustained by Mary's romantic yearnings and memories;
'Twenty years ago we walked arm in arm together, and you came to dinner, and
saw me in a low gown, and told me I had a jolly throat.'
Mary was deeply in love with Balfour, and Laura Tennant spoke of her
'weaponless worship.' In 1887 it seemed that Balfour might reciprocate her
feelings. He was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland and just before he
left for Dublin, he and Mary met at his house in Carlton Gardens where
occurred 'a small very private and personal incident . . . first kiss (gear
changing),' recalled Mary two decades later.
Such an episode was tentative; later there were kisses and caresses and
nothing more; whether this was due to Balfour's moral scruples, or the fear
of commitment, or even the hazard of a child we will never know. Or was he,
in the end, being faithful to the memory of May Lyttelton? Lady Randolph
Churchill said of Balfour that he 'liked to stir up emotional warmth, to
love, and to be loved, but that he was unmasculine  - not homosexual - just
a man who liked a lot of smoke and rather little fire.' She understood him
well, and, as an American, she was a good observer of the vagaries of love
in a very cold climate.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Books: Devious tricks with the thriller genre - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEVIATHAN by Paul Auster Faber Pounds 14.99, 245 pages
PAUL AUSTER'S new novel - his seventh in eight years - epitomises the genre
of the highly literate and literary thriller which he has virtually
invented. The short novels of The New York Trilogy, published in this
country in 1987, and with which he made his name, play devious tricks with
the conventions of detective fiction, exploring a shadowy ground on which a
novel's narrator becomes indistinguishable from a private eye, and
characters' names assume surreal significance.
References to the classics of American literature - Melville, Thoreau,
Whitman and, most notably in this case, Hawthorne - are repeatedly worked
into the texture; and it has frequently been suggested that Auster's work
convincingly assimilates the existential scenarios of Kafka and Beckett to
traditional American realism.
Auster's subsequently published books - with the exception of his curiously
inert, sub-Beckettian poems  - use the trilogy's distinctive
straight-talking, confiding and inviting authorial voice, and similarly
exploit techniques of suspense to unusual and decidedly literate ends.
Arguably his most appealing book, the apparently non-fictional memoirs of
The Invention of Solitude (published here in 1988) is quite as suspenseful
as the novels, and reveals the detective quest as a primary psychological
source for this author - who only unearthed the fact that his grandmother
murdered his grandfather as the result of a very unlikely coincidence and a
great deal of sleuthing.
For Auster the workings of chance - those weird Jungian synchronicities we
all know so well and on which he built his 'Book of Memory', the second part
of The Invention of Solitude - have much more exalted status than that of
cogs and wheels for the mechanism of a mystery novel, but they do serve very
nicely as that. The complex plot of Leviathan is neatly articulated by a
series of amazing coincidences which, separately from their relevance to the
novel, Auster invites us to consider as a metaphor for the labyrinthine
unknowability of all our lives; and, in his submission, the more thickly the
coincidences are laid on, the more essentially true to life the book
becomes. The novelist-narrator Peter Aaron (he shares initials, profession,
and much else with the author) observes at the point of tightest-screwed
coincidence: 'No matter how wild we think our inventions might be, they can
never match the unpredictabilty of what the real world continually spews
forth.'
But after finishing the novel, formidably entertaining though it is, one may
not escape the thought that there is no need for a writer to take part in
such a competition. For all the interest of its themes - the Hobbesian title
and Emersonian epigraph point to the book's preoccupation with anatomising
the American body politic; the fascination of characters like the tall,
bony, sexual Maria, conceptual life-artist and Austerian 'goddess of the
unpredictable'; and the central figure, Benjamin Sachs, who blows himself up
in the novel's first sentence and for whose strange career as
novelist-turned-pseudo-terrorist the narrative is a tense apology -
Leviathan does not offer the deeper satisfactions of literature. Those of
the more solidly factual Invention of Solitude are deeper, and that book
invites re-reading and pondering in a way that is as impossible for this one
as it is for thrillers in general, once the final twist is known. Auster is
sunk in the end by the vessel he has commandeered.

JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES VOL 2: THE ECONOMIST AS SAVIOURS 1920-1937 by Robert
Skidelsky Macmillan Pounds 20, 751 pages
THE SECOND volume of Robert Skidelsky's huge biography of John Maynard
Keynes covers the inter-war years. In the first volume, published in 1983,
Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920, and now published in paperback at Pounds 12.99,
Skidelsky described Keynes's childhood at Eton and Cambridge, his membership
of the Bloomsbury group, and his sudden rise to power and fame during and
after the First World War.
In this volume Keynes is now influential, independent and rich. He has
largely forsworn his earlier homosexuality, and, to the astonishment of his
friends, he marries a Russian dancer. He slips effortlessly between the
worlds of politics, finance and academia, always ready with an opinion and a
remedy. He publishes books of astonishing originality and power, and owns a
weekly newspaper. Keynes is already a legend, brilliant everyone concedes,
one of the cleverest men in England, the greatest economist of the age,
perhaps of any age, but is he sound?
Still to come in a future volume are his return to the Treasury; financing
the war and the reconstruction; and Bretton Woods.
Keynes hoarded his papers, sticking them on spikes before storing them in
clothes chests. But although Keynes was a great man, not everything he did
or said needs to be recorded. Skidelsky successfully sets Keynes in the
political and intellectual context of his times, breaking the chronological
narrative with occasional thoughtful summaries. His portrait of Keynes is
entirely convincing, although a little too protective of the less attractive
characteristics. But although he has divided his argument into sub-chapters
and appendices, few readers will want all the information offered - the
minor journalism, the forgotten colleagues, the hotels he stayed at, the
names of his butler's children.
Skidelsky rightly concentrates on Keynes the economic thinker. He takes us
comprehensively through the arguments and counter-arguments of the time, and
discusses the modern commentaries, not neglecting his opportunities to
contradict a few colleagues along the way. However he tends to confuse the
role of the historical biographer (to analyse and understand what was said,
believed, and done in the past), with that of the contemporary economist (to
explain the problems of Britain now). Despite the occasional disclaimer he
does not give sufficient weight to the differences between Keynes's time
from our own.
When industrial investment was financed by fixed-interest bonds, and
wage-earners and pensioners had no arrangements for uprating their incomes,
inflation was more redistributive and more socially disruptive than now -
but it was also good for profits. The policy choices of today are at best
only partially elucidated by the debates and equations of 1934 even if they
were true then. Keynes himself abandoned the idea that economics is a body
of knowledge, as distinct from a method of analysis.
The questions which the country faced in the 1920s and 1930s are still
dismally topical. The ERM fiasco was a re-run of the 1925 return to the gold
standard, a more precise case study than history usually provides. Keynes
later estimated that the country paid 10 per cent in lost output when the
Government deflated a depressed economy with high interest rates in its
(fortunately unsuccessful) effort to maintain an inappropriate external
parity.
In the 1990s the finance markets are again said to be demanding cuts in
public expenditure on the grounds that the country does not have the money.
'We do nothing because we do not have the money', Keynes told the Macmillan
Committee in 1930, 'but it is precisely because we do not do anything that
we do not have the money'.
As for cutting real public investment in order to keep down the rate of
interest on Government borrowing, that was 'one of the most desperate
muddles the human mind has ever entertained. The whole object of having a
low rate of interest is in order to do something. But if you think it is
wise to stop doing things in order to lower the rate of interest, you are
standing upside down.'
Skidelsky, recommended for a life peerage by the Social Democratic Party,
admires Keynes's attempt to promote a Middle Way, a taming of capitalism
without socialism. He also writes confidently of the 'Keynesian Revolution',
as if it were a movement which had irreversibly transformed understanding,
and he evidently intends no irony in describing Keynes as 'the saviour.'
In the long run, Keynes wrote, ideas are more powerful than vested
interests. 'Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from
any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct
economist.' He had in mind his Victorian predecessors who naively believed,
against the evidence, that economies tend towards full employment and
equilibrium if left to market forces. We will see in next week's Autumn
Statement whether the defunct Keynes can help us from beyond the grave.

AFRICAN LAUGHTER: FOUR VISITS TOZIMBABWE by Doris Lessing HarperCollins
Pounds 16.99, 442 pages
IN African Laughter Doris Lessing goes home - to Zimbabwe, as Rhodesia
became in 1980. She had not been allowed back for a quarter of a century
because she was a 'PI' - a Prohibited Immigrant to her own country] - but
with 'Independence' this nonsense fell aside and in this book she describes
the four visits she has made since then. To anyone with the faintest
interest in, or knowledge of, Southern Africa, it is an engrossing and
fascinating record.
It is a long book of artful simplicity. On each trip she arrives, travels,
describes, analyses and, sometimes, judges. She loves her country, of
course, and the most moving sequences are those in which she returns, first
in reminiscence and conversation, and at last apprehensively in person, to
the childhood farm of The Grass is Singing. 'We lived in Eden and didn't
know it', she and her brother agree.
Today there is no shortage of serpents in Zimbabwe, and one recurrent theme
is her need to balance her instinctive (almost patriotic) optimism for
Zimbabwe with her honest admission that so much is going wrong; in
particular, she does not fudge the issue of corruption among the new ruling
class.
We start in 1982 with a country still recovering from a savage inter-racial
war: the people are 'sick'. By 1988 - the longest section  - the war is a
fading memory as she roams the country, meeting everyone. In this visit we
glimpse a country coming to terms with corruption, the falling-short of the
original utopian expectations.
By 1992, briefly, we are beyond corruption, and stupid economic policies,
and land hunger, and unemployment, and even AIDS (which may kill one million
out of nine million before the 2000) - 'Southern Africa is drying up, that's
the news. That is the only news.' Are the rains going to come in November?
And will Mrs Lessing, after this wise and candid book, be a PI for the
second time?

A WORLD OF MY OWN: A DREAM DIARY by Graham Greene Reinhardt Books Pounds
12.99, 116 pages
'I CAN only express a hope that readers of this book will put themselves in
my difficult situation and treat me with indulgence, and, further, that
anyone who finds any sort of reference to himself in my dreams may be
willing to grant me the right of freedom of thought - in my dream-life, if
nowhere else'.
That was Freud speaking - in the preface to the first edition of The
Interpretation of Dreams (1900) - and his sentiments are echoed by Graham
Greene in this selection from Greene's dream journals. The choice of
extracts was carefully made and ordered by Greene in the last few months of
his life. Like Freud, and ever mindful of frontiers, Greene explains in his
introduction that he felt a blessed sense of release in crossing from what
he called the Common World to that private self-centred world - A World of
My Own as this little volume is titled - the world of the sleeping dreamer.
Readers of Norman Sherry's first volume of The Life of Graham Greene will
remember the chapter 'Psychoanalyzed' where it was revealed that after his
nervous breakdown, provoked by his sufferings as a public schoolboy, Greene
underwent a course of analysis from Kenneth Richmond. Although basically a
Jungian, Richmond believed in making his patients recall their dreams. If a
patient had no dream to recount during a session he or she was asked to
invent one. What better training could there have been for a future
novelist?
The result was that Greene began to keep dream diaries. None of these early
diaries has survived but accounts of some of his dreams have. We read in
Sherry of a Princess of Time with a troop of black-skinned girls who haunted
Greene's sleep; and of nightmares involving sinister Chinese agents from
whom Greene took refuge in a hut with an armed detective. The schoolboy
crisis passed, but left its mark as Greene matured into a novelist with a
highly developed sense of narrative. The nightmares were re-cycled as plots,
especially the one about a man on the run, the obsession with pursuit.
Through constant creative distillation into fiction, they were ultimately
exorcised.
But the habit of recording his dreams remained and itself became a kind of
obsession. Greene suffered, unnecessarily, from the recurring fear of many
novelists that he would one day run out of material, and he clearly felt
that no potential source should be neglected. His companion Yvonne Cloetta,
to whom he bequeathed the task of seeing the book through the press, writes
in a foreword: '. . . he always had a pencil and paper at hand on his
bedside table so that when he awoke from a dream, which happened four or
five times a night, he could jot down key words that in the morning would
allow him to reconstruct it'.
Although there are still elements of terror, it is often as a bland, urbane,
traveller to foreign parts, a remorseless globe-trotter that Greene emerges
here. Greene the adult dreamer seems not so much a defenceless quarry being
pursued by evil forces, but himself a pursuer - a latter-day Stephen Crane -
hot on their trail.
The dreamer frequently hob-nobs with politicians and world-leaders - Edward
Heath, Mitterand, Castro, Yuri Andropov, Ho Chi Minh, even Oliver Cromwell -
and he speaks his mind to them freely. He bandies words, for instance, with
Khrushchev at a banquet in one of those dream exchanges that seem wittier at
the time than in the cold light of day.
As one might expect, religion is a frequent presence. Greene goes for a
stroll around the Vatican garden in 1984 with John Paul II who was 'in turn
very amiable and then very impatient'. That might, surely, be from real
life. More in the realm of fantasy but highly revealing, was the dream in
1973 when Greene read in a newspaper that he had been appointed Archbishop
of Westminster. 'I knew that I was quite unsuitable, but all the same I was
rather attracted by the idea of taking part in some royal occasion a few
days later, with the Archbishop of Canterbury'.
The dreamer regularly up-stages everyone he meets, however eminent. It seems
only natural that the contemporary theatre with which Greene had a love-hate
relation should be another frequent source of dream-encounters. He was
fascinated by a convivial figure like Ralph Richardson, wondering went on
behind the facade of bonhomie. Charlie Chaplin, Peter Ustinov, Paul
Scofield, Michael Meyer, and Peter Glenville, who directed Greene's plays,
are all here. Farce frequently obtrudes, as in a dream about the performance
of a play called The Game of Croquet in which Scofield slices a ball into
the stalls, blooding a member of the audience in one eye.
The work, containing quite a few laughs of that kind, is by no means the
most significant book in the Greene canon; even so it contains a side of him
not to be found elsewhere.

FREUD'S WOMEN by Lisa Appignanesi and John Forrester Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson
Pounds 25, 563 pages
WOMEN were crucial to Freud's life and work. His earliest women patients
effectively invented psychoanalysis, and the psychoanalytic profession owed
its rise, spread, and in time some of its most decisive transformations, to
women who began as Freud's patients and later became analysts in their own
right.
The story is absorbingly told by John Forrester and Lisa Appignanesi, who
marry an illuminating and highly readable 'psychobiography' of Freud with an
account of the development of his theories. The women who figure large in
Freud's life each get their own skilfully wrought biographical sketches. The
closing chapters contain a discussion of Freud's views on women and women's
views on Freud, particularly the recent all-out attack on psychoanalysis
mounted by feminism.
The book's careful tapestry of biographical and expository concerns are
nimbly woven. It is one of those rare productions: a book hard to put down.
But undoubtedly some of it - principally, the authors' analysis of Freud
himself - will provoke controversy, especially within and among the
quarrelsome tribes of Freudians, Kleinians and other descendants of the
master. Even an amateur reader, of the sort occasionally apt to gasp at
Freudian absurdities, can detect the authors' provocative stance.
For example: Freud recalled, during self-analysis, a childhood incident in
which he snatched flowers from a girl. 'To take flowers from a girl,' he
mused, 'means to deflower her'. For Forrester and Appignanesi defloration
becomes a key metaphor for analysis itself; analysis is penetration to
depths beyond a veil of innocence. Whether one agrees with their placing of
emphases here and in other cases important for understanding Freud, the tale
they tell is riveting.
Two of the most significant women in Freud's life, his mother and his wife,
are dim presences in the book. This is not the authors' choice. Freud hid
his mother behind a screen of sincere but nevertheless conventional filial
respect. His wife is hidden too, but this time behind an absurd embargo on
the Freud papers which seals them from view for another century. But their
shadowiness is more than compensated by the striking presence in the book of
other extraordinary women, who in different ways transformed psychoanalysis
from an oddity on the medical fringe to an explosive force in 20th century
consciousness.
Freud always claimed that psychoanalysis was invented by his colleague Josef
Breuer while treating a wealthy and beautiful young hysteric. This was
Bertha Pappenheim, who effectively created her own therapy in the form of
the 'talking cure'. Freud's experience with the woman he called his
'teacher', Anna von Lieben, confirmed this therapeutic possibility. Anna was
his patient for six years, and taught him that it takes a talented patient
to make a talented analyst.
These early patients helped establish the technique of analysis. The theory
emerged more slowly. Its painful growth is reflected in the different paths
from Freud's couch taken by women as variously brilliant as Helene Deutsch
and Lou Andreas-Salome when they became analysts in their own right. A
salient example is Princess Marie Bonaparte, who established Freudianism in
France. Great-grand-niece of Napoleon and hugely rich, Marie came to be
called 'Freud-a-dit' ('Freud said . . ') by French analysts, and engaged in
famous battles with Jacques Lacan over Freud's legacy.
Freud sometimes likened himself to King Lear. In a major respect the
comparison is apt, for his youngest daughter Anna proved crucial both to him
and his cause. Although her differences with Melanie Klein over child
analysis caused a major split in the analytic movement, Anna's tireless
loyalty was central to the defence of Freudian orthodoxy against powerful
voices of later dissent and criticism.
In recent decades Freud has been the target of swingeing attacks by
feminists scornful of his claims that girls suffer 'penis-envy' and that
vaginal orgasm supersedes clitoral orgasm in the mature woman.
Nevertheless, Freud's thought was a major factor in the openness which gave
feminism renewed impetus in the 20th century. For this, and for the many
ways in which his thought has illuminated the inner human landscape, Freud's
achievement is astonishing. By locating it in the pivotal setting of his
relations with women Forrester and Appignanesi have added hugely to our
understanding of the man and his achievement.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: It's Paris chic to wear your seams inside out this
season - Alice Rawsthorn is excited by a young designer who hangs out in a
derelict hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the chicest places to shop in Paris is the disused radiology
department of Hopital Ephemere, a derelict hospital on the edge of
Montmartre cemetery and now an artists' squat under threat of closure from
the French authorities. Here Xuly-Bet designs and sells his clothes.
Xuly-Bet, 30, is one of the recyclage designers now making waves on the
Paris fashion scene. These designers, led by Martin Margiela, the young
Belgian, use recycled fabrics and cheap materials to make avant garde
clothes, often with unfinished edges and seams on the outside rather than
the inside, that are popular with the young Paris fashion crowd.
Xuly-Bet is typical of the recycleurs. He was born in Mali but studied
architecture in Paris and switched to fashion four years ago. His clothes
are made of tights and underwear fabrics. He makes them himself on an old
Singer sewing machine and sells them at weekends when he opens the radiology
department as a shop.
Things might have been different a few years ago when a talented young
designer could have expected to be courted by everyone from LVMH, the French
luxury goods groups, to GFT, the Italian textile giant. But that was back in
the 1980s when the fashion market was buoyant and designers were feted as
superstars. All that has changed. Now today's designers are struggling to
find new directions in the moribund market of the 1990s.
The fashion market expanded in the 1980s, when the middle-aged customers of
the establishment designers had more to spend. These designers also gained a
fertile market in Japan, thanks to the appetite of the nouveau riche for
western luxuries. The dominant stylistic theme for the established fashion
houses was reinterpreting traditional designs, as Karl Lagerfeld did at
Chanel with his 1980s versions of Coco Chanel's 1920s suits. This fused
perfectly with the post-modernist ideas then influential in art and
architecture and satisfied the Japanese craving for western 'authenticity'.
At the same time the designers gained a new, young market as the progeny of
the pre-Pill baby boom moved into their 20s. These young consumers had been
influenced by the 'glam' image of rock groups such as Roxy Music that
dominated pop culture during their adolescence. 'Glam' was a rebellion
against the scruffy hippy styles of the early 1970s. It fostered a
generation of young consumers who wanted to dress smartly and a cadre of
young, innovative designers emerged - Jean-Paul Gaultier in Paris and Dolce
&amp; Gabanna in Milan - to service them.
But those days are over. Recession has struck and designers are in the
doldrums. Some companies have collapsed. The rest have been left to
struggle. Recession is not the only issue. The designers must also grapple
with changes in their market, for fashion has fallen victim to demographics.
There are fewer 20-year-olds around because of the falling birth rate. The
recession has left them with less money and the shift in pop culture to the
'rave' cult - a backlash against 1980s materialism that has heralded a
return to the casual dress styles of the early 1970s - means they are less
inclined to spend it on expensive clothes.
Even the older customers have changed. The Gulf war, environmental crises
and the chaos in eastern Europe have fostered a new sensibility. As this
month's US Vogue magazine concedes: 'In these politically correct times,
Dollars 10,000 seems a ludicrous price to pay' for a suit.
The designers have found it difficult to adapt. For the past few seasons the
fashion collections have had the feel of designers plumbing new depths of
sensationalism in an attempt to disguise the emptiness of their ideas and to
attract the paparazzi. The assortment of super-models, pensioners and drag
queens that totter along the catwalks are all part of the spectacle.
Karl Lagerfeld is still a superb stylist - refining the hippy de luxe look
into sellable suits for Chanel and Chloe. But he seems to take a perverse
delight in exposing his own role as a publicist for the global luxury goods
groups. A big bottle of Chanel No5 towered over the last Chanel show.
Lagerfeld was later asked by French television whether he saw himself as a
designer or a stylist - a question which might have reduced his peers to
tears. Lagerfield just laughed.
Christian Lacroix, unlike Lagerfeld, is still idealistic enough to believe
that fashion can move forward from the disposable materialism of the 1980s,
by using traditional aesthetics and craftsmanship to create beautiful,
enduring clothes. The same theme is apparent in the cottage couture of Koji
Tatsuno and Romeo Gigli, both of whom produce limited editions of hand-made
pieces alongside their main collections. Tatsuno's exquisite silk jackets
and Gigli's embroidered velvets cost thousands of pounds, but last for
years.
Lacroix, Tatsuno and Gigli are trying to redefine the de luxe look that was
so lucrative for designers in the 1980s into something better suited to
their 'politically correct' consumers in the 1990s. The recycleurs, who
dominate what remains of the young market, favour the direct approach of
rebelling against 1980s excess.
It remains to be seen whether Martin Margiela and the other recycleurs will
be more than a transient phenomenon. Recyclage is riddled with
contradictions. Everything about Margiela's clothes, from the seams on the
outside to his blank white labels, is a statement against materialism. But
his labels are as coveted among the Paris avant garde as are Chanel's
trademark Cs by the nouveau riche. His clothes are expensive, Pounds 350 for
a jacket or Pounds 500 for a coat, and they sell in the same shops - Jones
in London, Charivari in New York - as those of the established designers he
is rebelling against.
The biggest threat to the recycleurs is the fashion establishment. The
luxury goods groups that gobbled up the established fashion houses in the
1980s have raised the financial stakes in the industry, as Jean Colonna,
another recycleur, discovered when his business went bust this spring. It
will be much more difficult for Margiela to achieve the same status in the
1990s as Gaultier in the 1980s - or even for Xuly-Bet to check out of
Hopital Ephemere.

SERIOUS walkers, skiers, sailors, alpinists and other wanderers in chilly
parts probably already know about Helly-Hansen, a Norwegian company which
has supplied undergarments to expeditions to the North Pole, to climbers of
the Eiger and to round-the-world sailors, writes Lucia van der Post.
This year sees the arrival in Britain of its range of pukka skiwear, called
Equipe. Those who would be truly warm can aim for three separate layers.
Start with the inner thermal layer, LIFA, which consists of thermal tops and
bottoms in varying styles.
Then you should add the fleecy layer, called Propile.
Finally, we come to the outer waterproof layer of Helly-Tech, one of the new
breed of breathable fabrics.
The outer garments incorporate all the functional details the serious skier
requires. There are high collars, double covered zips, ribbed inner collars,
snow stops, hoods with adjustable peaks, zipped pockets, breathable linings,
drawstring waists to keep snow out and ventilation zips. Salopettes are
Pounds 121.99, jackets, Pounds 185.99 and Pounds 197. A good range is
stocked by Ellis Brigham, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2, Canyon Mountain
Sports, 92 Granby Street, Leicester and One Step Ahead, 177 Morningside

FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: How to keep water out and heat in - Daniel Green
has two questions for ski clothes manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
IT IS HARD to be chic when you are cold and wet. But while some
fashion-conscious skiers dress to impress the dog-walkers of Gstaad, a
snowstorm would leave them no better off than the poodles: miserable and
bedraggled.
Stay dry and warm by asking two questions about any garment that you fancy:
Is it waterproof? Of course, the fabric should be waterproof, but that is
not much help if the seams leak. Seams must be sealed with tape. They may be
glued shut, but then cleaning with detergent could turn this season's
waterproof into next season's sieve.
Is it breathable? Sweat needs to be able to evaporate through the material.
The alternative is to leave a trail of salt water on the floor of your
favourite mountain restaurant as the sweat emerges the only way it can:
through the bottoms of your ski pants.
The result of these inquiries will probably lead you to an item with a
Gore-Tex label. Gore-Tex is a lining with microscopic holes that are big
enough to let water vapour from evaporated sweat out but too small to let
liquid water from rain or melted snow in.
Gore-Tex is not the only waterproof breathable fabric, but it is one of the
most highly-rated and the most heavily marketed.
It is also the most expensive. Alan Waugh, a director of Phoenix which makes
some of the highest specification ski-wear in the UK, said: 'The materials
in a Gore-Tex garment account for 50 per cent of the cost of manufacture. On
a normal item, the figure is only 30 per cent.'
A Phoenix Gore-Tex jacket retails at Pounds 265 and similar makes such as
Degre 7 and Mover cost about the same. Alternative fabrics include Sympatex,
more common on the Continent, Entrant, on Canada's Couloir label, MPC from
Tenson and DPS from Head.
Since 1990, Gore-Tex garments have been given a three-year dryness
guarantee. Each design is tested in a rain chamber to one of seven
standards: ordinary skiers need the GPS1 standard while ski-tourers need the
higher specification GPS2. The other standards cover such sports as hunting
and motorcycling.
Gore-Tex is, however, not the answer to every problem. If you only ski when
it is sunny, it is overkill.
'The breathability is never as good once you add extra layers, even
Gore-Tex,' says Toyin Latunji, ski-wear buyer at Harrods. 'And it doesn't
matter if the seams leak if it's not raining.'
Paradoxically, she says, it is beginners who need waterproofing most, as
they fall over on lower, wetter slopes.
Good intermediates and experts might want to sacrifice some waterproofing
for improved breathability. The experts' choice is microfibres, found in
ICI's Tactel Micro. When microfibres are used for both weft and warp,
clothing can withstand several minutes of rain. Although not as waterproof
as Gore-Tex or its rivals, prices are slightly lower: Head's 2169 jacket,
for example, retails at around Pounds 220.
Water can still get in up sleeves and down necks. Make sure that the fit is
snug and watch out for cost-cutting at the cuff.
A simple elasticated cuff, such as on the GSL ladies patterned ski top
(Pounds 99) or the polar bear and snowflake patterned lilac one-piece
ski-suit from Luhta (Pounds 169.50) could end up a slush trap after a day's
skiing.
A better design is for the sleeve to extend beyond the wrist before turning
inwards and backwards to meet the elasticated cuff. Any cuff should have a
velcro strap or buckle for tightening over or under a glove.
For warmth, the choice is between having separate thin layers or buying one
item with several layers sewn in.
Manufacturers favour the multi-layered approach, perhaps because they sell
more garments that way. But modern insulating materials are very effective.
The main advantage of layering is that if the weather is warm and dry, you
can peel off gradually. US-brand Patagonia specialises in selling eight
separate inner layers to draw sweat away from the skin, 12 middle insulation
layers and 12 outer water and wind-proofing layers.
Whatever you choose, that inner layer should be of an artificial fibre.
Natural materials absorb and hold on to moisture. Your arrival home at the
end of the day in the mountains might be too clammy even for your poodle to
appreciate.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: Posing for the piste - It doesn't matter whether
you are a ski bunny or a ski bum these days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAY BACK when, before there were triple chair lifts and rear-entry plastic
boots, before automatic bindings and microfibre fabrics, dressing for the
slopes was simple. What made it so was that there was hardly any choice -
black (or possibly navy blue) ski pants and an assortment of anoraks that
today would have them falling about with laughter in Blackburn was about all
there was.
Alas, for the simplicities of yesterday. Today you can choose your image -
ski bunny, piste-basher, moody rebel, off-piste loner, kamikaze, ski-bum,
Total Design Concept, Yuppie - and know there will be an outfit to match.
What you wear is a reflection of who you are. The pistes and lift-queues are
the fashion runways of the snows: what makes choosing difficult is that you
do not get to see the shows until you have bought the clothes. Ski fashions,
more than any other, are made by being seen, not on the fashion pages of
glossy magazines.
Most regular skiers will already have a reasonably functional set of
clothing, and those who have been cautious will probably need to do little
to update it.
The big news (good for those like me who still have a pair lurking in the
back of their wardrobe) is that one of the most prevalent looks takes its
cue from street-fashion and focuses on the lean ski-pant - the snow version,
if you like, of the legging.
There is no need to spend a great deal of money on these - at C &amp; A, for
example, they are selling for Pounds 49.99 - just make sure they are
properly wind and waterproof. The silhouette is all: lean and long - tough,
I know, if like me you are female and standard British height of 5 ft 2 in -
and topped by a blouson.
Given that most fashionable silhouettes will be skinny and black it is the
blouson that will really catch the eye.
Ralph Lauren, for instance, has some stunning military style jackets (see
one sketched here below) reminiscent of last year's sell-out mainline
collection. In black or white, trimmed with gold buttons, piping and
epaulettes, they combine chic with utility - an amazingly difficult double
to score. I vote them tops for this year's dernier cri award.
You may - or may not - be sorry to hear that Ralph Lauren's gold leather ski
jacket, which would otherwise have been my nomination, is sold out. Pounds
1,100 is not too much to pay, it seems, to create a stir on the ski slopes.
You could, though, if you hurried, part with Pounds 800 for a gold
sleeveless hooded ski jacket. Be sure, though, to wear it over something
warm and waterproof.
If you feel you are just a little too pear-shaped for itsy-bitsy blousons
topping skintight ski-pants, then you will be relieved to hear that parka
jackets are perfectly OK. They may lack the ultimate panache of a gold
bomber jacket but they are capacious and they cover the rear most
comfortingly.
If you still have some of those fluorescent skisuits that were so
fashionable an eye-blink ago, take my advice and confine them to the back of
the cupboard. Muted colours are part of the new recession chic and this is
as true on the ski slope as anywhere else. When it comes to colour there is,
however, one curious exception: pink, it seems, is a classic of the snow set
 -the little black dress, if you like, of the piste.
Otherwise, Jacquard or changeant effects will be much in evidence - and if
you are wondering what that that means, it is a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't
two-colour effect. Set foot inside any ski-shop and you will see it
everywhere - all the big manufacturers, from Luhta and Nevica to Degre 7 and
Killy, have used it in some of their lines.
If you are into heli-skiing, or are liable to find yourself on the top of
windswept backbowls in the Rockies, you will need to consider the matter of
function seriously. Degre 7 is a name to look out for. For about Pounds 595
(I am afraid if you want to be fashionable and comfortable you have to pay
for it) you get what amounts to two suits in one. The Gore-Tex suit comes
with a polar fleece lining which is detachable, a fantastic hood that really
buttons-down, is wind-proof and has detachable sleeves.
Bogner has a catsuit for those who are so sure of their technique (or
possibly their silhouette) that they do not mind making sure that all eyes
are upon them. Based on the skintight catsuit worn by the German team ski
(remember them on television's Ski Sunday?) it has black and white legs and
a black and red striped top (yours for Pounds 325). top In colder weather an
over-the-head jacket picks up the black and white theme (Pounds 395).
Alternatively there is Emmegi's champagne ski-suit, all washed elegance,
perfect for ski bunnies heading up the mountain for nothing more taxing than
a gluhwein and a yodel: Pounds 625, from Lillywhite's sports store in
London. Ski-bunny's companion could fittingly escort her in some of Signor
Giorgio Armani's latest numbers - for the first time the masterly Italian
has come up with what he calls 'ski-inspired' clothing (the inspired
indicating that they may look as if they are for skiing in but they are not
really, because they are not waterproof). There are salopettes (nice in
denim) at Pounds 250 a time, hooded jackets at Pounds 225, blousons at
Pounds 195 and hooded parkas at Pounds 295.
Finally, if there is one fabric that will be everywhere, it has to be polar
fleece. Started by Patagonia, the eco-chic provider of rugged clothing to
climbers, skiers and wilderness wanderers, it is now available at many
prices and in many forms in all good ski shops.
The Patagonia catalogue, incidentally, has a marvellously informative
section on the art of layer dressing and weatherproofing. It is available
from 24 Wilkinson Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S10 2GB. Tel:
0742-756-361.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Travel: St Helena - almost a lotus-isle - Mary Rose Beaumont
was much taken with the scene of Napoleon's exile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHERE exactly is it?' people would ask when I said I had been to St Helena.
'In the South Atlantic,' I would reply. 'Ah,' they said knowingly, 'near the
Falklands.'
WELL, NO, actually. It is about 4,000 miles from the Falkland Islands, bang
in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, nearly 1,000 miles south of the
equator, some 1,100 miles from Angola to the east and 1,800 miles from
Brazil to the west.
The nearest landfall is Ascension Island, 700 miles to the north, and St
Helena can only be reached by sea, two days' sail from Ascension and five
days from Cape Town. Its very remoteness and inaccessibility were the
principal reasons that it was chosen by the British government for
Napoleon's exile.
St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese admiral Juan de Nova Castella on
May 21 1502, the feast-day of Saint Helena, mother of the Emperor
Constantine. It continued in relative obscurity for another
century-and-a-half, though it became prosperous as a port of call for ships
trading with the East.
Situated in the south-east trade winds, it was a stopover for ships rounding
the Cape of Good Hope to revictual and take on fresh water. The British laid
claim to it in 1659 and the East India Company was granted a charter by
Charles II to administer it, until in 1834 it was brought under the direct
rule of the British crown. With the construction of the Suez Canal and the
invention of the steam ship, St Helena's importance declined, and the island
is now entirely dependent on the UK government.
The St Helena plies between Cardiff and Cape Town, calling at Tenerife and
Ascension Island before reaching St Helena some two weeks later. Once a year
she calls at Tristan da Cunha, the remotest and most sparsely populated of
all British territories. She is a jolly little ship to travel on, carrying
both passengers and cargo. She is the essential lifeline between St Helena
and Britain, carrying everything from food to cars to mail.
The ship also carries much longed-for fresh fruit on her return journey from
Cape Town. The passengers are divided between those who are having the trip
of a lifetime, often recently retired, those who are taking up posts on the
island, and St Helenians returning home. The St Helena is a very friendly
ship, the affable crew, partly British, partly St Helenian, making life on
board a riot of fun. There are deck games, films and bingo, as well as a
quiet lounge in which to read.
Approaching from Ascension Island, excitement mounts to fever pitch among
the home-bound St Helenians as the dot on the horizon is gradually revealed
as a cloud-capped volcanic rock rising sheer from the surrounding sea. How
Napoleon's heart must have sunk when he saw those formidable cliffs and
realised that this time there was to be no escape.
The port and capital of the island is Jamestown, named after King James II.
The actual landing process is hazardous: after clambering down the companion
way one is conveyed in a small motor boat from the ship to the slippery
wharf steps where one is obliged to hang on to a rope and jump when the
sailors say so. Failure to obey has been known to result in a ducking. Those
unable to negotiate this obstacle are put in a large container, lowered over
the side and landed like cargo.
Having negotiated the landing, and been through Customs, one walks through
an archway emblazoned with the coat of arms of the East India Company into
Jamestown proper. The capital (pop: 1,500) boasts just one street - Main
Street - with the castle, seat of government, police station, library,
courts of justice, Anglican church, museum, post office, two hotels and
shops and houses prettily painted in Portofino colours.
The Consulate hotel is an elegant, white-painted building with blue filigree
ironwork pillars and verandahs. It is here that le tout St Helena assembles
twice a day to drink and chat (except on Sundays, when everything closes
down). The hotel was originally built about 1780, but along with the other
buildings in Jamestown was ravaged by white ants which were inadvertently
and disastrously introduced on to the island in the broken-up timbers from a
captured Brazilian slave-ship. The hotel was rebuilt in 1863 in stone, iron
and teakwood, which is unpalatable to white ants. Mangoes and avocadoes grow
in the bougainvillaea-hung garden.
Out of Jamestown it is uphill all the way, whether on foot or by winding
narrow roads. Jacob's Ladder is a spectacular sheer ascent, 699 concrete
steps leading to the top of Ladder Hill, the shortest way to a coronary.
Winding up the single track road by car is more leisurely, although
expertise in reversing is required, since the rule of the road dictates that
the ascending car should give way to the descending.
Progress is therefore slow, but as few people are in a hurry it does not
matter. Drivers and passengers wave genially at each other. With a
population of only 6,000, it is not surprising that nearly every driver of
the perhaps 2,000 cars knows one another. (On my return to Britain, I
continued to wave to other drivers, but their reaction - incredulity to
outright hostility - caused me to desist).
Jamestown is the warmest and most humid part of the island. The temperature
can drop sharply as one ascends into 'the country.' There is a turn in the
road called Button-Up Corner where men on horseback supposedly buttoned up
their jackets against the cool breeze. The weather can change dramatically:
one moment bright sunshine, the next mist or driving rain.
St Helena, which is 10 miles long and six broad, has unsurpassed views: the
sea is almost always visible, glittering in the sun or storm-tossed. The
uplands alternate between bare volcanic rock and lush pastures. In the early
part of this century there was a massive planting scheme of New Zealand
flax, in an attempt to grow an exportable crop, but the invention of
synthetic fibres put paid to that; the huge spiky flax plants are gradually
being replaced by an afforestation scheme, principally of eucalyptus and
conifers, to help prevent soil erosion.
The plants and animals of St Helena are plentiful, though the wind militates
against all but the keenest domestic gardener. Mynah birds are everywhere,
chattering and gossiping, and little ring doves peck boldly at your feet.
Rarer are the brilliant red cardinals and yellow cape canaries. The
wirebird, an unlovely plover-like creature which scuttles rather than flies,
is an essential sighting for tourists, since it is found nowhere else but St
Helena.
The supreme place of pilgrimage is the house where Napoleon was
semi-incarcerated. The original document, dated May 1816, ordering his
detention as a prisoner of war, may be seen in the attorney-general's
archives. Napoleon lived at Longwood House in imperial state, with his
retinue, but his life was a misery, constantly spied upon and discourteously
treated by the governor. Finally he became seriously ill. He died in May
1821, aged 52, and was buried with full military honours.
The long melancholy walk down to the tomb is peopled by ghosts. After
Napoleon's death the house was abandoned, but it has since been restored to
its original state, and many artefacts have been returned or borrowed from
France to fill out the historical picture. The garden, too, under the
supervision of the French consul, who lives at Longwood, has been replanted,
and both house and garden are open to the public.
The tourist who leaves the ship for only a day will be conducted round St
Helena in a 1928 Cadillac, acquiring at least a superficial overview. Those
who leave the ship whilst it sails to Cape Town and back will have two weeks
to enjoy the sights and get to know the friendliest people on earth.
'Saints' are a racial mixture, reflecting St Helena's trade with the East,
so that there are discernible Chinese, Malaysian and Indian features, as
well as Portuguese and Dutch from the early traders. There is also a dash of
African blood from the slave ships which were intercepted en route to
America. English is spoken with a purity heard only in remote country
districts of Britain.
The sights for the day tripper will include Plantation House, the home of
the governor. It is an elegant 18th century country house whose grounds are
open to the public. The main attraction is Jonathan, a 162-year-old tortoise
the size and weight of a small tank, and his satellites Myrtle, David, Emma
and Fredrica, which browse on the lawn in front of the house and permit
their necks to be scratched.
A more extensive tour would be required to visit the ruins of High Knoll
fort, which stands on a peak overlooking the northern approach, built by the
British to defend the island against invaders. Two spectacular basalt
columns, quaintly named Lot and Lot's Wife, dominate the rocky volcanic
landscape from almost any viewpoint.
Probably the best way to get to know the island is on foot. There are peaks
to climb and cliffs to scale, as well as more gentle ascents for the less
athletic. One such is Flagstaff Hill, the breathtaking view from the top
being well worth the effort. From there one can see a huge hump-backed hill
called The Barn on the edge of which, to the eye of faith, can be discerned
the profile of Napoleon.
Two principal features of St Helena linger in the mind: the extraordinary
scenery, switching from pastoral to bleak and back again in minutes; and the
people, warm, friendly, dignified, courteous, honest and fiercely proud of
their island and its history. Its geographical remoteness, and the
difficulty of access to all but the most determined island lover, means that
it is untouched by so-called progress, mercifully free from television,
shopping malls and building blight. If lotuses were grown on St Helena they
would form the staple diet.
Mary Rose Beaumont travelled as a guest of Curnow Shipping, The Shipyard,
Porthleven, Helston, Cornwall TR13 9JA. Fares to St Helena start at Pounds
446 (four-berth cabin) and rise to Pounds 1,606 for sole use of a double
cabin, one way; return fares are double. A room at the Consulate Hotel with
private bath or shower is Pounds 35 per person per day, including meals.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Travel: The warm comfort of Antarctica - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a time when only strong men ventured to Antarctica. Now, this vast
and beautiful wilderness is far more accessible. Several companies, for
example, are offering cruises on ships with ice-hardened hulls, the
amenities of four-star hotels, cabins with en suite facilities, and zodiacs
(small inflatable dinghies) for shore landings. Going to the Antarctic is
still an adventure, but one that can be enjoyed in comfort.
The only time it is possible to go, when the southern oceans are free from
ice, is between October and March, the Antarctic summer. From Britain,
passengers fly from London to Chile or Argentina with embarkation at
Montevideo, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas or Ushuaia. Landings are made,
depending on length of voyage and weather, in the Falklands, South Georgia,
South Orkneys, South Shetlands, Antarctic peninsula and, on the return
journey, Cape Horn and Puerto Williams in the Chilean fiords.
First in the field of passenger expedition ships was Clipper's World
Discoverer (3,700 tons), which has taken people to the Antarctic since 1974.
It is a small, comfortable, friendly ship, with the accent on giving
passengers (maximum 139) a learning experience rather than a cruise - films
and lectures of an evening rather than casino and cabaret.
However, it has a fitness centre, sauna, small pool, beauty salon, cinema
and library. Lecturers, who act as guides on shore, include polar
historians, geologists, ornithologists and marine biologists; 16- to 23-day
voyages cost from Pounds 4,756 to Pounds 8,466 per person depending on
accommodation and length of trip. (London tel: 071-436-2931).
Ocean Cruise Lines' (tel: 071-724-7555) Ocean Princess (12,200 tons) carries
460 people and provides more mass-appeal cruising. As well as a team of
specialist lecturers, there is nightly dancing and cabaret, a piano bar and
casino. It also has a library, gym, sauna, pool, health club and beauty
salon. Prices for 20-22 days: from Pounds 2,295.
Several tour operators use both these ships but provide their own natural
history guides. Birdquest (tel: 0254-826317) takes small groups (maximum 12)
on World Discoverer and they can act independently on board and shore
excursions. Price for 25 days: Pounds 6,680 London return, or Pounds 5,840
Santiago return.
Abercrombie &amp; Kent (tel: 071-730-9600) uses Ocean Princess and takes groups
of about 30. A&amp;K also owns Explorer (2,398 tons), the smallest
ice-strengthened passenger vessel in Antarctica, which carries the least
number of people (96) to the largest ratio of specialist lecturers (12). In
spite of its size, it has a sauna, library, gift shop and lecture
hall-cinema. Prices for 16-23 days: from Pounds 4,128 to Pounds 6,297.
To visit the far side of the Antarctic, south of New Zealand, Noble
Caledonia (071-491-4752) offers cruises aboard Frontier Spirit (5,000 tons),
an exploration vessel for 130 passengers.
Sailings are from New Zealand via Terra Nova Bay, Ross Ice Shelf, McMurdo
Sound and Ross Island. Prices, from Pounds 4,500 to Pounds 7,995 for a
verandah suite, include return flight London-New Zealand, two nights in
Auckland, two in Sydney and 22 on board.
For the longest voyage of all (31 days), Quark Expeditions' (071-490-2211)
18,000-ton Russian ice breaker, Kapitan Khlebnikov, sails from Cape Town to
Perth stopping in the Antarctic en route. The price, from Pounds 5,955 to
Pounds 8,300, includes air travel London-Cape Town-Perth-London and 22
nights on board.
Information about Antarctic cruises can be obtained from Paul Mundy
(071-734-4404), the cruise specialist.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Run rabbit, run rabbit, run, run, run: Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING up from the kitchen sink I saw an octet of pheasants within potshot,
scrumping under our apple and rowan trees. An hour later a ninth bird,
intent on kamikazi, dive bombed my car and splattered down on to what looked
more like a tarred and feathered track than a modern Macadamised road, so
many corpses were there.
That was in late October.
Now that November has dawned and the guns are poised to attack, the
feathered fraternity has vanished as fast as a conjurer's hat.
Which is why my recipe today is not for pheasant, as it might have been, but
for rabbit - and farmed rabbit, at that.
I used to be snooty about farmed rabbit, rating it not a patch on the real
thing, but the variability of the wild sort has worn down my argument. Too
many knife-blunting, jaw-aching memories of jousting with long-toothed
rabbits in the kitchen and at table has taught me to appreciate the delicacy
and juiciness of the farmed sort.
Farmed rabbit is an asset too if you like to serve meals at an appointed
hour and to synchronise the timing of dishes to go with the meat. Wild
rabbit is wildly unpredictable; joints of farmed can be counted on to take
just 30 minutes or so to become tender.
Poaching is my preferred cooking method, chosen for several reasons. It is
light work for the cook. It produces pure, low fat food which is easily
digested. And the cooking liquor forms the basis for lovely soups
afterwards.
What is more, poached rabbit is not only delicious hot but also excellent
cold and in rechauffe dishes, so much so that I usually cook more rabbit
than I need for one meal with these 'extras' in mind.
Cooking in quantity brings added bonuses: it intensifies the flavour and
satiny texture of the cooking broth, and it means that half the cook's work
for subsequent meals is done ahead, without any effort.
Rabbit joints not eaten at the first meal will keep in the fridge for two or
three days. Delay stripping the meat from the bone and cutting it into
quills until needed.
Sometimes I mix the cooked quills with sauteed mushrooms, hard-boiled eggs,
ham and olives, and I bind the ingredients with a creamy light sauce and
serve them under a puff pastry lid. This makes a fine rabbit pie.
Sometimes I toss the quills with orange zest and toasted pinenuts, and use
them to garnish a risotto.
On other occasions I pack the rabbit meat into a terrine with chunks of
gammon, a handful of fresh green herbs and some of the jellied poaching
stock to make brawn.
Cold, juicily cooked rabbit meat also makes appetising salads. I
particularly like to sprinkle the quills generously over a scant bed of
chicory or frizzy endive leaves, add segments of orange and tiny black
Nicoise olives, and serve with a blob of mustardy mayonnaise on the side.
SOUCHY OF RABBIT WITH LEEKS, POTATOES AND GARLIC Sauce: The secret of
successful poaching lies in keeping the flame very low, never allowing the
liquid to come anywhere near the boil. Boiling toughens meat: if the liquid
becomes violently agitated - even for a minute or so - the meat will then
need hours of gentle cooking to render it tender again.
The cook must be on constant guard, ready to adjust the flame as necessary.
The temperature should not drop so much that no steam rises when the lid is
lifted from the pot, but it must be kept below simmering point so that only
a very occasional bubble burps gently to the surface.
To cook say 10 or 12 rabbit joints (shoulder portions are my preferred cut;
legs are good; saddle is the most expensive and the driest meat), first
bring at least 3 pt of liquid to boiling point. Yes, I mean boiling point in
this instance. Salted water with bay leaves, a few snippets of lovage or a
small bunch of coriander will do well. Light chicken stock can be used, even
that made with a good quality stock cube, such as Kallo.
When boiling point is reached add the meat, all at once, so the bubbling
ceases instantly. Cover the pot, turn the flame right down and poach as
described.
After about 20 minutes add some leeks to the pot, say three for every two
diners, cutting the vegetables into 2in chunks. Raise the flame slightly as
their addition will cause the temparature of the liquid to plummet.
After a further 10-15 minutes poaching both meat and vegetables should be
cooked to perfection. Turn off the heat and if you are not ready to eat
straight away, let the ingredients stand in the covered pot to keep them
succulent and hot.
When ready to serve, lift the rabbit and leeks out of the pot and arrange
them on a dish with some separately steamed or boiled floury potatoes. Spoon
on a few spoonfuls of the poaching liquor (fast boiled to intensify its
flavour if necessary, and seasoned to taste). Scatter lavishly with fresh
chopped coriander for the sake of its colour as well as its complementary
taste.
Rabbit cooked this way is juicy and tender, best enjoyed by eating in one's
fingers, and most delicious when partnered with a bowl of garlicky sauce:
aioli, tarator or skordalia.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Romance at a city's heart: Grand Hotel Nicholas Lander
enjoys an anniversary at London's Savoy Hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HAVE A good trip,' said the hotel's personable cashier. I did not have the
wit to tell her that our return trip after a night at the Savoy would be
eight stops up the Northern Line on the London Underground.
We had decided, using a wedding anniversary as the pretext, to explore
London, our own city. Choosing the hotel was more difficult than forsaking
the queues at Heathrow or on the motorways that a journey out of London
would have necessitated.
The elegance of the Ritz, the decorum of Claridges, the sheer
professionalism of the Inn on the Park or the renaiscent Dorchester? Or,
perhaps, the discreetness of one of the smaller hotels, the Connaught, the
Capital or Blakes? I recalled a friend who had managed to explore all of
them during a week's walking tour of London by forsaking lunch and having
tea in a different hotel every afternoon.
The Savoy attracted us for its history, its location and its architecture. I
had, until this visit, one major reservation about the hotel and that had
been the rather supercilious attitude of its staff. It seemed to me that
even in the late 1980s the management had not been able to break the almost
feudal system that used to be the norm in all the grand hotels and
manifested itself in the older members of the staff believing, and acting,
as if they owned it.
Today this attitude has changed. The recession has played its part but so
too has the example set by Herbert Striessnig. the hotel's general manager.
Brought in as a troubleshooter by his predecessor, Striessnig patrols the
Savoy as though intent on wearing out the pile carpets.
As we checked in, the advice of a former general manager of another of
London's grand hotels was ringing in my ears: 'Whenever you stay in one of
the world's expensive hotels get full value for your money. Send the
postcards, wear the dressing gowns and find a home for all the free gifts on
offer.' (In the Savoy's case golden toothbrushes).
We did. We ate lunch in the Upstairs Bar looking on to the Savoy's entrance,
the only street in London where you drive on the right. We took tea, not on
the public terrace, but in the drawing room reserved for residents and a
well- guarded secret.
There were pre-dinner drinks, a dry martini naturally, and excellent potato
crisps in the American Bar, followed by dinner in the Savoy Grill and,
finally, breakfast in the River Room where we were the only people reading
newspapers in a room full of power-breakfasters.
The only problem was getting out of the bedroom which was stunning. We had
requested a room with a view of the Thames and on the day it seemed fully
worth its Pounds 60 supplement with panoramic views; east towards St Paul's
Cathedral and Canary Wharf and west towards the Houses of Parliament. And
the Thames looks magnificent, regardless of the colour of the water, because
the hotel stands on a bend which is much more pronounced than I had
realised.
The room was huge with a range of fixtures and fittings that only an hotel
with a long history could offer: a clock face etched on a large mirror from
the 1930s; a three-button alarm for the valet, maid or butler; and a small
wall-mounted Roberts radio. The bathrooms are small, converted from
balconies which, before the first world war, overlooked the Thames. Bath
robes and linen sheets are of the finest quality.
To make up for this extravagance our afternoon's sightseeing cost nothing.
The Savoy stands near two of London's ecclesiastical gems, the Savoy Chapel
and St Mary-le-Strand. Also nearby are Victoria Embankment Gardens, which
offer a green walk alongside the river and, just a brisk trot along the
Strand and into Trafalgar Square, is the National Gallery. Covent Garden is
just across the road.
Nothing could be more pleasant than dinner in the Savoy Grill, consistently
busy at lunch and dinner thanks to its proximity to the city, the theatres
and the opera.
Nor was it possible to fault the phalanx of distinguished waiters, including
a sommelier who remembered what we had drunk on our last visit three years
ago and informed us of the temperature of the red wine we had chosen.
Criticism, however, there could be of the wine list which, in its pricing,
shows the heavy hand of an accountant and offers nothing exciting by the
glass (unlike the Upstairs Bar). And criticism too, for some of chef David
Sharland's more adventurous dishes - in particular a salad of scallops with
spiced vegetables.
But the Grill had worked its magic. And London, from our bedroom window,
looked enchanting.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Drink: The market's fruitiest malt - Giles MacDonogh savours
a malt whisky - in San Prospero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW, foolhardy people ever visit the swollen village of San Prospero in the
north Italian province of Modena. There is nothing much to see apart from a
handful of jerry-built modern factories and a huge vinification plant for
the local, Lambrusco wine.
One might well have imagined that the wine, or indeed grappas and liqueurs,
would be quite sufficient to satisfy the largely communist workforce, but
no. A careful study of drinks behind the counter in the high street bar
reveals a well-thumbed bottle of the Macallan single malt standing proudly
aloof from the ranks of amaros and amarettos.
The Macallan is a seven-year-old: unknown in Britain, where the range kicks
off with a ten-year-old spirit.
San Prospero is unlikely to be any different from any other village in
northern Italy: malt whiskies like the Macallan are all the rage, with the
Italians drinking twice as much of the stuff as we do in Britain.
They also drink a lot of the Macallan seven-year-old, which is currently
ranked eighth most popular - and that includes blended whiskies. The
Macallan's rating is a tribute to the extraordinary skills of Armando
Giovinetti of Milan. It was Giovinetti who introduced the Italians to malt
when he managed Glen Grant a few years back.
He later fell out with the men at Glen Grant and since then he has been
promoting the Macallan.
That Glen Grant's loss was the Macallan's gain is clear to Allan Shiach,
Macallan's chairman. It was Shiach who created prestige malt when he took
the courageous decision to launch a Macallan single malt in 1969. At that
time the distillery was known only as a source for blending. The first
ten-year-old malt was released ten years later in 1979 after a decade of
heartaches. Shiach likes to compare his 1969 decision to opening a
restaurant: you equip the kitchens, hire the staff, but you don't open the
doors to customers for another ten, long years.
Macallan's success has vindicated Shiach's faith in his own whisky. Since
that time he has launched 18- and 25-year-old malts on a regular basis and
occasionally sold even older spirits for fantastic prices. The family firm
has sold off half its equity: 25 per cent to Remy Martin, and 25 per cent to
Suntory, but a richer, sleeker Shiach remains in control. In spite of the
launch of countless superb old malts since 1979, the Macallan remains the
one which captures the drinker's imagination as the ne plus ultra, and
nothing looks like toppling it for the time being.
So what makes the Macallans so special? All malt whisky is the product of a
micro-climate, spring-water, a set of stills and an ageing technique. For
the Macallan, it is the latter which is all important: the Macallan has
always led on its oak barrels; more particularly on reused Oloroso casks
from Jerez in Spain.
The Macallan claims to be the only whisky aged exclusively in 'sherry-wood'.
When other distilleries use 100 per cent sherry casks, it is only for a
special vintage release, and not for the whole range.
Reluctance to use only sherry is not just a question of taste: sherry casks
cost Pounds 250 a piece as opposed to Pounds 35 for the more prevalent
Bourbon wood. Sherry wood engenders problems of its own: you must go to
Spain to select the oak; then you must keep an eye on the casks to make sure
the sherry companies do the right things with them. It would not do for the
casks to develop the bacterial 'flor' which gives the special character to
fino sherries.
This was noticable in the tasting of eight different Macallans I did with
Allan Shiach. First we tasted the fresh, young spirit before it had been put
into cask; next came a whisky aged in a cask which had housed a dark, sweet
sherry which had given the whisky a buttery, nutty character. A lighter
sherry wood, possibly from a young oloroso was far less obtrusive. Next came
a new Bourbon cask, immediately noticable by its up-front new Kentucky oak
flavours. The fino cask whisky was peculiar, the bacterial flor from the
sherry had made the Macallan taste leathery, much like an Island malt. The
last three were a rich, raisiny amontillado, a nutty dry oloroso, and a
sweet, buttery oloroso. An excellent demonstration of just how important is
the cask to the finished product.
The sherry oak makes the Macallan the fruitiest, most raisiny malt whisky on
the market. Some whisky drinkers hate the taste, which brings the spirit
half way to cognac, rounding off the rough edges which make other whiskies
an acquired taste.
It is hard to know which school is the purest, for some would claim that all
good whisky was aged in old wine, sherry or even port casks in the past, and
that it is only cost which deters distillers in our own day. Whatever the
case, these arguments do not bother many Italians and the people of San
Prospero are happily unaware that the controversy even exists.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Drink: It's time to roll out the barrels - Jancis Robinson
discovers the secrets of making a fortune in the wine trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUNCH WAS served under a tree by the pool, the snails and duck cooked by the
local two-star chef and smilingly served by his mother. In the dappled
September sunlight of a good Burgundy vintage (yes, 1992) we watched two
young men fulfil their pool maintenance contract and discussed the world's
financial crisis.
The cold hand of stagnation and bankruptcy has certainly touched most parts
of the wine business, but my hosts' very particular sector of it seems as
hot as ever.
Jean and Noelle Francois report little slackening of demand for the top
quality French oak barrels they sell from their three pre-eminent
cooperages: Francois Freres in Burgundy, Demptos just outside Bordeaux and
Demptos Napa, a joint venture in California.
Total production is more than 200 casks a day (75 in St Romain, 100 in
Bordeaux, 30 in Napa) which can sell for Pounds 250 apiece. As Gerard
Lebrere of the biggest cooper's Seguin Moreau, says: 'The world is
infatuated with new oak at the moment'.
As more wine producers console themselves over slow demand with the mantra
'less but better', the wooden cask has taken on a mythical significance.
At the lower end of the ladder the most obvious way a producer can jack up
the price of his wine is to age it in wood, preferably oak new enough to
impart a perceptible layer of 'oaky' flavour, and trumpet the fact on the
label.
At the top end, the increasingly high proportion of meticulously nurtured
fruit in many cases demands meticulously coopered wood which not only adds
more complex flavours but smooths the winemaking process. High scores and
public acclaim are imperative to generate sales and top quality new French
oak seems, at present anyway, to be the key.
Demand for oak casks is strong therefore from producers at the bottom who
wish to climb and from those at the top who dare not slip. Only those
producers with a real cash flow problem - such as Burgundy's most logjammed
negociants and smaller, mid-range domaines - have sharply cut their orders
this year. But producers in the New World and emerging Old World wine
regions who wish to demonstrate that they too belong to the wine world elite
have more than compensated.
Of the 200,000 French oak barrels made for a particularly generous vintage
such as 1990 more than half are exported, with the ambitious and relatively
cash-rich wineries of California taking about half of all exports. The
geographical diversification of the French cooperage business, initially
impelled by the 1973 oil crisis, means that it is now, thanks to southern
hemisphere orders, a year-round rather than three-month activity.
Survival in the cooperage business takes considerable nerve however, as well
as financial reserves, which is why many smaller coopers have foundered.
While not being so long-term as the timber business (trees should be at
least a century old before being hewn into wine casks), a good cooper has to
bet on his likely sales in two to three years' time, buying ahead after
careful selection from France's efficiently-managed forests, which cover a
quarter of that sizeable hexagone.
Top quality oak tends to be from slow-growing trees from certain treasured
areas, carefully split into staves by following the grain and then left
outside for a couple of years like giant stacks of matches to yield the
harshest tannins to the elements.
This relatively buoyant market is fought over by the 30 or so specialist
coopers left in France, other than those well-heeled, traditional wine
producers who still have their own in-house cooper. Some of the biggest are
based in Cognac where barrels are all-important, but it is a sign of the
relative health of the wine and brandy markets that Seguin Moreau is now a
nice little earner for the Remy Martin group selling 95 per cent of its
barrels to wine producers.
Taransaud uses its particularly fine stock of French oak to do the same for
the Hennessy bit of the LVMH group while Vicard and Radoux are still
independent. Francois Freres of Burgundy became the biggest family-run
cooperage business in 1989 with its trans-hexagon acquisition of Demptos, to
which Seguin Moreau has responded by setting up shop in Burgundy last
November. Nadalie is the other sizeable Bordeaux cooper, but Californians
Kendall-Jackson have bought a stake in a French cooper.
Coopers such as Demptos will export staves for reconstruction into casks
abroad but others try to minimise such potentially expensive problems as
contamination and leaks by exporting whole made-up barrels sheathed in
plastic. Like most craftsmen however, with the possible exception of chefs
and marblers, coopers, those who actually coop for a living, are a
disappearing species. Seguin Moreau has cleverly harnessed Portuguese
cooperage skills to make French staves.
Just as port and traditionally matured Portuguese wines have kept the
cooper's art alive in Portugal, so sherry, rioja and a wide range of
wood-matured spirits mean that there are still flourishing cooperages in
Spain, Scotland, Ireland and, particularly, America where bourbon must be
matured in a new charred American oak cask. This rule, surely formulated by
some American timber merchant, can generate sales of up to 1m casks a year,
many of which eventually find their way to Scotland where Scotch whisky
producers are becoming increasingly worried by the possible effects of the
bourbon slump on their own production costs. The future may bring new
American oak casks. (Used wine casks tend to be traded down for use on
increasingly lowly wines.)
The sherry producers of Andalucia play an important part in the cooperage
business too, not just by breaking in oak casks specially for some of the
more particular malt whisky producers, but by usefully abhorring new oak and
using individual casks for up to 200 years. The sweeter, more obvious
flavours of American oak have traditionally been favoured by Spanish wine
and brandy producers ever since the 17th century, and this naturally less
porous oak is also widely used for reds hefty enough to take it in Australia
as well as California.
European oak is finer and although there is no shortage of French oak, it is
expensive, representing up to half the price of a barrel today.
Many coopers, mindful of history, are looking east for cheaper oaks -
particularly since there are, for the moment at least, few controls on exact
wood provenance, however much Napa Valley winemakers agonise over whether to
order Allier or Troncais - names which may, in reality, be used
interchangeably by France's still blessed barrel salesmen.
Jancis Robinson's series Vintners' Tales (BBC2 Mondays 8.50 pm) looks at
some of the more colourful characters in the wine trade.

IF YOU feel a faint frisson at the thought of having to face the standard
British turkey routine, you may like to consider celebrating Italian style
this Christmas. On Wednesdays, beginning next week, in the kitchens of Books
For Cooks in London's Notting Hill, Anna Del Conte and Carla Tomasi will
join forces to offer an inspired double helping of the best of Italian
festive cuisine. Each of the one-day cookery classes will be devoted to
festive menus from a different region: Lazio (Tomasi's homeland), Milan (Del
Conte's birthplace) the Veneto and Sicily. Recipes include a magnificent
fritto misto, montebianco, polenta with squid, caponatina and farsumagru.
For details and bookings tel: 071-278-2659. Philippa Davenport.
Although Italian cooking is in vogue, one of that country's most
gastronomically exciting areas, Piedmont, has been sadly ignored.
Pizzicato, 34 Rupert Street, London W1 (tel: 071-734-0122) is an attempt to
rectify that. The emphasis is heavily on design - elaborate spotlights,
thick candles and waiters in brightly coloured waistcoats - but the food and
wine list, entirely Piedmontese, is impressive too.
The food conveys the rustic feel of the area - open parsley ravioli with
wild mushrooms, a pizza of wild boar sausage and pecorino, a grilled breast
of chicken with gnocchi and baked rabbit with white wine, hazelnuts and
rosemary potatoes. The wine list provides an excellent introduction to some
of that area's unique grape varieties - Nebbiolo, Arneis and Cortese - from
some of its top producers - Gaja, Pio Cesare and Ceretto. Open seven days,
noon to midnight. Nicholas Lander
My largest post-bag came two years ago after an article on the early demise
of Chez Max in Richmond, Surrey, run by Mark and Max Renzland. Since then
the Renzlands have been cooking their way around London looking for a way
back into the restaurant business without excessive borrowings. Their
solution may epitomise the 1990s.
They have invested no more than Pounds 5,000 in fixtures and fittings for
unlicensed premises which, during the day, is run as a cafe called Bonzos.
In the evening the Renzlands step in, throw on the red-checked tablecloths,
rename it Le Petit Max and start cooking the type of food that brought them
so many admirers: crab and mussel soup, confit of duck with cabbage, skate
with black butter and braised oxtail with red wine and lardons.
Costs are deliberately being kept down by a short menu; a staff of three and
a set price of around Pounds 14 for three courses. Bring your own wine,
corkage Pounds 1. Open seven nights a week and Sunday lunch, 97a High
Street, Hampton Wick, Middlesex. Tel: 081-977-0236. NL
The price of wines in restaurants seems to be everybody's bete noir. As a
former restaurateur I find these complaints a little excessive as food and
wine are the only two possible sources of profit - no restaurant makes a
profit on the service or the ambience.
However, Fortnum &amp; Mason has decided to adopt a pricing policy that should
please everyone. Taking advantage of its revamped wine department, it adds,
for restaurant wine lists, a straight Pounds 2 margin to the retail prices.
Bargains in its Fountain Restaurant include Ch La Lagune 1983, Pounds 25;
Chianti Isole e Olena 1990, Pounds 12.75; a house white Burgundy Pounds
9.50; Puligny Montrachet Carillon 1990, Pounds 25.50 and a Dr Loosen Moselle
at Pounds 6.75. NL.
Yes, more American food. For those who want to celebrate Bill Clinton's
victory as US President with more than a tired hamburger and a glass of root
beer, the Inter-Continental on London's Hyde Park Corner (071-409-3131) is
promoting American cuisine, beers and wine throughout this month.
Specialities will include fish and seafood chowder, country peanut soup,
southern fried chicken, carpetbagger steaks and lots more.
For Republicans drowning their sorrows, cocktails include 'Bush's Booster',
which consists of: one part vodka, one part almond liqueur, a dash of lemon,
lime and curacao served on crushed ice with a wedge of lime.
Yuck. You can't win 'em all . . .

FT  07 NOV 92 / As They Say In Europe: Bill Clinton's lucky number
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to say anything new about this week's events in the US.
IF Time magazine can run a cover story weeks before the election which could
have been titled 'Clinton's road to the White House,' poor old Europeans
have little to add.
In Germany there is no reluctance to hammer home self-evident truths. Welt
an Sonntag produced a fine example of what German leader writers manage when
they know they have to write something, no matter what: 'Most auguries say
President Bush will not be confirmed in office on Tuesday. Most Americans
want a change and therefore will send Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to the
White House for at least four years . . . There are many reasons for the
loss of confidence in a President who had more international and government
experience for the highest US job than any of his predecessors. But the main
cause of Bush's loss of popularity is the desolate economic situation.'
Elsewhere the lacklustre apercu demands more skilful decoration. Tuesday's
headline in Corriere della Sera ran: 'Dollar jumps with Clinton.' On
Thursday La Repubblica had Bill Clinton saying, improbably, 'Ecco la mia
America.'
Generally each nation worried about its fate. France-Soir warned, 'It would
be a great mistake to lower our guard in the belief that a Democratic
president would scarcely defend the farmers of the Middle West under the
pretext that these people vote Republican.'
Fortunately there is always Komsomolskaya Pravda. The Moscow paper
proclaimed, 'In recent weeks a hole appeared in the Republican vessel that
had seemed unsinkable some six months ago . . . At that time the
good-for-nothing governor of a small state could not compete with the
President of a great country. But victories in the Gulf and changes in
Eastern Europe raised Bush so high that he forgot a simple truth: not even
success of historic proportions abroad can replace concern about one's own
country.'
Last week Bernard Heimrich of the Frankfurter Allgemeine took a London taxi
to a royal investiture: ''To the Palace, please,' said the passenger.
'Buckingham?' asked the driver. 'Buckingham Palace,' confirmed the passenger
simply. The driver nodded, turned the meter and made his way towards his
Queen. The passenger behind waited. The driver was silent. Surely that
cannot have been all?'
'Many have been racking their brains as to why London taxi drivers have
stopped talking. A week ago a cabbie spent a quarter of an hour attacking
the Bundesbank without drawing breath. But for two years now that sort of
thing has been the exception. . . . One school of thought puts it down to
these new-fangled chat radio stations which remove the pressure for
conversation.'
Heimrich wrote that he had wished to contact the Palace so he looked in the
phone book. 'There stands 'Buckingham Palace' in small print, somehow thrown
between 'Buckingham Butchers,' 'Buckingham Dry Cleaners and 'Buckingham, R',
and even the phone number is not anything special.' This raises a problem:
how do you start looking up the phone number of a head of state? And what
sort of number should that person have? Clinton's will be 202-456-1414 which
is pretty dreary.

FT  07 NOV 92 / A monstrous regiment fights the good fight: Women priests
are knocking at the door of the Church of England. But will their prayers be
answered?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Church of England will never be the same again after next Wednesday,
when its general synod votes on whether to ordain women to the priesthood.
Supporters and opponents of the move, divided on almost everything else, are
at least agreed on that. The debate happens to be taking place on November
11 - Armistice Day - but no armistice will follow the result. Some people
will leave the church if it ordains women priests; others will leave if it
does not.
Church-going is a minority activity in modern Britain. Around 7m people are
practising members of the main Christian denominations, which is low by the
standards of other European nations. Only around 2m adults worship regularly
in the Church of England. But interest in the national church continues to
reach far beyond its active membership. The BBC, reflecting this, will
broadcast next week's entire debate live on radio and the decisive,
afternoon session on television - giving it parity with big parliamentary
occasions and political party conferences.
Some among this wider audience of non-churchgoing viewers and listeners may
question the idea of women priests in the same way as they are unhappy about
female voices in choirs, hymns written since the start of this century and
church architecture that does not look at least vaguely gothic. They regard
the Church of England as a repository of timeless - in reality more often
Victorian - values that should be preserved in familiar and unchanging form.
Next week's debate is not for them. It is about the future shape of the
church rather than about preserving traditions - even 2,000-year-old ones -
for tradition's sake.
For the church no other subject, with the possible exception of a decision
on disestablishment, could run next week's debate close in either importance
or potential for division in an institution which takes pride in its powers
of comprehensiveness, co-existence and compromise.
A synod decision in favour of women priests would need to pass through
parliament before becoming law, and divisions have already opened among MPs
and ministers. John Gummer, the agriculture minister, might leave the Church
of England if it agrees to ordain women. Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, has declared herself in favour and recently sponsored the
Movement for the Ordination of Women's first meeting in the house of
commons.
If next week's debate were taking place under parliamentary procedures,
there would be no doubt about the outcome. A majority of synod members will
vote in favour of women priests. The synod, however, votes in three houses -
bishops, clergy and laity - each of which must approve the change by
two-thirds majorities.
Even this demanding threshold will almost certainly be met by the bishops
and clergy. If the move to ordain women is defeated, it will be because it
fails on the narrowest of margins to scrape a two-thirds majority among lay
members of the synod. In a related vote earlier this year, support for women
priests reached only 61.4 per cent in the house of laity.
Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, last month defended the church's
'slow and cumbersome' decision-making process, saying 'dictatorship of the
simple majority' could cause worse tensions and problems. Campaigners for
women priests will not settle for such calm rationalisation if the vote goes
against them next week.
Representatives of most of the 44 dioceses have voted in favour of ordaining
women and, if the move is thwarted because it just misses a two-thirds
majority in one of three houses, there will be accusations that the
dictatorship of the blocking minority has been at work.
The difficult implications of ordaining women have been recognised
throughout years of preparation leading up to next week's vote. Some male
priests would leave the Church of England - a financial compensation scheme
has been devised for them - and relations with the Roman Catholic Church
would come under severe strain.
It has become apparent as the final decision has neared, however, that a
vote against would be just as divisive and difficult for the church to
handle as one in favour.
If the vote is lost, supporters of women priests are threatening sanctions
including an 'ordination strike' - male deacons refusing to accept
ordination to the priesthood until women deacons could become priests as
well.
The Rev Philip Crowe, principal of Salisbury and Wells theological college,
says he would be unable to continue in his post if the church adopted an
official policy of opposing women's ordination. Other high level
resignations might follow.
The bishops are under acute pressure to maintain a united front whatever the
result, but some have very publicly endorsed the ordination of women. One or
two might find it impossible in the new circumstances to continue ordaining
men. It has even been suggested that retired bishops might be prepared to
carry out unlawful but valid ordinations of women.
Dr Carey would be left in an exposed position personally by a 'no' vote.
Since leapfrogging much longer-serving bishops to become Archbishop of
Canterbury last year, he has maintained whole-hearted support for women
priests.
There have been mutterings among a few senior colleagues that the archbishop
was unwise not to take a more neutral line given the uncertainly of the
outcome. But Carey - the first non-Oxbridge archbishop of Canterbury since
the Middle Ages - comes not from the pages of Trollope but from an east
London council estate and secondary modern school. He is not a natural
exponent of the fence-sitting skills that sometimes pass for leadership in
the Church of England. Supporters hope a heartfelt speech from a
sincerely-convinced Carey will win over enough waverers to carry the vote.
Outside the active membership of the church, the debate over women priests -
turning on such arguments as whether there are theological objections to a
woman representing Christ in the celebration of Holy Communion - can appear
medieval and arcane. But the church began moving towards the ordination of
women before sex equality issues achieved their current political and social
importance.
There have been women priests in the worldwide Anglican communion for nearly
50 years - the first, Florence Tim Oi Li, ordained in China in 1944, died
this year. Since then women have been ordained in other Anglican provinces,
not always in the most tranquil of circumstances.
Dr Peter Carnley, Archbishop of Perth, ordained Australia's first ten women
priests earlier this year without the authority of the Australian synod and
after a supreme court bid to block the ordinations had failed. 'Today we
ordain ten but we liberate tens of thousands,' he declared in a phrase that
illustrates the depth of feeling aroused by the issue.
The battle to win the argument for women priests in the mother church of
Anglicanism is continuing unabated right up to Wednesday. Potential waverers
among synod members are being lobbied as forcefully as Conservative
backbenchers in this week's Maastricht vote; advertising campaigns have run
in the religious press.
An advertisement by the Movement for the Ordination of Women features Dr
Susan Cole-King, a British-born medical doctor who went to New York as
senior health adviser to the United Nations children's fund in the 1980s and
became a priest in the US Episcopal church.
Today she is back in Britain as minister in charge of Drayton, Oxfordshire.
Dr Cole-King conducts baptisms, weddings and funerals, leads services,
presides at meetings and offers individuals support and advice. She lives in
a house called the vicarage and is, in the eyes of her parishioners, the
vicar of Drayton - except that she cannot use the title as it is restricted
to priests. Although Dr Cole-King is a priest, in England she has only the
status of a deacon.
The most significant effect of this is that she is prevented from
undertaking the exclusively priestly functions of celebrating Holy
Communion, pronouncing absolution and the blessing. Like other women deacons
in charge of parishes, she has to maintain a rota of male colleagues who are
available to celebrate communion. If a car breakdown prevented one from
arriving to say the Eucharistic Prayer, the service could not legally
continue.
' . . . who in the same night that he was betrayed, took bread and when he
had given thanks, he brake it and gave it to his disciples saying, Take eat,
this is my body . . .' The Eucharistic Prayer: the point in the Holy
Communion service at which the bread and wine is consecrated. Words that in
England only a man can validly say. This is, says Dr Cole-King, the only
real difference between her role and that of male priests in neighbouring
parishes. But, reflecting on her work in Drayton and her previous ministry
among the homeless in New York, she adds: 'The Eucharistic Prayer is not
what makes a priest a priest.'
Her experiences in New York and Oxfordshire draw her to the conclusion that,
when confronted with a women priest, most parishioners find 'there really is
nothing particularly special' about the experience. 'The biggest problem for
people in Drayton was deciding what they were going to call me, particularly
as I followed someone who called himself Father John. I had no wish to be
called Mother, and resolved the problem by suggesting that people called me
by my name.'
Women priests are knocking at the door of the Church of England. They are
already ordained in the Church of Ireland. Scotland, where women ordained
overseas are allowed to celebrate Holy Communion, and Wales could follow
soon. England itself has women deacons - undiscernable from priests to the
lay eye - running parishes.
Even the staunchest opponents recognise what this means. A 'no' vote next
week might win them a few years. But there will be women priests in England
before long, whatever the outcome of the debate. They will eventually become
as much part of the natural, unchanging Anglican tradition as robed choirs,
festivals of nine lessons and carols and all that other 'timeless'
ceremonial inherited from only a century ago.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Sport: Confessions of an Arsenal supporter - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICK HORNBY and I have a lot in common. We are nearly the same age. We both
grew up in the 1960s in the middle class purlieus of London. As children we
both found the idea of watching soccer incomprehensible. For both of us that
changed not slowly but in a matter of minutes.
My epiphany occured one dull Sunday afternoon in 1965. I switched on the
television. A team in shining white was playing a team in grey. Before I
could switch off, one of the white shirts flitted half the length of the
field and popped the ball past the grey goalkeeper. Then he did it again,
won a penalty, scored and opened my eyes to the beauty and excitement of
soccer. He was Jimmy Greaves and I was a Spurs fan.
A month later I sat on my father's shoulders in a crowd of 56,000 and
watched Spurs beat Arsenal 3-1. It was my first game at White Hart Lane. I
have been going ever since.
Nick was a later convert. His parents separated and his father would take
him out on Saturdays. In 1968 his father offered to take Nick to the FA Cup
final but he refused. That autumn he relented and saw Arsenal beat Stoke
City 1-0.
In his book Fever Pitch, Nick writes: 'I fell in love with football as I was
later to fall in love with women: suddenly, inexplicably, uncritically,
giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring.'
Fever Pitch is Nick's account of his life as a soccer fan and as an Arsenal
fan, which he does not believe are the same thing. There are chapters on the
England team, an account of his student fling with Cambridge United, but
Arsenal is his abiding, dominating passion. He writes entertainingly and
sensibly about watching the game, about the players, about the fans, about
hooliganism and about the fans' relationships with the clubs.
The book is also an autobiography: the tale of a life in which soccer has
seeped into every waking moment. It is the story of his relations with his
father and his struggle with depression which dominated his 20s, a period
which coincided with barren, directionless years at Arsenal.
Nick is now a book and television reviewer and, with Fever Pitch, a
successful author. He and Arsenal emerged from the dark years together in
1987 when Arsenal won the Littlewoods (now Coca Cola) Cup. He says this was
not coincidental: 'The symbolic value of beating Tottenham in the
semi-finals and Liverpool in the final helped a great deal.'
When I went to meet him I was looking forward to a chat about the game with
an articulate, intelligent and - the book suggested - likeable fellow fan
with whom I had so much in common.
I was wrong. He is articulate, intelligible, likeable. But as soccer fans we
have little in common.
The book contained hints. My memory of my first game is of a sunny afternoon
crowded happily together with friendly fans. Nick's is different: 'What
impressed me most was just how much most of the men around me hated, really
hated being there . . . nobody seemed to enjoy, in the way I understood the
word, anything that happened during the entire afternoon. Within minutes of
the kick-off there was real anger . . . as the game went on anger turned
into outrage and then seemed to curdle into sullen, silent discontent.'
He told me that he had only once missed an Arsenal home game while in
London. He went with a girlfriend to queue for tickets for the Laker
Skytrain. It took longer than expected and he spent the afternoon wrestling
with a desire to leave her to queue while he went to Highbury. 'That would
have been unforgiveable'. He stayed.
'Surely you felt virtuous?'
'No.'
He refers constantly to the 'pathology' of his relationship with Arsenal. It
is something 'unhealthy'. He has been in psychotherapy and is a
highly-regarded writer, but he is still a season ticket-holder at Arsenal.
'I don't have as much invested in football as I did but is still provides
some kind of backbone.'
The book has struck a chord. Nick tells of two women who have written to
him. Both have successful careers but Nick does not want to reveal their
identities. One told him that only her parents knew why she did not attend
her grandmother's funeral: she was watching her team. Another sends a fax
every Monday to George Graham, the Arsenal manager, with her thoughts on the
weekend's game.
Nick says that when he looks around him on a cold, wet March evening when
Arsenal are anchored in mid-table playing a purposeless match against dull
opponents, he realises that everyone else has an unhealthy reason for being
there.
He says the intelligent way to consume soccer, the way he consumes films, is
to select the best games and see them: 'Watch the big matches, stay away
from the rubbish - surely the sensible way.'
People mock when Wimbledon set a record low for a crowd in the top division.
The wonder is that there are 3,500 people 'pathological' enough to cross
south London in December to watch a club with little history or glamour play
in rented accommodation against Oldham Athletic. There are hundreds of
thousands like them; professional soccer in Britain could not survive
without their support.
Nick acknowledges his community with them, as he accepts that he has
something in common with train spotters and others with socially-useless
obsessions. But he also argues, as lovers do, that his relationship has
unique characteristics which set it, and him, apart.
He takes pride in the fact that the loved one is not seen as beautiful by
others. 'We Arsenal fans know, deep down, that football at Highbury has not
often been pretty, and that therefore our reputation as the most boring team
in the entire history of the universe is not as mystifying as we pretend.'
Nick insists that his love affair has shaped him. 'I can't have watched
Arsenal for 25 years without it having some effect on my character.' I hope
he was joking.
Arsenal also offered Nick the illusion of community. He moved to Highbury
and was disappointed.
'I thought it was going to be like those sitcom depictions of suburbia, with
all the identical front doors opening at the same time. In my street it
would be Arsenal supporters rather than commuters who emerged . . . and they
would see me and wave, and I would immediately become a much loved and
valued member of a happy, working-class Arsenal community.
'But no doors opened. Nobody supports Arsenal on my street.'
A fan's life is one of disappointment. Arsenal are one of England's most
successful clubs, yet that translates into three championships, two FA cups,
one Littlewoods Cup and one Fairs Cup in Nick's 25 years with them. Eight
moments of fulfilment to set against hundreds of failures. That is why the
melodramatic climax to the 1989 season, when Arsenal won the League for the
first time since 1971, was 'the greatest moment ever.' Nick struggles to
find a metaphor. Even orgasm pales by comparison: 'Maybe if I hadn't made
love for 18 years . . .'
Last Saturday I saw Spurs play Liverpool, cherry-picking like Nick's
sensible fan. It was another sunny November afternoon. White Hart Lane was
packed - that now means 33,000. After 30 minutes neither team had managed a
shot but I suddenly realised how much I was enjoying being there. I like
watching soccer, especially my old friend Tottenham Hotspur, but I envy Nick
Hornby the pain and disruption his love affair has brought him.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Sport: What the big money wants - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HER Majesty's Government handing out extra money is not a common sight these
days. The announcement this week of an immediate start to Sportsmatch, the
pound-for-pound matching of private support of grass-roots sport with public
cash, took even sponsorship insiders by surprise.
'We welcome this splendid and slightly unexpected news,' the Duke of
Edinburgh, president of the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, responded to
junior Heritage minister Robert Key at an ISS lunch.
Sportsmatch parallels a highly-successful programme in arts sponsorship. It
also offers a useful sticking plaster to the small sports, and the lower
levels of large sports, at a time when both structural changes and recession
are hitting them hard.
'Many sports that are an exciting and important part of peoples' lives today
rely for their existence on sponsorship - this is not the easiest of times,'
said ISS chairman Ian Muir, a senior marketing executive with Coca Cola.
Economic pressures are immense at both the top and bottom of sport at
present. Barclays, the bank most damaged by the property slump, announces it
will no longer sponsor the Football League. British Coal turns its back on
the traditional coalfields of Rugby League. British Steel concede that it
would have liked to pull out of the round the world yacht race it is
backing.
At the other end of the spectrum the Sports Council reports that local
authorities spending around Pounds 230m on sport in 1991-92, are projecting
a figure of only Pounds 140m for 1992-3. 'A large number of sports have
already approached us for help and we're not sure if we can,' said an SC
spokesman.
Oddly enough, this is not a shrinking market. RSL, the research leaders in
this area, makes the point that allowing for inflation of around 4 per cent,
the real spend in UK sports sponsorship will stay at about Pounds 250m for
both 1991 and 1992. What is occurring is a massive 'bunching' at the top end
of the market. Even disregarding its Pounds 304m Premier League deal from
satellite television, rafts of money surround British soccer's top echelons.
RSL reports that of Pounds 30m-worth of new deals signed in January-July
1992, Pounds 22.6m related to kit deals with three soccer clubs: Aberdeen,
Rangers and Manchester United.
'These new kit deals, particularly in soccer, have now become so large, that
they will now be noted separately when market figures are estimated,' notes
RSL drily.
An example of the inflationary pressures in this sector is the Liverpool
strip. Candy paid around Pounds 300,000 last season for players to advertise
its wares. Carlsberg, the new shirt-sponsor, now pays over Pounds 1m.
Golf is proving similarly recession-resistant. Prize money of Pounds 25m is
likely to be on offer on next year's Volvo European Tour, an increase of
around Pounds 2m on this year. In 1992 even players ranked below 50 in the
Order of Merit were winning over Pounds 100,000 in prize money.
The key to this is the explosion of sport on television, particularly
satellite. For the big sponsors with consumer brands the line between
advertising and sponsoring is increasingly blurred. Turning a soccer player
into a moving billboard is good value if millions of people watch the game.
According to motor racing correspondent Norman Howell, the key reason why
Formula One is able to soak up Pounds 1 of every Pounds 3 spent in sports
sponsorships - a staggering total of over Pounds 82.5m - is that it is still
cheap.
'The companies simply divide what they spend by a worldwide viewing audience
of billions,' observed Howell. 'If you have a global brand it is still
cheaper than most other forms of advertising.'
However, most sports do not get on television. Or if they do they do so only
rarely. According to Sports Marketing Surveys, badminton, an
increasingly-popular participation sport got a total of 35 minutes airtime
during 1991: 0.02 per cent of all sport broadcast on terrestrial channels in
the UK.
The economic terror of not being on television causes some odd situations.
Today England's netball team plays New Zealand at Wembley Arena. In the
netball world it is the equivalent of the Cup Final and will be broadcast
live on BBC and in New Zealand.
However, the All England Netball Association could not find a sponsor for
the three-match series and faces a Pounds 12,000 bill for production costs
involved in broadcasting the second and third games. All second-tier sports
are engaged in increasingly frenetic quadrilles to make sure that they get
some portion of their activities on television. In London this week the
annual conference of the International Yacht Racing Union has been far more
involved with desperate attempts to modify Olympic sailing with an eye to
TV, than with the more usual fare of port v starboard and pink gins.
Yet television is turning its face away from these smaller sports;
professional in attitude and healthy in numbers, if not in finance. What
technology now permits, and an international electronic swapshop makes
possible, is to see the best, day or night, wherever in the world they are
performing. But, and it is a big but, the best will be those performers in
sports with a huge spectator base.
'The big well-established events in the major sports are still selling their
sponsorships at or near the asking price,' said John Taylor, a partner in
Taylor Craigie International and the man who brought Canon into soccer. 'But
grass-roots sports sponsorship is an absolute nightmare. Impossible to
sell.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Computing: Pleasures of working in free form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN J BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY ONCE in a while you come across a software package that has you hooked
as soon as you use it. This happened to me in the space of a few days after
I received a copy of Info Select in the post.
Info Select is a special type of database - called a free-form database.
Many top-marque database programs such as dBase, Paradox and DataEase, offer
excellent retrieval methods for data conforming to a particular structure.
But, much of the information we gather day-to-day has no structure and it is
for this type of data that a free-form database is needed.
Info Select allows you to create a file with data on all manner of different
subjects. Each individual note is held within its own window. The windows
are in many ways like an electronic Post-It note but with an ability to
record approximately 5,000 words (to typed pages) on each note and to keep
up to 64,000 of these notes together in one file or stack. The only overall
restriction is the amount of memory available in your computer.
If Info Select only recorded notes, then it would have no significant
advantage over other word-processor and notepad applications. What makes
Info Select so useful is that it can search all those notes for particular
words and present you with a subset of the windows to browse. It is not
restricted to finding just one string of characters. A feature called neuron
searching allows several unconnected strings to be requested. Info Select
will find all the windows with the best fit. Perhaps you specify five words
to look for and no window has all five. The neuron search will retrieve
those windows with any four of the five strings suggested.
If you are the sort of person whose telephone hardly stops then, as you are
talking to your contact, you can type pertinent notes of the conversation
into a window. It may be an inquiry from a potential customer who,
initially, just requires literature on your product. A couple of keystrokes
will date-stamp the window and then you can type in his name, address and
telephone number, the literature he requires and any other things of note.
When he rings off you can carry on with what you were doing. Near the end of
the day you ask Info Select to print all notes with that date and then get
on with replying to all the enquiries. Two weeks later the same person
phones and within seconds you can find their last inquiry. They will be
impressed. You have remembered them by name and what you discussed. This
type of personal service gives customers confidence in ordering from you.
There are a myriad of uses for Info Select in a business environment but
what about in your private life. You may be a keen gardener and glean
information from various newspaper and magazine horticultural features. You
may have made notes on all the different plants in your garden when suddenly
your roses are plagued with greenfly. All you would have to do is ask Info
Select to get all the references relating to roses and greenfly, or aphids,
and, almost instantaneously, you will be presented with the windows
containing those words to browse through. It would be a subset of the
complete gardening file.
Info Select may be used as a word processor. As you would expect it does not
have the sophistication of Microsoft Word or Wordperfect. But, it can create
everyday letters, memos and similar documents with ease and, because of its
underlying database nature, it has sophisticated mailmerge features. It can
also work with the more structured data of a normal database. Setting up
your own data entry screens is simple. So if, as I intend to do, you wish to
set up a file on articles culled from newspapers and magazines you can
combine the structured nature of a bibliographic database with the free-form
nature of notes.
Info Select does not need sophisticated computer equipment to run - I have
used it on an Amstrad 1512. It does need a hard disk if you are to use it
with any seriousness, though it can be run on a twin-floppy machine. The
program operates as a TSR (Terminate Stay Resident) so if you are working on
your accounts a simple keypress - the default is Alt-J - will call Info
Select, where you find the information you require, and a second similar
keypress will return you to your accounts package at the point where you
left off.
The first thing I ask of a software product is: 'Does it fulfil my need?'
and secondly 'Is it easy to use?' Info Select meets both these criteria in
capitals.
The software comes with a good manual, an on-disk tutorial, and context
sensitive help via the normal Fl key. A Windows version is available from
Monday.
Info Select costs Pounds 99.95 plus Pounds 24.54 for VAT, post and packaging
from First Hand Software, Manor Studios, Maningford Abbots, Pewsey, Wilts,
SN9 6HS tel-0672-63163 fax-0672-64301.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A house in trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM the trustee for the estate of my wife's father who died in 1971. The
family home, which is the sole asset, is left to be divided between the two
sisters upon the death of the stepmother who has lifetime use of the
property.
If the stepmother wishes to move from the house the proceeds must be shared
three ways. What will the position be regarding capital gains tax if and
when the house is sold.
As you will see from the free pamphlet CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses),
obtainable from tax inspectors' offices, the trust should escape CGT by
virtue of section 103 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979:
'Sections 101 to 103 above shall apply in relation to a gain accruing to a
trustee on a disposal of settled property being an asset within section
101(. 1) above where during the period of ownership of the trustee the
dwellinghouse or part of the dwellinghouse mentioned in that subsection has
been the only or main residence of a person entitled to occupy it under the
terms of the settlement, and in those sections as so applied
(a) references to the individual shall be taken as references to the trustee
except in relation to the occupation of the dwellinghouse or part of the
dwellinghouse, and -
(b) the notice which may be given to the inspector under section 101(5)(a)
above shall be a joint notice by the trustee and the person entitled to
occupy the dwellinghouse or part of the dwellinghouse'
It is a surprising that this was not explained to you by the solicitors: the
law on this point has not significantly altered since the introduction of
CGT in 1965.

<TEXT>
MY AUNT owns a property, part of which is rented under a controlled rent.
The rest is vacant. The council has served a repair notice on the property,
and has offered a mandatory grant towards the repairs, provided she keeps
the property for five years.
1) If the property is sold after five years, could she claim the cost of all
the repairs against CGT, or only the net cost taking account of the grant?
2) Does it make any difference whether she pays for all the repairs herself
and separately receives the grant, or whether the council and she each pay
their share to the builder?
3) Can all the repair cost be deducted against income tax or only the net
cost?
1) On the bare facts outlined, none of the expenditure will be deducted in
calculating the chargeable gain. Ask your tax office for the free
introductory pamphlet to CGT - CGT14.
2) No.
3) Only the net cost. The extent to which the net cost of repairs to the
vacant part will qualify for income tax relief depends upon facts you have
not supplied. Relief should be available if the vacancy is merely an
interval between lettings.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT is the position regarding Capital Gains Tax on the sale of chattels
with a predictable life exceeding 50 years, such as antiques?
If the sale price (before deduction of auctioneer's commission etc) does not
exceed Pounds 6,000, there is no CGT to pay. If the indexed cost exceeds the
proceeds, the allowable loss is calculated as though the sale price (before
commission etc) had been Pounds 6,000. There are rules for sets of articles,
eg the Pounds 6,000 limit would apply to a pair of candlesticks - not to
each candlestick separately.
Where the sale price (before commission etc) exceeds Pounds 6,000 the
chargeable gain is restricted to 166 2/3 per cent of the excess of that
price over Pounds 6,000, if that suits the taxpayer. This can give a high
marginal rate of CGT where chattels are sold at auction.
Suppose a 40 per cent taxpayer has an antique with an indexed base cost of
Pounds 5,000 and it is sold at auction, subject to commission at the rate of
11 3/4 per cent (inclusive of VAT). If the bidding stops at Pounds 6,000,
the owner will receive Pounds 5,295 and will be exempt from CGT; but, if the
bidding continues to say Pounds 6,300, so that he receives Pounds 5,559.75
from the auctioneer, there will be a CGT bill of Pounds 200 to meet (40 per
cent of 166 2/3 per cent of Pounds 300) on the extra Pounds 264.75 - an
effective marginal rate of over 75 1/2 per cent.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A plan for pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRIEND worked part-time without contributions to an occupational pension
for several years to April 1987. From 1984 to 1987 she made contributions to
a personal pension, and backdated contributions to 1977. She received
refunds from the Inland Revenue. The amounts varied but were always far less
than the maximum permitted.
She ceased the payments to the private pension in 1987, when her employer
gave her a full-time job with a pension. Recently her employer has given her
the chance to contribute extra to backdated her occupational pension over
some of the years for which she has already contributed to a personal
pension.
Should she or her employer approach the Revenue?
As she did not use the full allowance for her personal pension can she
either:
(a) make up the balance through the occupational scheme and, if so, is the
limit the same as for the personal pension, or,
(b) could she refund the tax rebates received from the Revenue for her
personal pension and have her occupational pension back-dated to the full
extent allowed?
Presumably your friend is being given the option to pay additional voluntary
contributions (AVC) under her present scheme. Neither your friend nor the
employer need to go back to the Revenue in respect of past benefits because
its rules are clear on this. Your friend can get relief from AVCs so long as
the total of her ordinary scheme contributions plus AVCs does not exceed 15
per cent of her taxable earnings from the job.
However, if she pays AVCs at the maximum rate and this produces a total
pension in excess of the limits then the excess would be refunded less tax
when she retires. Given the substantial amount of unpensioned back service
this is unlikely, but most pensions department will do a rough calculation -
which must include personal pension / self-employed annuities - for a member
who wishes to pay AVCs.

to cover his studies. 'I saw him all right for books,' she says, 'and he
taught me the basics of his trade. I always reckoned I got the best of the
deal.'
She was not particularly interested in jewellery, but says: 'I realised
fairly early on that I have a feeling for silver. I moved towards things
that people hold, and that led to table pieces.'
She is from a family of engineers and was fascinated by the working tools
available. 'I learned much of what I know by reading the tool catalogues.
I'd once toyed with the idea of being a dentist and dealing with the
precision tools.'
Now she works as a silversmith which, after philosophy and probation work,
is her third career.
She was a probation officer for 16 years. 'I think there's a limit to how
long you can be a practising social worker,' she says. 'It's quite stressful
and it's rapidly changing.'
She has been selling her silverware since 1985 when a confident friend from
New York told her she should. She marched into a store on Madison Avenue and
displayed it.
'They referred me to another store. So the first collection I made was for a
store on Madison Avenue. That began to convince me that silver was the right
thing to do. It was not just my friends being polite.'
She has a university job, sorting out placements for social-work students.
But she borrowed from the bank to make silverware her main business last
year when she set up a partnership with Janet Ford, also embarking on a
third career after medical physics and running a victim-support scheme.
Janet is a woodworker, and both have workshops in the Merrimans' big old
house on Lancaster Marsh. Philippa's husband, Dr Marcus Merriman, is a
senior lecturer at Lancaster University.
The combination of silver and wood gives Philippa and Janet a market niche
and also enables them to fight the recession by making items more cheaply,
since wood is a cheaper material.
'When Liberty's is saying that the optimum price per item is about Pounds
30, that really makes it very difficult,' says Philippa. 'We make wooden
bowls with silver decoration, silver serving pieces with wooden handles. We
have moved into silly things like dice with silver spots. We have some wood
and silver cutlery which is very popular. A number of people are prepared to
fork out Pounds 450 for a place setting.
'There are one or two things that go and go: silver chopsticks with wooden
knobs, tea strainers, salt dishes. What tends to happen is that people say:
'That's nice. I would like it done a bit differently'.
'It has been stimulating working with somebody else. Sitting by yourself can
get tiresome.'
They do not need to keep a stock of silver because they can get an order
delivered within 24 hours; but they have to keep some completed work to show
clients.
'We're stuck between two stools. We want to get rid of our work as quickly
as possible but we need something to show people.'
They have found four stores in New York that sell their products, one each
in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Edinburgh, two or three in London.
Philippa is making a plate for the National Silver Collection, which
supplies British embassies.
Merriman reckons that they can only make goods worth about Pounds 30,000 in
a year without going over to factory methods 'and that is not what either of
us gave up our other jobs for.'
They were going on nicely until, a few months ago, one or two customers went
out of business, owing them money.
'Janet has been our salvation with wood because it cuts down the cost of
materials. We are able to produce things of good design and quality and
individuality and within a price range that seems acceptable at the moment.
'We are hanging in, waiting for better times.'

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: A hand for homeowners - A new scheme
to help hard-pressed householders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS caught in the 'negative equity' trap have a better chance of
escape after the launch of two schemes from the Woolwich, the country's
third largest building society, this week.
Up to 1.5m people are estimated to own homes worth less than the value of
their mortgage. This has combined with a shortage of buyers and an estimated
70,000 repossessed houses to deepen the inertia of the housing market.
Those with negative equity cannot afford to sell their homes because they
would be left with an outstanding debt to pay their lender.
The first Woolwich scheme (Parent Line) will benefit householders whose
parents have substantial equity in their own homes and are willing to use
this as security for the new house their child wants to buy. John
Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, called the
scheme 'the most innovative so far.'
The scheme allows up to 60 per cent of the value of the parents' home to be
used as security for the extra loan required by their child.
Interest rates on the loan would be the same as the prevailing mortgage
rate. The increased mortgage payments would be borne by the child but the
parents would be named as the borrowers. This means that should the child
default the parents will be responsible for mortgage payments. Woolwich says
that they will only make this scheme available to children whose income is
high enough to cover their increased payments and who have a perfect record.
However, parents are advised to take independent legal advice before taking
on the scheme.
Woolwich says about 10 per cent of its 500,000 borrowers have negative
equity but it cannot estimate what proportion may take up the scheme, since
many may not need to move at all and others may not have parents able and
willing to help.
Halifax, the UK's largest lender, said it did not plan to introduce a
similar scheme, preferring instead to deal with mortgage problems on a
case-by-case basis. 'Each individual society is taking its own way to perk
up the market,' said the society. Abbey National also said it had no
specific plans but Nationwide said it was working on a scheme similar to the
Woolwich's.
'Negative equity is the bane of the housing market,' said Peter Robinson,
managing director of Woolwich. 'The problem is too complex and individual
circumstances too diverse for it to be totally solved with one scheme. What
is urgently required is government intervention to jolt the market into
action.'
Last month, the government attempted to address the problem of negative
equity with two new measures. It raised the amount which building societies
are allowed to lend on an unsecured basis from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds
25,000. It also allowed the security of one house to be exchanged for
another against the original mortgage loan, without the loss of mortgage
interest tax relief.
The first measure is unlikely to appeal to most people. Those who are
already in debt will be reluctant to increase their borrowings, particularly
on an unsecured basis since interest rates will be higher. Building
societies themselves are also unenthusiastic about the prospect of
increasing their exposure to potential bad debt. A spokesman for Woolwich
said one reason it had devised its schemes was because the idea of lending
on an unsecured basis did not appeal to it.
The second scheme from the Woolwich is called the Mobility Mortgage, aimed
at those who do not want to increase the size of their mortgage but want to
move.
Homeowners can move house and transfer their mortgage to the new property,
as long as the value of the new home is the same or less than the one being
sold.
Take someone with a Pounds 100,000 loan on a house in Ashford, Kent. The
borrower needs to move to Bristol but cannot afford to sell his home because
it will only fetch Pounds 85,000 and he cannot pay off the Pounds 15,000 of
negative equity. The Mobility Mortgage allows him to buy a house in Bristol
for Pounds 85,000 and transfer the Pounds 100,000 loan to it with no loss of
mortgage interest relief.
The Woolwich says the schemes are only available to borrowers with an
'impeccable' payments record.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Ripples of uncertainty disturb
annuity market / A look at a controversy over the best way for pensioners to
handle a potentially costly investment decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CONTROVERSY has hit the normally tranquil market for annuities, the products
which convert capital into income for the elderly.
The problems can be traced back to Black Wednesday, September 16, when
sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. The initial assumption
of gilt traders was that inflation was likely to increase over the
long-term. Prices of long term gilts fell (because their repayment values
would be eaten away by inflation), and the redemption yields of such gilts
rose.
Annuities are almost totally dependent on the yields from medium and
long-term gilts, so some impact on annuity rates seemed inevitable.
But more than a month later, movements in rates, where they have occurred,
have been downwards. Why is this?
In spite of an effective devaluation, demand for gilts, usually strong in a
recession, has been pushed up by the uncertainty of recent weeks, and by the
cuts in short term interest rates. Long gilt prices reversed their original
post-Black Wednesday decline, and yields have accordingly dropped.
This trend has started to translate into lower annuity rates in the last
week, with cuts in rates from competitive companies such as Pearl and
Equitable Life. Canada Life and Generali, which also specialise in
annuities, shaved their rates last week.
The chart, provided by Sage Annuities, demonstrates the trend. Sage expects
the trend in annuity rates to continue downwards for the coming months.
But others disagree about the long-term. There are two schools of thought.
Some believe the initial post-devaluation fears of rising inflation will
return. Long gilt yields and thus annuity rates will rise. Others expect
further base rate cuts, designed to boost the sluggish economy, will cause
gilt yields (and annuity rates) to fall.
Brian Hurl, of Norex Pensions, says: 'Annuity rates may edge down slightly
in the short term. But comparing now with 12 months' time, I think we could
see a slight rise.'
In the light of all this confusion, what should those contemplating buying
an annuity do? Remember that annuities come in two basic forms:
Compulsory Purchase Annuities - which are purchased with the proceeds of a
pension fund when you retire. By law, the bulk of the fund built up in a
personal pension plan must be used to buy such an annuity. Because they are
regarded as your main source of income, the tax position for these annuities
is less favourable than for:
Voluntary Annuities - which can, in general terms, be bought with any
capital not directly derived from a pension fund. The rule here is usually
to wait as long as possible until buying, because the older you are, the
higher the annuity rate you will receive.
In both cases, you will receive a fixed income until you die. If you die
early, then the life office will keep the capital (unless you have arranged
some form of guarantee, which will cost money), while if you live a long
time, the office will be obliged to keep paying you the money. So you are
effectively taking a punt on how long you will live.
You are also taking a view on the rate of inflation for the rest of your
life. It is possible to buy annuities which are linked to the retail prices
index, or which escalate at 5 per cent per annum, but they will offer a
lower starting level of income. According to Norex, Standard Life have left
level and escalating annuities untouched since Black Wednesday, but
RPI-linked annuities have been cut four times - a move which speaks volumes
about what actuaries expect to happen to inflation.
The orthodox view is that you should wait as long as possible before buying
pension annuities so that your fund increases, and your extra age means a
greater annuity. But if annuity rates are set to fall further, it might be
best to lock in to current yields. So an early retirement might be tempting.
Savers should think carefully before taking this step - particularly if they
have a with-profits pension policy with penalties for early surrender, as
this could damage the value of their retirement fund. A misjudgement in
timing of a few months can make a big difference to the income you receive
for the rest of your retirement.
The vogue, inspired by uncertainty surrounding the gilts market, is for
'staggered vesting.' This takes advantage of the fact that you do not have
to take all your pension at once. Instead, once you have reached retirement
age, you can take a portion of your fund and buy an annuity with it (along
with taking some tax-free cash), while leaving the rest of the fund to
carrying on accumulating.
Several advisers, such as Towry Law, accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, and
stockbrokers Albert E Sharp offer plans for 'staggered vesting'. Mark
Bolland of Chamberlain De Broe says it is a 'sensible way to hedge your
bets', and suggests that it should be retained as an option even when
markets are less uncertain.
However, Billy Burrows, of Sage Annuities, says quotations usually assume
that annuity rates are constant, when in practice they will rise or fall
according to market conditions. If annuity rates fall the advantages of
staggering could be wiped out, he warns.
He says: 'Rather like currency mortgages, they look good on paper, but the
trick is with ongoing advice and management of annuities. If the timing is
wrong the client will lose out.'
But this does not mean you should rush to retire early.
The possibility of higher returns next year means that you should not bring
forward your retirement drastically just to try to catch annuity rates while
they remain high.
Staggered vesting should enable you to avoid the worst of this dilemma -
there is no need for the retirement annuity purchase to be a
once-and-for-all decision.

BOXMORE International, the Northern Ireland-based packaging group, has
enjoyed a strong share price performance over the past two years. Indeed,
over the last 12 months, the shares have outperformed the market by 80 per
cent. Robert Campbell, finance director, has sold 60,000 shares at 187p but
this still leaves him with 600,000 shares.
Over the last two years, Greenalls Group has moved away from its traditional
brewing base to become more involved with hotel management. The current
rights issue is aimed at providing funds for the group to expand by
acquiring hotels at depressed prices. The sales indicated in the table are
the nil-paid shares and the proceeds will be used towards taking up the
rights.
The share price of hotel operator Friendly Hotels has been in decline
throughout the year. Henry Edwards, chairman and chief executive, bought
100,000 of the 7.5 per cent preference shares at 66p. He bought a further
50,000 preference shares and 50,000 ordinary at 94p, but both purchases were
made for a non-beneficial holding.

FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: The five-year curse is lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT and investment trusts have finally rid themselves of the burden imposed
by the October 1987 crash on their five-year performance figures.
The effect is dramatic. Over the five years to October 1, the average unit
trust fell by 4.8 per cent and the average investment trust rose by a measly
0.02 per cent, according to Micropal. But during the five years to November
1, the average unit trust rose by 40.1 per cent, while the average
investment trust holding grew by 37.6 per cent.
The change is good news for unit trust managers trying to market their
funds; they have to produce five-year performance figures in their
promotional literature. But even after the shift, an investor might well
have done better in a building society. Someone who deposited Pounds 5,000
in Halifax's 90-day Xtra account would have earned, after basic rate tax,
50.5 per cent over the same period.
Performance figures may be meaningless. Few private investors will have been
bold enough to buy unit or investment trusts at the start of November 1987,
when the financial system seemed to be in chaos. The peak period for unit
trust sales will have been in the summer of 1987 - before the crash.
It seems even less likely that many investors will have chosen the best
performing unit trust over five years, Gartmore Hong Kong. In November 1987,
the reputation of the Hong Kong stock exchange had been severely dented by
the closure of the market in the wake of the crash.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to see which areas investors should have
favoured five years ago. The tables show the best and the worst sectors over
the period. The best returns were offered overseas - in the Far East, North
American and Europe. The worst returns were achieved by one of 1987's
fashionable sectors - UK smaller companies.
In the investment trust sector, it is encouraging to see the big general
trusts showing good figures. Over five years, the average international
general trust rose 79.1 per cent (mid-price basis with income reinvested).
Law Debenture is top of the sector over three, five and 10 years; Foreign &amp;
Colonial, the biggest trust, is fourth (out of 18) in the sector over five
years, with a gain of 103.6 per cent.
Perhaps the most startling contrast is in the venture capital sector, where
Pounds 100 invested in Candover has grown into Pounds 281.30 over the last
five years; the same sum invested in Sumit has shrunk to Pounds 22.37.
But how much attention should investors pay to performance figures? It is
difficult to predict which fund manager will have the magic touch. That
makes the arguments in favour of tracker funds, which aim to match the
performance of a given stock market index, all the more compelling.
One final statistic adds weight to this argument. The Gartmore UK Index,
which tracks the FT All-Share, has no initial charge and a 0.5 per cent
annual fee, is third out of 86 funds over three years.
