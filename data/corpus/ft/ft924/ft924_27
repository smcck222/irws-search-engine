SEVERAL Caribbean governments are seeking to stop a shipment of plutonium
through the region, despite Japanese assurances that the load is not
dangerous.
The members of the Caribbean Community say they will try to get the support
of the United Nations for a ban on shipments of plutonium and other
radioactive materials through the Caribbean Sea.
The governments claim the planned shipment, from Cherbourg in France on the
3,800-tonne Japanese vessel the 'Akatsuki Maru,' is the first of several to
Japan over the next eight years. It will pass through the Caribbean 'in a
few weeks,' according to environmentalists, followed by 38 more shipments
from Europe to Japan, where the plutonium is to be used in fast breeder
nuclear reactors.
The Japanese government has said that the ship carrying the plutonium will
'meet or exceed' all international standards for safety, and the shipment
will not threaten the marine environment.
The decision not to announce the planned route of the ship was to avoid a
possible hijacking by terrorists, Tokyo said. There was no indication of
when the ship would pass through the region, as the statement said only that
it will be 'in autumn of this year,' and that it will be escorted by an
armed vessel 'capable of continuously monitoring the neighbouring sea area'.
Governments in the region appear not to have been mollified, and say they
intend to ask the UN to have the Caribbean declared a nuclear-free zone for
the purposes of shipment, storing or dumping of material.
The ship has already been banned from the territorial waters of several
countries, and the cargo has raised concerns of governments of some states
along likely alternate routes.

SHINING Path guerrillas yesterday killed a colonel of Peru's anti-terrorism
police in what appeared to be a retaliatiory attack for a humiliating video
of rebel chief Abimael Guzman made after his capture, police sources said,
Reuter reports from Lima.
Five guerrillas shot Colonel Manuel Tumba in the head and back as he left
his apartment in the Surquillo district of Lima, according to police
officials. Col Tumba was administrative chief of the anti-terrorism police
(Dincote) and former head of counter-insurgency agents known as the Delta

AITKEN HUME International, the banking and fund management group, reported
profits of Pounds 871,000 before tax for the six months to September 30.
This compared with Pounds 2.57m last time, or Pounds 950,000 on a
like-for-like basis after allowing for a pre-disposal contribution of Pounds
1.11m from the Bachmann Group, a Guernsey-based financial services company,
which was sold in March this year.
Profits were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 266,000, including a
Pounds 172,000 provision against future settlements of stock options for
management of the NSR offshoot in the US.
The previous outcome took in an exceptional credit of Pounds 510,000
following a refund of surplus funds from the UK pension scheme.
Fund management in the US lifted profits to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.06m) but
UK and Channel Islands banking again lapsed into losses with a deficit of
Pounds 71,000 (profit of Pounds 252,000), having incurred losses of Pounds
635,000 in the last full year.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.83p (3.25p). The interim dividend is passed
reflecting the need to conserve the capital base of the banking group, the
company said. The previous year saw an interim of 0.5p but the final was
omitted.

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wrapping up to brave tepid flotation waters
 -A mechanism designed to guard against disappointing retail demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOTATION market has tentatively reopened after the summer pause. Yet
the mood is still fragile after the series of issues in the early summer
which were labelled flops when retail demand dried up.
One new issue expert goes as far as saying that the market is 'hibernating'.
And some corporate financiers are advising companies not to float at all.
There have been a few successful issues - such as Trinity Holdings and
Dorling Kindersley Holdings - with more in the planning stage. But already
there has been an issue pulled.
Woolcombers, the textile company, cancelled its flotation plans in September
after Black Wednesday happened between publication of the pathfinder
prospectus and the planned pricing day.
Institutional investors were simply not prepared to put the money required
into a relatively small company at a time of such volatile markets.
The delayed flotation of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, is not
expected to take place until the second half of next year because of the
absence of economic recovery.
So far no companies have followed the route of a public offer for sale,
daunted, no doubt, by the reception met by issues such as The Telegraph, MFI
Furniture Group, Taunton Cider and Anglian Group, where public offers were
undersubscribed.
Some corporate finance experts are sceptical that a public offer could work
at present. 'Only,' says one, 'if it was a very popular retail stock,
something with a strong brand.'
However, in a month or so National Express, the coach operator, is expected
to brave the market with a public sale making up 25 per cent of its issue.
The other 75 per cent will be placed with institutions on a firm basis.
Mr Jeremy Lucas, corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, National
Express's sponsoring bank, says the public offer plan reflects expected
interest in the issue from retail investors who often see the double
arrowhead logo whizzing along motorways on the group's white coaches.
Advertising for the sale has already begun on the buses.
The public issue is not being underwritten. Rather Morgan Grenfell is
planning to place these shares with institutions, who will release them
according to demand from retail investors. The distinction is subtle and the
end result the same.
This placing and clawback method is common for smaller issues, where a firm
placing is joined by a conditional placing of shares available to the public
through financial intermediaries.
Under a financial intermediaries offer members of the public can apply for
shares via stockbrokers, rather than filling in an application form printed
in a prospectus or a newspaper. The brokers than apply for shares on behalf
of their clients.
Private investors might not like this trend. The brokers may charge clients
commission, whereas applications 'off the page' involve no extra charges.
Further, not all potential investors have stockbrokers.
But the system has its supporters. One merchant banker says: 'The financial
intermediaries mechanism is the best of both worlds. Shares are not for the
man in the street. They are risky investments and the sort of person who
doesn't have a broker shouldn't be going for most flotations.'
Another confesses: 'It is a cheaper way of persuading the Stock Exchange
that you are trying to reach beyond the usual charmed circle.'
The Stock Exchange is keen that small investors should be able to subscribe
for new issues if there is sufficient retail demand. But at the same time,
it wants to keep a balance and not be seen to be only looking after the
small investor.
However, the exchange has been taking a more flexible attitude to flotations
in response to market conditions. It is concerned when a flotation is seen
to have flopped, especially if that means that the market in the shares is
weak.
Until recently a limit of Pounds 30m was imposed on the amount a company
could raise without making a public offer. Even that amount was only
possible if half was offered through financial intermediaries to the public.
These limits have now been relaxed, and sponsoring banks have been
approaching the exchange to discuss arrangements for particular flotations.
Trinity, which builds chassis for fire engines and dustcarts, was first to
take advantage of the relaxation. It came to market with a placing slightly
over the Pounds 30m level, with a quarter of the shares offered through
financial intermediaries.
That issue was priced on an evening when the market had fallen by more than
100 points. The intermediaries offer was oversubscribed and the shares
opened at a premium on their first day of trading.
Had the offer been split evenly between a firm placing and intermediaries,
then the level of subscription of the latter part would have looked much
thinner.
It is understood that in Trinity's case the exchange was happy to cut the
intermediaries' allocation to a quarter, and was prepared to see the issue
value reach Pounds 35m without pressing for an offer for sale.
The Stock Exchange has to take account of a sponsoring bank's judgment about
likely retail demand for an issue when deciding whether to insist on a
public offer. If a series of intermediaries offers were well-oversubscribed,
the exchange would have to think again about reimposing an offer for sale
requirement.
The issue by JD Wetherspoon, the London pub chain, might have been thought
to attract strong interest from the public. But the intermediaries' portion
was only 79.4 per cent subscribed, leaving the rest of the shares with the
institutional placees.
By contrast Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publishing group, saw its
intermediaries offer, which closed a day after Wetherspoon's, subscribed six
times. That left the institutions with only the shares which had been placed
firmly.
Unlike a public offer, if the full number of shares available in an
intermediaries offer is not subscribed, instead of the ignominy of having
them left with underwriters, they will have been placed.
The shares may end up in the same hands at the same price. But, as one
broker admits: 'If an intermediaries offer is undersubscribed, it is easier
to sweep it under the carpet than in a public offer.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A very tough act to follow - The challenges
facing the new Sainsbury chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY CAN a chairman have taken over a company with such a successful
recent trading record as that of J Sainsbury. But rarely will a chairman
have to run so fast just to match, let alone exceed, the achievements of his
predecessors.
Such is the privileged and challenging inheritance of Mr David Sainsbury,
who at noon on Monday succeeded his cousin, Lord Sainsbury, as chairman of
the UK's biggest grocery chain.
David Sainsbury certainly started well enough. Just two days into the job he
was able to announce a solid 19 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax
profits. And, at a competently-handled press conference, he went out of his
way to stress that there would be few noticeable changes in the direction of
the company. 'It has been a very smooth transition,' he said.
But to the company's followers, the personality and style of the new
chairman offer a fascinating contrast with that of his domineering
predecessor, who successfully guided the company for the previous 23 years
taking its annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 628m in that
time.
Quiet where his cousin was assertive, and reflective where his cousin was
impulsive, David Sainsbury brings a very different feel to the top of the UK
grocery chain.
But Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Henderson
Crosthwaite, suggests the contrast will be no bad thing.
'Both men, it seems, are carriers of a gene that makes them world class
grocers but the two personalities could scarcely be more different,' he
commented in a recent circular.
'David will be out to prove that his consultative, philosophical style will
be as good for the next phase of Sainsbury's growth as John's slightly less
benevolent dictatorship was for the group's formative years as a public
company.'
A neat composed figure who wears sensible glasses and button-down shirts,
the 52-year-old Mr Sainsbury likes to stress the continuity and teamwork at
the top of the company.
When the two cousins worked together they complemented each other well.
While Lord Sainsbury was the consummate grocer with a deep interest in the
running of the stores and the products they sold (he will continue to help
select Sainsbury's wines), David concentrated more on the financial and
analytical issues of the business - much as his father had done before him
when he was chairman and Lord Sainsbury was his deputy.
Lord Sainsbury was certainly a hard taskmaster, ready to tear employees off
a strip for shoddy store displays, but David is likely to adopt a more
consensual approach - much to the relief of some of his colleagues.
However, the sense of complementarity at the top will be maintained as Mr
Tom Vyner, who has been steeped in the company's products as a former buying
director, has filled Mr Sainsbury's old post as deputy chairman.
Nevertheless, Mr Sainsbury emphasises that while there will be no revolution
at Sainsbury there will continue to be a rapid evolution.
'Food retailing is a very dynamic and a very competitive business. It is a
market of changing fortunes. We are leaders now and it is absolutely my
intention to have a bigger lead when I cease to be chairman. But we will
only do so by changing our business. I am certain we will be a very
different business in 10 years' time from what we are today,' he says.
Mr Sainsbury sees growth opportunities in the UK for some time to come,
saying there are still 150 sites from which the company would like to trade
 -it has only recently opened its first store in Scotland, for example.
'We have always had a fairly steady rate of increase,' he says. 'We have
increased space by about 8 per cent a year over the past 20 years and that
is something we want to continue to do.
'But if we felt that we were not finding the opportunities to do that in
this country then we have already established a foothold in America with
Shaw's and may look to expand there.'
After an education at Cambridge and Columbia University in New York, Mr
Sainsbury joined the family company in 1963 holding a succession of posts,
most notably as finance director between 1973 and 1990.
His most prominent involvement in public life came from his enthusiastic
backing of the now-defunct Social Democratic Party. But he has retained a
strong interest in issues of social policy.
'We have got a tradition in Sainsbury's that we do not get involved in
politics at a corporate level. We have always had quite different political
views in the family. But there are still some issues I feel very strongly
about such as training and education, which are very closely related to our
company's business philosophy,' he says.
It is a view he intends to champion as chairman of the London Business
School, if not as chairman of Sainsbury. 'We give the bottom 40 per cent of
children a very poor education and I think there is now a lot of evidence to
suggest that this has a major impact on productivity,' he says, citing the
research conducted by Sig Prais at the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research.
Mr Sainsbury will certainly be one of the more cerebral additions to the
ranks of UK company chairmen. And after living in the shadows of more famous
members of his family, Mr Sainsbury will now stand out more clearly in his
own right.
It somehow seems appro- priate that the company's staff has now stopped
referring to him as Mr David - to dis- tinguish him from all the other
family members. From now on he is the Mr Sainsbury.

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: HK Land in fresh move on Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled Hong Kong property company,
yesterday signalled its intention to keep up the pressure on Trafalgar House
when it said it had an option to take its stake above 20 per cent.
Hongkong Land, which has a 14.9 per cent stake in the UK property,
construction and engineering group, said an investment house had entered
into an option arrangement to buy 36m Trafalgar shares on February 3.
As part of the option deal, Hongkong Land may be obliged to buy up to 67m
shares until May 3. In both cases, it would pay no more than the 85p per
share or 82p per A share it offered in its recent tender.
The arrangement means Hongkong Land is almost certain to raise its stake to
20.07 per cent. Although it could increase its stake to 29.9 per cent, in
practice it is only likely to be forced to buy another 67m shares if the
share price falls well below 85p.
However, by taking its stake above 20 per cent Hongkong Land will be able to
equity-account its holding, enabling it to book a share of Trafalgar's
profits. Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares yesterday closed at 83p and 80p
respectively.
Mr Alasdair Morrison, managing director of Hongkong Land, said yesterday he
would be looking for further board representation.
Trafalgar has already appointed Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong
Land, to its board, but has turned down a request to appoint a second
director from Hongkong Land to its board.
Hongkong Land yesterday made it clear that its main priority over the next
five months was to get another of its directors, Sir Charles Powell, to join
Trafalgar's board.
Mr Morrison described the option over Trafalgar as 'friendly'. He said
Trafalgar's board was made aware of the company's intention to enter into
the option arrangements. 'We wish to be a supportive, long-term investor,'
he said.
Trafalgar said it was relaxed about the move but is unlikely to be happy
with the ease at which Hongkong Land has been able to lift its stake after
Hongkong Land's tender offer for another 15 per cent failed.

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Burnfield drops 78p on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET value of Burnfield yesterday plummeted 47 per cent to Pounds
29.8m after the specialist maker of pressure gauges and other industrial
instruments warned on profits.
The share price fell from 165p - on a par with this summer's rights issue
price - to 87p.
Less than two months ago, directors accompanied the announcement of a Pounds
1.1m interim pre-tax profit with a prediction of increased profitability in
the second half.
For the full year, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the company's broker, had
forecast a rise to Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 1.17m). But following a sudden drop
in UK orders from mid-September, the figure has been revised to Pounds 2.5m.
The company has been reorganised by new management in the couple of years
since Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive of Williams Holdings, the industrial
conglomerate, became non-executive chairman.
It had started to grow by acquisition - Budenberg last year and Malvern
Instruments this summer - accompanied by the 3-for-4 rights issue to raise
Pounds 22.7m.
Mr Ian Staples, chief executive, said UK orders at Isopad, a maker of
heating products, had fallen by 50 per cent in September. Normally the
fourth quarter was the strongest because its products are aimed at such
tasks as frost protection, 'but the orders have not come through'.
Isopad's sales were expected to be 11 per cent down for the year at less
than Pounds 14m. This was due partly to a planned contraction in Germany,
where the recession was deepening.
Budenberg, the pressure gauge and thermometer company, had been enjoying a
steady rise in orders, but the drop in mid-September amounted to 30 per
cent. For the year, its sales would be flat at about Pounds 9m. Last year
Budenberg was only included for seven months.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Bonds: EBRD joins EdF in post-poll rush of
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development and Electricite de France
were two of the biggest names leading a rush of deals in various currencies
yesterday. Issuers had held back from tapping the international bond market
in the lull ahead of the US election.
A prestigious borrower in any market, EBRD made its debut in the Euroyen
sector with a Y35bn five-year issue. The yield spread tightened slightly to
32 basis points over comparable Japanese government bonds, from a launch
spread of 34 basis points.
The issue could be as important in strategic terms for Sakura Finance
International, which lead-managed the deal along with Nomura International,
as for the borrower. While the bond itself was widely agreed to be
successful and well executed, Sakura came in for some sniping in the market
for indulging in that traditional Japanese activity, taking a long-term
strategic view which overrides other considerations. Put simply, it is
thought to be loss-leading to develop its role as a player in the Euroyen
market.
The first post-election US dollar deals included another capped and collared
floating rate note, for EdF. The Dollars 100m 10-year issue will pay Libor
minus 25 basis points, subject to a minimum rate of 5 1/8 per cent and a
maximum of 8 1/4 per cent. This was seen as aggressively priced but EdF is
still a name in demand, even though it no longer carries an explicit state
guarantee. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said it launched the deal in response to
continuing demand for top quality collared floaters. Elsewhere, EdF is
taking advantage of continuing strong international demand for the French
franc with a FFr2bn five-year 8 1/4 per cent bond through J. P. Morgan.
The Canadian dollar sector saw aggressive issues from two classic names in
the three-year sector where demand is said to be particularly strong for
current coupon paper and attractive swap opportunities. Always a good retail
name, IBM is raising CDollars 150m over three years at 6 5/8 per cent
through its European funding subsidiary. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is lead
manager.
Some bankers described pricing of DSL Bank's CDollars 125m three-year 6 1/2
per cent bond as looking very tight at launch, but others argued that
triple-A German entities are seldom seen in this market.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Sterling rates soften
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF cuts in UK and German official interest rates continued to dominate
trading in the sterling and D-Mark money markets yesterday, writes James
Blitz.
In the sterling money market, dealers seemed to assume that Mr John Major
would win last night's vote in the House of Commons, calling for the
government to embrace European economic and monetary union.
The prospect of the UK government losing was simply not priced into trading.
Dealers said a government defeat would be followed by a sharp mark-up in
short-dated futures this morning.
However, according to one discount house dealer, a government victory would
almost certainly be followed by a reduction in base rates to accompany next
Thursday's Autumn Statement. Dealers were daring to contemplate that the
next cut will come on the morning of Friday the 13th.
Sharp volatility in the trading of the December short sterling contract
yesterday implied that dealers were divided over the scale of the cut. The
contract rose to 93.64 in the morning, continuing Tuesday's bull run. But it
later fell to 93.46, down 18 basis points on the day.
Helped by another very small shortage from the Bank of England, cash rates
moved to their lowest levels since base rates were introduced. One-month
money closed  1/4 easier, at 7 7/8 per cent on the offered side, while
three-month money ended at 7 5/16 per cent offered, down from Tuesday's 7
1/2 per cent.
In the German money market, call money eased to rates of between 8.85 and
8.95 per cent after the Bundesbank injected an extra DM3.3bn into the market
in the weekly securities repurchase tender.
Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Greenwell Montagu in London, noted
that the Bundesbank accepted only 37 per cent of bids at the lowest
allocated rate of 8.75 per cent. In her view, this suggested that the
Bundesbank was calling a temporary halt to the recent cycle of reducing
money market rates.
She thinks the Bundesbank will now wait for several weeks before deciding on
where to direct policy. Both the public sector wage round and the budget
deficit for 1993 will be decided in the next fortnight, and the Bundesbank
will take note of results there.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar trades in tight ranges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR traded in tight ranges against the D-Mark yesterday, in spite of
the political euphoria that followed Mr Bill Clinton's election as President
of the US, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks, the prospect of Mr Clinton's election has been viewed by
dealers as 'dollar positive'. The market believes that his promise to
increase government spending will probably be accompanied by a rise in US
short-term interest rates - a repetition, as some analysts see it, of the
economic policies associated with the early Reagan years.
However, a Clinton victory had already been priced into the market, and the
dollar had little upward momentum to gain from the victory declaration
itself. Many dealers are betting on a sharp upturn in the dollar continuing
into the new year. But they are unsure about the exact timing because the
incumbent does not take office until January.
A sharp dollar rise might accompany earlier than anticipated announcements
of Mr Clinton's administration, the framework of his economic policy and his
attitude on the exchange rate.
In the absence of developments the dollar only managed to rise to a high of
DM1.5743 in Europe yesterday, before retreating to a low of DM1.5555. It
finished in London at DM1.5675, up about  1/2 pfennig on the day. In New
York it ended at DM1.5690.
Nevertheless, the dollar is now some 12 per cent above the historic low
reached on September 2, and the effect of this is being felt in the European
markets. As more investors sell dollars for D-Marks, the German currency
appears to be weakening on the cross rates.
In recent days, for example, both the French franc and the Italian lira have
shown signs of a new upward momentum. The franc rose 30 centimes to a close
of FFr3.3830 against the D-Mark yesterday, in spite of Monday's cuts in
official interest rates and a promise from the French prime minister
yesterday that more interest rate cuts are about to come.
The lira also closed higher, at L852.6 per D-Mark, helped by the fact that
two-thirds of the government's emergency package has now been ratified by
parliament. There is growing confidence that the lira could re-enter the
exchange rate mechanism before the new year.
Sterling has also benefited from the dollar's strength in recent days,
rising 1 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to a DM2.4350 close in London. However, the
short-term outlook for the UK currency depended on the results of last
night's vote in the House of Commons on whether the government should move
to endorse European economic and monetary union.
Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London,
said the pound will find it difficult to re-enter the ERM in any event. The
UK's economic weakness and the cuts in interest rates would continue to
weaken sterling.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad scraps duty to boost
output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN effort to attract new and larger investors to its petroleum sector and
to arrest a decline in crude oil production, Trinidad and Tobago has changed
its legislation on the petroleum industry and is offering incentives to new
participants.
The government is repealing an oil recovery duty imposed five years ago, and
is increasing the rate of its petroleum profits tax from 45 per cent to 50
per cent.
Under the recovery duty, oil companies paid rates of 1 per cent if their
taxable income was below Dollars 5m a year, 2 per cent on income between
Dollars 5m and Dollars 15m, and 3 per cent on income in excess of Dollars
15m. According to Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, the change in
the legislation will cost the country about Dollars 35m this year. He said,
however, that this loss was a sacrifice for the longer term benefit to the
country in anticipated increased investment in the petroleum sector.
He said the government intended to provide incentives 'for increasing
activity in the petroleum sector, particularly activity which will help to
arrest the declining trend of production'.
The country needed to attract major oil companies which would be willing to
drill to depths of 20,000 feet if necessary, the minister said. 'At that
depth we are looking at costs of Dollars 20m per well, and such capital is
not available to our small companies.'
Trinidad and Tobago's crude oil production has fallen steadily from an
average of 168,999 barrels a day in 1986 to an average of 138,900 b/d in the
first half of this year.
The country's petroleum sector is to benefit from a Dollars 411m project for
secondary oil recovery and refinery expansion, which is being financed by
the Inter-American Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the
Commonwealth Development Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the
Caribbean Development Bank and the state-owned oil company.

CYPRUS MINERALS Company will temporarily shut its Thompson Creek primary
molybdenum mine in Idaho because of weak demand for steel, reports Reuter
from Denver.
The company said the mine's sales had fallen in 1992. It will reopen the
mine when it sees improvement in molybdenum prices, which have remained at a
20-year low.
Cyprus said during the shutdown it would meet molybdenum demand from
by-product output at its Sierrita and Bagdad copper mines in Arizona.

<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN IRON ore exports were down to 80.5m tonnes in the first nine
months of this year, compared with 87.3m tonnes for the same period last
year, according to figures released by the National Association of Iron and
Basic Metal Mining Industries, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
Receipts for the period were Dollars 1.8bn, compared to Dollars 2bn last
year.
The state-owned Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, responsible for 55.7 per cent of
the country's iron ore output last year, saw its sales abroad drop for the
January-September period to 52m tonnes, from 58m tonnes.
The downturn was mainly due to lower demand in Japan, Germany, South Korea,
Italy, France and other principal markets, said Mr Antonio Henrique Senise,
the association's executive secretary. He also blamed reduced receipts on
lower prices, down by about 5 per cent in comparison with 1991.
Exports were expected to maintain the same rhythm for the rest of the year,
said Mr Senise. At that rate, Brazil's total iron ore exports for the year
will be about 108m tonnes, down from last year's 114.7m tonnes.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Falconbridge to cut nickel
output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FALCONBRIDGE of Canada is to trim its nickel output by up to 15 per cent of
capacity, joining the lengthening list of producers which have been forced
into cutbacks by the slump in metal prices.
The Toronto-based company, which is the western world's second biggest
producer, yesterday outlined a number of measures that will reduce planned
1993 production of nickel matte at its Sudbury, Ontario mines to 38,000
tonnes, from an earlier estimate of 45,000 tonnes.
Mr Lars-Eric Johansson, Falconbridge's chief financial officer, said that
cuts were also possible at Falcondo, the company's ferronickel facility in
the Dominican Republic, but that no final decision has yet been made.
News of Falconbridge's action had only a marginal impact on the nickel
market yesterday. The London Metal Exchange three months delivery price
closed at Dollars 5,942.50 a tonne, up Dollars 27.50 on the day.
Inco, which accounts for more than a quarter of the west's nickel output,
began the belt-tightening among producers last month by announcing a 10 per
cent reduction in output. Several others have subsequently followed its lead
in response to stagnant demand from the world stainless steel industry and a
sharp increase in exports of nickel and stainless steel scrap from eastern
Europe.
But Mr Ray Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, said that
the cutbacks are not yet sufficient to reverse the recent slide in nickel
prices. Mr Goldie recently raised his estimate of the third-quarter supply
surplus from 13.9 per cent to 14.2 per cent. He said that Falconbridge's
cuts would narrow that gap by 0.7 per cent.
The normal two-week summer shutdown at the Sudbury division will be extended
to ten weeks next year. In addition, the commissioning of a new shaft at the
Craig mine, which was originally due to take place next August, has been
postponed for at least a year or two. Besides cutting production capacity,
the deferment will save Falconbridge CDollars 25m-30m (Pounds 13.1m-Pounds
15.8m) in spending on new machinery and equipment.
The Nikkelverk refinery in Norway, which gets the bulk of its raw material
from Canada, will be closed for seven weeks in the early summer of 1993. Mr
Johansson said that the refinery's output next year was now estimated at
'not more than' 54,000-55,000 tonnes, compared with 56,000 tonnes this year.
Falconbridge, whose shareholders are Canada's Noranda and Trelleborg of
Sweden, also said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose to CDollars
7.9m from CDollars 3.7m a year earlier. The average price realised during
the three months was USDollars 3.40 a lb, well above present prices.

LARCO, THE troubled Greek ferronickel producer, is to cut output of refined
nickel by 40 per cent from next week in response to falling international
prices.
Production at Larco's plant in central Greece will drop from about 1,400
tonnes to 800 tonnes a month. The cuts are to be maintained for at least
five months, the company said.
'Prices have gone so low that we have no alternative but to follow the big
international producers and reduce output," said Mr Nikos Kalles, Larco's
president.
'There should be no problem in fulfilling contracts in time this year, in
spite of the cutbacks, but we'll have to review the outlook for 1993 with
our customers,' he added.
Larco, a state-owned company which operates the only nickel mine in the
European Community, accounts for about a quarter of European output of
refined nickel.
The company is due to be offered for sale in the next few months under the
Greek government's privatisation programme. Credit Suisse First Boston, the
merchant bank, has been appointed to handle the disposal.

THE CREATION of a joint venture between a Ukrainian and a Jamaican company
to mine bauxite on the island is awaiting the securing of financial
guarantees, according to Jamaican bauxite industry officials.
Jamaica Bauxite Mining, a state-owned company, and Nikolaev Alumina of the
Ukraine have been negotiating the establishment of a company to rehabilitate
and work bauxite mines on Jamaica's north coast, which were closed eight
years ago, with the ore being processed in the Ukraine by Nikolaev.
Mr Vin Lawrence, chairman of Jamaica Bauxite Mining, said it was proposed
that his company would have a 51 per cent stake in the new company, with
Nikolaev holding the remaining equity. He said neither the Jamaican nor the
Ukrainian governments would be involved in the venture.
The mines, which were worked by a local subsidiary of Reynolds Metals of the
US, were closed in 1984. The venture being considered by Jamaica Bauxite
Mining and Nikolaev will need between Dollars 20m and Dollars 25m to
rehabilitate the mines. Production is projected to reach 2.5m tonnes a year
within five years.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmental costs 'may
bankrupt some oil refiners'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHTER environmental legislation on oil refiners could mean higher prices
for consumers and bankruptcies among refineries, delegates heard yesterday
on the second day of the Financial Times Petroleum and Gas conference.
Several speakers warned the costs to refiners of green regulations would be
tens of billions of dollars which oil companies could ill afford.
Mr Klaus Kohlhase, head of health, safety and environment at BP and chairman
of Concawe, the European oil industry's environmental organisation, warned
that the total cost of all potential environmental laws was Dollars 70bn to
Dollars 80bn, or about Dollars 10bn a year to the end of the decade.
'To put this in perspective, Dollars 10bn was the total for 1991 of profits
from worldwide operations for the 10 largest European oil companies. The
industry just cannot afford this investment level,' he said.
Of environmental controls already implemented or being seriously considered
by the European Community, Mr Kohlhase said reducing emissions of sulphur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides was likely to cost Dollars 1bn; controlling
hydrocarbon evaporation losses during storage and transfer, Dollars 2bn;
controlling hydrocarbon evaporation during refilling of cars at service
stations, Dollars 1bn; reducing the sulphur content of diesel fuel to 0.05
per cent, Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn; and reducing sulphur in heating fuel
to 0.1 per cent, Dollars 2bn.
Mr Kohlhase warned that in a competitive environment, there was limited
scope for passing on these costs to the consumer, and that refineries might
start going out of business, as was already happening in the US.
Mr Maurice Allion, of the European Commission's directorate-general for
energy, and Mr Yves Nanot, president of refining and distribution at Total,
the French oil company, both agreed the refining industry faces potential
spending of upwards of Dollars 60bn.
Mr Allion said oil companies' cash flow would not be sufficient and outside
financing would have to be sought. 'If I was cynical, I would say the
consumer at the end of the day will pay,' he added.
Mr Nanot warned that oil companies could not deliberately engage in
activities that harmed the development of the industry, which had made a
significant contribution to improving the quality of life.
He urged closer co-operation between the oil and car manufacturing
industries in finding environmental solutions, and between the oil industry
and the European Commission. He added that all emissions control proposals
should undergo rigorous cost-benefit analysis and be based on strong
scientific evidence. Inefficient constraints, he warned, would have a
negative impact on the refining business, with important consequences for
sustainable development in Europe.
Mr Pieter Koppenol, senior managing director of Comprimo, the Dutch
engineering company, said environmental proposals presented huge
opportunities for companies specialising in pollution control processes and
systems.
He emphasised the need to strike a balance between the environmental
benefits and energy consumption of pollution control, warning that
generating the energy required to remove one tonne of sulphur from the
diesel stream in a refinery emitted 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere.

</HEADLINE>

Prices are just managing to hold steady in Australia, though there is no
sign of any build-up in confidence. Growers are still withdrawing wool prior
to auction at times, a sign of dissatisfaction with present prices. Trade in
Europe generally, and particularly in the United Kingdom, is made difficult
by distorted and volatile currency alignments, which undermine confidence.
Dollar strength in the past two months effectively raises prices for many
users. China appears to be the best-placed economy and of major importance
as a wool buyer in Australia and New Zealand at present.

A sharp post-US electoral rally in SILVER prices to the highest point in
nearly three months sparked a turn-round in precious metals markets from
morning levels that saw gold hit its lowest fix since late August. Silver
pushed up through resistance at 382 cents a troy ounce in early Comex trade
on US fund buying and peaked near 387 cents. The move had been widely
signalled by an increasingly constructive technical picture. The expected
Clinton victory also generated hopes of an economic stimulus package for the
US economy and provided the fundamental excuse for silver's rally. GOLD,
however, remains under pressure from producer forward selling, notably from
South Africa and Australia where gold remans attractive in local currency
terms as the rand and Australian dollar have slid against the US unit.
Recent large sales of what appears to be central bank gold, have also
weighed on values. Dealers said the sales had the feel of institutional
selling.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar prices forecast to remain
in doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLUGGISH world sugar industry can expect only modest improvements in the
decade to the year 2000, according to a report compiled by the United
Nation's Food and Agricultural Organisation and the International Sugar
Organisation.
In 1990 sugar overtook coffee to become the biggest soft commodity export
earner for developing countries, accounting for USDollars 8.6bn.
Taking the UN's growth rates for the 1990s as a baseline case, the report
predicts growth in sugar consumption to average 1.76 per cent a year,
reaching 128.3m tonnes in 2000, compared with 107.8m tonnes in 1990.
Production is expected to be 1m tonnes below consumption.
In contrast to the stagnation and decline of the 1980s, trade will expand by
about 4m tonnes. But prices in 2000 will still be around 10 cents a lb in
1990 terms, after falling lower in the middle of the decade.
However, the report warns that if world income growth falls below the UN's
projected rate, 'the prospects for the remainder of the decade would be
bleak'.
In addition to growth prospects, developments in the sugar market will be
heavily influenced by activity in the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe, the report suggests. World imports will be 26.8m tonnes in the year
2000 given 'stable' production in the former Soviet Union, but only 23.7m
tonnes if the region were to achieve a 'high' production of 12.5m tonnes by
then.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outlook brightens for iron ore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST increase in world iron ore consumption is expected next year after
a difficult 1992, which has been marked by lower prices, weaker demand, high
investments and declining trade.
Government and industry representatives from 30 countries who met last week
in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, agreed that 'the worst has already passed' for the industry in
the short term.
Long-term prospects were also brighter, with the International Iron and
Steel Institute predicting an overall increase in steel consumption to the
year 2000.
The institute expects a 1.5 per cent rise in steel demand in 1993, which the
experts believe will translate into an increase in demand for iron ore of
the order of 1 per cent. This compares with a drop in world consumption of 4
per cent in 1991 to 937m tonnes and a further fall in 1992.
Despite higher demand, however, the high level of stocks and very low scrap
prices will continue to put downward pressure on iron ore prices next year.
The 1992 slowdown has reflected recession in the big industrialised
countries, especially Japan and Germany, the two leading iron ore importers.
Crude steel production in the first nine months of 1992 was down 13 per cent
in Japan and 2 per cent in Germany compared with the corresponding period of
1991.
However, the big fiscal expansion package announced by the Japanese
government last summer is expected to boost steel output from early next
year. Other Asian markets are growing strongly, especially China where crude
steel production rose by an annualised 14 per cent in the first nine months
of this year. Steel production has also been rising in the US and Latin
America.
The main black spot remains eastern Europe where crude steel production fell
by an annual 16 per cent in January-September 1992 and little improvement is
expected in the near term.
Iron ore production in the region is almost entirely concentrated in the
former Soviet Union, with Russia and Ukraine accounting for nearly 95 per
cent of output. Despite a drop of 16 per cent from 1990, the former Soviet
republics still produced 199m tonnes of iron ore in 1991, more than 20 per
cent of the world total.
After the former Soviet Union, China, Brazil and Australia are the leading
iron ore producers, while Brazil and Australia are by far the biggest
exporters.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: US long bonds fall as domestic issues fade

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER an upbeat opening in the wake of Mr Bill Clinton's victory in
Tuesday's presidential election, US Treasury prices edged lower at the long
end yesterday as many investors and dealers switched their attention away
from domestic politics.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 94
31/32 , yielding 7.675 per cent. The two-year note, however, was slightly
firmer, up  1/16 at 99 21/32 to carry a yield of 4.416 per cent.
Treasury prices were mixed overnight on foreign markets as it became clear
that the Democrats had won the White House easily, but there was some early
buying of longer- dated bonds when New York opened - the result primarily of
short-covering. That buying soon fizzled out, however, and shifted to the
intermediate and short end of the market, where the two-year gained ground.
Although the political situation was still a factor affecting sentiment  -
the new question troubling investors was who President-elect Clinton would
appoint to senior Treasury and economic posts - players began to switch
their attention back to the economy, and tomorrow's employment report for
October. The day's only economic news - a 1.1 per cent rise in September
factory orders, and the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' report on the economy
showing a sluggish rate of recovery - was mostly ignored.
UK government bonds lost up to a quarter of a point at the long end ahead of
last night's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht treaty on European
economic and monetary union.
Dealers said the gilt market appeared to be assuming a very narrow majority
for the government in the critical Commons debate.
Long-dated issues shed about a quarter of a point, with the 9 per cent gilt
due 2008 falling  13/32 to 102 1/8 to yield 8.74 per cent. Shorter-dated
gilts held up well and ended little changed on the day.
FRENCH government bonds ended slightly firmer after Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the
prime minister, said Monday's quarter-point cut in key interest rates was
not the last.
Mr Beregovoy said the strength of the French franc provided scope for
interest rate cuts, and his comments raised hopes of lower rates across
Europe. The 10-year OAT yielded 8.12 per cent, against 8.17 per cent the
previous day, and the Matif futures contract closed at 110.72, up 0.12 from
late Tuesday.
Elsewhere in Europe, long-dated German government bonds ended slightly
weaker with the market trading in a narrow range.
On the Deutsche Terminborse, long bunds dropped to 91.37, from 91.46 at
Tuesday's close, after trading in a range of 91.23 to 91.46. Medium-term
December bund futures slipped to 95.83, from 93.84 at Tuesday's close.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied at the opening on the yen's strength
against the US dollar overnight, but early gains were wiped out by
profit-taking and the market closed slightly lower on the day.
The futures contract and benchmark cash bond firmed in the morning following
the yen's rise in New York overnight, but the rally lost ground as the
dollar rebounded in Tokyo.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.68 per cent and moved to
4.67 per cent, then ended the day at 4.695 per cent after dealer
profit-taking. The December futures contract ended at 107.59 against its
Monday close of 107.57.
A senior fund manager from Fidelity Investments, the large investment
management group based in Boston, yesterday warned that the slowdown in
Germany was likely to be far worse than anyone in Germany - or the financial
markets - had yet realised, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
Mr Martin Wooller, Fidelity's UK fixed income director who manages five bond
funds, said 'Germany is about to come under a tidal wave of recession'.
Under this scenario, Mr Wooller argued that the prognosis for bunds was
extremely favourable: he predicted that 10-year bunds would yield 6.25 per
cent by the end of 1993.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Competition between Liffe and
DTB intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION between London and Frankfurt for D-Mark derivatives business is
intensifying.
Yesterday, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(Liffe) announced plans to launch a medium-term German government bond
contract early next year. The contract will compete with a similar one on
the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), and is a sign that competition between the
rival exchanges is increasing.
Liffe decided to launch a futures contract to meet demand from its members
for a medium-dated futures contract. Both Bundesobligationen ('Bobls,' or
five-year notes) and Bundesschatzanweisungen ('Schatz,' or four-year notes)
will be deliverable into the Liffe contract. So far this year, a total of
DM58bn of Bobls and Schatz have been issued.
Liffe's announcement was warmly welcomed by bund market participants, who
believe the new contract will help to improve liquidity. The London exchange
already has a three-month Eurodeutschmark interest rate future (which has an
average daily volume of 71,569 contracts), and a German government bond
(bund) future, with an average daily volume of 60,922 contracts.
'To some extent we had a gap in the maturity range - but the new contract
allows us to encompass the whole range of maturities,' said Mr Roger Barton,
managing director of business development at Liffe. Mr Nicholas Durlacher,
Liffe's chairman, said the new contract would provide greater hedging and
spread trading opportunities.
Mr Barton argues that the total volume of futures business is increasing,
and that while Liffe is competing with the DTB, 'the overall size of the pie
is increasing too'.
According to Liffe, the monthly volume of bund contracts declined from 1.87m
in January to 1.36m in June before rebounding to 2.1m in September. Liffe
has 67 to 70 per cent against the DTB's 30 to 33 per cent share of the bund
futures contract business,
The DTB yesterday welcomed Liffe's decision to introduce a Bobl contract,
saying it would broaden the market for such products. The DTB introduced its
Bobl contract in October 1991 and after meeting with what the DTB calls
'some initial scepticism', it has found increasing favour with investors.
In the past two months, average daily volume has exceeded 10,000 contracts.
The DTB claimed its clearing facilities were much quicker than London's and
would ensure it maintained a competitive edge.
While market participants welcomed Liffe's decision to launch a Bobl
contract, some point out that Liffe could lose market share with its 10-year
bund future unless it amends the contract's specifications.
Last Friday, the German Finance Ministry said there would be no further
10-year bund issues this year. The market interpreted this as a decision to
halt Federal issues while leaving the way clear for further German agency
issues, in particular from Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with the
privatisation of former eastern state-owned enterprises.
The Treuhand launched a 10-year DM10bn bond issue in September which trades
at a slightly higher yield than comparable Federal issues (see graph). This
is because the Treuhand issue is less liquid and is seen as less secure than
the Federal issues, even though it carries a Federal guarantee and has a
triple-A rating from the leading credit rating agencies.
While the Treuhand bond is deliverable into the DTB bund contract, Liffe
decided to leave its bund contract specifications unchanged for the moment.
Liffe says it is still considering whether to include Treuhand bond issues
for delivery in its June 1993 and subsequent bund contracts.
Bund market participants have suggested that if Germany temporarily stops
issuing 10-year Federal issues, leaving the Treuhand free to tap this area,
then Liffe's bund contract will become less attractive as the number of bund
issues available for delivery declines.
Liffe points out that about DM60bn of bunds are deliverable into its March
1993 bund contract, consisting of five separate Federal and Unity bund
issues.
The difference in the DTB and Liffe contract specifications has led to a
widening of the price gap between the two contracts. Before the Treuhand
bond issue, the contracts traded at similar levels. However, since the
Treuhand issue has become the cheapest to deliver into the DTB contract, it
means the DTB bund future is priced lower than the Liffe contract.

AT LEAST 10 large Indian companies, including some of the country's leading
private enterprises, aim to raise some Dollars 1bn in new equity capital on
the Euromarkets before the end of this year.
Grasim Industries, the cement, textiles and fibre manufacturer which delayed
a domestic offering earlier this year when trading on the Bombay stock
market was halted, will now enter the Euromarkets this month with a Dollars
100m issue through Citibank and Merrill Lynch.
Hindalco, an aluminium company, will also enter the markets in November,
with Jardine Fleming managing a Dollars 100m issue.
Tata Iron and Steel will raise Dollars 100m through Credit Suisse First
Boston and Citibank.
ITC, the tobacco and hotels company, will make a Dollars 80m issue through
Merrill Lynch and Citibank.
Gujarat State Fertiliser Corporation plans a Dollars 80m offer through
Merrill Lynch and Citibank.
Essar Gujarat, the iron company. is raising Dollars 100m through Merrill
Lynch and Citibank.
Bombay Dyeing, the textiles manufacturer, is seeking Dollars 100m through S
G Warburg Securities and Citibank.
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a finance company,
will make a Dollars 100m through Morgan Stanley and Citibank.
Southern Petrochemicals and Industries Corporation (SPIC), the fertiliser
and chemicals manufacturer, will raise Dollars 100m through Solomon Brothers
and Citibank.
Gujarat Ambuja Cements, the cement company, will issue Dollars 100m via
Solomon Brothers and Citibank.
India's leading foreign banks have cautioned the Securities and Exchange
Board (SEBI) to monitor the performance of shares of companies planning
Euro-issues.
This follows fears that companies may attempt to artificially inflate prices
on the domestic stock markets before pricing their Euro issues.
Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) for Euro issues are priced taking into
account share prices on the country's stock exchanges during a specified
period.
The government has discontinued the two-year lock-in period, replacing it
with a 180-day 'cooling off' period.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: DnB shares hit by deeper
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday disclosed nine-month net
losses of NKr2.46bn (Dollars 385m) - up from NKr2.33bn a year earlier - and
announced plans to seek further state cash following last year's NKr5.9bn
government rescue.
Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director, would not reveal the amount of
support the bank needed, but did not rule out the possibility of DnB not
meeting its capital adequacy requirements by the end of the year.
At the end of September, the bank's capital adequacy was 8.3 per cent of
risk-weight assets of NKr162.3bn. Norway's banks are required to meet a
minimum of 8 per cent by the end of 1992.
Mr Trond Reinertsen, head of the Norwegian Banks Association, has suggested
that banks should aim to obtain a capital adequacy of 10 per cent. If DnB
aims for 10 per cent, it may need an estimated NKr2bn to NKr3bn in fresh
capital, according to analysts.
Yesterday, DnB A shares again fell heavily, sliding by 23 per cent to a new
all-time low of NKr0.50.
Analysts fear DnB may be forced to write down the value of its shares to
zero. Mr Hvistendahl said this decision would have to be made at the annual
meeting next year. DnB said it was forced into heavier losses because of
turbulence in the money and securities markets.
It was also hit by losses incurred by Investa, a non-listed domestic
investment company, which was declared technically insolvent in September,
and by losses at Realkreditt, a subsidiary it acquired last year.
DnB made a NKr200m provision for losses incurred from Investa's holding
company. It also made a provision of NKr470m for losses incurred by
Realkreditt. For the nine-months, DnB's total credit losses were NKr497m
lower at NKr3.29bn although it is still incurring heavy property losses in
the UK.
Non-performing loans stabilised at around NKr10.3bn. Net interest income in
the nine-month period fell by NKr100m to NKr3.39bn as other operating income
declined by NKr547m to NKr1.34bn.
DnB said interest expenses in August and September rose steeply when
domestic interest rates were driven higher by the surge in Sweden's marginal
lending rate to 500 per cent.
DnB was also forced to write down the value of its share portfolio by
NKr365m and 'substantial losses' were incurred in the bond portfolio.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Record HK offer reflects
investor interest in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE extraordinary investor interest in China was emphatically underlined
yesterday when China Travel Service, a Beijing-owned company in Hong Kong,
said its offer to the public of a 25 per cent interest in a subsidiary was
411 times oversubscribed.
In contrast to other markets where new issues are failing to entice
investors, local and international investors stumped up HKDollars 150bn
(Dollars 19.4bn) to participate in an issue of 400m shares of HKDollars 1
each in China Travel International Investment Hong Kong, (CTII).
The amount of money committed to the flotation was not far short of the
capital cost of the colony's multi-billion dollar airport and related
infrastructure projects - currently delayed due to a rupture in relations
between Britain and China - and is the largest ever oversubscription in Hong
Kong. Interest on the money, which CTS has for a week, would earn it about
HKDollars 60m.
In light of the tensions between the UK and China - due to plans to widen
democracy in the colony before China's resumption of sovereignty in 1997 -
the enthusiasm for the new issue also took many local analysts by surprise.
CTS is one of the oldest Chinese companies in Hong Kong and has been
controlled by Beijing since the Communists assumed power in 1949. It opened
for business in the colony in 1928.
CTS is one of the 'four heavenly sisters' - along with China Resources,
China Merchants and Bank of China - and the second of them to float a
subsidiary on the Hong Kong market. In July, China Merchants floated a
subsidiary which was 373 times oversubscribed.
In 1991, CTS made profits of HKDollars 97.3m on turnover of HKDollars
305.8m. The company's assets are a 51 per cent interest in two theme parks
in Shenzhen, the special economic zone to the north of Hong Kong, and CTS's
freight forwarding and transportation businesses.
Mr Ma Chi Man, deputy chairman of CTS, said yesterday that CTII would be
CTS's main listed vehicle in Hong Kong. In due course it may sell some of
CTS's other assets to it.
CTS has four main operating divisions - tourism, freight transport, trading
and investment - and has ambitious plans for expansion in Hong Kong, Macao,
China and elsewhere in Asia.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Nordbanken hopes for
break-even next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACOB Palmstierna, new chairman of Nordbanken, the loss-making Swedish
bank, yesterday said he hoped the group's annual bad debt charge would peak
this year and that the bank would break even next year.
However, he said that the government was unlikely to be in a position to
sell its 100 per cent holding in the bank for a least two years.
'I think the government would be happy if it could outline a plan for
privatisation in August or September 1994, before the next election,' he
said.
The Swedish government was forced to buy out the minority shareholdings in
Nordbanken and promise financial support earlier this year because of the
bank's escalating losses.
Mr Palmstierna, who became chairman in September, said that the charge for
bad debts was likely to be SKr12bn (Dollars 2.04bn) this year, compared with
operating revenues of only SKr2bn to SKr2.5bn.
He added that the bank had received SKr10bn in new capital from the
government only two days ago.
The bank is being reconstructed. Bad loans of SKr60bn are being transferred
to a new subsidiary, called Securum, which will be demerged early in the new
year. At that time, Securum should receive an injection of another SKr10bn
of government money.
Mr Palmstierna said Securum was likely to receive further financial support
from the government.
He hopes that Nordbanken will break even next year, after the
reconstruction, and that it should return to profit in 1994. When Securum is
hived off, Nordbanken's ratio of tier 1 or core capital to assets should be
6 per cent, above the internationally agreed minimum level.
Swedish banks have been very badly hurt by an fall of between 40 per cent
and 60 per cent in commercial property prices over the past two years.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Bad times for global equity
flows - The continuing decline in trading activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the far-off heady days of the mid-1980s, there seemed little doubt that
equity markets were on the verge of going global. The slumbering giant of
the international investment world, the US, had stirred as its investors
began to look abroad for better returns than those available at home.
Nothing would ever be the same again.
Today, that vision looks increasingly simplistic, even if there are still
plenty of pundits predicting the coming of the global equity market. The
crash of the Tokyo stock market - after many foreign investors had jumped
in, guessing that share prices had touched bottom - and the volatility in
currency markets this year give ample warning of the risks that lie in wait
for international equity investors.
That global equity flows dipped in 1991, and have continued to decline
further this year, is reported by Baring Securities, the UK investment
house, in the latest of a series of annual studies of the international
share markets. The report, produced by global equity strategists Michael
Howell and Angela Cozzini, follows the pattern of similar studies produced
previously while the pair worked for Salomon Brothers.
According to the Baring study*, the value of foreign shares traded dropped
by 9 per cent in 1991, to Dollars 2,100bn. In terms of share volume, there
was a more marked 20 per cent fall. Net equity investment abroad still rose
to Dollars 100bn, though, higher than its previous peak of Dollars 92bn in
1989. The message: overseas investment is still creeping up, even though
trading activity has slumped.
Much of the foreign investment that did go ahead in 1991 was badly timed. Of
the Dollars 100bn of net buying, nearly half was accounted for by purchases
of Japanese shares, ahead of the renewed slide in prices earlier this year.
Much of this money was pulled out again as asset allocaters panicked, says
Mr Howell - missing out on the subsequent bounce in Japanese share prices.
Baring's research also indicates that foreign buying of US shares has been
particularly badly timed. When foreigners sell, prices go up: when they buy,
they fall, says Mr Howell. Last year, foreign buying of US shares was
minimal, with the only significant purchases coming from investors outside
Europe and Japan (see table).
Meanwhile, international investment emanating from some regions was very
subdued last year. Japanese investors, who had spent a net Dollars 18bn
buying foreign shares in 1989, paid out only Dollars 3.6bn in 1991. UK and
continental European investors, while remaining substantial figures on the
world stage with net purchases of nearly Dollars 40bn, nevertheless slipped
from their 1989 record of Dollars 46bn. It was left to the US to plug the
gap: it exported a net Dollars 43bn of equity capital, more than double its
1989 level.
Despite these difficulties, however, the overall trend in the nature of
overseas investment seems likely to continue. In the late 1970s, just 5 per
cent of international capital flows was accounted for by equity investment.
By last year, that proportion had leapt to 36 per cent, reflecting the new
dominance of institutional investors as providers of international capital.
Also, the fall-off in foreign share trading has been less pronounced than
the decline in domestic trading on most of the world's exchanges. That means
that, as a proportion of all share trades, foreign transactions continued to
creep up last year, to 19 per cent.
The emerging markets of Latin America and the Far East continue to attract a
large proportion of net overseas investment. In addition, Baring reports,
investors have begun for the first time to switch funds actively between
these two regions in pursuit of higher returns. While Latin America
attracted substantial equity investment in the first quarter of this year,
for instance, much of the money has since been moved across to the Far East,
says Mr Howell.
In all, the emerging markets attracted a net Dollars 14bn last year, almost
identical to the investment in each of the previous two years. In that
period, just over a fifth of net overseas share buying has been directed at
the emerging markets. If primary share issues were included, that proportion
would rise to more than a quarter.

Following Observer's revelations that a US hedge fund has been reading
Penthouse to see what President Clinton means for the American bond market,
it now emerges that US fund management giant Fidelity on occasion resorts to
an equally unorthodox approach to economic forecasting.
Fidelity's UK fixed income guru Martin Wooller believes that America is
poised for a significant upturn next year. Why? Because his brother Ed
decided to buy a car last month.
Now finance director of a medium-sized company based in Atlanta, chartered
accountant Ed, who has lived in the US for the past 20 years, is his
brother's best leading indicator. 'The last three times he bought a car, he
bought exactly one month before the end of recession,' says Wooller.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Does UK corporate affairs minister Neil Hamilton have a conflict of
interest? Along with the rest of the trade and industry department's top
team, he has been given a regional responsibility - north-west England -
which includes his Tatton constituency.
Although one of the north's most salubrious areas, Tatton is under
Manchester Airport's flight-path. Hence Hamilton's honorary vice-presidency
of the Knutsford and Mobberley Joint Action Group trying to stop the
building of a second runway. The group uses such unparliamentary words as
'rapists' when referring to the airport's management.
Airport chairman Jack Flanagan, a Manchester Labour councillor, has
retaliated by calling on Hamilton to resign either from the government or
from the action group. Flanagan says any trade and industry minister must be
in favour of the extension to the airport, now claimed to be the
north-west's leading economic generator with up to 81,000 jobs in prospect.
Hamilton denies any conflict of interest as the planning decision will be
taken by the environment department, not his own. He also says Liverpool's
Labour councillors - who want their city's under-used airport developed
instead - would support him. Who would ever have expected a Tory minister to
recruit Liverpool as an ally?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A set of threadbare underwear may seem an unlikely candidate for inclusion
among the harbingers of Bill Clinton's success, but at least one of his
helpers would claim that it brought luck to the new regime.
He is Louisiana-born James Carville, who became political director of
Clinton's campaign after engineering the first crack in George Bush's
presumed political impregnability, exactly a year ago. The breakthrough came
in Pennsylvania when little-known college professor Harris Wofford upset
Dick Thornburgh, the US attorney general, in a Senate race.
Chronically superstitious, 48-year-old Carville backed Wofford not only with
his political skills but by wearing the same underclothes throughout the
final stage of the contest.
Perhaps it was the strain of washing them every night that accounts for the
more modest magic he used in Clinton's support. He merely got out of bed on
the same side every morning this last week.
Another of his unorthodox claims to fame is his romance with Mary Matalin,
the acerbic political director of the Bush team. But behind his
idiosyncrasies lies undoubted professionalism, including an instinct for
strategy.
While Clinton was otherwise surrounded by smart people with a programme for
every problem, Carville's constant advice was to relate to the concerns of
ordinary people, to listen without necessarily answering back, and never to
stray from the fundamental campaign theme: the state of the economy.
So what's in store for him now - a place in the new administration on the
model of Hamilton Jordan who, having guided Jimmy Carter to the presidency,
became White House chief of staff.
'I wouldn't live in a country whose government would hire me,' Carville
jokes. 'I've had two experiences with the government, one was the Marine
Corps and the other is April 15 (when tax returns must be filed), and I
don't need a third.' We'll see.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: Imperative to strengthen hand of United Nations in
Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As president of CARE International, which has great humanitarian
responsibilities in Somalia, I have just returned from a fact-finding
mission to this war-torn and drought-stricken country. I have never seen
such depths of human suffering, against a backdrop of naked anarchy, wanton
destruction and total collapse of social, economic and political structures.
It is imperative that the international community strengthens the hand of
the United Nations in Somalia. Aid organisations, not least CARE
International, want to expand their humanitarian and rehabilitation
programmes. We have brave men and women risking their lives to mitigate the
suffering in the wasteland. The UN must be equipped to give these aid
workers the protection that they need. Objections by factional warlords must
not stop the UN from deploying peace-keeping forces.
Specifically, the number of troops should be increased to about 15,000.
Around 500 observers would be needed across the country. There should be
greater delegation of finance and power to the secretary-general's special
envoy and to the UN commander.
Furthermore, the special envoy should be given greater assistance to bring
about a conference as a first step towards reconciliation of factions in
Somalia. Without a comprehensive package of measures, a special 100-day
humanitarian programme the UN is seeking to put in place is almost certain
to fail.

Laudable as this is, if the DTI is serious in its concern for users of
copiers, it should also be prepared to stand up to the European Commission
as it moves (if history is any guide) inexorably towards imposing hefty
anti-dumping duties on all copiers imported from Japan.
Canon is not alone in endorsing copy plan contracts which it regards as
fair. Minolta has introduced a code of conduct for all its dealers obliging

<BYLINE>
   From L T SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One's admiration for FT contributors is somewhat dimmed by their
continued preoccupation with government U-turns.
Plans for present and future action by people and governments are always
made in the light of the information available at the time. If, after plans
are made, new information suggests that those plans are wrong, sensible
people and governments change them.
The present government has had to make many changes in policy recently for
that reason. The government's sources of information have been extremely
poor and they can be faulted for not addressing the problem sooner. However,
if they turn a corner and face a brick wall which is not on their map, is it
right to rebuke them for making a U-turn? The FT is in the information
business itself and it should be concentrating on this aspect of government

FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: Maastricht treaty contains seeds of its own
destruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER HELMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your 'A vote for Europe' editorial (November 2) lets down the normally
excellent standards of your newspaper. The answer to the question, 'if not
Maastricht, what?' is simple and clear - the Treaty of Rome and the Single
European Act, both already in place. I am talking of the Common Market
(remember the phrase?), for which the British people voted in a referendum,
the largest customs union in the world.
The Maastricht treaty contains the seeds of its own destruction, for
precious few member states will achieve the convergence criteria to bring
the single currency into effect in the foreseeable future. In that case, you
may ask, what harm to ratify it? Great harm. It is a distraction from the
real needs of the economies of Europe, a monstrous time-waster. Worse, the
Conservative party has no heart for it: neither does the nation, and nor
does Europe as a whole.
Denmark voted No, France Yes. Yet the messages from Denmark and France are
identical: there is no consensus for Maastricht. And there is none in
Germany. While a simple parliamentary majority may suffice for day-to-day
decisions, surely we cannot allow major constitutional changes affecting the
citizenship of ourselves and our grandchildren to pass in the absence of
wholehearted consent. Still less can we do so in order to save Mr Major
embarrassment in Edinburgh.
Mr Major has already found out the hard way that you can't buck the markets.
He has yet to learn that you can't buck the people either.

Sir, Regarding 'Men's club still proves elusive' (November 2), how would you
feel if you were selected the most qualified out of 250 job applicants?
Pretty good, what? Then you were told that you didn't stand a chance to be
invited to an interview. How do you feel now? - in fighting spirit, I hope.
And when you finally have the recruitment consultant pinned to the wall and
he confesses that it's because you are the wrong shape, what's your next
move?
His excuse? 'My client, the managing director, prefers to discuss business
in the john rather than in the board-room.'
Well, that managing director deserves all he gets in there, don't you think?

<TEXT>
Sir, I note the comment in your piece on schools ('Schools for free or fee:
what's the difference?', October 24) that 'boarding becomes ever less
fashionable', but presumably demand for boarding places is down (if it is)
because fewer parents at the moment can pay for them.
Your feature writers' comment is about as sensible as saying, with regard to
an area with a falling school population, that education is going out of
fashion.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: More important than getting numbers right is
reasoning and understanding behind them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL KAFKA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At the risk of being accused of 'sour grapes' could I suggest that
Peter Marsh have a word with Samuel Brittan? Impressive though the number
crunching behind his survey (October 30) of UK GDP forecasts may be, it
panders to what Brittan calls 'the profoundly misguided view that making
(short-term) forecasts is what economics is all about' (November 2).
As is their duty, the members of our economics team are ready to fall on
their swords over the inaccuracy of their predictions for UK GDP in 1991
(accounted for by a period of over-optimism in early 1990). However, I would
suggest that the survey provides a distinctly partial view of their
abilities as forecasters, let alone economists. UK GDP is merely one of the
hundreds of variables which they are involved in forecasting and by no means
the most important.
As rewarding as it must be for the winners to receive their economic Oscars,
perhaps the more obvious conclusion to be drawn from this survey is that
economic forecasting is a very imprecise art. More important than getting
the numbers right are the reasoning and understanding that lie behind them.
If the chancellor, or indeed any institutional investor, chooses his
advisers on the basis of the 'winners' and 'losers' in your survey this
year, then they risk being disappointed and surprised when next year's
envelope is opened.
Our evidence suggests that institutional investors show a more genuine
understanding of the quality of underlying analysis than is implied by the
results of your survey.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The hard part
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS not the moment to be grudging. Governor Bill Clinton has been
elected president of the US squarely and fairly. That is, the unfairness in
the campaign was directed more at him than by him. President George Bush,
with all the supposed advantages of incumbency, resorted to undignified
muck-raking in his attempts to blacken Mr Clinton's character. Mr Ross Perot
had much more money to spend. Mr Clinton won by making himself the
unchallenged leader of the main opposition party, by imposing on that party
a new direction and a new image, and by becoming the most credible spokesman
of what is clearly a deeply felt, nationwide desire for change.
His campaign was in itself an impressive feat of leadership and
organisation. As Vice-President Dan Quayle said, if he can run his
presidency as well as he ran the campaign he will be a highly successful
president.
That is, and was intended to be, a big 'if'. Mr Clinton has shown himself a
thoroughly professional politician. But that means, in essence, a person
skilled in being all things to all men, and dodging difficult choices.
Governing on the other hand involves making choices. On many points Mr
Clinton will, once in office, have to clarify his position; and in the
process he will not be able to avoid disappointing, perhaps even
infuriating, many of those who voted for him on Tuesday.
That will be true especially in the area which he rightly made the main
focus of his campaign: 'the economy, stupid'. Mr Clinton, unlike Mr Bush,
believes that government has a role to play in galvanising the economy,
notably through spending on education and infrastructure. He is deluding
himself if he thinks these plans can be financed by taxing only the 'top 2
per cent' of the population. He will have to choose whether to increase the
already yawning budget deficit or to raise revenue through broader,
presumably indirect, taxation. If he wants to make good his environmental
claims, he should in any case raise taxes on gasoline.
Similarly, Mr Clinton will not be able to implement his proposed healthcare
reforms unless he is prepared for a head-on battle with the American Medical
Association and the pharmaceutical industry; and he will not be able to make
good his reputation as a free trader without facing down powerful lobbies
within his own party, including notably the trade unions and some
environmentalists.
Foreign policy is clearly not his main interest, and the voters have shown
they do not mind that. But foreign policy too will present awkward and
unavoidable choices. Mr Clinton will have to choose between conflicting
interests, and to allocate resources for honouring US commitments and
furthering US objectives.
The ends of the president-elect, so far as he has defined them, are mainly
good. The more difficult part, which he must now set about, is finding the
means.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Trade threats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR CLINTON thinks he can set his own agenda, regardless of events, he
should think again. Come January, he will find world trade at the top of his
in-tray. He may even find his country embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war
with the European Community triggered by their five-year-long oilseeds
dispute. It is vitally important that the new administration does not
inherit so embittered a conflict. If one is to be avoided, however, the EC
will have to show more flexibility than it has done so far.
The Community is likely to regret its failure to reach an overall agreement
on farm trade with the outgoing Bush administration. Nothing suggests that
Mr Clinton will be easier to deal with than Mr Bush. He may well be still
less accommodating. Mr Clinton may, for example, try to make the environment
and fair labour standards central issues in the Uruguay Round, whereupon the
whole draft agreement could easily disintegrate. He will probably be still
more inclined towards the use of unilateral market-opening measures than
someone as instinctively internationalist as Mr Bush.
Failure to resolve the oilseeds dispute can only exacerbate those
tendencies. The US regards this particular dispute as a test case for the
multilateral approach to the resolution of trade disputes. It has twice won
favourable verdicts from Gatt panels, which have concluded that the EC
oilseeds regime discriminates in favour of EC oilseed production, thereby
impairing the value of the zero tariffs on imports of oilseeds conceded by
the EC in the early 1960s. The US has proposed binding arbitration on this,
but the EC refused.
The US is entitled, therefore, to do what it did yesterday, namely, request
Gatt authorisation for suspension of tariff concessions to the EC worth
Dollars 1bn and so equivalent in value, it claims, to EC concessions that
are judged impaired.
Even if the US is entitled to do this, retaliation must be very risky at
this delicate juncture. The threatened EC counter-retaliation would be worse
than merely risky. It could be a disaster, not least because it is almost
certainly illegal under Gatt. The US is entitled to withdraw tariff
concessions in order to balance the losses its producers have suffered.
Counter-retaliation by the EC would upset the balance once more. Thereupon a
spiral of retaliation and counter-retaliation would seem inevitable.
The failure to complete the deal on farm trade within the Uruguay Round is
more than a misfortune; it is a mistake. So is the failure to resolve the
dispute over oilseeds. But this mistake need not be compounded. So long as a
spiral of retaliation and counter-retaliation is avoided now, both the Gatt
dispute settlement mechanism and the Uruguay Round remain alive until Mr
Clinton takes over. The EC failed to prevent yesterday's US action. It must
now eschew the counter-retaliation that can only make things worse.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Popular tune but a tricky score - With the right vanquished
and the left tamed, Clinton can succeed despite a challenging agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the cold light of yesterday's dawn, it was just possible to question the
extent of Bill Clinton's triumph. His mandate by the popular vote, just 43
per cent, was the third-lowest this century, a thin underpinning to his
sweeping five-to-two margin in the electoral college, with a majority built
on states which he often carried by little more than a whisker. Even his
acceptance address late in the night in Little Rock was hardly triumphal,
sounding more like the campaign speeches that in the end came and went like
a blur. It was almost as if this most determined and driven of men had not
quite fully grasped the enormity of the fact that he really was the next and
42nd president of the United States.
But, as every football coach says, 'a win is a win is a win' and this one
offers the chance to change the fundamental political dynamic. The US once
again has a president and Congress of the same party. By giving Mr Clinton
and Mr Ross Perot more than 60 per cent of its votes, the country
resoundingly rejected the economic and social policies that had guided it
for 12 years and the man it felt had not understood why they were no longer
working. And, convincingly enough, if with its heart in its mouth, it
entrusted its immediate future to the 46-year-old governor of one of its
smallest states mostly on the grounds that he really is 'a different kind of
Democrat'.
On that score, America's confidence ought not to be misplaced because Bill
Clinton is not the identikit profligate Democrat of Republican demonology.
Far from President George Bush's claim that Clinton really loves to raise
taxes, the evidence is that he gets his kicks from cutting spending, not
surprisingly since for 12 years he has been obliged to produce a balanced
state budget. This may mean that he will not be able to do all he wants to
do - even his party in Congress might not let him do that - but it is a fair
bet now that the country has a president who at least has an agenda, a long
one, of what ought to be done.
Successful or otherwise, his will be a seriously activist, but not
necessarily radical, government. In spite of all the seductions that foreign
affairs offer every president, and acknowledging that some external exigency
might command much of his time, it will begin with a profound domestic
orientation. Its first 100 days will be bold and vigorous. There will be
weighty job creation, investment and training programmes, involving both the
public and private sectors; the explosion in the costs of healthcare will be
addressed; there will be substantial attempts to reform the welfare system.
There will be pump-priming of the economy through public works, and the
local governments of America may suddenly find themselves with federal money
to spend. There will be all these things not because there should be but
because Clinton won election by claiming, successfully, that they are all
necessary.
But that alone will not make them happen. As Walter Mondale, who ought to
know, put it on election night: 'If Congress treats Bill Clinton the way it
did Jimmy Carter, we won't be out of power for 12 years next time, it'll be
28 years.'
It is true that Mr Carter came to Washington as an outsider, though with a
vice-president, Mr Mondale himself, more versed in its ways than Senator Al
Gore. The important difference is that Mr Clinton lives and breathes
politics - he even inhales it - in a way that Mr Carter, equally sharp of
mind, equally committed to a better country, never did. Intelligent
compromise has been the hallmark of his record in Arkansas, after all.
Second, the dinosaurs of Congress may not have been rendered extinct by
Tuesday's wave of discontent with incumbents, but they have been chastened.
Some of their lives have been cut short by term limitation amendments at the
state level. The excuse to fight the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue no
longer prima facie exists. And if it does transpire, as it may well, that
the special interest grip on Congress thwarts reform, then Mr Clinton, who
knows about populism, has another weapon up his sleeve, if he can find a way
to use it.
That weapon is represented by the pure populist, Ross Perot, who got nearly
20 per cent of the vote, a remarkable performance for any independent
candidate, and the second-best this century after Teddy Roosevelt in 1912.
To describe Mr Perot as mercurial is a gross understatement and nobody has
the foggiest idea whether, having failed to buy an election with his own
money, he will stay the course and get engaged inside, rather than outside,
formal politics. But he did extend a helping hand to the new president on
election night and Mr Clinton is far too sharp a politician not to recognise
the offer.
It is not only President-elect Clinton who senses this opportunity - and the
threat posed by Mr Perot and his amorphous movement if it is not taken up.
There was the wily Bob Dole on election night, easily returned to his
Republican Senate seat from Kansas, promising that he would speak not only
for his party but for those who supported Mr Perot. Mr Vin Weber, the smart
young Republican from Minnesota who is retiring from Congress in
frustration, called the election 'a clear vote for change', which was the
specific message of both Mr Clinton and Mr Perot, and a rejection of the
status quo, which was 'all the Republicans and Mr Bush could offer'.
Mr Perot's agenda was originally very limited - to balance the federal
budget and substantially reduce the national debt. His essential policy
disagreement with Mr Clinton was only over the ferocity and means by which
both should be attacked. But, as his effort unfolded, the billionaire from
Texas also began to speak more in Clintonian terms, though with much less of
his precision, of the need to tackle structural reform, such as education,
health and welfare, and to create more and more private sector jobs.
Mr Clinton's likely Faustian bargain with Congress is to give it what it
wants initially - public works spending - in return for a longer-term
commitment to cut spending and to pursue the social agenda. If properly
conceived and presented, Congress might find it difficult to turn down.
His healthcare goals - to cut administrative costs and other waste by as
much as Dollars 80bn over four years, to weaken the hold of the insurance
industry and, if necessary, to engage in some rationing of care - sound
laudable and have indeed been endorsed by powerful elements in the medical
profession. His aim is a new universal system of 'managed' healthcare,
financed by employers and, if necessary, by higher taxes. Embracing the
nearly 40m Americans who now have no health insurance will not come cheap. A
prerequisite, he has always maintained, is stringent cost controls over
federal and state Medicare and Medicaid programmes.
The educational goals will also not be achieved at the stroke of a pen. He
wants to assure every young person of the right to post-high school
education through a national trust fund, access to which would not be denied
to higher-income families. Student loans would be repaid differently than
under the present formula, or by community service, a constant theme in his
vision of a participatory democracy. He wants a national apprentice
programme, funded by a 1.5 per cent payroll tax on employers. He believes in
choice in state education, but no preferential treatment for private
schools. He introduced in Arkansas constant testing of teacher competence
(in return for better pay) and believes it can be extended nationwide.
He frequently speaks of wanting to 'end welfare as we know it', which he
sees as 'a culture of dependency'. This means limiting the time anybody may
spend on welfare and the provision of alternative public service employment,
in sum what is known as 'workfare'. This will inevitably lead him to
calling, first, for ceilings and then cuts on federal and state welfare
expenditures, and hence to the risk of alienation from his liberal
democratic constituency (he may actually welcome such a confrontation).
What all this costs is anybody's guess - and Mr Bush's estimates are now
irrelevant. The Clinton calculation is that a growing economy, with more
people in productive work, can do the trick. This is why, as his economic
advisers were freely saying in Little Rock on election night, a job-creation
package will be the first order of business when he takes over and why the
promises of middle-class tax cuts may have to wait a while for redemption.
The new president knows perfectly well the financial markets doubt that he
can square the circle. But he will be coming to Washington with precious few
hostages to fortune and even fewer obligations to those who got him there.
His own ideology is so resolutely centrist, his own career so conspicuously
meritocratic, that he ought to be able to call on the most eclectic range of
talents. With the right vanquished for now and the left tamed, the
opportunity for the practice of a new kind of politics surely exists.
The same could apply to foreign policy, to the extent that it intrudes. Only
tentative conclusions can now be drawn but they must include the expectation
that a President Clinton will be more interested in dealing with the
European Community as a whole than with its constituent parts, which implies
some diminution of the 'special relationship' with the UK. He will probably
seek to encourage, and less to control, independent Japanese policy
initiatives in the wider arena, which could be in that country's longer-term
interests. His government will be active on the environmental front, which
can only be desirable, and more inclined to intervene in the face of gross
violations of civil liberties worldwide, though how and where is far from
clear.
But he is certainly not an isolationist and nothing like as protectionist as
many in his party. In sum, he may be a fair reflection of the present,
far-from-confident mood of the nation whose leadership he has inherited. He
was elected, quite simply, to get it on a better domestic footing and he
will be operating in the sort of altered political circumstances which give
him at least a chance of success. The challenges are awesome, the vested
interests entrenched, his own agenda dauntingly difficult, his mandate not
quite as sweeping as it once appeared on Tuesday night. Given the odds he
has already overcome, he probably would not have it otherwise.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Angola's lessons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRACY IS faltering in Africa. As authoritarian regimes across the
continent bow to international and domestic pressure, the transition to
multi-party rule is endangered by electoral fraud, undisciplined armies,
aggrieved minorities and flawed constitutions. Without tougher international
monitoring of elections, and the introduction of constitutions that
accommodate ethnic, religious and regional rivalries, democracy will remain
imperilled.
Angola's threatened relapse into full-scale civil war is the latest blow to
hopes for a fresh start, and the most serious. Renewed conflict would be
disastrous for southern Africa as a whole. But the tragedy will have wider
implications. The UN has played a leading role in Angola, monitoring the
country's ceasefire and observing the elections. Success would have
encouraged such efforts in Somalia or Mozambique; failure will reinforce
misgivings about mediation in Africa's conflicts.
Clearly the burden of blame rests with Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader,
defeated by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in the September elections.
Unita has claimed widespread electoral fraud, and demanded an international
inquiry. The vote was deemed fair not only by the UN, but also by
Washington, which along with South Africa, supported Unita in the civil war.
Mr Savimbi is a bad loser, and a dangerous one. A Unita military victory
seems impossible, but the damage it can wreak could be better contained had
the ceasefire been firmly implemented.
The demobilisation of the Unita and government armies fell behind schedule,
as did the creation of a national force drawn from both sides. The
understaffed UN monitoring team did its best, but Angola would have been
better served had the UN made clear that, without full compliance with the
transition terms, elections could not take place.
The most serious obstacle to lasting peace, however, may be the constitution
itself. The record of post-independence Africa suggests that systems which
concentrate too much power in the hands of one party lead to one-party
states. Its leaders have yet to find the constitutional formula which
reconciles democratic values with ethnic or religious loyalties, and Angola
is no exception.
The passions that Mr Savimbi can now exploit could have been defused by a
constitution offering proportional representation in the country's
executive, a decentralised government which gives provincial administrations
real power, and a revenue allocation formula that ensures that all regions
receive an equitable share of Angola's oil wealth. Rigorous implementation
and monitoring of transitions and constitutions which acknowledge African
realities would not guarantee peace. But they offer a better chance of
coping with political rogue elephants, in Angola and elsewhere.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Personal View: A losing proposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the voters in the US presidential election had been UK businessmen, the
outcome would have been very different. A recent Harris poll of European
Community business leaders showed that 70 per cent of those in the UK
supported Bush.
Is it possible that this finding is connected with President-elect Clinton's
plan to 'crack down on foreign companies that prosper here and manipulate
tax laws to their advantage'? As UK shadow chancellor Denis Healey once
promised to tax the wealthy until their pips squeak. Does the same fate now
await foreign investors in the US?
Who would be hurt by such a policy? Arguably the UK stands to lose the most
as the largest investor in the US, accounting for 27 per cent of total
foreign direct investment at the end of 1991, compared with 21 per cent by
Japan and 15 per cent by the Dutch. Democratic Senator Al Gore, the
Vice-President-elect, has warned that the Democrats plan to raise taxes on
all companies in which the foreign ownership stake is at least 25 per cent;
the figure of an additional Dollars 45bn tax from foreign-owned US
corporations over the next four years has been quoted by Clinton.
This is an enormous amount and it is impossible to predict exactly what the
consequences would be for US business under foreign ownership. But there
could be a withdrawal of foreign investment, closure of a number of
foreign-owned concerns and an enormous disincentive to new foreign
investment into the US. To put it in perspective, Dollars 45bn is almost
twice the total amount of tax collected from foreign-owned US corporations
over the entire six-year period of 1983-88.
Clinton's current proposal is to raise this additional Dollars 45bn by
stricter enforcement of existing law and not by introducing new legislation.
His main target will be the manipulation of prices at which goods are sold
from abroad to the US. He would also increase the numbers of lawyers working
on these transfer pricing cases, which would add substantially to the
already heavy compliance burden on foreign investors.
However, if Clinton fails to raise the required extra revenue, as seems
likely, will he feel obliged to bring in additional measures?
An indication of possible action that might be taken against foreign
investors can be found in a discussion bill introduced last year by
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the important House
Ways and Means Committee. One proposal was to impute profits to a
foreign-controlled corporation, based on an industry average. It is not
difficult to imagine the effect of having to pay tax on this imputed profit
for a loss-making US subsidiary of a UK parent company. At the time both US
Treasury officials and a Clinton spokesman expressed their disapproval of
this proposal, but if future tax revenues are below expectations, there
could be pressure to resurrect it.
There are a number of cogent reasons why the US should not take specific
action against foreign-owned corporations:
The US already has the most sophisticated anti-avoidance tax law in the
world. It has detailed transfer pricing rules that can be used to ensure
that imports into the US are not overpriced and thus US net income reduced.
Furthermore there are 'anti-earnings stripping' provisions which prevent
profits being taken out of the US by way of a tax-deductible interest
charge.
Any action would almost certainly be discriminatory and breach the US's
double-tax treaties, although this has not proved a disincentive to Congress
in the past.
Fear of possible retaliation. The US itself is by far the largest overseas
investor in the world; at the end of 1989 the US accounted for 28 per cent
of all foreign investment worldwide. Many countries could be expected to
consider counter-measures. The UK has made it clear that retaliatory action
 -by denying tax refunds to US companies receiving dividends from UK
subsidiaries - could be introduced almost immediately. This could cost US
companies millions of dollars.
As a practical matter the US legislative machinery is notoriously tortuous
and there must be a fair chance that any proposals could either fall by the
wayside or be so emasculated as to pose a threat to foreign investors no
longer. Obtaining information is always a problems for tax authorities, but
of all nations the US already has the most extensive, detailed and onerous
reporting requirements placed on foreign investors which undertake
transactions with their US subsidiaries. Probably the most persuasive
pressure for not taking action will come from within the US itself. Many US
states are currently doing their best to boost their flagging economies by
encouraging foreign investment, while those states which already have such
investment will not look kindly at measures which may drive foreign
investment away.
Foreign investors need to press their case immediately, but I believe they
have right on their side. It is my hope that this issue will be another case
of 'read my lips'.

Mr Heseltine was pressed by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, on reports that some of the 10 collieries not included in the
shutdown moratorium were already being stripped of equipment or neglected.
Mr Cook urged him to keep the pits working while British Coal carried out
its statutory 90 days' consultation.
Mr Heseltine said there was no market for the coal with stockpiles at
pitheads and power stations.
He added that some MPs suggested to his department that British Coal was not
honouring its commitment to care and maintenance so that if its consultation
determined the pits should stay open, they could do so.
'I have personally investigated every suggestion that has been put to me,'
he said, 'and I am satisfied on the assurances given by British Coal that
none of the 10 pits has been prejudiced should the outcome of the
consultations indicate their continued life.'
Mr Tim Eggar, industry minister, insisted that Colombia's authorities had
assured him that none of the coal it exported to Britain was mined by child
labour.

FT  05 NOV 92 / MPs press governor on BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, endured a fierce
cross-examination by MPs yesterday over the manner in which the Bank handled
supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton faced repeated questioning by members of the Treasury and
Civil Service select committee over why he or another senior official of the
Bank had not resigned over the report by Lord Justice Bingham into the BCCI
affair.
He rejected criticism of the Bank's style of supervision as 'passive and
timid', and said it needed to retain experienced officials such as Mr Brian
Quinn, executive director of banking supervision, to help it improve
regulation.
Ms Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said BCCI
showed that 'the amateurish, gentlemanly supervision that the Bank is noted
for has failed'. She asked him: 'Would not the gentlemanly thing to do be to
resign?'
An early day motion signed yesterday by 91 Labour MPs, one Ulster Unionist
and one Liberal Democrat, said it would leave Mr Leigh-Pemberton with
'neither credibility nor honour' to remain in office after the mishandling
of BCCI.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Mr Quinn and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's deputy
governor, were questioned for two hours about Lord Justice Bingham's report.
The report will be debated in the House of Commons tomorrow.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that although the report by Lord Justice Bingham,
criticised various aspects of how BCCI was handled, he 'never makes the
statement that the Bank was negligent. That is the point about it.'
The governor admitted that the Bank should not have waited until the BCCI
closure before tightening supervision.
'If you say to me we should have effected these changes earlier and of our
own volition, I would have to say yes,' he told the committee.
But he said he could not 'take absolute responsibility for every bank'.
'Banking is a tricky business: there will be mistakes, there will be bad
commercial judgments and there will be fraud,' he said.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton argued that the Bank's record in the past six years
showed it was not timid. In 35 cases, it had required banks to take remedial
action 'without fuss'; and there had been 17 cases of licences being
revoked.
He disputed Lord Bingham's conclusion that the Bank had too narrow a view of
its powers to act against BCCI under the 1987 Banking Act, saying it had
known the extent of its powers but had not thought there was enough evidence
to apply them.
Members of the committee criticised the Bank's failure in 1984 to force BCCI
into accepting a corporate structure that would have been easier to
supervise although it had debated a change for two years before approaching
the bank.
But Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he did not think he had 'the necessary leverage
at this time to force on the bank an alternative structure'. The informal
authority of 'the power of my eyebrows' would not have been enough, he said.
He insisted that although the Bank had made mistakes, none had been so
fundamental that avoiding it would have made the final outcome of the BCCI
closure any different.

THE LABOUR party has threatened to oppose any proposals the government makes
for the reform of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales if the wages
councils are abolished.
The government is expected to make a statement on Sunday trading soon, and
will need the support of Labour MPs to ensure that any reform passes through
the Commons. Many Conservative MPs oppose the extension of Sunday trading.
The Employment Department has said that it sees 'no permanent place' for
wages councils, which set minimum rates for about 10 per cent of the working
population.
There has been speculation that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment
secretary, will include their abolition in the Employment Bill, likely to be
published tomorrow.
The link between Labour's support for reform and wages councils emerged
during a meeting between Ms Joan Ruddock, Labour's voice on Sunday trading,
and Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister. Ms Ruddock said the
abolition of wages councils would undermine legal guarantees of protection
for retail workers.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Lib Dems turn fire on Labour's 'night
of fun'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN launched a fierce attack on Labour last night, accusing the
party of 'discreditable opportunism' for opposing the government motion. He
promised to support Maastricht's early ratification - not to back the
government's but Britain's future in Europe.
The Liberal Democrat leader warned that 'the cost of one night's fun for
Labour' could be tens of thousands of lost jobs. Delaying the treaty's
ratification would damage economic confidence and stem inward investment.
Amid repeated heckling by Labour MPs furious at his party's decision to back
the government motion, Mr Ashdown derided as 'legalistic analysis', the
claim of Mr John Smith, Labour leader, that the motion was one of confidence
in the government.
'If the government loses this debate tonight, will there be a general
election tomorrow? The answer is No. There will be a vote of confidence
tomorrow which the government will win because turkeys don't vote for
Christmas.
'Then on Friday morning we will wake up without a general election and with
Britain's future in Europe desperately damaged,' Mr Ashdown said.
If would not make any difference if the Commons forced Mr Major to resign to
be replaced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary - but the economic
consequences for Britain would be far graver.
If the debate had been a genuine opportunity to remove the government from
office, he said, Liberal Democrats would not have missed the chance.
Mr Ashdown said Maastricht was not perfect. He regretted the 'opt-outs' on
the social chapter and on economic and monetary union. But unless the
treaty's ratification was allowed to proceed, any future, more pro-European
government would not be able to re-instate those parts, he said.
Mr Ashdown did not receive support from other minor parties. Mr Seamus
Mallon, deputy leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour
party, signalled that he did not believe the motion was entirely about the
Maastricht treaty.
Although his party backs the treaty, the Commons was not been given a chance
to debate it 'on its merits', he said.

play a central role in Europe's development?'
John Major
'If we had any doubts about what this debate is all about, we could have it
resolved by looking at the terms of the motion. No ringing declaration about
the future of Europe, which would rally the troops under the Maastricht
banner. No declaration of any discernible kind'
John Smith
'You are seeking to hide behind Denmark and the splits in your party'
John Major to John Smith
'This debate and the ambiguous and anodyne motion upon which it proceeds has
no formal parliamentary status. It is a device; a happening; a political
event justified by the government at different times and on very different
grounds, to very different people as both expediency and the tide of war
within the Conservative party dictated'
John Smith
'By your tactical ineptitude you have provided the circumstances in which
the pro-Maastricht majority in this House can be dissipated.'
Giles Radice Labour MP for Durham North to John Major
'Today, for the sake of plaudits from some of your backbenchers, you have
forsworn your integrity. Having done that, you will find that you will never
be able to regain it'
Sir Edward Heath on John Smith
'I have to confess, however, that I don't relish the prospect of being

FT  05 NOV 92 / Frantic battle for the Euro-waverers: The two sides that
fought for the hearts and minds of Tory rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT'S vote marked the culmination of days of frantic lobbying by
government whips and leading Euro-sceptics in Westminster's ill-lit warren
of corridors and committee rooms.
MPs huddled in small groups in obscure corners. Telephone lines buzzed
continually. Unlikely alliances were consummated. Whips even acted to
postpone a visit by MPs to the Falkland Islands and St Helena.
The air of intrigue was overlaid with the scratching of pencils as lists
were drafted and re-drafted and both sides engaged in hectic
back-of-envelope arithmetic.
With expectations of a tight outcome mounting in the final 24 hours, the
lobbying of waverers by senior Tories and by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, intensified further, and talk of prospective deals between the
government and minority parties reached fever pitch.
The Ulster Unionists - the group most likely to be talked out of opposing
the government - protested to the last that they would not be swayed.
However, they delayed making an official decision until the last possible
moment.
The pro-European Social Democratic and Labour party, meanwhile, was also
understood to have been approached by a carrot-bearing minister - apparently
to no effect.
As the pleas and threats being flung in the direction of waverers grew ever
more frequent and ever more vigorous, weary possible rebels began taking
refuge in phrases designed to infuriate both camps.
'I am not going to take a decision until I have heard the debate,' said one.
Another said: 'I have told the whips that I will vote for the government but
I may have to tell them I have changed my mind.'
By the time the division bell rang, the government had resorted to every
persuasion technique in its repertoire - gentle and otherwise - as the
haggard expressions on the faces of several whips bore witness.
'How does it look?' asked one MP among the crowd milling anxiously around
the members' lobby. 'Like a spinning coin,' answered an-other, refusing to
be drawn.
With the government's slender majority of 21 looking ever more vulnerable on
a variety of fronts, there was speculation that this sort of backroom
bargaining would be a distinctive hallmark of Mr Major's administration.
Last week, as the whips worked their way systematically through their quotas
of MPs, ministerial involvement in the government push began in earnest with
face-to-face meetings with small groups of backbenchers.
One MP summoned to a 20-minute audience with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, opined shortly afterwards that the meeting had proved
counterproductive. 'Most of the people going in there were Thatcherites,' he
said. 'They were not likely to be greatly influenced by Mr Heseltine.'
In the wake of the publication of the motion, the whips whittled down
internal resistance, with reformed rebels making their revised positions
known in letters to The Times and in television interviews.
Meanwhile, the ministerial offensive continued with weekend telephone calls
to potential rebels in their constituencies. 'It was a very friendly
conversation,' said one MP so contacted. '(The minister) displayed no
aggression. His main worry was the potential impact (of Britain rejecting
the Maastricht treaty) on foreign investment.'
Mr Major reserved his chief efforts for this week, inviting suspected rebels
to hour-long question-and-answer sessions, side by side with experienced
loyalists. The prime minister's performance at these gatherings was
generally portrayed as cogent and impressive, although he failed to win over
a number of those attending.
As pressure built up in the final hours before the vote, Mr Major was
reported to have supplemented these group sessions with a small number of
individual meetings with hand-picked waverers. In an indication of the
government's determination to leave no stone unturned, these meetings were
said to be going on even after Mr Major had opened yesterday's debate.
The Euro-sceptics, of course, had their own heavyweights to wheel out, and
this they did - notably when a small group of new MPs attended a
spine-stiffening pep-talk with Baroness Thatcher.
The former prime minister's other main contribution to the pre-debate high
jinks was a concise foreword to a new book on the Maastricht treaty by Mr
Michael Spicer, one of the rebel leaders.
Besides maximising their support, the prime concern of the rebel leadership
in recent days has been instilling a sense of discipline in their troops in
a bid to ensure that as many as possible opted for the same voting tactics.
Their parting shot came on Tuesday evening when 34 Tories and one Ulster
Unionist assembled to discuss their battle plan amid much laughter and
desk-banging in a particularly obscure Westminster committee room.
'We know absolutely accurately what our figures are,' said a defiant Mr
James Cran, MP for Beverley, as the gathering broke up. 'Everybody was told:
'If you are not taking a hard line tomorrow, the door is over there.' '

THE Labour party has threatened to oppose any proposals the government makes
for the reform of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales if the wages
councils are abolished.
The government is expected to make a statement on Sunday trading shortly,
and will need the support of Labour MPs to ensure that any reform passes
through the Commons. Many Conservative MPs oppose the extension of Sunday
trading on religious grounds.
The Employment Department has said that it sees 'no permanent place' for
wages councils, which set minimum rates for about 10 per cent of the working
population. There has been speculation that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
employment secretary, will include their abolition in the Employment Bill,
which is likely to be published tomorrow.
The link between Labour's support for reform and wages councils emerged
during an information-seeking meeting between Ms Joan Ruddock, Labour's
spokesperson on Sunday trading and Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior home office
minister.
Ms Ruddock said the abolition of wages councils would undermine legal
guarantees of protection for retail workers - for example the provision that
Sunday working must be voluntary - which are central to Labour's support.
The unions argue that if wages councils were abolished there would be a
general downward pressure on pay that would depress premiums for Sunday
working particularly. Wages councils would be their preferred vehicle for
setting and policing such premium rates.
Both Labour and the government are committed to a free vote on Sunday
trading, but the Labour front bench will issue guidance on the reforms that
will strongly influence shadow ministers and many backbenchers.
The government has been committed to reform the Sunday trading laws since
1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated
by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986.
The options are expected to range from full deregulation on the Scottish
model to a tightening of existing laws along the lines advocated by the Keep
Sunday Special campaign.
Pressure on the government to introduce urgent reform of Sunday trading laws
increased after the European Court of Justice suggested that it was up to
English courts to end the confusion surrounding the present legislation.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Smith scorns government policy failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPEATED government policy failures and the 'disappearing authority and
credibility' of Mr John Major, the prime minister, justified MPs of all
parties in voting against the government, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
claimed in the Commons last night.
He had to contend with a barrage of charges from Conservative and Liberal
Democrat MPs that by refusing to support the government he had sullied his
record as a consistent supporter of membership of the European Community.
Sir Edward Heath, who as Conservative prime minister took Britain into the
EC in 1973, told Mr Smith he had 'forsworn his integrity'.
Mr Smith insisted that the ambiguous and anodyne government motion on which
the debate was based had more to do with the internal crisis in the
Conservative party than with the EC and the Maastricht treaty.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, confirmed that further proceedings on the
bill seeking authority for the ratification of the Maastricht treaty would
not be affected by a government defeat.
Mr Smith highlighted the sharply contrasting indications from government
quarters in recent weeks about the importance that ministers attached to the
debate. And, scoffing at the navety of Liberal Democrat MPs who intended to
vote for the motion, he said they had been 'conned by the Conservatives'.
Mr Smith said that for Labour MPs to adopt the same course would amount to
an endorsement of the government's decision to opt out from the social
chapter. 'That might suit the Liberal Democrats, but it would be a betrayal
for us,' he said.
The motion contained no ringing declaration about the future of Europe that
would rally the troops under the Maastricht banner, he said.
Mr Smith argued that further proceedings on the bill should be delayed until
after the Edinburgh summit in December, when the terms secured by the Danish
government for staging a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty would be
clarified.
He said that a statement made by the prime minister in September amounted to
an acceptance that the 'framework' for the second Danish referendum would
have to be agreed at the Edinburgh summit before MPs were asked to deal with
the next stage of the Maastricht bill.
To cheers and laughter from the Labour benches, Mr Smith poured ridicule on
the recent statement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
that a vote against the government at the end of the debate would result in
a policy vacuum of 'incalculable destructiveness'.
Mr Smith said: 'After all the clear and decisive leadership of the last few
weeks, after all the consistent and determined implementation of
long-established policies, how could we possibly cope with the black hole of
a policy vacuum?'

FT  05 NOV 92 / PM warning to Tory rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major set about the biggest fight of his political career yesterday
by arguing that the crucial issue at stake was whether Britain would play 'a
central role in Europe's future development.'
In a measured speech aimed both at his Euro-sceptic backbench Tory critics
and his Europhile Liberal Democrat allies, he backed up this keynote theme
by insisting that pressing ahead with ratification of Maastricht was a vital
national interest.
'I don't believe it is credible for this country to sit on the sidelines of
Europe and let other people determine policy,' he said, adding shortly
after: 'It is not in our national interest now, not in the future and never
will be.'
Using words tailored for his own back benches, he insisted that a
centralised Europe was more likely if 'Britain scowls in frustration on the
fringes'.
In spite of numerous hostile interventions, some from his own side, Mr Major
managed to command the attention of the house with a low-key delivery aimed
at appealing to reason, not passion.
A confident performance, which skilfully tackled or brushed aside the points
of his critics, also played heavily on the dire economic consequences of
Britain's being left on the sidelines.
Anticipating a Labour attack on the motives behind the paving debate, he
said that it had come as a consequence of a request from Mr Neil Kinnock,
when Labour leader, in June.
He asserted that progress had been made on creating a framework for a
definition of subsidiarity at the Birmingham summit and said the Danes had
now made clear their aims for an addendum to the treaty that met their
concerns without seeking a renegotiation.
Turning to Labour, Mr Major won cheers from the Conservative benches by
charging that the amendment tabled by the opposition was 'a fraud.'
Exploiting the fact that Labour was arguing for a delay in ratification
while also claiming to be a firmly pro-Maastricht party, he aimed a steady
stream of fire at the integrity of Mr John Smith. Although a long-time
pro-European, the opposition leader was 'hiding behind the Danes' to
disguise the splits in his own party,' he said.
'The right honourable gentleman's principles have been cast adrift on a sea
of expediency,' he added to loud cheers.
After winning noisy Tory support for these attacks, the prime minister then
attempted to address what he acknowledged were the 'genuine concerns' of the
doubters.
He underlined that his negotiation had firmly established Britain's right
not to proceed to Economic and Monetary Union, adding that such a prospect
looked increasingly unlikely within the treaty's timetable.
Heavy stress was put on Britain's successful persuasion of its European
partners to keep key policy issues such as security and foreign affairs at
an intergovernmental level and outside the competence of the European
Commission.
Asked by Mr Tony Marlow (C Northampton N) why the Commission had the right
to initiate policy under the treaty, Mr Major replied that that was only by
unanimous agreement of the Council of Ministers.
The problem of 'creeping competence' eroding to the Commission was tackled
by the need not only for that but, in addition, the approval of member
states' parliaments.
In his concluding remarks, he appealed directly to his own backbenches when
he argued: 'I have to tell the House and . . . the country that we cannot
continue to make a success of our membership of the Community unless we
ratify the treaty we have agreed to.
'That is my clear judgment and I would be doing the country a disservice, if
I did not back that judgment with all the force at my command.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World reaction): Old Soviet bloc will demand
attention - Washington will not be allowed to forget former communist
adversaries

THE Cold War ended during President Bush's watch. But with hyper-inflation,
economic dislocation and ethnic conflicts now stalking Russia and other
former Soviet republics, and central Europe worried about the spread of
ethnic conflicts from Yugoslavia, the region is likely to intrude on the
priorities of President Clinton.
A central question for east Europeans is how far and how fast Mr Clinton
will withdraw US troops from Nato, an alliance which leaders of the new
post-communist democracies see as an essential element in their own
security.
Unable to secure a firm timetable for their entry into the EC and denied a
formal extension of the Nato umbrella beyond the German border, the states
of central Europe in particular see a continuing US military and political
presence as a long-term reassurance against possible unpredictable upheavals
in the former Soviet Union which could de-stabilise their fragile
democracies.
In military terms the risks from Russia are seen as minimal even though
Russia and Ukraine still have by far the biggest armies on the continent.
Soviet troops have withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland and are
leaving their bases in former east Germany.
But, as the current slowdown in troop withdrawals from the Baltic states
indicates, the Russian military could in future resume a more active role.
Of greater immediate concern is the rising tide of economic refugees and
evidence from Yugoslavia that without direct US political and military
involvement the European Nato countries lack the will to tackle the
potential ethnic conflicts throughout the area.
The danger is that eastern Europe will expect too much from a US which is
home to millions of ethnic Poles, Slovaks, Ukrainians and others, and still
represents, despite decades of Cold war propaganda, the promised land for
millions or ordinary people and a model for governments.
The longing for a strong US role in eastern Europe is also present in the
economic sphere where US investment, especially by multinational companies,
is regarded as doubly valuable. President Walesa of Poland has described US
investment as equivalent to having US divisions on Polish soil.
Russia too sees a special relationship with the US as crucial. Having been
bankrupted by military competition with the US, Russia looks to its former
opponent for help in converting military industries to civilian use and
restoring order and profit to its farms and oil and gas industries.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin was among the first to congratulate Mr
Clinton, adding that he hoped the new administration would 'actively
support' Russian reforms.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World reaction): Clinton puts paid to
Reagan-Thatcher era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Reagan-Thatcher era is over at last, writes Edward Mortimer.
That was the instinctive reaction of many Europeans yesterday to President
George Bush's defeat by Governor Bill Clinton. The evidence is mixed, but
belief in global political currents, flowing across frontiers and oceans, is
widespread.
Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, Warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, thinks Mr
Clinton's victory will be both a symbol and, by its example, an agent of
change.
He sees the change as partly one of generations, but also one of policies,
'towards a greater emphasis on things social'.
The 1990s, he says, will not be deliberately redistributive of wealth, as
the 1960s were. The supply side will not be taken for granted, but the
emphasis will be on 'entitlement', and more attention will be given to the
employment consequences of economic decisions. The economy will no longer be
seen as 'a programme in itself'.
In the 1980s - the Reagan-Thatcher decade - the emphasis was on the supply
side. It was the age of tax-cuts, privatisation and deregulation; of the
leveraged buy-out and the real-estate boom.
In the early 1990s, those chickens have come home to roost. Right across the
industrialised world, rapid debt deflation has choked off growth, bringing a
rise in unemployment.
Such changes almost inevitably have their effects in the realm of politics.
'In the late 1970s,' says Sir Ralf,'nobody could get themselves re-elected.
In the late 1980s, it seemed no one could get themselves de-elected. I have
long expected that we should see massive change in the early 1990s.'
Professor David Calleo of Johns Hopkins University, Washington, also sees
the idea of 'a more efficient and active public sector' as being at the
heart of Mr Clinton's appeal.
'The flood tide of neo-liberalism, the idea that the market will decide
everything, is over,' Mr Calleo says. 'But the old antithesis of big state
versus little state is in a way beside the point. The argument is for a more
efficient state, politically stronger but administratively less intrusive,
not growing in all directions automatically. That's the theory. We don't
know how it will work in practice.'
For the British Labour party these analyses have two possible implications:
either it has failed to articulate the new trend, being still infected with
old-style 1960s interventionism, or last April's UK election came just too
soon for it to benefit.
But changes in policy are not always reflected in party labels.
In France and Spain Socialist parties were in power throughout the
'Reagan-Thatcher decade', and, mutatis mutandis, applied Reagan-Thatcher
policies with vigour, to the dismay and discomfiture of many of their
grass-roots supporters, notably in the trade union movement.
Sir Ralf Dahrendorf says he had thought 'Mr Major and his generation' would
implement the new 1990s thinking in Britain, while retaining the
Conservative label, and admits to being disappointed that this is not the
case.
In Germany, where he was himself a Liberal (FDP) politician in the 1960s and
1970s, Sir Ralf points out that in the 1980s the ruling Christian Democrats,
hitherto proponents of a 'social market economy', became much more
Thatcherite; and he expects them to move back under any of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's possible successors.
The country that will have most difficulty in adjusting, he thinks, is
France, which is approaching elections next spring 'with all the old
characters'. He quotes a French friend as saying France will experience the
change 'in the new millennium and not before', but he himself thinks 'things
may slide more rapidly, in the next few months'.
In any case, Sir Ralf predicts that 'we are in for a decade of gigantic
redistribution struggles,' in which most people's real incomes will fall and
there will be intense pressure for the pain to be equitably shared.
In the short term fiscal deficits will widen further and, 'though I shudder
to say it', the result will almost certainly be a return to high inflation.
Mr Calleo too sees a potential conflict between two types of demand for
change: Mr Clinton's emphasis on government spending, on infrastructure,
schools etc on the one hand, and the demand for balanced budgets and
financial stringency expressed by Mr Ross Perot on the other.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World reaction): Leap into unknown for nervous
EC leaders

<TEXT>
EUROPE will miss President George Bush. However unpopular he was in the US,
Mr Bush was viewed by his fellow European leaders as a predictable ally.
President-elect Bill Clinton represents a leap into the unknown. This at
least was the initial assessment in Brussels yesterday.
The Clinton campaign has sent signals about its desire for continuity in US
foreign policy; but questions remain about how a 46-year-old governor from
Arkansas, with next to no experience in foreign affairs, will approach
Europe, especially now that relations between the US and the EC have turned
decidedly sticky.
The tensions between the two in the Gatt trade talks are symptomatic of a
wider lack of transatlantic co-operation. The sense of drift has grown as
the global recession has deepened and national leaders have gone their own
way.
'We're in the middle of a hurricane, but we're still trying to do business,'
said a senior White House official just before the November 3 election, 'and
you people in Europe are worrying about the French farmers in elections six
months down the road.'
For Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, the Gatt talks have
turned into a trial of strength in which no side can afford to lose face. As
Mr Clinton will discover, Mr Delors is reflexively anti-American on some
issues. He believes the EC should resist US pressure on farm subsidies
because 'it is important for an adolescent Europe to say No to Big Brother
(America)'.
This view is widely held among Europhiles in Brussels who fret about US
claims to world leadership and hanker after a partnership of equals: but at
the same time, officials worry that the US may decide to go home, leaving a
security vacuum in Europe.
In a speech in Boston in 1989, President Bush recognised European
aspirations for a greater political voice and gave an unequivocal welcome to
European economic integration.
Subsequently, he awarded the EC a co-ordinating role in eastern Europe,
invited Mr Delors to Washington as a quasi head of state, and gave an
enthusiastic welcome to the Maastricht treaty on European union. Behind the
scenes, however, frustrations continued to build as European aspirations
foundered, first in its dilatory response to the Gulf crisis and then in its
ill-conceived rush, under German pressure, to recognise Croatia and Slovenia
 -thereby exacerbating the Yugoslav civil war.
The US was also alarmed about Franco-German plans to form a new Euro-corps,
the potential nucleus of a future European army sketched in the Maastricht
treaty. US diplomats privately denounced the corps as a challenge to the
primacy of Nato as guarantor of European security.
Enter Mr Clinton, the man who declares it is time to rebuild America, who
puts the restoration of US economic strength as top priority. Two questions
arise: will his 'America first' rhetoric lead to a more confrontational and
protectionist trade policy; and will his interest in domestic affairs
accelerate the trend toward US disengagement in Europe?
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, attempted to dispel concerns
yesterday, describing Mr Clinton as a 'fervent supporter of the Atlantic
alliance'. But some senior EC officials are not entirely reassured by the
Clinton camp's answers. (The EC delegation in Washington only received
official biographies of Mr Clinton and his running-mate Senator Al Gore on
election day; more seriously, officials in Brussels are awaiting the first
senior foreign policy appointments).
Economic questions remain paramount. Will Mr Clinton pursue his plan to
increase taxation of foreign-owned companies to help reduce the budget
deficit, even at the expense of job-creating inward investment? What steps
will he take to spur a US recovery?
In the last resort, however, much will ride on the Gatt talks which have now
become a litmus test for whether the US and EC can balance the need for
political co-operation with economic rivalry.
For this reason, many officials in Brussels believe Mr Clinton would be
secretly delighted if Mr Bush could pull off a deal because it would avoid a
damaging row with the allies just as he takes office in January.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World Reaction): Latin Americans look anxiously
across border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE defeat of President George Bush will initiate a period of uncertainty
across Latin America. Although most governments will naturally declare their
contentment with Mr Clinton, most would have preferred the continuity of
another Bush term.
With the exception of two issues - the proposed free trade agreement with
Mexico and Canada and Mr Clinton's desire to see the end of the Castro
government in Cuba - the election campaign provided little insight about the
incoming administration's attitudes to Latin America.
During the campaign, Mr Clinton cast doubt on the value of US aid programmes
and trade concessions such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative: bad news for
the reconstructing economies of central America and small Caribbean
countries. His qualified approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement
coincided with high praise for President Carlos Salinas of Mexico. On issues
relevant to most of the rest of the continent, he was mute.
From the Latin leaders' perspective, however, Mr Clinton shares neither Mr
Bush's experience of the region nor his friendship with many of its leaders.
They also expect their relations with Washington to become more complicated.
Mr Carlos Bolona, Peru's economy minister, believes Mr Clinton's arrival at
the White House will lead US Latin America policy to be more oriented
towards human rights, the environment, the fight against drugs and promoting
democracy.
By contrast, the Bush administration emphasised economic reform and trade, a
policy that coincided with the agendas of most Latin American leaders.
Despite fears among Latin governments, there is a widespread view in
Washington that shifts in US policy will not be dramatic, partly because
Latin America is the fastest growing market for US goods.

<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton's time spent beneath the dreaming spires of Oxford may not,
by itself, be enough to turn Washington into Camelot when he moves into the
White House.
However, Britain yesterday was hailing the prospect that its 'special
relationship' with the US could be given an additional polish as a result of
Mr Clinton's Oxonian connections.
The Foreign Office yesterday underlined that Mr Clinton - who was a Rhodes
Scholar - would be the first US president to have studied at Oxford. 'There
will be a sentimental attachment,' a Foreign Office spokesman said. 'But
they (the Clinton administration) will be trying to do their best for
America, just as we are trying to do the best for ourselves.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, took a break from worrying about a
US-European trade war to welcome the prospect of working 'very well' with
the new president. Prime Minister John Major is likely to meet Mr Clinton
during a planned trip to the US before the end of the year.
Dons at the 13th century University college, where Mr Clinton studied in
1968-1969, issued a message of congratulation. The Master and fellows said
they were 'delighted' at the election of a 'Univ man' to the US presidency.
The college has endured months of harassment from the media.

IF Governor Bill Clinton's policies towards Japan are a reflection of his
appetite for singing with karaoke machines, relations between the US and
Japan should take a sharp turn for the better.
Officials from the Arkansas state office in Japan yesterday recalled that
during the most recent of his three visits to Japan in 1988 the
president-elect and his wife sang in an Osaka karaoke bar until 2am.
Mr Satoshi Iue, president of Sanyo Electric, the first Japanese manufacturer
to invest in Arkansas, who was the Clintons' guide that night, remarked: 'He
enjoyed going in a video arcade, sang very well and fascinated people by
playing the saxophone like a pro'.
Mr Iue, who has known Governor Clinton for 14 years, added: 'I do not
believe the close relationship between Japan and the US will change.'
However other Japanese leaders gave Mr Clinton's victory a more cautious
welcome. Expressions of gratitude for President George Bush's foreign policy
achievements were combined with the uncertainty of losing familiar
Republican policymakers and apprehension that Mr Clinton's focus on domestic
economic issues may lead the US to withdraw from an active international
role.
Japanese business and political leaders welcome Mr Clinton's apparent
determination to boost US industrial competitiveness on the grounds that a
strong US economy is in Japan's best interests. But they worry that a
revival might come at the price of a more assertive anti-Japanese trade
policy.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa congratulated Mr Clinton and urged the US to
continue to play a world leadership role.
The premier said that relations with the US would remain the cornerstone of
Japanese foreign policy. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of
Employers Associations, said: 'It appears the Clinton administration will
strengthen attention to domestics affairs.
'On this point I am concerned that America will reduce the role it has
played in international politics.'
Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
said: 'I am concerned that should he fail to reform the fiscal deficit or
bring about economic recovery it would bring about a harder line toward
Japan.'
One Japanese company already claims to have played a vital role in Mr
Clinton's victory. The Arkansas hotel which served as his campaign
headquarters is owned by the Tokyo-based Japan Green Stamp company.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World Reaction): Uruguay Round set to simmer on
back-burner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS in Europe and Japan that Mr Clinton will take a tougher stance on
trade issues - with the possibility of edging the US towards protectionism -
were quickly voiced yesterday. The fact is, however, that he remains an
unknown quantity.
Mr Clinton has been deliberately, and perhaps cleverly, coy on trade issues.
All he was willing to say during one of the presidential debates was: 'I'll
have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed realistic policy, and not
get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.'
He has said in general terms that he supports the Uruguay Round, and has
described the free trade pact with Mexico as desirable, but only if
accompanied by a national economic strategy.
'When you get past agriculture, Clinton's people really will have to make
choices among competing political interests, and it would be awkward, if not
bizarre, for the outgoing administration to make decisions with which the
incoming president may disagree,' said Mr Harry Freeman. Mr Freeman is
executive director of the MTN Coalition, a non-partisan business grouping
organised to get a Uruguay Round package passed by Congress. 'It would have
been difficult for Clinton to redo things that have already been agreed -
but that difficulty ended on Tuesday night,' he said.
The first consequence of a Clinton victory, therefore, is the collapse of
present efforts to agree a Uruguay Round package. Having sidelined trade
issues during the campaign, there is no reason to believe Mr Clinton will
promote them to the top of his political agenda on January 21. A long delay
can be expected before serious negotiations on the Round can resume.
He is likely to be successful in negotiating Congressional renewal of 'fast
track' legislation which effectively expires next March, and which is
essential for smooth ratification of any Uruguay Round deal.
But a Clinton administration is likely to have priorities that do not match
those of the present US Trade Representative's Office. This implies a need
to unravel the draft Uruguay Round agreement that has taken six years to
bring to the table - with uncertain reactions by the other 104 contracting
parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The most
controversial new priorities are likely to involve 'non-traditional areas'
like workers' rights, human rights and environmental concerns. How tough he
will be in forcing these issues on to the trade agenda is unclear.
Trading partners wonder whether Mr Clinton will be as zealous as his
predecessor in blocking the more protectionist excesses of Congress. Mr
Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, noted: 'The Democratic party has
been supporting trade protectionism and attempting to put a brake on the
sale of cheaper Japanese goods. It's possible (that a President Clinton)
would reactivate (Super) 301.'
Super 301, a potent modification of Section 301 of the US's 1984 Trade Act,
would permit Washington to impose tariffs of up to 100 per cent on exports
of a country that refused to open its markets to US goods.
A trade bill passed by the House of Representatives in July and now before
the Senate would renew for five years the Super 301 clause, which expired
two years ago. While President Bush had been poised to veto the bill, no one
has yet determined Mr Clinton's reaction.
The tendency to prefer bilateral settlement of trade disputes implied in
Super 301 is at odds with Gatt principals that disputes should be settled
multilaterally, and is feared by many US trading partners.
Japan has been targeted in part because of its mounting trade surpluses with
the US. But it is not alone. Other countries in trade surplus with the US,
like Taiwan and China, may fear similar treatment.
Indeed, unless Beijing hastily secures the safe haven of Gatt membership -
as it is trying to do by next March - it will be in grave danger of losing
its most favoured nation trading status with the US, which has remained in
place over the past four years thanks only to Mr Bush's success in
fiercely-fought veto battles with Congress.
Mr Clinton has also hinted that he would take a tougher view on
'anti-dumping' action against 'unfair' traders. Such actions - already
widely abused by the US and the EC in defence of uncompetitive but powerful
domestic industrial interests - were due for reform under the Uruguay Round.
The hint of their wider use is seen by the US's trading partners as a
dangerous pointer in the direction of protectionism.
Clinton supporters nevertheless insist that 'while it is right to be
cautious, it would be wrong at this stage to make judgments'.
Said on Washington-based trade lobbyist: 'If I were you, I would give
Clinton a chance - you might be surprised. You will have to hold your breath
a while.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Battle of ideas set to
absorb the GOP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not going to be easy for the Republican party after holding the White
House for 20 of the last 24 years. It will not even have the consolation the
Democrats had for most of their years in the executive wilderness of running
Congress, the legislative arm of government, writes Jurek Martin in
Washington.
Yet the GOP future is by no means bleak. The internal forces that would tear
it apart are strong. There are serious differences of opinion between the
socially exclusionary ideological right, conventional moderates, and the new
strain of conservatism, which combines economic tightfistedness with a
liberal approach to social problems.
But, offsetting this, should be the twin realisation that out of division
comes new strength of purpose and that the party lacks not in distinctive
leadership material.
Now that Mr George Bush is heading into retirement, the nominal titular head
is Vice-President Dan Quayle. Undoubtedly he has his eye on the party's
nomination in 1996 and his faithful performance in this campaign, much
better than his underwhelming national debut four years ago, will have won
him support.
For the moment Mr Quayle is the standard-bearer of the ideological right,
more so than Mr Pat Buchanan, the polemicist who challenged Mr Bush in the
primaries. But his handicap remains the perception, reinforced by the
election results, that he is still not intellectually worthy of the
presidency. That cannot be said of some other challengers.
Mr James Baker will probably not be one of these. His distaste for electoral
politics is palpable. He might not turn down a nomination handed to him, but
it is difficult to see him seeking it out aggressively, not least because he
will be in his late 60s by the time 1996 comes round.
The younger Republican generation looks more ambitious. Mr Jack Kemp, the
housing secretary, had a good election, proving himself faithful to his
president but distinctive in his advocacy of greater government and
private-sector involvement in inner-city problems.
Mr Dick Cheney, the widely respected defence secretary, was also
conveniently above the fray of a losing campaign. A moderate in most
matters, which is not true of the enthusiastic Mr Kemp, and with few
political enemies, he looks more able than most to reconcile the party's
factions.
Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Mr William Bennett, the former
education secretary, represent best the new strain of conservatism, with Mr
Weld, because of his greater exposure, the more advantageously placed.
But all will have to reckon with the grass roots force of the Christian
right and its skilful political mastermind, the Rev Pat Robertson, who has
an extensive agenda for the future.
If the Republicans follow the Clinton model, there will soon be a
mini-proliferation of new think-tanks, trying to win the party's battle of
ideas. It could prove fascinating.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Ignominious end for a
paradoxical president - George Bush's vitriolic campaign lost him the
respect he earned while in office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR George Bush it was not supposed to end like this. Rather than a graceful
exit from the presidency after eight years, contemplating a place in the
history books, he leaves after only four, the first elected Republican
president since the forgettable Herbert Hoover to be turfed out after a
single term.
Even more sadly, a gracious concession speech on election night could not
expunge the sour taste that his foul campaign had left in the nation's
mouth. This further reduced the respect he had earned for having done some
things well during what will come to be seen as, at best, a transitional
term in office and, at worst, a negligent one.
Nor could he have expected that his own nation would so turn against him.
Had he not, as he would have it, won the cold war, reunified Germany, stood
firm during the attempted Soviet coup thereby encouraging democracy in
Russia, and brought Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega to heel?
Even though he began to concede this year that perhaps he might have paid
more attention to domestic affairs and that, perhaps, the economy had not
performed to expectation, he never gave the impression he could be blamed
for not solving every problem. Of the economy he would say: 'It's bad, but,
hey, not that bad.'
Nor did he seem to realise that perhaps his country had really read his lips
and did not trust him that much. His public life has, after all, been one in
which constancy has not been a virtue - be the issue 'voodoo economics,'
abortion, civil rights or dealing with Iran and Iraq.
For a confessed unreflective man, Mr Bush is a complex character. He is said
to bear private malice towards none (even Mr Clinton concedes this) and is
capable of great personal kindness. But he sanctions malice in public,
especially in those who work for him, and seems more than capable of turning
a blind eye to those who may break the law on his behalf.
For a man who made it all the way to the White House it is paradoxical to
state that he has never been a great electoral politician. Set against his
losses - twice for the Senate from Texas in 1964 and 1970 and for the
Republican nomination in 1980 - have been two terms as a congressman from
his state in the 1960s and, of course, the presidency itself in 1988. The
enduring feature of all those races, except possibly 1980, has been his
willingness to conduct ruthlessly negative campaigns, even when they have
not appeared to be necessary.
But if Mr Bush saw elections as a necessarily dirty rite of passage, to be
approached with all the cynicism to be mustered, there was also the
assumption that he saw the presidency as something else - a test of his own
manhood.
His long public career had always been dependent on patrons - in order,
Goldwater, Nixon, Rockefeller and Reagan, who encompass the full range of
Republican beliefs and experience. He owed more than a little of his winning
campaign four years ago to Mr Ronald Reagan, but at least when he inherited
the White House it was his to run, with the capable assistance of his old
friend James Baker.
Mr Bush has admitted that, in 1989, he still felt he had not been fully
tested under fire. He resolved that problem, inside a year, with the
invasion of Panama, a soft target perhaps. But there was nothing soft about
other challenges that came his way, with the liberation of eastern Europe,
the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and the
dissolution of the Soviet Union.
In most of these he was not found wanting as a crisis manager. He encouraged
democracy in eastern Europe, while leaving the leading role in economic
assistance to the European Community; he stood firmly behind Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in the great debate about German unification; his finest moment,
if not hour, was a critical comment when it seemed that the anti-Gorbachev
putsch was going to work. 'Not all coups succeed,' were his words, which
looked awfully good compared with the simultaneous equivocations of the
likes of President Francois Mitterrand.
His finest campaign was undoubtedly his diplomatic and military triumph in
the Gulf war, although Mr Bush is now going to have to face up to question
after question about the details of his policy to court President Saddam in
the years before the invasion of Kuwait.
The conduct of the Gulf war and the subsequent pursuit of the Middle East
peace process laid to rest for a while the suspicion that Mr Bush had no
broad, strategic vision to deal with a changing world. When last year he
spoke of 'a new world order,' involving greater collective international
responsibility and burden sharing and a leading role for the United Nations,
there was a sense that he was on to something substantive.
It could well be said that the first 2 1/2 years of his presidency were
indeed a success. He seemed a man of purpose, which makes the failure of the
balance of his term all the more difficult to understand.
Even his signing of the 1990 budget legislation, containing the very tax
increases which two years before he had promised he would never allow, was
considered at the time by all except the ideological right wing to be an act
of responsible domestic statesmanship. It was hardly surprising that 15
short months ago so few Democrats felt like taking him on.
It is impossible to divorce the state of the economy from his demise. It is
not so much that policy mistakes were made - indeed his administration and
the Federal Reserve pushed most of the buttons available to them - but more
that the president seemed blithely indifferent to the real domestic world
outside the White House.
The word got out that he had 'lost touch' with his own country and the
concerns over health care, education, narcotics, crime, unemployment that
were so much on the mind of average people.
This year has read like a catalogue of disasters: an ill-conceived and
ultimately disastrous trip to Japan, a divisive Republican primary campaign,
an ineffectual response to the deeply disturbing riots in Los Angeles,
perpetual 'gridlock' in relations with Congress, veto after veto of popular
legislation, a grudging and mean-spirited excursion to the Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro and, as politically damaging as anything, a vindictive and
confrontational Republican convention in Houston.
There were also growing and public divisions inside his own government. Mr
John Sununu was an abrasive White House chief of staff and his successor, Mr
Sam Skinner, ineffective. His economic advisers - Brady, Darman and Boskin -
were not of one mind. They often did not seem to know whether to support Mr
Alan Greenspan at the Fed or undermine him. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing
secretary, made no bones of the fact he felt semi-detached. The
conservatively pure, always suspicious of Mr Bush and Mr Baker, began open
assaults, suggesting that the weak end of the Republican ticket was Mr Bush
and not Vice-President Dan Quayle.
Mr Bush's reactions to these events were unpredictable, contradictory and
defensive. The last was arguably the worst offence; he began to whine and
blame others, a trait that Americans, like others, do not find attractive.
By the time he finally brought Mr Baker back to the White Houser to sort it
all out, the rot had set in - and the economy was definitely not getting
better.
Suddenly the old suspicion that Mr Bush (and Mr Baker) lacked strategic
vision and a sense of purpose took hold again.
The negative campaign against Mr Clinton only served to reinforce this. It
began to be written and said repeatedly that the only reason Mr Bush wanted
to be president was 'to be president'. One of his less felicitous early
election year pronouncements - 'I will say or do anything to remain
president' - was increasingly used in evidence against him.
The paranoia of Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, may know no
bounds, but Mr Bush did sanction dirty tricks against his opponents. There
is no other explanation for his political appointees at the State Department
nosing round the Clinton family passport records.
But, to the president, 'you gotta dish it out and if they can't take it, too
bad'. In the end he was reduced to the most demeaning of insults against Mr
Clinton and, finally, the public concluded that this demeaned Mr Bush more
than the recipient.
Yet it is also typical of George Herbert Walker Bush, a Yankee patrician,
that he was publicly gracious in defeat. That is the ultimate dichotomy.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Corporate America
nervously awaits new order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 12 years basking under laissez-faire, pro-business Republican
administrations, corporate America is nervously awaiting an activist
Democratic president whose legislative programme has far-reaching
implications for both US and foreign companies.
Despite the anxiety, Mr Bill Clinton has a reasonably strong pro-business
record as governor of Arkansas and managed to pick up the election
endorsement of many more top executives than other recent Democratic
candidates.
He has put the revitalisation of the US economy at the top of his agenda and
his aides are promising early action in two areas which should win strong
business support: an investment tax credit and a Dollars 20bn (Pounds
12.2bn) a year programme of infrastructure spending, which should benefit
the construction, telecommunications and environmental services industries.
However, businesses fear that some of Mr Clinton's other pledges,
particularly in the area of healthcare insurance, job training and labour
relations, could impose onerous new costs on them, while foreign companies
are extremely concerned over his threat to tax them more heavily.
The impact of the new policy mix remains highly uncertain, since Mr Clinton
has yet to fill his cabinet posts and his published plans consist of little
more than vague campaign generalities.
However, some broad themes stand out:
Foreign companies may suffer in two respects. First, Mr Clinton has promised
to 'crack down' on those which 'prosper by manipulating our tax laws to
their advantage'.
This may involve new rules to prevent multinationals abusing transfer
pricing - the price they charge US subsidiaries for goods - to avoid paying
US tax. A more aggressive approach would be to support a discussion document
floated by two senior congressmen last summer, which suggested arbitrarily
taxing foreign companies on the basis of the average profitability of US
companies in their sector.
Second, foreign companies may suffer from a more protectionist attitude to
the takeover of US businesses.
For example, Mr Clinton said recently he would oppose the proposed
acquisition by British Airways of a 44 per cent stake in ailing USAir
because if the deal went through US carriers would get no additional access
to the British market.
Tax. Mr Clinton plans quick action to provide a 'targeted' investment tax
credit, which US business has not enjoyed since 1986.
Ms Gillian Spooner, a partner at the accounting group KPMG Peat Marwick,
says it remains unclear what kinds of investment will be covered and whether
the credit will be incremental - in other words dependent on a business
increasing its investment over the level of preceding years.
There are also plans to encourage new small businesses by allowing long-term
investors in start-ups to get 50 per cent of any gains excluded from the tax
net.
In common with Mr Bush, Mr Clinton has promised to make permanent an annual
tax credit for companies investing in research and development and to set up
enterprise zones in the inner cities.
Health insurance. A key campaign pledge has been reform of the US healthcare
system, aimed at making adequate medical aid available to all and holding
back rocketing health costs. The drug and insurance industries will be hurt
by promises to attack the 'price gouging' of the former and the underwriting
policies of the latter.
Mr Clinton is also expected to mandate that all employers provide healthcare
insurance for their workers, though they would get some form of federal aid
in the early years. Many businesses, particularly small ones, are likely to
complain that this is an extra financial burden which will costs jobs.
A larger question, argues Mr Steve Raetzman, of management consultants
Towers Perrin, is whether Mr Clinton might look to business as a source of
revenue to fund his healthcare pledge. He might seek to reduce the
favourable tax treatment of employers' health insurance payments, currently
treated 100 per cent as an operating business expense.
Worker training. Mr Clinton will require every employer to spend 1.5 per
cent of payroll for the continuing education and training of its workers.
That may not be too arduous for large companies, but once more it may be a
severe burden for smaller businesses.
The environment. Businesses guilty of pollution are likely to be fined or
taxed more heavily, while tax incentives are promised to encourage use of
alternative fuels and recycled materials. The motor industry will have to
meet tougher fuel efficiency requirements by 2000 and other sectors may face
more onerous pollution standards. Telecommunications. The new administration
supports the idea of nationwide communications infrastructure based on
highly efficient fibre-optic technology. It is not clear who would pay for
this and which companies would benefit.
The record of Mr Al Gore, who will be vice-president, suggests the
administration will encourage a big role for the giant, cash-rich 'Baby
Bell' regional phone companies, which are presently discouraged by
regulatory and legal restrictions from investing in fibre-optic networks and
want more freedom to provide video services to the home. Labour relations.
Mr Clinton owes election debts to the labour movement and corporate America
fears that unions, which have lost a great deal of power over the past 12
years, may regain some ground. The president-elect has pledged to sign the
Workplace Fairness Act, which would ban the permanent replacement of
striking workers.
'The great concern in labour law is what he is going to sign when a liberal
Congress presents it to him,' says Mr David Rhodes of consultants Towers
Perrin, who suggests the outcome will have a significant effect on American
industry's long-term productivity.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Wealth of talent ready
for Clinton - No party power bloc will force his hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton is not going to be short of talent or choice as he
contemplates putting together a new government. He will also be able to
select from an experienced crew of Democrats who have been waiting for the
chance for 20 of the last 24 years and a new younger generation who have
come to the fore with him over the last 10 years. Most to the point, he
seems beholden to no particular power bloc in the party.
Probably the most important single job in the portfolio sounds the most
mundane, that of White House chief of staff. Yet Mr Bush's failure to find a
good one proved a fatal weakness in his administration, while Mr James
Baker's ability to direct traffic, policies and people in the Reagan first
term was an essential key to its success.
One member of the transition team believes the choice will come down to
somebody most versed either in politics or government. Mr Mickey Kantor, the
campaign chairman, and Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, belong mostly in
the first category, though Mr Kantor has government experience. Mr Warren
Christopher, the former deputy secretary of state under President Carter, is
the quintessential government man. Younger hopefuls could include Mr George
Stephanopoulos, the smart young campaign communications chief.
Rated almost as important is the White House position of congressional
liaison, again a weakness in Mr Bush's government. Any of the above could be
chosen, with Mr Brown, in particular, having displayed his political skills
in abundance during the year. Though he says he does not want a job in the
new government, Mr James Carville, the street-smart political director of
the Clinton campaign, might have earned the right of refusal.
Mr Christopher is also considered a prime candidate for at least two other
senior Cabinet positions - secretary of state and attorney-general (Mr
Kantor might be interested in the latter, too, as could be Mr Vernon Jordan,
the black lawyer and civil rights activist). Other contenders for the
foreign, defence and security portfolios include at least three congressmen
 -Lee Hamilton of Indiana, Les Aspin of Wisconsin and Dave McCurdy of
Oklahoma - Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and
retired Admiral William Crowe, one of Mr Clinton's most active supporters in
the military hierarchy.
Mr Clinton has been careful to offer few hints about the composition of his
own economic team, or about the distribution of power between different
groups of advisers.
Financial markets would be unhappy if old Oxford friends, such as Mr Robert
Reich of Harvard and Mr Ira Magaziner, an economic consultant, gained
excessive leverage since both are seen to favour activist government
policies that postpone measures to cut the budget deficit.
But their influence has so far been balanced by Wall Street advisers such as
the investment bankers, Mr Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs and Mr Roger Altman
of the Blackstone Group, and by Mr Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy
Institute, all of whom prefer free-market policies with tight budgetary
controls.
The troika of Treasury secretary, chairman of the council of economic
advisers and budget director forms the economic backbone of any
administration. Mr Clinton may want to supplement them with an economic
security adviser and may give higher profile to the commerce secretary and
US trade representative.
Mr Rubin is probably the leading contender for the Treasury, with Mr Altman,
Mr Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker at Lazard Freres, and former
Congressman Jim Jones, chairman of the American Stock Exchange, also in the
frame.
Not to be excluded, though clearly a long shot, is the prospect of Mr
Clinton calling on Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal
Reserve and still the ultimate pillar of financial rectitude.
Mr Larry Summers, now on leave from Harvard and chief economist at the World
Bank, is a likely chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, not least
because he has policy-making experience in a large bureaucracy. But there
are other strong claimants, such as Mr Alan Blinder of Princeton, Mr Paul
Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Ms Laura Tyson of
the University of California.
Mr Shapiro, long close to Mr Clinton and a fountain of ideas on budgetary
reform, must be a contender for the budget office, as may be Mr Jones or a
current congressional heavyweight, like Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
though his current hegemony over the finance committee is a powerful
competing attraction.
Mr Reich can certainly be expected to get a senior position in the White
House mechanism, conceivably as a new economic security adviser. Mr Robert
Hormats, once a Washington veteran and now with Goldman Sachs, also brings a
wealth of experience to bear on the international front.
Mr Fred Bergsten, another Washington Democratic veteran of both government
and institutional life, can hardly be ignored.
If Mr Rohatyn does not get the Treasury, then he could be offered Commerce,
as might Mr John Young of Hewlett Packard, or indeed Mr Magaziner. The hot
inside tip for trade representative, succeeding Mrs Carla Hills, is another
woman, Ms Paula Stern, an expert in her own right whose husband happens to
be the present head of the Clinton transition team.
There are, of course, in excess of 3,000 political jobs going in Washington.
There will be at least twice that many applicants for them, which is why the
city's real estate agents, long in the doldrums, were looking positively
perky yesterday.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Fresh threat for north-east pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has linked the survival chances of the only deep-coal colliery
in north-east England not on British Coal's recent 31-pit closure list to an
application for opencast coal extraction.
Ellington Colliery - or Big E - on the Northumberland coast near Ashington,
provides 1,600 mining jobs and sustains hundreds more by supplying coal to
the nearby Alcan aluminium smelter and Blyth power station.
The licence under which the pit tips 670,000 tonnes a year of unsightly
colliery waste on adjacent Lynemouth beach was renewed in 1990 on condition
that British Coal pursued other means of disposal before the licence expires
in mid 1995. It was warned that the licence would not be renewed unless the
planning system showed that no land-based alternative existed.
British Coal has told Northumberland County Council and local MPs that it
will submit a planning application next year seeking permission to dispose
of the waste on land next to the pit - and to mine 1.75m tonnes of coal
opencast over six years.
'Without a shadow of doubt it will be an extremely contentious application,'
said Mr Kevin Flaherty, the council's planning committee chairman,
yesterday. 'We do feel caught in the middle; there's a great deal of
pressure from both sides.'
British Coal says the proposal is 'absolutely crucial' for the pit's future.
Opencasting, it said, would create space for the waste. The site would avoid
environmentally unacceptable waste transported by road, avoiding extra costs
that would increase production overheads.
Northumberland County Council has protested that opencasting in the county,
providing 15 per cent of the UK's opencast coal, has reached unacceptable
levels.
The North East Opencast Action Group will oppose the application, said Mr
Andrew Pratt, the organisation's chairman. 'We think it's trying to hold a
gun to the county council's head,' he added.
Mr Jack Thompson, the National Union of Mineworkers-sponsored Labour MP for
adjacent Wansbeck, where most Ellington miners live, said he hoped the
council would oppose the plan. He added: 'It smells a little bit of
blackmail.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / Ambulance service abandons computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Ambulance Service yesterday abandoned its new and troubled
computerised despatch system and reverted to manual methods.
Mr Martin Gorham, acting chief executive, said the computer would not be
brought back into service until technical difficulties, which resulted in
the system slowing down for no obvious cause, had been resolved.
The ambulance service has been using manual back-up procedures to ensure an
effective service since last week, when difficulties with the computer
system caused delays that provoked claims that lives were being put at risk.
Mr John Wilby, the ambulance service's chief executive, resigned last week.
Yesterday the system slowed down when demand was low and back-up procedures
failed to improve response times. The ambulance service said the despatch of
one ambulance was delayed by 25 minutes. It arrived nine minutes later and
the patient was safely transported to hospital.
At that point it was decided to return to fully manual methods. The
ambulance service said the system slowed at the same time as daily data was
being automatically archived.
The new system is built around a network of personal computers, in contrast
to earlier systems based on minicomputers or mainframes.

FT  05 NOV 92 / More letters after their name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTERED accountants may soon have yet more letters after their names -
after the existing 'ACA' or 'FCA' - to reflect their specialist skills,
under proposals discussed yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
The council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
approved circulation of a document to its members suggesting additional
qualifications to reflect members' expertise.
The post-qualification working party, part of the education and training
directorate, recommended the introduction of a framework of flexible
qualifications, which would include areas such as taxation, financial
management and information technology.
It said the voluntary framework should be built on existing chartered
accountancy qualifications and be designed to appeal to accountants in both
professional firms and businesses.
It should be controlled by formally approved institute accreditation.
Mr David Clark, a council member, said professional recognition of
specialisms was very important for accountants competing with consultants in
other fields such as information technology.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Forgery used to get Welsh agency job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAN forged the signature of a Home Office minister on headed notepaper to
help him get a Pounds 40,000-a-year job with the Welsh Development Agency,
Cardiff Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Neil Smith, from Walsall, produced a glowing reference from Mr Peter
Lloyd, a junior minister, when he applied for the post of marketing
director. He also claimed to have held senior jobs with Laker Airways and
Polly Peck, and said he had a Master of Business Administration degree from
Madison Business School, Wisconsin.
Mr Smith, who had served three previous sentences for deception, admitted
forging and then using references and CVs to obtain pecuniary advantage and
was jailed for a total of two years.
Mr Martin Kelly, prosecuting, told the court: 'Mr Lloyd had no knowledge of
this letter whatsoever. It is wholly false. He had no knowledge of the
defendant at all.'
WDA executives interviewed him on five occasions, but failed to uncover his
real background as a bankrupt businessman with a recent jail term. Mr Smith
spent four months in the WDA job before he was arrested.
Mr Greg Bull, defending, said Mr Smith resorted to deception in his anxiety
to find work after leaving prison. He added: 'It might be seen that he was a
good marketing man because he sold himself to the WDA and took up
employment.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / Inland Revenue changes tax relief eligibility on Lautro
levies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVIES imposed on life insurance companies under the terms of the Lautro
investor compensation and indemnity schemes will be eligible for tax relief,
the Inland Revenue has ruled.
Lautro is the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, the
industry regulator.
In an extra-statutory concession, the Inland Revenue said contributions
through the Lautro investors' compensation scheme could be treated as a
management expense.
Separately, the Inland Revenue said regulations were laid before the Commons
this week to allow relief under the Lautro indemnity scheme.
Relief will be available for levies paid at any time since the scheme was
set up.
The investors' compensation scheme requires levies from life insurers under
the provisions of the 1986 Financial Services Act. It can treat the levy as
a management expense, which makes it eligible for tax relief.
Other life insurance company contributions to the investors' compensation
scheme, which are not imposed under the terms of the scheme, do not qualify
for tax relief.
However, under the new concession, contributions paid under the rules of a
Lautro imposed levy introduced in December last year can now be treated as
expenses of management.
The compensation scheme, which was established in 1988, provides
compensation to investors for otherwise unrecoverable losses.
The costs of compensation are allocable under the rules between the members
of the various self-regulating organisations and bodies regulated directly
by the Securities and Investments Board.
The regulations allowing tax relief on Lautro indemnity levies extend the
concessions already available under the 1975 Policyholders Protection Act
and the Investments Board scheme created by the 1986 Financial Services Act.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Electricity regulator angers MPs: Littlechild spurns role in
promoting coal - Controversy over opencast proposals - Clarke preferred
'gradual closure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday
declined to take a direct role in promoting greater use of coal in power
generation in order to save pits from closure.
He told a House of Commons inquiry: 'My job is to protect the electricity
consumer. Responsibility for the coal closures lies with the secretary of
state for trade and industry and British Coal.'
In the face of repeated questioning by backbench MPs on the trade and
industry select committee, Prof Littlechild said that neither the
Electricity Act nor his understanding of the role of a regulator permitted
him to prescribe what the UK's energy mix should be, or to dictate what
power stations should be built.
Contrary to the perception that he could intervene in electricity industry
decisions, his job was to remove obstacles in the market so that competition
could determine which types of fuel were best.
His stand infuriated MPs. Mr Cranley Onslow, Tory MP for Woking, described
it as 'a cop-out'. Others referred to his 'blind faith in the market'. They
also professed amazement when Prof Littlechild said he had not yet met Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, although he had had
frequent discussions with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister.
Prof Littlechild would not be drawn on whether gas was unfairly taking
market share from coal. He said that, although many people claimed gas was
more expensive than coal, there was also evidence to the contrary and the
situation was not clear-cut. There was no such thing as 'a single price' for
electricity.
The regulator is currently conducting an inquiry on whether electricity
distributors are living up to their licence requirement to purchase
electricity economically. He will report his initial findings next month.
MPs accused Prof Littlechild of dragging his feet and preparing of producing
a report that would be 'too late'.
He replied that he wanted to take as broad a view as possible of the
electricity companies' purchasing practices, and not just respond to
particular concerns.
He said: 'I want to make clear that my review is of the economic purchasing
obligation, not a general review of the case for gas against coal.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / Executives land in back seats with air-fare curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS TRAVELLERS are getting a taste of life at the back of the aircraft
as companies cut their spending on air fares in the struggle to control
costs, according to a survey by Mori for the Wagons-lits travel group.
But many senior executives have held on to their travel privileges - and
they rarely come back with gifts for the secretaries who book their flights
and hotels.
Nearly half the 400 senior executives and secretaries surveyed said their
companies were instructing travellers to use cheaper hotels and flights.
One traveller complained about 'the party of ball-bearing salesmen who are
always checking in in front of me'. Another said: 'I am dying to find out
what anything other than baggage class is like on any aeroplane.'
Some companies did their best to soften the blow. A senior executive said:
'We amended our air travel policy - except if you had a bad back, then you
could still be in first. We had an amazing number of people with a bad
back.'
About 30 per cent of businesses surveyed said everyone travelled in the same
class, regardless of their position, but in most organisations the
recognition of status had survived the recession. Nearly 60 per cent said
status in the organisation dictated class of travel.
Those who travel first class and stay in the best hotels have only a hazy
notion of how their travel is organised. Most of the details are handled by
secretaries.
Nearly two thirds of the secretaries influence their company's choice of
travel agent. One senior manager said: 'I've got secretaries who will sit
there and say 'I don't want to use these people' and then we won't use them.
It's as simple as that.'
Another executive said: 'My secretary organises it all. She will ensure I
get whatever I want at whatever time I want it.'
More than 80 per cent of travellers relied on secretaries to check their
travel details, yet only 7 per cent of the secretaries said their bosses
regularly returned with a gift. Half said they had never received anything.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX TRAINING and Enterprise Councils in areas that will be affected by the
first 10 coal-mine closures presented the government yesterday with action
plans designed to help those communities.
Tecs - the employer-led bodies that deliver government training schemes -
have been asked to organise and co-ordinate measures to alleviate
unemployment among former miners. The government has allocated Pounds 75m
for that over the next two years.
It is understood that action plans, which are at an initial stage, contain
proposals for Tecs to work more closely with the Employment Service, which
runs non-training programmes such as Job Clubs.
They will also work in close partnership with British Coal Enterprise, which
since 1984-85 has run counselling workshops, job shops and training
programmes for former miners.
A wider revision of training programmes for the adult unemployed is expected
to be announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, after
next week's Autumn Statement.
She has been reviewing all provision including Employment Training and
Employment Action, the work experience scheme. How radical the revision will
be will depend on the department's Public Expenditure Survey settlement.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUSTEE Savings Bank is making 440 managers and clerical staff redundant
as part of a merger of its retail banking and insurance operations. The move
is the latest in a series of attempts by banks to reduce staff costs, John
Gapper writes.
TSB said yesterday that 80 senior managers had already left the bank, mostly
by voluntary redundancy. It hoped to reach agreement on voluntary redundancy
with 150 branch managers over the next few months.
The remaining job losses in TSB Retail Banking and Insurance will involve
120 computer staff and 80 clerical staff. The company, which employs 25,000
staff, said it expected most would leave within a year.
The job losses were criticised by the banking union Bifu, which said it
would hold meetings with members employed by TSB Retail Banking and
Insurance over the next few weeks to decide on how to respond.
Ms Jennifer Cole, a Bifu negotiating officer, said the job cuts were
'totally indefensible' and would damage customer service. The union said it
believed there would be further job losses as a result of the operations
merger.
Ms Cole claimed that surplus staff were being told that if redeployment was
not possible within 28 days, they might be sacked before Christmas. That
claim was denied by the bank, which said there was no set timetable of this
kind.

Members of the campaign presented evidence to back up their call for action

which merge the capital cost of photocopying equipment with running costs to

<TEXT>
BIRDS EYE WALLS, the food company, was yesterday fined Pounds 4,400 for
failing to indicate the use of texture soya protein in the names of some of
their beef and chicken products.
The company, part of the Unilever group, was also ordered to pay Pounds
15,000 costs by magistrates in Telford, Shropshire, at the end of a two-day
trial.
Birds Eye Walls had denied seven charges brought by Shropshire County
Council's trading standards department.
Four charges under the food labelling regulations alleged the names used to
describe the products did not mention soya protein, and were 'not
sufficiently precise to tell a buyer the true nature of the food'.

FT  05 NOV 92 / TSB to cut 440 jobs in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEE Savings Bank is making 440 managers and clerical staff redundant as
part of a merger of its retail banking and insurance operations. The move is
the latest in a series of attempts by banks to reduce staff costs, John
Gapper writes.
TSB said yesterday that 80 senior managers had already left the bank, mostly
by voluntary redundancy. It hoped to reach agreement on voluntary redundancy
with 150 branch managers over the next few months.
The remaining job losses in TSB Retail Banking and Insurance will involve
120 computer staff and 80 clerical staff. The company, which employs 25,000
staff, said it expected most of those made redundant would leave within a
year.
The job losses were criticised by the banking union Bifu, which said it
would hold meetings with members employed by TSB Retail Banking and
Insurance over the next few weeks to decide how to respond.
Ms Jennifer Cole, a Bifu negotiating officer, said the job cuts were
'totally indefensible' and would damage customer service. The union said it
believed there would be further job losses as a result of the operations
merger.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Failure to consult unions was 'within law'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Clarke, the chairman of British Coal, yesterday insisted that he had
acted within the law when he omitted to consult unions before announcing
plans to close 31 pits with 30,000 redundancies.
Under fierce questioning from Labour MPs, Mr Clarke told the Commons
employment committee he believed that the 'unprecedented drop' in demand for
coal was a 'special circumstance' and that the law allows that the normal
pit closure procedure need not be followed under such circumstances. He said
the market had dictated that coal production should fall by 30m tons between
the this financial year and next. Mining unions are seeking judicial review
of British Coal's failure to follow agreed consultation procedures. If the
courts back the unions, the consultation procedures might last nine months.
Mr Clarke said British Coal's preference would have been for a 'more gradual
process of closure'. He hinted that the Department of Trade and Industry was
to blame for the announcement last month that the 31 pits would be closed
before the end of March. It had not been possible to begin the closure
programme at British Coal's preferred time of June, with enhanced redundancy
terms. Mr Clarke said that after the closure announcement, the Employment
Department had contacted British Coal to express the view that the
corporation had broken the law. Privatisation of the electricity industry
had led to the drop in market demand for coal and it had not been possible
to begin the closure programme in June. He said the coal industry had
between 20 and 40 years left at current prices, but less at world prices.
That was because British Coal did not have the Pounds 250m to develop
environmentally friendly coal technology and would not have the funds to
invest in deep mine shafts.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Tory ex-minister knew exports could make Iraq arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Clark, a former minister in the Thatcher administration, approved
the export of machine tools to Iraq knowing they could be used to produce
arms, he told an Old Bailey court yesterday.
Mr Clark, who was serving at the Department of Trade and Industry at the
time before moving to the Ministry of Defence, also admitted that he advised
Matrix Churchill and other British toolmakers exporting machines capable of
making arms to draw up specifications emphasising their peaceful, rather
than military, applications.
However, he denied that that showed companies how best to circumvent
government guidelines on arms exports to Iraq.
Mr Clark said he thought the government's guidelines were 'tiresome and
intrusive' and that it was in Britain's best interests for the Iran-Iraq war
to continue as long as possible.
The former minister was giving evidence in the trial of three former
directors of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry machine tool company, who are
accused of deceiving DTI by pretending that equipment exported to Iraq was
for civil, not military, use. Mr Paul Henderson, the company's former
managing director, Mr Trevor Abraham, its former commercial director, and Mr
Peter Allen, the former sales director, all deny breaching export
regulations.
In January 1988 Mr Clark met a number of representatives of the British
machine tool industry, including Mr Henderson, who were concerned that the
DTI had frozen their export licences after earlier shipments had been
suspected by intelligence services of going to Iraqi munitions factories.
Mr Clark told them to draw up specifications with their customers that
emphasised peaceful rather than military purposes.
When something was capable of dual use, the use that was within government
guidelines should be emphasised, Mr Clark told the court.
The suggestion involved 'our old friend 'economical'', he admitted to Mr
Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Henderson.
'Economical with the truth?', Mr Robertson responded.
'With the actualite,' Mr Clark replied.
It was not misleading or dishonest to have made such a suggestion and did
not amount to a tip-off he said. It was, however, a case of 'Whitehall
cosmetics' to keep the records ambiguous, he agreed.
Mr Clark agreed that intelligence reports were confused over whether the
machine tools could be used to make munitions.
The trial continues today.

CALIFORNIAN voters have broken ground by electing two women to the US
Senate, the first time that any state has done so.
'Washington, ready or not, here we come]' declared Mrs Dianne Feinstein,
pictured above (right), at a joint victory rally in San Francisco with
fellow-Democratic Senator-elect Barbara Boxer.
In all, women won six seats in the Senate, often derided as 'the most
exclusive men's club in the world'. Ms Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois
became the first black woman to win a Senate seat, and only the third black
person to serve there.
She had faced controversy in the final weeks of her campaign over alleged
financial irregularities, but overcame them to beat her Republican opponent
Mr Rich Williamson.
Democrat Ms Patty Murray, a self-styled 'mom in tennis shoes', won a Senate
seat from Washington State. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland was
re-elected.
Ms Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, whose seat was not at stake, remains the only
Republican woman senator.
'We will be the Cagney and Lacey one-two punch for the state of California,'
Mrs Feinstein said, referring to the two female detectives in a popular TV
show. Mrs Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, unseated Mr John
Seymour, the Republican picked by Governor Pete Wilson to fill out the rest
of his term in the US Senate. With just two years to run in this partial
term, she will face re-election in 1994.
Well known throughout the state following her failed 1990 campaign for
governor, Mrs Feinstein, 59, won 54 per cent of votes against 37 per cent
for her opponent.
Mrs Boxer, a five-term member of the House of Representatives, narrowly
defeated right-wing Republican Bruce Herschensohn.
She won renown for blowing the whistle on Pentagon spending on overpriced
toilet seats and coffee pots. However, she was rated the biggest spender in
Congress by the National Taxpayers Union.
In one of the bitterest fights, Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, two-term
Republican from New York who spent millions of dollars on negative
television commercials, won a narrow re-election victory over Mr Robert
Abrams, his Democratic challenger. Mr D'Amato took 51 per cent of the vote
against 49 per cent for Mr Abrams.
The plain-spoken Mr D'Amato's favourite campaign greeting was: 'How are ya
doin', Big Guy]' When he gave his victory speech at 1.20 in the morning, the
senator told his supporters: 'I'm not a diplomat. I'm your advocate. I'm a
fighter.'
Mr Abrams, a traditional New York liberal Democrat who is the state's
attorney-general, made much of the repeated investigations into alleged
ethics violations by Mr D'Amato. In exchange, the senator accused Mr Abrams
of not paying his taxes on a country home.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (The Results): Key winners and losers in the
house
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By Congressional district
Alabama 6: Democratic incumbent Ben Erdreich was badly hurt by redistricting
but did better than expected, losing 53 per cent to 47 per cent to
Republican Spencer Bachus.
California 3: Redistricting cut Democrat Vic Fazio's majority to 51 per
cent, his lowest in 8 elections, but he averted a stiff challenge from an
anti-gun control Republican.
California 42: George Brown has rarely had an easy election, but the
chairman of the House science and technology committee survived the damage
caused by House bank overdrafts.
Georgia 3: Republican state legislator Mac Collins ousted incumbent Richard
Ray, who lost much of his old constituency when the district was redrawn.
Georgia 6: Outspoken Republican Newt Gingrich, top of the Democrats' hit
list, survived redistricting, bank overdrafts and a venomous campaign.
Iowa 2: Redistricting forced two incumbents into the same election, and
Republican Jim Nussle edged out Democrat Dave Nagle by just 3,390 votes.
Maine 2: Republican Olympia Snowe recovered to beat Democrat Patrick McGowan
for the second time, helped by a Green candidate drawing votes from her
opponent.
Maryland 1: Redistricting created an incumbent versus incumbent race -
Republican Wayne Gilchrest got the better of Democrat Tom McMillen.
Massachusetts 3: Incumbent Joe Early barely survived a Democratic primary
but, as one of the worst abusers of the House bank, he succumbed to
Republican Peter Blute.
Massachusetts 6: Republican Peter Torkildsen easily defeated incumbent
Nicholas Mavroules, indicted on racketeering, bribery and tax evasion
charges.
Missouri 6: Democratic state legislator Pat Danner ousted Tom Coleman,
senior Republican on the House agriculture committee.
Montana: Redistricting cut Montana to a single House seat; Democrat Pat
Williams defeated fellow incumbent Ron Marlenee.
New York 2: Republican Rick Lazio beat incumbent Tom Downey, who came to
Congress aged 25 in the post-Watergate wave and suffered from the
'Washington insider' label.
New York 14: Last of the liberal Republicans, Bill Green finally lost his
Manhattan Upper East Side district to Democratic city councilwoman Carolyn
Maloney.
Ohio 6: Republican Bob McEwen was a member of the powerful House rules
committee, but his House bank overdrafts dragged him to defeat at the hands
of Ted Strickland.
Ohio 10: Republican Martin Hoke easily beat Mary Rose Oakar, chair of three
House sub-committees but bloodied by her 213 House bank overdrafts.
Pennsylvania 19: Republican Bill Goodling was hurt by his 430 House bank
overdrafts, but won re-election as opposition split between Democrat Paul
Kilker and conservative independent Thomas Humbert.
Texas 2: Democrat Charles Wilson survived the label 'Good Time Charlie' and
held off Republican Donna Peterson, making the most of his clout on the
Appropriations Committee.
Texas 23: Hounded by a three-year FBI investigation and by House bank
overdrafts, Democratic incumbent Albert Bustamante lost this heavily
Democratic district to Republican TV executive Henry Bonilla.
Wisconsin 1: House armed services committee chairman Les Aspin came under
attack for paying more attention to world affairs than to his district, but
survived a Republican challenge.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (The Results): Congress incumbents hang on but
many terms are limited

<TEXT>
ASK American voters what they think of Congress members in general and they
will boo; ask them what they think about their own member in particular and
they will cheer.
Campaign strategists and political pundits agreed that this conventional
wisdom would be turned on its head this year by a wave of anger against
incumbents.
In fact, incumbents fought back, often against damaging personal accusations
and strong challengers, to win re-election. Voters still booed incumbents in
general, by voting overwhelmingly to limit the number of terms that can be
served by elected officials in each of 14 states that had such a proposition
on the ballot.
But, for the most part, they cheered their own representatives, re-electing
most of the incumbents who had seemed at risk.
Many members of Congress saw their electoral majorities reduced, and two
dozen incumbents were defeated in the House of Representatives - a
substantial figure, but a far cry from the dire predictions.
Prominent victims included Mr Richard Ray of Georgia's third Congressional
district, an important voice on defence issues, and Mr Thomas Downey of New
York, a member of the House Ways and Means committee who, only 43, had
served 18 years in the House and built a reputation as a substantial author
of legislation.
Public outrage over the abuse of the generous overdraft facilities for
members by the House's private bank continued to wreak havoc. Among its
victims were Ms Mary Rose Oakar and Mr Bob McEwen, both of Ohio, while Mr
Nicholas Mavroules in Massachusetts and Mr Albert Bustamante in Texas were
laid low by broader accusations of financial misdeeds.
In the Senate, North Carolina voters were deterred from re-electing Mr Terry
Sanford by his recent heart surgery, while Wisconsin's electorate spurned
Senator Bob Kasten in favour of Mr Russ Feingold. Mr John Seymour, as
expected, failed to hold the Senate seat to which Mr Pete Wilson appointed
him when he himself left the Senate to become governor of California.
Yet endangered incumbents from both parties, such as Republican Newt
Gingrich in Georgia and Democrat Romano Mazzoli in Kentucky shook off their
challengers.
None of the senior House leaders who had been tipped as possible upsets,
such as Speaker Tom Foley, Ways and Means committee chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, or Armed Services committee chairman Les Aspin, was defeated.
In the upper chamber, too, Senator John Glenn survived in Ohio, although his
involvement with Mr Charles Keating, head of a collapsed savings and loan
body, stripped him of some of his space hero's aura.
The new House of Representatives is expected to have 105 new members, nearly
a quarter of its 435 total. The 100-member Senate, which elects a third of
its members for six-year terms in every two-yearly election, will see 11 new
members.
Overall, the Congress will wear a different face, with greatly increased
representation for women, Hispanics and African-Americans.
This is particularly true for the Senate. Ms Barbara Mikulski, one of only
two women in the Senate, easily won re-election in Maryland. She will be
joined by two newly elected Democratic women from California - Ms Dianne
Feinstein and Ms Barbara Boxer - as well as by Ms Patty Murray from
Washington state and Ms Carol Moseley Braun from Illinois. Ms Braun will be
the first black woman US senator.
For all this change, and despite the election of a Democrat to the White
House for the first time in 12 years, the new Congress may be prone to the
gridlock that agitated voters during the campaign.
The Democrats will retain solid control of the House. With a few seats still
outstanding, their majority was expected to shrink to from 266 to 259, with
Republican representation growing from 166 to 175. There is also one
independent, Mr Bernard Sanders, the socialist member for Vermont.
In the Senate, the Democrats have, so far, a net gain of one seat. That
could be negated, however, for Senator Wyche Fowler of Georgia narrowly
failed to win an outright majority, and must proceed to a run-off against Mr
Paul Coverdell.
In any event, the Democrats have failed to achieve the 60-member majority
needed to override filibusters. This failure could put a brake on their
ability to push through a sweeping legislative agenda.
Democrats won eight of the 12 governorships up for election on Tuesday,
picking up North Carolina, Missouri and Delaware from the Republicans, but
losing North Dakota.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (The Results): Waiting for Perot to plot path -
The independent's value still unproven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the election over, Mr Ross Perot left the American people as much in
doubt as ever over what he wanted and what he had achieved.
The Texas billionaire's 19m votes - almost exactly 19 per cent of the total
cast in the presidential contest - were not enough to win him a single vote
in the electoral college, but enough to erase the label of 'quitter' that
had stung him after he temporarily withdrew from the election in July.
Mr Perot won more than a quarter of the vote in the western mountain states,
and pushed Governor Bill Clinton into third place in Utah. In Maine, he came
third with 30 per cent, one percentage point behind President George Bush.
The tally left unanswered questions: Was Mr Perot the voice for a fleeting
anger at the system, or for a deeper set of concerns? Were his supporters
driven by his message or lured by his homespun wisecracks? Will he press on
with his campaign? Will his movement fall apart if he does not?
In conceding victory to Mr Clinton on Tuesday night, Mr Perot seemed to
promise to keep up the fight.
'Is this the end or just the beginning? Stay together and you'll be a force
for good for our country and our children. We'll keep it intact,' he told
his supporters at an election-night party in Dallas.
Yesterday morning, however, his son appeared to presage more of a withdrawal
 -somewhat along the lines of his two-month absence from the presidential
campaign this summer - while he waited to see how the new Clinton
administration was performing.
'He said he hopes President Clinton would get these problems fixed and there
wouldn't be a reason for Ross Perot in (the election of) 1996. If he has to
become active again to fix problems, he'll do it, but every year is
different. We'll just have to wait and see,' Mr Ross Perot Jr said.
There is clearly a constituency for a leader or group of leaders focused on
the issue that was at the centre of Mr Perot's campaign: the fast-growing
federal budget deficit.
Two former senators from New England - Republican Mr Warren Rudman,
co-author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit limitation law, and Democrat
Mr Paul Tsongas, candidate for his party's presidential nomination this
spring - have launched a group which will concentrate on the deficit issue.
Neither man has a quarter of Mr Perot's personal electricity, but neither
has his delusions - and each has four times his perseverance.
Some see Mr Perot lending a hand to the new Clinton administration on some
ad hoc task force - possibly in education, his main area of concern after
the deficit.
But he could be destined to follow the path of the black Democrat Mr Jesse
Jackson, a permanent outsider with a devoted following whose role in US
political life is to criticise, not to do.

GHANA'S military leader, Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings, was winning a majority in

years, AP reports from Accra.
The returns showed the 46-year-old former fighter pilot with 53 per cent,
enough to avoid a run-off in three weeks with his leading challenger, Prof
Albert Adu Boahen.
Reuter adds from Accra: Local authorities have declared an overnight curfew
in the central town of Kumasi after opposition supporters rioted in protest

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANZ Grindlays Bank, the Australian-owned group involved in the Bombay
securities scandal, has paid Rs5.06bn (Pounds 116m) to National Housing Bank
(NHB), a central bank subsidiary, against seven disputed cheques in a
package deal to refer the disputed transactions for arbitration, R C Murthy
reports from Bombay.
Grindlays held out for more than a month from complying with a directive of
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to pay the money to NHB, which
claimed Grindlays wrongly credited these seven cheques to the account of Mr
Harshad Mehta, the broker involved in the Rs35bn securities scandal.
The Australian bank had, however, honoured in May an earlier Reserve Bank
directive to make a provision for the Rs5.06bn by bringing funds into India.
Last month, Grindlays admitted at the hearings of a special committee of MPs
to the breach of central bank regulations on forward trading in
non-government securities.
The securities scandal, India's worst, led to the liquidation of two small
banks and losses for financial institutions.
The deal envisages a panel of three arbitrators acceptable to both parties;
and its verdict on the dispute would also be binding on both.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Freer economy pays Syria big dividends: The flow of
investment that has followed reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WELL-SWEPT streets of Damascus are lined with colonnades of cement pipes
for the city's new Dollars 350m Kuwaiti-financed sewage system. Shops are
filled with imported goods and residents of the city travel to work in
luxurious mini-buses.
Applications for foreign investment projects flow into the prime minister's
office. Salaries are still low, power cuts are frequent and the telephones
will not work efficiently until Siemens completes installation of 700,000
lines financed by Kuwait and Qatar. But Damascenes have almost stopped
grumbling.
The economic liberalisation that began in the late 1980s, the gratitude of
Gulf countries for Syria's participation in the anti-Iraq coalition,
increased oil output and a 1991 investment law have all contributed to the
improvement.
Over the past three years, annual inflation has decreased from 35 per cent
to 12 per cent. For years, consumer goods were smuggled from Lebanon into
Syria; now the trade is reversed. And Syrian enthusiasm for shares in new
companies rivals that of the Chinese.
Dr Mohamed al-Imadi, the Syrian economy and foreign trade minister for 14 of
the past 20 years, is one of the engineers of Syria's reforms. Dr Imadi
cites unification of exchange rates, the easing of price controls,
encouragement of new investment and lower government spending as causes for
the improvement.
Syria once had 10 different exchange rates; now the country plans to move
from two to a single, floating exchange rate by 1994. Syria's GNP has grown
an average 24 per cent each year since 1985, while the public sector's share
in the economy has decreased from 48.4 per cent to 38.7 per cent.
But liberalisation has been a slow process. 'We had to change our mentality,
to let people import whatever they wanted to, to stop state monopolies,' Dr
Imadi said.
Reform began in the agricultural sector, which accounts for close to 30 per
cent of Syria's economy. A cautious 1986 law established several
agricultural joint ventures. Farmers were later allowed to import equipment
previously subject to state monopoly. 'In the past two to three years, about
40,000 tractors and agricultural machines have been bought by private
individuals - that's more than the total in the whole country before,' Dr
Imadi said.
The most dramatic step was last year's Investment Law. Mr Mohamed Taghlibi,
the director of the prime minister's Investment Office created by the law,
says that 529 projects have been approved in the past 15 months,
representing a total of SPounds 79.5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in investment and
generating 42,000 jobs. Investors enjoy a tax holiday of up to 10 years,
freedom to import equipment duty-free and repatriate profits in hard
currency.
The law sought an estimated Dollars 75bn held by expatriate Syrians abroad,
but investors include British and Italian poultry producers, Saudi and UAE
owners of transport companies, a Saudi shipping company, and Russian
manufacturers of furniture and drilling equipment. General Motors of the US
is discussing a pick-up truck assembly plant.
Large industrial projects must build their own generating plants while the
government expands the national grid in hopes of doubling electricity
production by 1996. About 650bn cubic meters in natural gas reserves will
help: electricity stations, factories and oil refineries are to be converted
from fuel oil to natural gas over the next five years, freeing up to 150,000
barrels a day of Syrian oil for export.
Oil production, a major hard currency earner, rose to more than 500,000 b/d
this year, of which 200,000 b/d are consumed domestically.
Syrian officials insist all Gulf funding has gone to project finance. 'The
Gulf war got things moving,' said Mr Taghlibi. Saudi Arabia is financing the
Dollars 500m steel mill at al-Zara near Homs and several textile factories.
Kuwait and Abu Dhabi are financing cotton spinning mills, cement factories
and irrigation projects, and the Arab Fund is building a power station and
two dams.
Many Syrians are now asking whether economic liberalisation may also bring
political freedoms. The inner workings of the regime remain mysterious and
the secret police still wield great power. Syrian media remain firmly under
government control and foreign publications are censored. Amnesty
International believes several thousand political prisoners continue to be
held in Syrian jails.
As economic prospects brighten, political stability depends on 62-year-old
President Hafez al-Assad's grip on power.

<TEXT>
MORE thorough inspections of Boeing 747 aircraft in the wake of last month's
crash of an El Al jet in Amsterdam are being strongly urged by the National
Transportation Safety Board, the independent federal agency that
investigates aviation accidents in the US.
The US Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for airline safety
standards, has already issued a directive, ordering carriers to inspect
engine fuse pins made before 1981 after every 500 landings.
The FAA has also demanded increased inspections of engine pins - which help
to attach the engine to the wing of the aircraft - made after 1981.
However, in a letter to the FAA, the NTSB suggests checks should be even
tougher. It recommends inspections after every 100 landings, and that
inspection requirements for pins made after 1981 should be stepped up.
Yesterday the FAA said the NTSB's suggestions were being given 'priority
consideration'. Under US law, the FAA has 90 days to accept or reject the
recommendations, or put forward an alternative.

IN the latest twist in the saga of Brazil's suspended President Fernando
Collor, the prosecution in his impeachment trial yesterday withdrew a key
witness, intimating that it suspected a deal had been reached between the
two men.
The testimony of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the alleged front man in the
multimillion dollar corruption scam which brought down Mr Collor, had been
expected to be crucial to the Senate hearings.
Mr Farias had been expected to turn on his friend and former boss as revenge
for Mr Collor's defence, which pins all blame on his shoulders. Tension was
high in the Senate yesterday before his scheduled appearance since his
brother Augusto had told reporters that his revelations 'would rock the
court'.
'We think it is in Brazil's interest to accelerate this process and we do
not think it will benefit the country to be subject to more spectacular
allegations or to give credence to the chief of a crime racket,' Mr Evandro
Linse Silva explained for the prosecution.
Mr Collor's lawyers said they would not call Mr Farias to testify for the
defence: 'It's too much of a risk', said Mr Evarista de Moraes, 'we don't
know if he'd tell the truth'.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Japan sees jump in trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus increased by 50 per cent in the first six
months of the financial year to stand at Dollars 57.6bn, (Pounds 35.3bn)
according to figures published yesterday by the finance ministry.
Japanese government officials argue that the sharp rise in the value of the
surplus is mainly accounted for by price rises reflecting the strengthening
of the yen and manufacturers shifting to more up-market products.
However, they remain concerned that the rapid growth of the current account
surplus could generate political pressure in Europe and the US to curb
Japanese export growth.
The trade balance for the six months to September rose by 29 per cent to
Dollars 66.2bn compared to the first half of last year, with a 10 per cent
growth in exports to Dollars 163.9bn far outstripping a 0.2 per cent growth
in imports to Dollars 97.6bn.
There was also a sharp turnround in Japan's net exports of capital.
In the first half of last year there was a net inflow of long-term capital
into Japan of Dollars 23.7bn, as Japan's banks retrenched from international
commitments.
However, in the six months to this September there was a net long-term
capital outflow of Dollars 22bn.
Japan's current account surplus in September expanded by 34 per cent from
the year before to Dollars 12bn, with exports up 14.3 per cent at Dollars
30bn and imports 7.1 per cent higher at Dollars 17bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government was yesterday preparing fresh legislation for
the introduction of subscription television after compromise proposals
received approval from government MPs.
The proposals are the latest attempt by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
to meet the demands of existing media groups, potential new entrants and the
government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC).
However, the opposition parties which control the Senate, the upper house of
parliament, responded coolly to the proposals.
The conservative Liberal/National Party coalition and left-wing Australian
Democrats combined to reject an earlier bill because of concern that it
would allow existing broadcasters to dominate subscription services at the
expense of new entrants and the ABC.
The latest proposals attempt to meet these criticisms by providing two
separate four-channel commercial licences, one reserved for new entrants,
plus a two-channel licence and ADollars 12.5m (Pounds 5.4m) start-up funds
for the ABC.
Mr Keating told Labor MPs that Optus, the private telecommunications carrier
which owns the satellites to be used for subscription TV, would use newly
developed digital compression technology rather than the widely used
analogue broadcasting system.
The bill will also provide protection for Australian equipment
manufacturers, and limit foreign investment, probably to a maximum of 35 per
cent of each commercial licence, with a 20 per cent limit on individual
holdings.

FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Bad timing and stark decisions in Chicago
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN farm trade ministers from the US and EC abandoned efforts to solve
their farm subsidy dispute, they knew the world had moved closer to a trade
war.
However, they were almost alone in their knowledge. The television crews had
already begun to focus on the imminent Bill Clinton presidential victory and
the UK's Maastricht vote the following day. Few noticed the lines for a
trade war had been drawn.
For six years, negotiators have tried to complete a trade package to open
markets and inspire global growth. The broader Gatt talks have stalled over
a row between US and EC oilseed producers about subsidies. World trade in
the 1990s, it seems, hangs on the soyabean.
The curious timing of the Chicago talks, stretching over the three days
before the US elections and the Maastricht vote in the UK, seemed to put
unusual pressure on the negotiators to achieve a resolution and deliver a
boost to their fading governments.
In the end, the timing proved unfortunate. The US envoy's negotiating power
ran out with Mr George Bush's projected defeat at the polls. Mr Bush was
notified of the failure of the Chicago talks only hours before he conceded
his Presidency. As he spoke on live television, his chief trade
representative, Mrs Carla Hills, was reviewing her list of possible
sanctions against the EC.
Champagne, flowing at many a Clinton victory celebrations last night, is
expected to be among the first commodities to be sacrificed to a trade war.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, UK prime minister, said yesterday he had contacted US and EC
officials in an attempt to end their dispute over farm produce, but declined
to comment on prospects for a resumption of talks until he had heard a
report from Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister.
Mr Gummer, present at the failed EC-US talks in Chicago, urged parties to
the Gatt talks to get back round the negotiating table because there was a
'deal in sight', despite the threat of a trade war between Europe and the
US.
Calling the prospect of punitive tariffs 'sad', he said: 'I hope we can get
back to the table. It ought not to be like this between friendly nations.'
Blaming the faltering negotiations on the US, he added: 'I said some time
ago we had a mile to go and had to go half a mile each. The Community went
more than its half mile. It seemed to turn out in the end that the US
negotiator didn't have any flexibility and remained unmoved on the crucial
issues.'
Mr Major said he 'had a number of conversations with members of the EC and
the Commission, and also with the US.' He had spoken twice on Tuesday, US
election day, to President George Bush's campaign manager and Mr James
Baker, former secretary of state. Mr Major said Mr Gummer would report to
him on why talks had broken down.
Earlier, a senior official expressed pessimism that the row over farm
subsidies and oilseed production, which is stalling completion of the
current round of Gatt world trade talks, could be resolved. quickly. The UK
government regretted the collapse of the latest round; little hope existed
for an early agreement, he added. Asked about prospects for renewed talks
and eventual agreement, he replied: 'We'll have to wait and see.'

THE international trading system entered dangerous uncharted waters
yesterday, though the failure of EC-US talks in Chicago on reform of
subsidised farm trade contributes as strongly to the danger as the election
in the US of a Democratic president with uncertain trade priorities.
If the Chicago talks had succeeded, officials both in the US and the EC felt
optimistic that wider negotiations under the Uruguay Round on world trade
liberalisation could at least be anchored, for President Clinton to take up
once he takes office in January.
Failure in Chicago means a Clinton administration inherits no binding
obligations from President Bush's trade negotiators; it is hard to believe
he will reject the chance to impose his own (as yet barely defined) trade
priorities on the long-delayed Round talks. More immediately, failure means
yesterday's meeting in Geneva of the 105-country Gatt Council was asked by
the US to sanction retaliation against the EC for its refusal to reform its
oilseeds subsidy regime so as to eliminate damage to US farmers, amounting
to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year.
The oilseeds row, rumbling on for more than five years, and the subject of
two Gatt panel rulings in favour of the US, was apparently the single
remaining obstacle in Chicago to a wider farm trade accord.
Why has the oilseeds dispute been so intractable? Is the US entitled to
demand sanctions, as it did yesterday? How would sanctions affect EC farm
exporters? Would the EC be entitled to retaliate? What would the danger be
of this localised conflict escalating into a fully-fledged international
trade war?
On the first of these questions, the dispute is at the heart of US
frustration with the EC's fiercely protective, and trade distorting, farm
subsidy regime. Significantly, US complaints have been backed by Argentina,
Australia, Brazil and Canada, all significant oilseeds exporters.
The EC, wrestling with powerful internal resistance to reform of the subsidy
regime, is refusing to brook external interference in its reform plans,
finalised in a Common Agriculture Policy package pushed into EC law in July.
But there is little question the US demands are legitimate. Gatt dispute
panel rulings in January 1990 and March this year found in favour of the US,
and urged the EC to 'act expeditiously' to eliminate the damage being done
to US oilseed exporters. US negotiators argue the EC has since then shown no
sign of acting in any way expeditiously.
On this basis, Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, urged countries
represented at yesterday's Gatt Council to 'authorise the US to suspend the
application to the European Community of concessions under the General
Agreement in the amount of Dollars 1bn.'
He said yesterday the US intended for the time being to target 'less than
the full annual amount of the Dollars 1bn', and would delay action for 30
days, hoping the EC would meanwhile agree with the US a 'mutually
satisfactory resolution'. Noting the dangers involved in the US taking
unprecedented action against a Gatt contracting party, Gatt observers were
relieved yesterday that the US had chosen to move with caution.
By keeping the dispute inside Gatt, the US has stopped erosion of Gatt's
authority as the supreme arbitrator in international trade disputes. By
seeking support from the Gatt Council for action, it reduced the danger of
action being seen as unduly inflammatory, and eliminated any grounds on
which the EC could legitimately counter-retaliate.
Mrs Carla Hills, US Trade Representative, has insisted that if GATT rules
are to mean anything at all, the EC must get permission from Gatt to
counter-retaliate, and that they have no grounds to get it.
At present, it is not possible to gauge how damaging to EC farm exporters US
retaliation would be. Total EC farm exports to the US amounted last year to
around Dollars 4bn. In the US administration, it has been agreed to aim a
first 'tranche' of sanctions (prohibitive tariffs on roughly Dollars
300m-Dollars 350m worth of products) against the French, who are seen as the
primary cause of the row, and the Germans, viewed as aiding and abetting
them. The detailed list has been kept under wraps so far, but targeted goods
are likely to be wines and liqueurs such as cognac (though Scotch whisky has
been left off the list), cheeses, and cereals.
The EC has repeatedly warned it would be forced to counter-retaliate if the
US imposed sanctions. Officials say they have drawn up a list of targeted
products, but have released no details. Dangers involved in the EC
retaliating are great, since if it moved without Gatt sanction, it could
trigger the much-feared escalation into trade war. Other disputes that could
quickly become the focus of sanctions involve steel, cereals, timber, salmon
and beef.
'The EC should think extremely carefully before making any precipitate
move,' one Geneva-based observer said yesterday: 'It would push us hard down
the slippery slope towards trade war.'
Escalation would be doubly dangerous at a time of political transition in
the US, when great uncertainty exists over the trade priorities of President
Clinton when he assumes power in January. Among the few trade signals Mr
Clinton has given have been hints he could be much more assertive, and
potentially protectionist, than his predecessor. Whether this proves to be
the case or not, trading partners would arguably be rash to inflame
international trade relations during the hiatus between administrations in
the US.
'The Uruguay Round is drifting rudderless for the next two months,' one
analyst said. 'It will almost certainly be blown off course during that
time, and it would be rash of the EC at the same time to blow the oilseeds
row up into a storm.'

FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: French urge EC to fight 'bad' deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S farm minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, yesterday urged the EC to
'counter-retaliate' against US sanctions in the oilseeds dispute, and
congratulated himself and his predecessors on standing firm against the
'very bad' Gatt deal offered by the US.
Mr Soisson told the French parliament 'the firmness France has shown since
1985 has finally avoided an agreement which would have been very bad for our
agriculture and our economy'. The US demands were 'as unacceptable to France
as to the European Commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry', he said.
In fact, the French government has privately disputed Mr MacSharry's claim
that, except for the impasse over oilseeds, the EC could virtually meet the
US-backed proposals of the Gatt secretariat for agricultural trade reform.
Brussels has contended that recent EC farm policy reforms would reduce
European cereal exports by almost as much as Washington has been seeking.
'We don't see the changes in the common agricultural policy (CAP) producing
a big reduction (in EC cereal exports) from the base period of 1986-90 used
by the US,' one French official said.
Officials claim there were inaccuracies in the recent study by Insee, the
French economic research institute, estimating CAP reform would cut EC
cereal exports from over 30m tonnes in 1991-92 to less than 15m by 1996.
Insee researchers omitted both durum wheat and the grain-growing potential
of the former East Germany in their calculations, officials complain.
In going into the final round of talks with the US, Mr MacSharry had been
wrong to conclude the cereal issue was virtually settled, French officials
say.
Equally, they contend CAP reform would probably produce little reduction in
beef and milk product exports, and nothing at all so far in shipments of
sugar, poultry and pork, products not yet touched by the CAP changes.
In opposing US demands, France claims to have the backing of several
countries on various issues: Ireland on beef, Denmark on milk products, and
Germany on cereal substitutes. For essentially political reasons, Spain's
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has said France could count on Spanish
support in the Gatt talks.

FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US farm groups stand firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US farm groups yesterday were anxious about the potential trade war with the
EC but remained determined in their support for sanctions against European
products.
They have been urging Washington to take action since 1985 when EC subsidies
began to hit their exports. The EC was then their best market, accounting
for half of US oilseeds exports.
In the view of most farm lobbyists, if the Reagan and Bush administrations
were at fault, it was for taking the word of EC officials that their
differences would be resolved 'next year', then the year after that, until
finally it became clear delay would bring no solutions.
The US has now won two rulings by a Gatt dispute settlement panel. Both
times the panel agreed EC subsidies to its oilseeds industry 'impaired' a
1962 agreement to keep the EC oilseeds market open to foreign producers.
The market was never closed, but US producers, who receive the world price
for their soyabeans (now Dollars 530-Dollars 540 a bushel) were competing
against EC producers who could undercut their price.
The subsidies made oilseeds output so lucrative that it soared to an
estimated 13m tonnes.
The American Soya Bean Association, which brought the case to Gatt, was
seeking an agreement which would roll back production to the 1986-1987 level
of 7m-8m tonnes. It rejected an EC offer which might have reduced output to
9.5m tonnes.
'Sanctions are our last resort,' a National Sunflower Association spokesman
said. 'We feel we have no choice.' Between 1976 and 1985, the US exported
about 2m tonnes a year of sunflower seeds to the EC. That market has totally
disappeared.
EC farmers, said Mr Craig Weir, of the ASA, 'have been living in a dream
world.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANKS have failed to make it easier for customers to transfer money across
EC borders over the past five years, according to the European consumers'
organisation.
The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) published a survey
yesterday which indicates that transferring money around the EC is more
costly, less transparent, and no quicker than at the time of its 1987
survey.
The organisation called for legislation to force banks to change their ways,
and to prevent them wriggling out of obligations to customers. It was
particularly worried about the deterioration in information available to
consumers about bank transfers, and the existence of 'hidden commissions' on
some transactions.
The survey was carried out for the European Commission's consumer policy
service. Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for consumer affairs, said
yesterday that legislative action would be taken if banks had not improved
their payment systems by the end of this year.
The Commission published its own guidelines for banks in March and promised
to reassess the situation in the first quarter of 1993. A spokesman for Sir
Leon Brittan said Brussels still believed co-operation with the banks would
be more effective than legislation. 'We don't dispute the findings, we know
things are still wrong, but we have given them (the banks) until the end of
the year to improve their act.'
Beuc sent 160 payments of about Ecu130 (Pounds 104) across Europe, via mail
and electronic transfer, and found the average total commission charged on a
transfer amounted to Ecu18, or 14 per cent, compared with 9 per cent in
1987.
Banks in Britain, Portugal, Italy, France and Ireland were among the most
expensive; the slowest were in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Netherlands.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Unemployment up sharply in west Germany
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in western Germany increased sharply last month, and short-time
working shot up by more than 160 per cent, as the downturn took hold of the
economy.
The number of jobless rose by 46,700 to 1,830,300, according to the Federal
Labour Office, the first time since 1984 there has been an unemployment rise
in October. The unemployment rate in west Germany now stands at 6 per cent,
compared with 5.4 per cent one year ago.
At the same time the numbers on short-time working increased from 122,200 to
326,700, as short shifts were introduced principally in the mechanical
engineering industry, iron and steel, the automobile industry and electrical
engineering.
Although there was a slight fall in the numbers officially unemployed in
east Germany - down 13,300 to 1,097,500, a rate of 13.5 per cent - a key
factor was withdrawal of job seekers from the labour market. The proportion
of women among the jobless in east Germany is almost 65 per cent, reflecting
the disproportionate loss of female employment since communism collapsed.
Mr Heinrich Franke, the president of the Labour Office, stressed that
another 1,700,000 would be registered unemployed in east Germany if it were
not for labour programmes designed to alleviate the jobs crisis there.
Almost 500,000 are taking part in full-time training schemes and 370,000 in
job creation programmes; there are 837,000 on early retirement pensions.
Spending on unemployment benefit and other labour market schemes is expected
to increase by between DM2.4bn and DM3bn (Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.2bn) in both
east and west Germany above the current budget figure because of the
economic downturn, government officials said.
As part of a package of budget savings measures, the government has agreed
to increase unemployment contributions next year from 6.3 to 6.5 per cent of
wages to pay for the excess, but to reduce pensions contributions by the
same amount. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said the shortfall
on pensions would have to be made good in 1994.
The German trade union federation (DGB) called for urgent measures from both
the Bundesbank, in relaxing the current high level of interest rates, and
from the government, in accelerating investment plans, to counteract the
rise in unemployment.

FT  05 NOV 92 / France to strengthen transfusion controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French cabinet yesterday drew up tough rules on the handling of blood
for transfusions to try to avoid a repeat of the scandal in which the
national transfusion service gave HIV-infected blood to more than 1,200
haemophiliacs.
The rules would increase state control over the conditions under which blood
is donated, checked for disease and transported, at a time when EC
single-market regulations will end the monopoly of the national blood
transfusion service.
This has become of high political importance in France, following the
passing of prison sentences on three senior health service officials accused
of criminal negligence and fraud in allowing HIV-contaminated blood to be
distributed. Concern has deepened with the revelation that Institut Merieux,
a leading pharmaceuticals group, had until November 1985 exported blood
without heat-treating it for HIV.
The new rules, which will go before parliament for final approval, forbid
distribution in France of blood from paid donors, punishable by up to five
years in prison and a FFr1m (Pounds 110,000) fine. Blood must be tested for
HIV and treated before being distributed and the identities of donors and
recipients must be kept confidential.
The law also establishes a national blood agency to monitor the collection,
processing and distribution of blood products. It will have a team of
inspectors, responsible for overseeing 163 blood donation centres, and will
be responsible for blood processing laboratories. Previously, the French
blood products system had no central organisation, except for the
transfusion service, responsible solely for stocking and distribution.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Aid shortfall 'will lead to casualties': Vance warns on
Bosnia

<TEXT>
HEAVY casualties in Bosnia-Hercegovina because of the failure to meet its
humanitarian aid needs are inevitable this winter, warned Mr Cyrus Vance,
co-chairman of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia.
While urging the delivery of humanitarian aid to be stepped up to besieged
cities in Bosnia, Mr Vance has called on all three sides in the Bosnian
conflict to accept the proposed constitution as the basis for a political
solution.
But despite optimism expressed, in particular, by Lord Owen, Mr Vance's
co-chairman, that all sides were prepared to use the document as a
negotiating platform, its rejection by Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of
Bosnia's Serbs, threatens this centrepiece of the Geneva conference. The
draft document envisages a state divided into 7-10 provinces along regional
and not ethnic lines.
The hostility of the Bosnian Serbs hardened last weekend when their
assembly, in the north Bosnian town of Prijedor, dismissed any such
constitutional solution imposed on them from outside. The assembly decided
to pull out of the conference unless the talks recognised the self-declared
Serb Republic of Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic has said that the only basis for solution is an agreement signed
in Lisbon on March 18. This agreement, which was first accepted but
subsequently rejected by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of
Bosnia, called for the creation of three ethnic 'cantons' amounting to a de
facto division of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Yesterday Mr Karadzic said Bosnian Serbs had agreed to continue Geneva
negotiations on the understanding that their demand for three to five
cantons would be discussed alongside the proposal by the international
mediators.
In September, Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, and Mr Dobrica Cosic,
his Yugoslav counterpart, signed the Geneva agreement, which would form the
basis of a peace treaty between Serbs and Croats.
This has increased fears among Bosnia's Moslems that Croatia and Yugoslavia
intend to divide the republic between them. But Mr Vance has made it clear
that the international community will not accept this.
Mr Vance also reiterated that the results of 'ethnic cleansing' must be
reversed, although United Nations and European Community officials admit
that enforcing this would be almost impossible, even if a political
breakthrough were achieved in Geneva. Many refugees have nowhere to return
to.
A 200-strong advance party of Canadian troops being sent to northern Bosnia
has been obstructed by local authorities in the region of Banja Luka, a
Serb-held stronghold. General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN force
in Bosnia, is to try over the next two days to resolve deployment problems
amid reports of fighting at Olovo, north of Sarajevo, and at Brcko, northern
Bosnia.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Delors names Dutch PM as 'right' successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday took the unusual
step of naming the prime minister of the Netherlands, Mr Ruud Lubbers, as
his preferred successor, two years before he is due to leave office.
Speaking in a Dutch radio interview on Tuesday, Mr Lubbers' tenth
anniversary in power, Mr Delors said that the Dutch prime minister would be
'the right person in the right place' to take over as Commission president.
Only last summer, at the Lisbon summit, EC leaders agreed to re-appoint Mr
Delors to a further two-year term which would expire at the end of 1994. Mr
Lubbers has made clear that he does not want to make himself eligible for
the Commission presidency until then.
But Mr Delors' remarks aroused interest in Brussels because they come amid
widespread reports that he is frustrated by his decline in influence since
the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty on closer European union.
He is also said to be frustrated by the corresponding assault by several
member states, including Britain, on the powers of the Commission.
An EC official familiar with Mr Delors' thinking described the Commission
president as 'feeling sore'.
Another EC official said Mr Delors was upset that he had not been formally
invited to give a presentation on the need for an EC-wide growth package at
the up-coming Edinburgh summit.
Mr Lubbers is a leading contender for Mr Delors' job. A few days ago,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would make a good Commission president.
As a proven national leader, he would also be a credible defender of
subsidiarity - devolving power from Brussels to the lowest appropriate level
in the Community.
Mr Delors said of Mr Lubbers yesterday: 'He is a true European, has fresh
ideas, and is capable of innovation. He is willing to discuss matters and he
can compromise between the Twelve, an essential quality for the success of
the Community.'
Mr Delors, who has headed the Commission since 1985, is best known for his
successful campaign to introduce a single European market by the end of
1992.

PLANS to simplify the transitional indirect tax system in the European
single market should be pushed through the EC's legislative machinery before
the end of the year, the European Commission said yesterday, Andrew Hill
reports from Brussels.
The Commission approved a new draft directive to help lift the potential
administrative burden on companies, many of which have complained about the
new transitional system for collecting value added tax (VAT) and excise
duties.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC tax commissioner, said the European
Parliament and national officials would begin debating the measure
immediately, and the Commission hopes for unanimous approval from member
states before the old system of border controls is abolished at the end of
the year. The directive should eliminate problems arising from 'triangular
trade'. For example, if a German company occasionally buys goods from a
British group for delivery to a Spanish company, the German company will not
have to register for VAT in Spain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM could launch its ambitious privatisation programme before the end of
this year, according to Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister.
The committee of four 'wise men' appointed to examine privatisation
prospects will submit its preliminary proposals for a first wave of
sell-offs to Mr Maystadt today or tomorrow. The confidential list will
consist mainly of financial institutions, such as savings banks and credit
institutions.
A stake in one of those companies could be advertised for sale before
Christmas to test the water for further privatisation. The government wants
to raise BFr60bn (Pounds 1.18bn) over four years, with a target of BFr25bn
for 1993, to help bring its budget deficit in line with the Maastricht
criteria for European monetary union.
Individual privatisation proposals will need cabinet approval and could
require a parliamentary vote. However, Mr Maystadt said he was convinced
that ideological differences between socialist and Christian Democrat
coalition partners would evaporate once 'concrete proposals' were on the
table.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Flemish Christian Democrat prime minister, set the
debate in motion two weeks ago when he said the state should put no
restrictions on the assets to be sold, the identity of the buyer, or the
proportion of state companies to be privatised. The deputy prime minister,
Mr Guy Coeme, a French-speaking socialist, hit back by arguing that Mr
Dehaene's position did not reflect the government's. Mr Maystadt, of the
francophone Social Christian Party, said 'golden shares' - allowing the
government to retain control of the company - were not ruled out for
sensitive sectors, such as energy.

UKRAINE'S prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, warned yesterday that unless the
west offered further inducements he would have a hard time selling the
strategic arms reduction treaty (Start) to parliament.
'Ukraine is giving up its nuclear umbrella and in exchange we are receiving
only advice, not real aid,' said Mr Kuchma, who was director of the world's
largest missile factory before becoming prime minister last month.
Ukraine has repeatedly promised to become a non-nuclear state and has
already removed all tactical nuclear weapons from its territory. However,
176 inter-continental missiles (ICBMs) remain in Ukraine.
The ICBMs are to be removed and dismantled through a complex process
regulated by Start, the Lisbon protocol (which extended the bilateral Start
treaty to include Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorus) and the non-nuclear
proliferation committee, all of which must be ratified by the legislature.
Russia's parliament ratified the Start treaty yesterday with some
reservation.
'I am for ratification but if we go to parliament with nothing it will be a
fiasco for me and for the president,' Mr Kuchma told journalists.
He said that Ukraine should get security guarantees and economic aid from
the west in exchange for its historically unprecedented renunciation of
nuclear weapons. Revealing the technical expertise which should make him a
tough arms negotiator, Mr Kuchma also gave a detailed critique of the method
for destroying the missile silos proposed by the US.
Ukraine will shortly introduce the coupon and ignore cash currency,
effectively taking the second most powerful former Soviet republic out of
the rouble zone, said Mr Kuchma yesterday. The move is part of his broader
effort to improve his republic's often hostile relationship with Russia,
which has urged Ukraine to introduce a separate currency in order to shield
Russia from Ukraine's spendthrift monetary policy.
Mr Kuchma, who warned of impending economic disaster in Ukraine, said he
would restrict the allocation of credit to faltering state enterprises and
raise the central bank's discount lending rate to at least 50 per cent per
year - at a time when inflation has exceeded that rate per month.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Clinton reassures allies and cautions enemies
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton, the Democratic governor of Arkansas and US president-elect,
set out yesterday to provide reassurance to allies while warning enemies not
to try to take advantage of President George Bush's lame-duck
administration.
'The greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt America's
resolve during this period of transition,' Mr Clinton said, implicitly
targeting Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, who yesterday celebrated the
defeat of President Bush.
'The greatest gesture of goodwill any nation can make toward me is to
continue their full co-operation during this period with our one president,
George Bush.' He said that 'America has only one president at a time, and
that American foreign policy remains solely in his hands'.
Mr Clinton, taking his first steps on the road to inauguration on January
20, also sought to reassure financial markets that he would not embark on a
government spending spree and that his economic policies would not interfere
with the free market.
'We understand the need to pursue stability even as we pursue growth,' he
said.
President Bush, only the fourth elected incumbent to be voted out of the
White House after one term and the first Republican to suffer the fate since
Herbert Hoover in 1932, flew back to Washington after a gracious concession
in Houston.
En route, Mr Bush signalled that he did not plan to bow out entirely in his
last months in office, by vetoing a Dollars 27bn (Pounds 16.5bn) tax bill
sent to him by the last Congress.
In the end, Mr Clinton's margin of victory in the election was less
overwhelming than had appeared likely at one time. Though his margin where
it mattered in the electoral college was decisive - winning 32 states plus
the District of Columbia, worth 370 votes, against 18 states and 168
electors for Mr Bush - he will take over the presidency in January with the
third-lowest score in the popular vote this century.
Near-final figures gave him 43 per cent, against 38 per cent for the
president and 19 per cent for Mr Ross Perot. Exit polls showed Mr Perot's
support, the highest achieved by an independent since Teddy Roosevelt in
1912, was drawn almost equally from the two party candidates. His best
placing was to come second in the Utah contest. Mr Perot gave no real clue
last night as to his future, but he did offer Mr Clinton an unspecified
helping hand.
The combined Clinton-Perot vote, about 62 per cent, was a resounding rebuff
for the person and policies of President Bush, who had taken over 53 per
cent of the popular vote four years ago. One explanation lay in a turn-out
estimated at about 104m, the highest ever, equivalent to about 55 per cent
of registered voters.
Though many state races were very close, Mr Clinton assembled a
geographically well-spread series of victories. He swept the far west and
the north-east, took almost all the big industrial states, broke the
Republican lock on the mountain states and was very competitive in the
south. Mr Bush held on to his adopted home of Texas and to Florida.
There was a subdued reaction to the result on Wall Street, which had been
expecting a Democratic victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down
29.44 at 3,223.04, but most of the decline was blamed on futures-related
programme trading and other stock indices were little changed or slightly
higher.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Major scrapes home on vote: Government beats off rebels by
margin of three to press ahead with treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR survived the most critical test of his political career last
night when the House of Commons voted by a nerve-wrackingly small majority
to back the government's commitment to the Maastricht treaty.
Amid extraordinary scenes at Westminster as cabinet ministers and party
managers struggled until the moment of the vote to contain a rebellion by
Tory Euro-sceptics, MPs decided by 319 to 316 - a margin of just three - to
back resumption of the Maastricht ratification process.
With Liberal Democrats giving crucial support to the government, the MPs
rejected by 319 to 313 an amendment tabled by Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, calling for a halt to ratification until after next month's
Edinburgh summit.
The perilously narrow government majority came after a strong warning from
Mr Major that reneging on the treaty would leave Britain 'scowling' in
frustration on the fringes of Europe. As colleagues judged that his
successful gamble had saved his premiership, the outcome was being claimed
by others as a turning point in the government's battered fortunes.
The victory followed the most intensive and frantic government effort in
recent memory to head off revolt on its own back benches. Sir Norman Fowler,
the Conservative party chairman, said it 'symbolised the support in the
Conservative party' for Mr Major, adding that it would serve to draw a line
under the government's recent rough patch.
The resuIt prompted a bitter attack by the Labour party on the Liberal
Democrats, whose decision to vote with Mr Major gave the prime minister his
majority. Led by Mr Paddy Ashdown, 19 of the 20 Liberal Democrats voted for
the government. Mr Ashdown was accused by Labour's shadow cabinet of
throwing a 'lifeline' to a prime minister who planned to use next week's
Autumn Statement to announce swingeing public spending cuts.
More than 30 Tory Euro-sceptics were unmoved by the day-long mixture of
threats and promises from party managers demanding loyalty to Mr Major. Some
26 defied the prime minister by voting against the government motion.
Another seven abstained.
On Mr Smith's amendment 23 Tories rebelled and 10 abstained. But many Tory
MPs who had previously opposed Maastricht were pressured into giving their
reluctant support to save Mr Major's premiership.
With the Ulster Unionists and other minor parties ranged against it, the
government - which has a paper majority of 21 over all other parties - was
saved only by the votes of the Liberal Democrats.
In a tense and frequently angry debate which quickly became a test of the
prime minister's authority, Mr Major said the outcome could decide Britain's
future in Europe: 'The essential question is simply: are we or are we not in
this country to play a central role in Europe's development?'
In spite of the breathtakingly close finish, ministers said that the vote -
acknowledged by leading Euro-sceptics to have represented their best hope of
wrecking the ratification process - would mark a watershed in the fortunes
of Mr Major's beleaguered government.
The focus of its attention would now switch to promoting economic recovery.
The government's hope is that the endorsement of its European strategy will
help to restore political and economic confidence.
But there was acknowledgement also that the harsh decisions facing the
cabinet later today over the public spending cuts needed before the Autumn
Statement threaten further unrest over coming weeks.
Ministers hope an early interest rate cut and Mr Major's promised economic
recovery package will ease the pain, but are nonetheless bracing themselves
for the possibility of potential Tory revolts once the extent of the
spending curbs becomes apparent.
The prime minister, who gambled on last night's vote in an attempt to
restore his shaky authority at home and to strengthen his negotiating hand
in the Europe, said that the detailed committee stage of the Maastricht bill
would now restart before the Edinburgh summit.
But acutely conscious that yesterday's debate will not calm the Tory back
benches, Downing Street signalled that there would not be a drive to push
through the legislation. Instead MPs can expect only a cursory debate before
Christmas with the most of the detailed committee stage of the legislation
deferred until the new year.
In the preceding debate Mr Major said that an attempt to renege now on the
Maastricht treaty would severely damage Britain's economic prospects.
He added that the 'centralist' Europe feared by the Euro-sceptics was most
likely, 'if we do stand aside and let others run Europe, while Britain
scowls in frustration on the fringes'.
Clashing repeatedly with Mr Smith over the opposition amendment, Mr Major
added: 'I have to tell the House, and I have to tell the country, that we
cannot continue to make a success of our membership of the Community unless
we ratify the treaty that we have agreed to'.

One of the good things about Waiting for God is that, like the sixties
series 'Till Death Us Do Part' and 'Steptoe And Son', it rarely takes the
easy option. It manages to generate laughter while, and even by, dealing
with big and difficult topics. Recently Diana and Tom, two of the more
headstrong inmates of Bayview ('home for the nearly dead') have started
sleeping together, causing deep distaste and outrage among younger people.
Today Diana falls ill, decides she is dying, and asks Tom to get sleeping
pills to help her take matters into her own hands. Is euthanasia funny? If
any programme can make it so this one will (8.30 BBC1).
Rumpole Of The Bailey (9.00 ITV) returned last week with a timely story
about over-keen social workers creating child sex abuse cases by putting
leading questions to children. This week the character who finds plot-lines
overlapping at home and at work is Mr Justice Featherstone (Peter Bowles).
The Channel 4 current affairs series Critical Eye reports on the case of
three ex-members of the Ulster Defence Regiment whose convictions for murder
were quashed on appeal earlier this year (9.00).

FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: 'Very' Burrows - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the uncommunicative title of Very, Jonathan Burrows marks the debut of
his own Dance Group in the harsh world away from from the Royal Ballet.
Burrows is talented, of that there can be no doubt. From his earliest solos
more than a decade ago, he proposed an off-beat and unexpected view of
dancing. His recent pieces - especially rainy morning, cloudy, mild; Hymns
and Stoics - have revealed a dance language markedly original in its ability
to expose feeling, the sheer bloody awkwardness of life, and the distress
that lies just under the skin of social behaviour.
What then to make of the new Very which was seen at The Place at the week's
end. It is more 'difficult' and more hermetic than anything Burrows has
shown us before. I am tempted to call it Very Uncommunicative, because -
great admirer of Burrows though I am - I was puzzled by procedures that
seemed to me wilfully alienating. It would be foolish to ask for narrative
coherence - this is not Burrows' aim - but his earlier works spoke far more
allusively yet potently of relationships, of the difficulty of being.
Very takes place in an arena of light-bulbs at ground level; it involves
Burrows with two favoured dancers, Deborah Jones and Lynne Bristow, and the
composer Matteo Fargion. Fargion's accompaniment is a sequence of
banalities, sung and played from an electronic piano which is manoeuvered
over the dance area as part of the action. The text (largely inaudible)
sounds like extracts from an ancient English/Bulgarian phrase book. The
dance stresses similar banalities - crawling, stamping, fighting, slapping,
running, embracing - shown in deliberately raw fashion.
These are the elements of a human drama, the disjecta membra of emotion,
which Burrows offers to us as pieces of a jigsaw that we are (I imagine)
expected to put together. Or perhaps not. If Burrows' thesis is that life is
made up of mad and unrelated moments, of ceaseless brutality and fatuity, of
irrational breakdown and anguish, then to present it in a London theatre is
an act of supererogation. Life is even nastier outside, and even more
disjunct than this choreographic text. Of course, there are rewards: in the
bravura performances by the dancers, and - most exasperatingly - in the
hints of a larger shape, as Burrows and Lynne Bristow play to each other
throughout the piece like a couple trapped in a relationship.
In ducking away from meaning, Burrows is true to his choreographic process,
but I think he betrays his material by making it so difficult to assess, so
cussed. It is as if, like the exquisitely tiresome Judson Church
experimentalists in New York 30 years ago, he is re-inventing theatrical
movement from its most ordinary elements, and purging dance drama of its
conventions. Ultimately, Very is a meal where we are given the ingredients
rather than the finished dish. Unsatisfying. Very.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: Our Song - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Waterhouse's new play is the kind of maudlin, sentimental piece that
one sometimes forgets is still being written - possibly because there is so
little time for a theatre critic to watch television. However, Our Song is
very professionally crafted, is an ideal vehicle for Peter O'Toole and
introduces a fetching new actress in Tara FitzGerald.
After his success in Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell (also written by Waterhouse),
O'Toole is enjoying an Indian summer on the stage. It is a great pity that
he bowed out of John Osborne's Deja Vu because the text was too long and too
complex. Still, here he is in a simpler play, dominating throughout.
O'Toole plays an ageing advertising man. That is another sign of the
datedness of the piece. One did not realise that they were still around,
even less that people still wrote plays about them. He has to think up
alliterative adjectives for things like Finnegan's Flakes: there are a lot
of 'effs' in the Waterhouse script.
Thus the character, called Roger Piper, strays is in falling for a girl
called Angela. She is Ms FitzGerald, who describes herself as a 'freelance
factotum'. She is always immaculately dressed, usually at someone else's
expense, and Ms FitzGerald can certainly act.
The affair lasted, as Piper never stops telling us, 16 months. It took a lot
of lunches, and even more champagne, to get her into to bed. Consummation
takes place in Edinburgh, shifts to Venice, and is continued in her bed-sit
in Islington. There is a series of flings around Leicester, Nottingham,
Cardiff and Brighton as Piper, having lost his partnership at the agency,
accepts a part-time job as a contributor to some kind of good food guide.
Angela is finally killed in a car crash on the road to Birmingham, Piper
reflecting - among other things - that she was on the M25 when she should
have been on the M1.
The theme is Piper wondering if it was love and, if not, what was it? 'Our
Song' is sung only once, and then only for a few bars. It was plainly a
tempestuous affair, which did not leave much time for gentle smooching.
O'Toole speaks in a slow drawl and moves in a stooping, slightly tortured
way that in the end becomes compelling. He is writing about his experience
on an old-fashioned Imperial Typewriter, which says a lot about the play.
There is not much else. Piper has a very patient, attractive wife, stylishly
played by Lucy Fleming. There is a little bit of poking fun at advertising,
good food guides and restaurants, but remarkably few outright jokes. Our
Song is directed by another old pro, Ned Sherrin. It makes for a pleasant
enough evening, though even at little more than two hours may seem a shade
too long. Ms FitzGerald we shall see again. The point about her Angela is
that if she has any depths, we do not discover them. She conceals them with
great skill.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: Horror and farce in 'The Changeling'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Middleton (1580-1627), official chronologer of the City of London,
was the Hogarth of his time, mixing satire, tragedy and realism. The
Changeling (1622) was one of six plays he wrote with the William Rowley (b.
1585). The Royal Shakespeare Company gave a traditional rendering of this
muscle-bound play: predictable, careful and unmoving.
This is a tragedy of irresponsible immaturity caught in its own
consequences. The action, set in Alicante, feeds on excess. The heroine,
Joanna, has an unwanted fiance and strong desires for another man, Alsemero;
she enlists her ugly servant, De Flores, to murder the affianced, but at the
price, she later discovers, of becoming the murderer's mistress. More deceit
and murder follow, and De Flores takes Joanna's life before taking his own.
A distant subplot, set in an asylum, echoes the main action.
Within this bleak prospect, The Changeling offers scenes which can be played
comically, and Michael Attenborough's thorough production balances the
horror with the farce. On her wedding night, Joanna discovers in Alsemero's
trunk a litmus test for virginity; she takes it in private, fails, tries it
on her virginal maid, and learns to replicate the effects of a positive
result. This scene is caught in a tightening net of deceit, the more
disturbing because inapposite.
The production's chief resources are Cheryl Campbell as the perjured, fickle
Joanna, and Malcolm Storry as the opportune and ill-favoured De Flores.
Together they register both the power of lust and the ease of deceit. Their
central scene follows his murder of her fiance; as he explains what he has
done, she begins to realise the extent of her involvement. While they barter
money, lust and power, both emerge as changelings, capable of expediency and
dispatch.
The third changeling is a lover, Antonio (played with panache by David
Westhead) from the subplot. He disguises himself as a fool in order to court
the asylum-keeper's wife: 'I bring nought but love and his soft wounding
shafts to strike you with.' The bedlam scenes are well policed by Geoffrey
Freshwater and Paul Webster.
Attenborough keeps the action moving, but finds neither character nor scene
as a centre to the play, no quiet level where the imperatives of excess,
appetite and deceit can bargain freely. This is partly Middleton's style,
which offers no moral centre; but a clearer disposition of the characters on
stage would sharpen the action to counteract Middleton's mixture of tedious
discourse and sudden reality. The open set, period costumes and creative
lighting have yet to cohere properly.
But The Changeling remains a powerful play, probing the possibilities of
personal change and the limits of reasonable deceit. It charts ordinary
vices. Joanna's husband asks if she is honest: 'That's a broad question, my
lord.'

<TEXT>
For several years the Next Wave festival at the Brooklyn Academy Of Music
has given a New York home to the more glamorous stars of new music, dance
and theatre: Philip Glass, John Adams and Steve Reich among composers; Mark
Morris and Lucinda Childs among choreographers, Robert Wilson among showmen.
Many of them will be back but perhaps fearing that the Next Wave was
starting to look suspiciously like the Last Wave, the BAM team looked
elsewhere for their opening performances. Fine. There must be life out there
beyond the dazzle, but not in what we were offered: a musical that would
have died as a college show in North Dakota, and a talent spot for
aboriginal Americana.
The latter event was probably inevitable in Columbus year. Robert Mirabel,
who makes and plays his own haunting flutes, trod stealthily among the
thistles of historical sensitivity and the nettles of political correctness:
he conjured delicate sounds and had an engaging manner, though I would
suspect the faunish naivety to have been as carefully applied as the
hairfeathers.
Pura Fe and her companions were a more unsettling case, inviting the
audience to a complacency of guilt and self-congratulation at hearing songs
of death and deracination. They were also not very good - though not quite
as dire as the musical, Frida, bizarrely with Houston Grand Opera behind it,
treating the life of the painter Frida Kahlo with grotesque bio-pic
sentimentality.
Robert Taub's recital at Merkin Hall was in another galaxy. He is a pianist
whose fingers think: every chord comes as something placed and balanced as a
considered moment, and when he speeds, as he often does, it is with the
exhilaration of a flow of ideas. Thought sounds out too in his programming.
Here he began with late Brahms - the Op. 116 Fantasias - after which his
selection of three recently published pieces by Berg sounded sunnily at
ease: a refreshment before, but also a passage towards, the Sonata that Berg
wrote soon afterwards.
Following Berg came Babbitt: the Three Compositions of 1947-8 and a new
piece, Preludes, Interludes, and Postlude, with the interval to stand in for
forty years of achievement in between. Mr Taub's reputation as a Babbitt
player is well earned: he senses the poetry and the wit in the music, and he
thinks the thought.
And Babbitt has responded to his care, accomplishment and devotion with
three works in the last decade, a decade in which his music seems to have
come to an alpine moment of serenity and distant vision. The counterpoint is
light, elegant and courteous in its pace, the rhythm nimble, the large shape
 -in this case a sequence of differently textured preludes with interludes
and postlude all relating - clear.
What remains, of course, is the abstraction, but also the humour and the
jazzy bounce. Babbitt in retirement is letting his geniality show through,
but at the age of 76 he retains all his fitness of mind.

THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS
Michael Mann
SIMPLE MEN
Hal Hartley
LONDON FILM FESITVAL
Actor Daniel Day-Lewis has developed a hyphen in his name. This was the
first thing to worry me about Michael Mann's frontier epic The Last Of The
Mohicans. The second was that it is 'based on the novel by James Fenimore
Cooper and the screenplay by Philip Dunne.'
For the aesthetically alarmist, 'Cooper-Dunne' spells more trouble than
'Day-Lewis'. Both hyphenations originate in Hollywood's attempt to make life
easy for dimwitted audiences. Just as three names are judged de trop for an
actor playing a backwoodsman, so Cooper's mazy-majestic novel, full of
provocative contraries like pro-British jingoism and hints of miscegenating
romance (between white Colonel's daughter Cora and the young Mohican Uncas),
must be ironed into a straight-arrow adventure.
Philip Dunne wrote the 1936 movie which turned Hawkeye into a sort of
frontier Tarzan - Chingachgook's adopted son rather than boon companion -
and then WASP-ishly transferred the love affair with Cora from red man to
white man. Let us take the film on a line-item basis. It looks magnificent.
No hint here of the designer pastels Michael Mann brought to his best-known
screen credit Miami Vice, nor of the high-shine futurism he applied to his
features Thief and Manhunter. The Adirondacks, circa 1757, are photographed
by Dante Spinotti as a green and steaming blur of forest and mountain, mists
and waterfalls. Down in the sylvan pathways are Cora and Alice Munro
(Madeline Stowe, Jhodi May), being escorted towards Dad's fort by British
officer Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington). Camouflaged amid the trees,
ready to ravage or rescue, are the heinous Hurons (pro-French) and the nice
Mohicans (pro-Brit).
As Hawkeye, Day-Lewis sports nipple-length hair, a fetching scowl and an
American accent. He is impenetrable, but in this film that is an asset. He
stands aloof from the flag-waving political correctness of the first half,
where uniformed man is a blot on nature and Chingachgook and Uncas are
scripted for silent monologues of noble savagery. And in the second half
Day-Lewis's sculpted, glowering impassivity is even more crucial. Anything
more fulsome would have spotlighted the silliness of the romance and its
visual consummation in a waterfall-curtained cave. Here Hawkeye and Cora
hurl vows of love at each other before H hurls himself - the movie's most
conspicuous moment of daft bravado - out through the liquid curtain into the
exploding cadenza of foam.
But the higher it climbs, gesturally and geographically, the grander the
film becomes. It is clean out of oxygen, but after the early rightmindedness
we cheer the new lightheadedness. No more piety about man versus nature or
colonisers versus colonised: just man versus man, in blurring permutations
of race and colour, on beetling precipices and giddying crags. Nor is woman
lost in the melee. Madeline Stowe, whose tremulous mezzo-voiced beauty had
critics marking their cards in Unlawful Entry, lends a sterling terror to
Cora, and Jhodi May has an unforgettably poignant moment as she teeters
above a suicide fall.
By this time, of course, Fenimore Cooper's own story lies smashed and
unrecognisable at the bottom of the valley. As a fan, I mourn. Cooper's
prose may be famously ponderous, but a film is still to be made that does
justice to his darkly winding storytelling and to the ambivalence of Natty
Bumppo, that sage and savage once dubbed by Balzac literature's 'moral
hermaphrodite.' (Even the name is gentrified for this movie: he is
'Nathaniel Poe"). But Mann's movie, by the time it starts moving, is at
least a romp. Already Dollars 50m to the good in America, it joins Clint's
Eastwood Unforgiven in suggesting that the long-presumed-dead Western may be
clambering out of its coffin even as we speak.
Like The Last Of The Mohicans, Hal Hartley's Simple Men is about two
siblings seeking their father. Only they are brothers not sisters and they
drift south-easterly into Long Island rather than carving up New York State.
With tomahawks replaced by Tacitean dialogue, the only red man in sight is
the cranky jail-escaped ex-radical their father.
I wanted to like the film. Hartley's first two features, The Unbelievable
Truth and Trust, were riddling tales of criminal and romantic passion set in
Nowhereville, US. Non-sequitur dialogue was played against sweetly vestigial
plot suspense, rather as if Samuel Beckett had been brought in to script a
small-town soap.
But in Simple Men the pretensions have grown large and everything is big
with self-admiring mystery. Failed bank robber Bill (Robert Burke) links up
with bookish brother Joe (William Sage) as they roam their semi-rural Ultima
Thule: a place of strange women (innkeepers, Romanian epileptics,
chain-smoking nuns), strange colour co-ordinations (Hartley never travels
without a suitcaseful of filters) and strangely irritating mantric proverbs.
'There's nothing but trouble and desire,' says someone. 'There's nothing
like a machine to make a man feel insignificant,' says someone else. And
there's nothing more tiresome than a movie that asks its own audience to
join in its search for a plot and purpose. Simple Men, I suspect, is working
out some filial problem of Hartley's that never communicates itself to the
filmgoer: except as an obscurantist version of that old chestnut about the
love of a good woman (or even a bad one) liberating the child from the
tyranny of the parent.
With the London Film Festival beginning today, long tentacles of celluloid
are reaching towards us from the South Bank. We have already hinted at the
event's size. Wrestling with the festival booklet and accompanying
literature, one feels like Captain Nemo shortly after his introduction to
the giant squid.
The strongest focus is on British cinema. As well as flaunting a sponsored
Pounds 10,000-pound cash prize for the UK film voted best by audiences, the
festival showcases some 20 new British features, even if the names of some
directors involved (Susan Seidelman, Krzysztof Zanussi) plant a question
mark over the word 'British'.
But what price nationality in the age of the co-production? At this year's
LFF, medium-hot tickets include a Spanish film starring Terence Stamp and
Patsy Kensit (Pilar Miro's Prince Of Shadows), a French film directed by
Poland's leading woman film-maker (Agniezska Holland's Olivier Olivier), a
Canadian film with a Polish-Australian star (Gosia Dobrowolska in Guy
Maddin's Careful), and Italian actress Stefania Sandrelli revealing all,
including a talent for fluent Spanish, in Bigas Luna's rampant sex comedy
Jamon Jamon.
Happily, there are also mono-cultural masterworks: films like Daniel
Bergman's Sunday's Children, Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju and Akexandre
Rockwell's crackling all-American comedy about film-making In The Soup. And
in the festival section called 'Electronic Image' notions of nationhood
dissolve almost completely. That divisive thing called dialogue is replaced
by the increasingly universal sign-systems of the video and computer age.
Work here by, with or about Derek Jarman, Lindsay Kemp, Nam June Paik and
Japanese computer maestro Yoichiro Kawaguchi.
For the nostalgics among us, there are revivals, restorations and
reconstructions. Visconti's The Leopard; Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The
Director's Version; and British cinema at its most Gainsborough-ish in the
1947 Jassy, newly refurbished by the National Film Archive. Margaret
Lockwood, gorgeous costumes, hissable villains and all that jassy. They
don't make films like that any more, but at least they lovingly restore
them.

While plant and flower sales slumped last year in the US, another section of
the gift market is flourishing: sales of customised baskets and hampers
filled with collections of assorted goodies have increased by 30 per cent.
Personal shoppers spend, typically, between Dollars 30 (Pounds 18.40) and
Dollars 50 each on baskets which may be filled with toiletries, children's
toys or gourmet foods.
At a corporate level, there appear to be few limits on expense or zaniness.
Birthdays, promotions, new company members and corporate anniversaries are
celebrated far more enthusiastically than they are in, for example, the UK
and provide gift basket companies with about half their business.
For the last two years, the US magazine Entrepreneur has named the gift
basket industry as one of its top 10 business opportunities. With low
start-up costs, low risk and low overheads, gift baskets have made an ideal
cottage industry. The idea has yet to take off in the UK where large groups
such as Body Shop and Fortnum and Mason dominate the basket and hamper
scene.
Many of the gift basket success stories are the result of women's efforts to
find a part-time occupation to supplement income.
In many cases working women have relinquished full-time jobs to meet the
demands of the booming cottage industry. Many have found it necessary to
recruit several employees to handle inventory, computerisation of orders and
delivery.
Elizabeth Skelton, associate editor of Gift Basket Review, a national
bi-monthly magazine, has been monitoring the industry in the US for several
years. Her publication has calculated that the average annual income from
assembling gift baskets is now more than Dollars 77,000.
'The downturn in the economy has actually helped the gift basket business,'
says Skelton. 'The shopper is looking for increased value for money today.
Even in a recession people have anniversaries, birthdays and Christmas gifts
to buy. Customised baskets solve holiday shopping problems and have immense
'leave behind' value.'
Lynn Mallotto of Rancho Mirage, California, began her business by producing
a single basket for a friend at a cost of Dollars 17.50, which she sold for
Dollars 35. In 1991 Mallotto's company, The Ultimate Basket, grossed sales
of Dollars 125,000. 'People don't have time to shop for gifts,' she says.
Niche marketing reaps even greater rewards, as Terry August discovered. A
home-based operation, founded in 1987, FanciFull of Los Angeles creates
extravagant gift items for the rich and famous. Specialities include baskets
made for the casts of Ghost, Star Trek V and Twin Peaks.
August's favourite creation is a violin case stuffed with mafia theme items,
red wine and single-stemmed red roses for the crew of Godfather III.
FanciFull grossed sales in excess of Dollars 700,000 last year.
'I started the company as something to do from my house,' says August. But
when a mailing she sent to friends and acquaintances turned up an order for
200 baskets from one company alone, August knew she had more than a
part-time hobby on her hands.
Bobbi Cooper, founder of A Basket Affair, based in Portland Oregon, travels
the country giving demonstrations on how to put baskets together. It was
this talent that landed her the entire gift-giving account of Nike, also
based in Oregon. By researching the company and then presenting carefully
targeted products to almost every department individually, Cooper won the
Nike corporate account which keeps her busy all year round.
At the most extravagant end of the scale, Skelton says she has heard of one
company that created the ultimate car enthusiast's basket: 'They filled a
car with automobile paraphernalia and tied it up with a bow.'
More commonplace are the baskets sold by companies like Snookies Cookies
store. Products range from Dollars 30 to Dollars 300 for a more elaborate
gift with champagne, gourmet foods and designer confectionery.
Says Crispin Gorman, manager of the store in San Francisco, California: 'We
use tea caddies, coffee jars, cookies, candies, chocolates, even some
personal items provided by the customer which are particularly relevant to
the recipient'.
The Los Angeles branch of Snookies does extremely well with the Lover's
Basket. At Dollars 13.95, the customer gets a pair of plastic handcuffs, a
feather, some massage oil, a packet of condoms and a 'lover's manual'.
'It does particularly well at Valentines,' says Gorman.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Illumination from
the stars - A look at the new-found respectability of so-called
'infomercials'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insomniacs will be forgiven for thinking they are having nightmares when
faced with the late-night television image of Dionne Warwick offering a
direct line to psychics through the Psychic Friends Network.
Only marginally more disconcerting is the sight of Michael Landon, the
'Bonanza' and 'Little House on the Prairie' actor, touting the benefits of a
study-aid video series called 'Where There's a Will There's an A'. Landon
died last year.
The growing celebrity presence in infomercials - a form of direct response
marketing generally presented in the format of half-hour television talk
shows or news programmes - bears testament to the medium's new-found
respectability after languishing for years in the nether world of
advertising. Product sales through infomercials are estimated to be at least
Dollars 500m (Pounds 306m) this year, and may run as high as Dollars 1bn.
Infomercials in the US began in 1984 when the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) deregulated the amount of time that broadcast stations
could dedicate to advertisements. They quickly became a popular forum for
advertising dubious products such as miracle cures for baldness and
impotence.
So prominent were the charlatans in the infomercial sector, that they
threatened the industry's survival. There have been dozens of lawsuits
brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and consumer advocate groups
alleging deceptive advertising.
As a result, the industry set up an internal watchdog agency, the National
Infomercial Merchandising Association, in 1990. It offers guidelines against
deceptive practices, endorses legitimate producers and reports violations to
the FTC.
Infomercial makers have also started to employ euphemisms such as 'long-form
marketing programmes' and 'direct response television' in an attempt to
distance themselves from their disreputable past.
The very format, however, presents problems by blurring the line between
advertising and regular television programming. 'I thought I was watching a
cooking show,' said a colleague, who ended up buying an authentic,
hand-hammered wok. 'I was tired and it seemed cheap.'
The recession's impact on the US entertainment industry may explain why
late-night TV viewers now see Larry Hagman and Cher discussing haircare
products. Celebrities can be paid about Dollars 250,000 for a role in an
infomercial, as well as receiving a percentage of the sales. It is estimated
that Cher was paid about Dollars 1m for her part in selling 'Aquasentials'
haircare products.
Money is not the only lure. Martin Sheen reportedly is unpaid for his
performance in an infomercial for 'Personal Power' self-help tapes because
he believes in the product. Jane Fonda uses infomercials to promote her step
work-out and Victoria Principal uses them to sell her skincare line.
Advertisers are drawn to infomercials by the low cost - a 30-minute
infomercial can cost roughly the same as a 30-second network advertising
spot because of differences in production and airtime costs.
The industry is hoping to cement its legitimacy by attracting more
mainstream players. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi last year formed a partnership with
Regal Communications, the largest US infomercial producer, to study
infomercials, but the venture has yet to sign any of Saatchi's leading
clients.
A number of large advertisers have also experimented with the infomercial
format. Earlier this year, Volvo ran an infomercial on safety in southern
California, but the company decided the response was not strong enough to
air its infomercial nationally. Similarly, Club Med has decided to stick
with its traditional 30-second advertising format after a brief foray into
infomercials this year.
While the prospects of luring a significant number of large advertisers to
the infomercial arena remain dim, at least in the short-term, the prospects
are good for industry growth overall thanks to the rapid expansion of US
cable television systems.
Direct response marketing via television infomercials is also making inroads
into the increasingly complex world of European media. One of the companies
leading the fray is Quantum International, a subsidiary of National Media,
based in Philadelphia.
Quantum is licensed by the UK's Independent Television Commission, and
currently broadcasts programmes via three European channels: Lifestyle and
Screensport (both on the Astra satellite) and Super Channel (on Eutelsat).
Their footprints extend from Scandinavia to north Africa, from west Europe
to Russia and beyond. The three channels are each reaching up to 30m homes.
Quantum takes programmes produced by its US parent and re-edits them for
European use. But it is branching out into producing its own infomercials
which, in turn, will be taken by National Media.
Infomercials broadcast across Europe face big obstacles which their US
counterparts need be less concerned with: language and cultural differences,
a plethora of legislation affecting product claims, advertising and
packaging, which vary greatly from country to country.
According to David Carman, Quantum's president: 'Europeans seem to demand a
higher standard of packaging, quality, value for money and service (than
American audiences). All instructions (on the products) must be translated
into all languages; products must meet all regulations whether EC or local;
and our programmes are dubbed into different languages, currently German,
French, Dutch and Swedish.'
Several factors are likely to influence the growth of infomercials in
Europe. Commercial development of digital compression will mean more air
time is available on existing satellites. As both terrestrial and satellite
broadcasting becomes more cluttered and fragmented, advertisers will need
either more sophisticated research or much larger budgets to ensure they are
reaching their putative purchasers. No one is forecasting a return to the
high-spending television advertising budgets of the early 1980s.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Technology: HDTV hits the screens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC engineers and Thomson-CSF Laboratories in Rennes, France have been
demonstrating this week that at least one digital high-definition television
(HDTV) service can be broadcast on a standard eight-megahertz (MHz) channel
used for today's non-satellite TV.
A digital television signal was broadcast from a low-power transmitter at
the BBC's Crystal Palace mast in London.
The signals were received at the BBC's Engineering Research Department and
at a number of other test sites in south London and Surrey.
'This was a real test that demonstrated that this system will work within a
normal television channel,' Henry Price of BBC Engineering said yesterday.
He described the test as a significant step on the way to HDTV, which offers
high-quality pictures if used with a special television.
The compression techniques, along with the transmitting and receiving
equipment, were developed by Thomson-CSF to convey about 60 M bits of
information in a single conventional channel.
The BBC believes that by combining the techniques with digitally compressed
television pictures it would be possible in principle to transmit two HDTV
lines in a single eight-MHz channel.
If the techniques are used to broadcast conventional TV pictures rather than
HDTV pictures some engineers believe up to four channels could be broadcast
in the capacity now occupied by a single channel.
National Transcommunications, the privatised transmitter and engineering arm
of what was the Independent Broadcasting Authority, has also been carrying
out compression work under its Spectre project. Spectre has shown that
digital channels can be broadcast alongside existing terrestrial services
without causing interference.
Because viewers will need decoders to receive either HDTV or a wider range
of new compressed channels, engineers suggest that it may take until the end
of the decade before fully commercial services are launched using the
technology.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Technology: Making tracks in the freight industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Access to electronic trading systems - not for dealing in shares, but for
such purposes as electronic mail, bulletin boards, and electronic data
interchange (EDI) - is increasingly important for many business sectors. For
the hundreds of players in Europe's fast changing freight industry, however,
it is becoming a question of survival.
Tackling the problem without the technical or financial resources to make
the right decisions on an integrated electronic trading system can be a
nightmare for smaller companies, and is no easy task either for their bigger
counterparts.
Over the past year the British International Freight Association has stolen
a march over its European rivals with the launch of BIFAnet, an electronic
trading service developed jointly with General Electric Information Services
(GEIS), a division of General Electric of the US.
The freight industry is a classic example of a sector where electronic
trading can produce more efficient links between shippers, forwarders,
carriers, traders and consignees. 'We're focusing in on an enormous paper
chain,' says Geoff Brickell, UK sales development manager at GEIS.
BIFAnet is a unique development for a trade association in the international
trade and transportation sector, according to Jim White, BIFA director-
general. 'The future of freight intermediaries will depend on having control
of information that relates to the supply system. If they don't they may end
up being cut out of the loop altogether.'
Freight forwarders have to communicate with all members of the supply chain,
and are moving information around for every shipment. But with half of the
900 members employing 10 people or less, they were looking to the
association for a modern electronic solution.
With software designed by the association, BIFAnet uses the EDI, E-mail and
bulletin board services provided via the GEIS global network to provide an
integrated electronic trading service. 'It's a stepping stone to paperless
trading,' says White. 'If members had no computer technology before, they
now have access to the world's largest EDI network for less than Pounds
2,000 for the hardware and software.'
BIFAnet was launched last November, but began to get going in May and June.
About 60 members are now signed up, and White hopes to reach a target of 100
by the end of the year.
The launch was timely, ahead of the Single European Market reforms which
could put further pressure on smaller players in the freight industry. There
has been keen interest in the system from other European freight trade
associations, says White.
GEIS, which sees its mission as providing value-added services to enable
electronic commerce to function, identified the transportation sector as a
new worldwide opportunity three years ago, says Brickell.
But GEIS is also keeping a close eye on other high-volume sectors where
relationships are becoming more complex as manufacturing patterns change, or
where companies are altering their distribution methods in line with the
Single Market.
The network of component manufacturers, distributors, contract manufacturers
and customers in the electronics industry is a case in point. The industry,
rather aptly, is finally coming round in a big way to electronic trading,
says Brickell.
And as more companies in such sectors start trading electronically, users
may feel less need for the 'belt-and-braces' approach now prevalent in much
of industry.
Each EDI transaction may in itself be highly efficient, but is usually
accompanied by between three and eight associated communications - phone
calls, faxes and queries - which may not strictly be necessary.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Absent figures that add up to an
incomplete picture - The case for the disclosure of discretionary investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LETZA and IAIN WARD-CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BLOW was dealt to the health of the UK economy last week with the latest
financial reporting standard launched by the Accounting Standards Board. The
decision to drop its proposal for the disclosure of discretionary investment
will divert attention from the importance of long-term financial measures
for corporate prospects.
For over two decades the accountancy profession has been continually hounded
by City commentators for the lack of reliability in UK financial reporting.
In times of recession, it becomes an even greater focus of attention as
large numbers of companies fail after reporting seemingly healthy profits.
That suggests the need for reform.
Those who simply argue for greater skill among readers of accounts in
interpreting existing financial information take a defensive position used
over more than 20 years by the accountancy profession and provide little by
way of solutions.
It must be questioned whether in today's globalised, fast-moving and
risk-infested business environment 'the figures speak for themselves'. While
greater knowledge and understanding of accountancy can undoubtedly be
useful, more fundamental questions need to be asked.
Most important is: what is the purpose of accounting? On the one hand,
accounting may be viewed as a process of reporting on the 'stewardship' role
of management. This can be adequately accomplished by the pretty basic
reporting of past financial transactions, most frequently expressed in terms
of the 'historical' monetary exchange which occurred at the time of the
transactions.
Enshrined in law, this approach has the so-called virtues of verifiability
and objectivity. But only a nodding acquaintance with accounting reveals
that this supposedly objective reporting process is shot through with highly
subjective estimates and expressions of opinion.
On the other hand, accounting may be viewed as a much more sophisticated
process of providing information for decision-making. This requires an
altogether more dynamic type of information.
Nowadays, most authoritative commentators, both from business and commerce
and from academia, recognise the interest in and right to corporate
information of a much wider group of parties than merely the owners or
shareholders of a company.
This wider group - the stakeholders - embraces creditors, customers,
employees, the government and society at large. Where stakeholders in a
company have an intimate knowledge of the internal workings of the company,
it can be argued that they have no need for sophisticated accounting
information to be made publicly available. The information necessary to
guide these stakeholders can be obtained elsewhere.
That is certainly the case in a number of countries. In Germany - where
there are less than one-fifth the number of listed companies than in the UK
 -the various stakeholders generally have representation at board level and
have access to information well beyond that contained in the published
accounts. It is therefore not surprising that published financial reports in
Germany fulfil only the basic stewardship reporting function, which is
reflected in their format and contents. 'Decision usefulness' is not a
primary objective.
In the UK a different accounting tradition has developed. The number of
listed companies is far greater and the information needs of users, who tend
not to be party to the internal workings of the company, are far more
extensive. As a result, there is a much greater need for annual reports to
provide users with relevant and reliable information to guide them in their
decision-making. Accounts have decision usefulness as a primary goal.
But if UK published financial statements must attempt both to satisfy
accounting for stewardship and to supply information to help
decision-making, what is being done to provide stakeholders with reliable
and relevant information?
First, there is the degree to which 'comparability' between different
companies' accounts has been improved, and the narrowing of areas of
difference and choice in accounting treatments, which will hopefully reduce
the opportunity for 'creative accounting'.
In recent years, the accounting profession has made considerable progress on
this issue with the formation of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and
associated bodies - though not without considerable external application of
the whip and spur. The framework for setting accounting standards is now
much tighter and seems to be operating with much more effective teeth than
the regime it replaced.
Second, there is the issue of the provision to users of information about
long-term, sustainable performance. Analysts and market commentators are
currently viewed as being too preoccupied with quick fix, short-term
measures.
Given the apparent (and widely acknowledged) impossibility of accountants
ever being able to provide a reliable, one-measure figure for earnings, it
does seem rather bizarre that analysts and others should attach so much
importance to it. To be fair, this is an attitude with which business has
seemed at times all too ready to conspire.
What the wider stakeholder needs is additional information on activities
that will lead to long-term sustainable performance rather than short-term
measures. These include research and development, advertising and other
marketing development, personnel development and Total Quality issues.
These are activities which have traditionally been written off by companies,
yet which are clearly investments for future health, as opposed to the
essentially historical financial information which is currently predominant
in accounts.
The need for stakeholders to be able to scrutinise these items of
expenditure is sufficiently important to overrule companies' resistance to
disclose such information.
Several recent research studies have demonstrated a link between some of
these issues and sustainable long-term financial performance. Work carried
out at the Bradford University Management Centre has shown a strong
correlation between use of Total Quality Management (TQM) techniques and
significantly better than industry-average financial performance. The study
showed that 29 companies with TQM programmes were well above the industry
norm over five years for profitability, return on capital employed and
earnings.
Quantification and disclosure of these expenses was one of the features of
the first Financial Reporting Exposure Draft (FRED 1) published by the ASB,
which it called 'discretionary revenue investments'. Unfortunately, the ASB
dropped these proposals in the face of criticism by industry and little
public support, arguably so it could help build support in its campaign to
abolish the much-abused extraordinary item, which was perceived as a more
important concern.
Accountancy is a conservative profession and is notoriously slow to adopt
new attitudes and practices. Under the present system, companies which
invest in anything other than tangible fixed assets in order to achieve
long-term, sustainable performance are to a large extent penalised in the
short-term.
We believe this will continue to be the case until sufficient attention is
given to the identification, measurement and disclosure of these highly
significant and potentially desirable investments by business. The present
system can only act to the detriment of the long-term health of our economy.

FT  05 NOV 92 / GM lauds 'low-cost' UK plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Vauxhall car assembly plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port are among
General Motors' 'lowest-cost plants in Europe', Mr Louis Hughes, president
of GM Europe, said yesterday.
Both, he said, had significant cost advantages over Opel plants producing
the same cars in Germany and Belgium.
Mr Nick Reilly, director of the Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port,
Cheshire, said that since sterling's devaluation, the UK plant had produced
Vauxhall/Opel Astras for DM900 (Pounds 364.30) a car less than GM's Astra
assembly plants in Bochum, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium.
The Luton plant, which assembles the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra,
established a significant production cost advantage over GM's Opel plant at
Russelsheim, near Frankfurt, before sterling's devaluation. GM warned its
German workforce earlier this year that it was costing DM750 a car more to
produce a Cavalier/Vectra at Russelsheim than at Luton.
GM will cut the 18,000-strong production workforce at the German plant by
about a third over the next five years to combat high costs and remain
competitive.
Speaking at Ellesmere Port, where GM opened its new Pounds 190m engine plant
yesterday, Mr Hughes said absenteeism at the UK plants was below 5 per cent,
compared with 10 per cent in Germany.
The two UK plants are matching the quality levels of GM's continental
European plants and have begun to export large volumes to continental
European markets in the past two years. Productivity is still lower at UK
plants, but the gap is narrowing. They now have substantially lower total
production costs because of lower UK labour costs, an advantage reinforced
by the devaluation of the pound.
Mr Hughes said GM wanted to buy more components in the UK. The company has
transferred the purchase of about Pounds 200m worth of components annually
to the UK since 1988.
Mr Bill Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman, said the company's UK vehicle output was
at a record high and would increase by more than 14 per cent this year to
300,000 from 262,000 in 1991.
Vauxhall has maintained full-time working at Luton and Ellesmere Port during
the recession, contrasting with recent short-time work introduced by Ford
and Rover.
GM remains pessimistic about the prospects for an early recovery in UK new
car demand. Mr Hughes said sales were not expected 'to be much higher than
1.6m' next year, compared with fewer than 1.55m this year and 2.3m in the
peak year of 1989.
New car sales in west Europe will fall this year to 13.3m from 13.4m last
year, Mr Hughes said, and 'could be clearly under 13m' in 1993 'if consumer
uncertainty continues in some key countries'.
Vauxhall launched a thinly veiled attack on Ford, the UK new car market
leader, for failing to follow its example - picked up by Rover, Peugeot and
Renault - by reducing new-car list prices and dealer profit margins to
reduce the need for buyers to haggle over a 'fair price'.
Mr Ebbert said 'some manufacturers' resisted change because reduced dealer
margins adversely affected used-car residual values.
'I believe that distress marketing with frequent price cuts is much more
damaging,' he said.
Ford has been forced to cut prices on selected models on several occasions
in the past two years to reduce stocks.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Vauxhall returns to engine making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors started production yesterday at its Pounds 190m engine
facility at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire - the single biggest investment by the
world's leading vehicle maker in the UK.
The complex, with 450 workers, will produce 135,000 engines a year when it
reaches full production in 1994-95.
It will make a new range of top-of-the-line V6 engines developed during a
four-year programme at the company's European research and development
centre at Russelsheim near Frankfurt.
The investment at Ellesmere Port, GM's sole source for the new V6 engines,
marks a watershed for the US group's operations in the UK.
It reverses the company's retreat from manufacturing in Britain up to the
mid 1980s. GM ceased all UK car engine making in 1984.
The V6 plant marks the first time GM has chosen the UK as sole source for a
principal component for its European vehicle operations.
The site was selected against fierce competition from Kaiserslautern, one of
GM's leading German engine and components plants.
The facility has extensive machining operations for main engine components
including blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts and con-rods.
It has capacity to produce 500,000 cylinder heads and 1m camshafts a year,
with some output being exported to GM engine plants in Germany and Brazil.
The V6 engines are destined for GM's European Opel/Vauxhall executive cars
and for Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker in which GM holds a 50 per
cent stake and management control.
The 170-brake-horsepower V6 engine will be fitted in a top-of-the-range
model of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra large family car to be launched
early next year. It will then go into the next generation Vauxhall
Carlton/Opel Omega executive car, to be launched in 1994.
A variant will be used by Saab when it replaces its ageing Saab 900 range in
the second half of next year.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Community seeks companies' skills, not cash: Chris Tighe
reports from a disadvantaged North Shields estate that wants business on
tap, not on top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WINDOWS of the Cedarwood drop-in centre on North Shields' Meadowell
estate are stained white from anti-graffiti solvent and clouded with damp
from the washing spinning in the machine in an adjacent corridor.
The handleless door of the meeting room has to be held shut to prevent an
invasion of shrieking toddlers, but the concentration of the senior
businessmen inside is unbroken.
With a combined annual turnover totalling many billions of pounds, they went
last week to the Meadowell estate at the invitation of Prince Charles,
Business in the Community's president, to discover the corporate benefits
and practical difficulties of business involvement with the community.
The Tyneside visit was one of 16 'Seeing is Believing' trips run this year
by BIC, founded to encourage companies to make community involvement an
integral part of successful business practice. Many trips take high-flying
executives to deprived areas they would never otherwise see.
The visit to the Meadowell estate, scene of riots last September, was
amiable, not confrontational. Some executives chuckled when Mrs Kath
Thompson, one of the residents doggedly working to improve the estate,
smilingly suggested a model for companies' involvement in the community: 'on
tap, not on top'.
They murmured assent when the visit's leader - Mr Richard Maudslay, managing
director of Rolls-Royce's Industrial Power Group - spoke of businesspeople's
fear that community involvement just means being asked for money.
Mr Maudslay's message, echoed throughout the trip, was that business has
much else, in skills, resources, knowhow and influence, to contribute to the
community.
A variation on that theme came from the Rev David Peel, the Cedarwood
Centre's project leader: 'You can do things to people, for people or with
people; we try to do things with people.'
BIC trips are rich in contrasts. Among the visitors to south Meadowell's
streets of boarded-up, vandalised houses was Mr Henry Clarke, deputy chief
executive of The Crown Estate, which includes such upmarket addresses as
Pall Mall and St James's in London.
Treasury deputy secretary Mr Michael Scholar, responsible for the pay and
conditions of 580,000 civil servants, listened attentively as a local
employer explained the 'benefits trap', which makes some residents poorer if
they take a job.
Mr Maudslay spoke of the 'terrible culture clash' when executives, keyed up
by recession and redundancies to make every minute count, tried to cope with
unstructured meetings attended by unemployed people with endless time. The
visitors, who will report back to Prince Charles at a seminar next month,
left Meadowell thoughtful but not despairing.
The enthusiasm of residents such as Mrs Thompson impressed many.
Mr Mark Higson, operations director of Courtaulds subsidiary International
Paint, said: 'I'm fairly shocked by the state of Meadowell but I'm very
struck by the idea (that) business needs to offer practical help, not a
cheque book.'
Several believed that lack of work was the root of Meadowell's ills.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Minister visits closure-threat London hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT decisions on closures of London hospitals are likely to be
completed about the end of January, Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister,
said yesterday.
Dr Mawhinney has this week begun visiting all hospitals identified for
closure or change in Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report into London healthcare
published last month.
He began on Tuesday at St Thomas' - which the report recommends should
amalgamate on a single site with Guy's - and yesterday visited University
College and Middlesex hospitals. The report recommends that these should be
rationalised with other specialist services on the University College site.
Dr Mawhinney said his visits would enable managers and staff to raise any
points they wished about the Tomlinson report's proposals, which would lead
to a reduction of about 2,500 hospital beds in London.
One of his next visits will be to St Bartholomew's, where a campaign has
been launched against a recommendation to close the 800-year-old hospital.
The government has emphasised that the Tomlinson recommendations are not
government policy, and says decisions on any closures will be made only
after Dr Mawhinney completes his programme of visits.
Ministers recognise, however, that it will then be necessary to act quickly
and end the uncertainty over threatened hospitals.
A disproportionate level of London's health resources is spent on hospital
services, and the Tomlinson report argues for a shift towards the capital's
relatively underdeveloped general practitioner and community services.
Many National Health Service staff are concerned that, at a time of acute
public-spending constraints, money released by hospital closures might not
be reinvested in better services at community level.
Dr Mawhinney said London, with 15 per cent of the national population,
consumed 20 per cent of healthcare resources. He did not think any minister
could give an 'unqualified guarantee' that its ratio would remain inviolate.

FT  05 NOV 92 / People: Morgan Grenfell tempts former ambassador
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Whitehead, British ambassador to Tokyo for the past six years,
recalls how, in the early 1970s, a group of his FCO colleagues chose to move
into City merchant banks which were looking to spread their wings
internationally. 'I was slightly tempted at the time and, if I had gone, it
might well have been to Morgan Grenfell.'
Now Sir John, who retired in August, is this week taking up the role of
senior adviser to the Morgan Grenfell Group, pursuing what he describes as
'almost a sentimental attachment as well as a nice offer'. His elder son,
Simon, who happens already to be at Morgan on the international banking
side, recently returned from two years in Moscow.
Other senior advisers to Morgan Grenfell include Lord Pennock, former deputy
chairman of ICI, and Sir Peter Carey, former permanent secretary at the DTI.
In what he says will be the largest commitment in his new incarnation in the
private sector, Sir John will initially be advising the group on Japan, a
country in which he has lived for a total of 17 years.
But he thinks he can be of use in a much broader role, with an input into
business in the whole of the Asia Pacific region as well as gradually in
Europe.
'His name will embellish the notepaper but we also expect him to do a lot
more,' says Michael Dobson, Morgan's chief executive.
Usefully for Morgan, which is now owned by Deutsche Bank, Sir John speaks
German, having spent four years in Bonn as well as having read the subject
at Oxford. He says he has yet to meet Deutsche's boss, Hilmar Kopper.
A tireless promoter of UK-Japan trade - the ex-ambassador points out that
during his tour Japan moved from being the UK's 16th to its ninth best
export market (after the US and seven European nations) - Sir John is also
advising the President of the Board of Trade on British export policy as
well as helping the Welsh Development Agency with its inward investment
programme.

materials group is under new management.
With Neville Simms, group chief executive, firmly in the driving seat at the
group's stately Hilton Hall headquarters in Staffordshire, Jackson's
departure reflects his close partnership with Sir Eric Pountain, the
colourful Black Country boss who steered Tarmac to success in the 1980s.
Earlier this year, however, against a backdrop of collapsing profits,
Pountain agreed to step aside to become part-time chairman. Jackson, with
Tarmac for 16 years, played a big role in its expansion and helped lead the
fight to win the channel tunnel contract. He cites 'managerial and
procedural changes' as the reason for his departure and is being replaced by

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Smith, a computer industry veteran of 25 years' standing, has been
given the task of building McDonnell Douglas Information Systems' share of
the UK's fastest growing data processing business.
Now 49, he has been appointed director of the US company's facilities
management business based at group headquarters in Hemel Hempstead,
returning to the UK after a tour of duty as general manager of MDIS'
Australasian operations.
Facilities management, in which a company agrees to contract out its data
processing operations to a computing services company for a fee, has become
one of the hottest topics in data processing as companies retreat from
services activities to concentrate on their core businesses. Some estimates
put the potential for growth in the market in the UK at at least 30 per cent
a year.
The UK market leader is Hoskyns, owned by CGS of France, but MDIS already
has some 10 contracts each valued between Pounds 0.5m and Pounds 7m. It aims
to concentrate on areas it knows well - local authorities, central
government, the police and health services (it was a runner-up in the London
Ambulance Service contract) - rather than large general FM contracts.
Smith has spent his life in the services business, having trained in hotel
management ('so I cook and drink wine very well'), before moving into the
computer business with posts in NCR and Honeywell Bull.

</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID GREEN

<TEXT>
THE leading critic of a computerised safety system being developed for the
Sizewell B nuclear power station has withdrawn his concern about the design.
Professor John Cullyer, professor of electronics at Warwick University and a
leading figure in the British Computer Society, says he is satisfied that
the Pounds 25m system will be acceptably safe.
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate has yet to approve the system, but
expects to do so within months.
The change of mind by Prof Cullyer, chairman of the society's systems task
force, follows a seminar arranged by the Royal Academy and addressed by
speakers from Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generating company building
Sizewell B.
Prof Cullyer said yesterday that more details about the system had been
given and he was no longer worried. The society task force, however, was not
due to meet for another two weeks. Prof Cullyer could not say whether it
would come to the same conclusion.
The society has criticised secrecy surrounding the design of the complex
computer system, which will be one of the main lines of defence against an
accident at Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised-water-reactor nuclear
power station. The system, being designed by Westinghouse of the US,
involves 300 microprocessors and 98,000 lines of computer software code.
Design details will remain secret for commercial reasons.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Maxwell's Death - The First Anniversary: Private empire
consumed Pounds 1.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Maxwell's private companies consumed nearly Pounds 1.7bn in a doomed
attempt to survive during the last year of the life of the tycoon, who died
a year ago today.
The total is nearly double the estimates compiled four months ago when his
two youngest sons, Kevin and Ian, were arrested. Most of the money went to
banks to repay loans and pay interest on debt.
It is now clear that little is likely to be recovered from the Maxwell
pension funds and the public companies - Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell
Communication Corporation - which suffered combined losses of about Pounds
1bn in cash, assets and broken contracts.
Attempts to recover the money have stalled as lawyers prepare for highly
costly legal actions expected to last several years. Lawyers' and
accountants' fees incurred in unravelling Maxwell's legacy and tussling over
the empire's scanty remaining assets total more than Pounds 30m so far.
Administrators of the collapsed companies, who have reconstructed more than
10,000 complex financial transactions, are now confident that they have
identified most of the assets.
Maxwell's private companies were a labyrinth of more than 400 separate
entities, some of them no more than brass plates in offshore tax havens
designed to shuttle money around the empire.
By the start of last year, nearly a year before his death, they were
tottering under some Pounds 1.5bn of debt and might have collapsed without
injections of cash from the public companies.
In total, the private companies repaid Pounds 501m of loans to banks last
year and made Pounds 123m of interest payments. They also passed at least
Pounds 400m of the assets flowing in to them - including property, shares
from the pension funds and a stake in Berlitz, an MCC subsidiary - totalling
more than Pounds 400m to banks.
As the crisis increased through last year, the private companies also
pledged much of their majority holdings in MCC and MGN, at one point worth
more than Pounds 900m, to banks.
Next to the bank loans in significance, the greatest part of the cash was
consumed in a series of alleged share-support operations designed to prop up
the value of the two public companies.
A small part of the share buying - Pounds 49m - was publicly disclosed as
required under UK companies legislation. But the majority - Pounds 204m -
was routed secretly through Liechtenstein and Switzerland, and Maxwell's
control over the shares he bought was not disclosed. Those shares in turn
were re-pledged to banks so more loans could be raised.
Losses in the private companies - including AGB, the market research
company, and The European newspaper, which had been one of Robert Maxwell's
favourite business ventures - soaked up Pounds 111m.
The private companies also struck property and financing deals with MCC and
MGN that they were later unable to fulfil and the public companies have been
forced to write off more than Pounds 100m against their profits.
In spite of the empire's financial crisis during last year, the private
companies scattered a further Pounds 80m on acquisitions across three
continents, mainly on property.
Investigators are still inquiring into the exact destination and purpose of
Pounds 75m. That includes Pounds 25m channelled through PH (US) Inc, a
Liechtenstein-owned financial holding company registered in the US, which
continues to trade and is outside the direct control of administrators in
the UK.
Public outrage and political pressure since Robert Maxwell's death have
pushed the Liechtenstein authorities and lawyers into unprecedented
openness, even though the principality's wealth has been built on strict
rules of confidentiality.
However, Liechtenstein's Crown Prince said last week that the request for
assistance from British authorities came only this September, even though he
had offered co-operation early in the year.
Accountants have been quicker to gather information on the trusts, and are
relatively confident that no hidden 'pot of gold' remains.
Aside from small sums of cash, most of the assets were held as shares in MGN
and MCC as part of the alleged share-support scheme and have been pledged
back to banks.
The Maxwell Foundation, which owned PH (US) Inc, has already acted to change
the directors of this company, and has sold one of its trading subsidiaries,
Sphere Inc, a California computer games manufacturer.
Some of the money consumed consisted of Pounds 71m in dividends from MGN and
MCC, and Pounds 226m in the disposal of stakes in a number of companies
including Central TV and TF1, the French broadcasting company.
The private companies also consumed Pounds 37m in cash paid to Mr Maxwell by
the former owner of the near-bankrupt New York Daily News to take the
company off its hands.
Investigators have questioned the legality of much of the transfers of cash
and shares from the pension funds and public companies. Some of the
transactions they regard as unusual date back to 1989, more than two years
before Robert Maxwell died.
The irregular transactions will be subject to long legal disputes which will
have to determine whether directors authorising the transfers could have
known that the private companies were unable to repay the money.
Lawyers and accountants have come under intense scrutiny for the level of
professional fees charged, although they reply that the courts and creditors
are monitoring their bills.
Administrators are becoming increasingly selective in the pursuit of further
recoveries, in case the fees incurred outstrip the assets to be realised.
The hopes of most of the pensioners for the long term rest with the work of
the Maxwell pension unit headed by Sir John Cuckney, which has so far raised
Pounds 6m in donations and Pounds 2.5m from the government.
The Serious Fraud Office has so far made four arrests. As well as the
brothers, Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Robert Bunn, both directors of
Maxwell private companies, face charges. Trials are not expected to begin
before early 1994.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Woolwich launches loan aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWICH Building Society launched two schemes yesterday to help up to 1.5m
people who have mortgage debts that exceed the value of their homes.
A further fall in the Halifax building society's house-price index meanwhile
confirmed the continued downward trend in UK house prices.
One scheme offered by Woolwich, the country's fourth largest building
society, would allow people to use equity in their homes as security for
part of their children's new mortgage. The other scheme allows borrowers to
transfer their existing mortgage, including the negative equity element, to
a new home of the same or lower value.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the first
scheme was the most innovative homes initiative so far.
Mr Gary Marsh, house price specialist at Halifax, said: 'The pattern of
1992, of seasonally adjusted falls of 1 per cent every month, shows every
sign of continuing.' Halifax is calling on the government to lower base
rates by at least 2 percentage points to 6 per cent and to introduce
measures, aimed particularly at first-time buyers, to stabilise house prices
next year.
Last month's 1.2 per cent fall in the index - 0.8 per cent after seasonal
adjustment - follows a fall of 3.1 per cent in September, or 2.9 per cent on
a seasonally adjusted basis. The index indicates a fall of 8.7 per cent in
the past year.
These developments increase pressure on the government to address the
decline in the housing market in its Autumn Statement next week.
The Halifax index comes a day after Nationwide's house-price index recorded
a fall of 2.7 per cent last month, after a 1.4 per cent fall in September.
Mr Wriglesworth said: 'The two indices have come into line over the
two-month period.' He attributed the sharp fall during the two months to the
ending of stamp duty relief and expects house prices to be down by at least
a further 5 per cent next year.
Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court, said the continued fall
in house prices showed that monetary policy was still too tight. Interest
rates would have to be reduced significantly to initiate recovery, he said.
He did not expect house prices to rise in real terms for five years.
In Scotland, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday
that the main concern of prospective buyers was job security. Recent
interest rate cuts had not spurred people into moving home.
Scotland has not suffered mortgage repossessions on the same scale as
England, the institution said, but many areas report static prices and slow
turnover. Mortgage lending was 'disappointing' in the third quarter of the
year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday. At the end of
September, outstanding loans for house purchases totalled Pounds 336.3bn, up
from Pounds 330.1bn in the previous quarter and 6.6 per cent higher than for
the third quarter last year.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Maxwell's Death - The First Anniversary: Family comes to
terms with shifting fortunes - A year on at the surviving members of the
Maxwell dynasty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE will be a poignant reminder of the Maxwell family's shifting fortunes
in the run-up to Christmas with two Sotheby's auctions of the contents of
Headington Hill Hall - the Maxwell family home in Oxford.
The sales - organised by administrators to Robert Maxwell's personal estate
 -will include wine, paintings and an assortment of memorabilia.
The combined sales are expected to raise about Pounds 1m - none of which is
likely to end up in the hands of the family, although Mrs Betty Maxwell, the
tycoon's widow, is arguing for a share of the proceeds. The auctions will be
followed within months by the sale of the remainder of the Maxwell lease on
Headington Hill Hall, which belongs to Oxford City Council. The lease is
being sold by PHL Estates, a private Maxwell company under administration.
Mrs Maxwell is not destitute. She still owns a large chateau, reportedly
valued at Pounds 3m, in Lot et Garonne in France, which she has firmly told
administrators belongs to her. She has provided Pounds 900,000 to cover the
legal fees of her sons.
In January she surfaced briefly to sue the magazine Paris Match for
publishing photographs of her husband's autopsy. She has refused to give any
interviews since earlier in the year but is preparing a book of memoirs.
By contrast Mrs Pandora Maxwell, Mr Kevin Maxwell's wife and Robert
Maxwell's least favourite daughter-in-law, has put forward an image of
family resilience in a series of public declarations.
'The only image my children have of prison,' she said recently, 'is when
they went to see the Wind in the Willows and saw Toad languishing in jail.
They hero-worship their daddy. The pressure is enormous . . . '
Her husband has kept both his sense of humour and equanimity in spite of the
criminal charges he faces. He is negotiating a publishing contract for a
book on the effects of bankruptcy. There will be only one chapter on his own
experience.
Kevin and his brother Ian - who also faces criminal charges - abandoned an
attempt earlier this year to set up a Dollars 10m media investment fund.
Kevin, who subsequently signed up briefly as unemployed, decided to take
himself off the register and seek work as a consultant. He and his brother
Ian have moved into an office in central London.
In an affidavit sworn after his father's death, Kevin valued his assets at
Pounds 1.6m and admitted to debts of Pounds 1.75m. Over the past year he has
sold his London home and his Morgan car. He and his wife live in her
converted barn in Oxfordshire and their three children go to a local private
school - with fees, estimated at between Pounds 2,900 and Pounds 5,000 a
term, being paid by relatives.
Investigators have established that five days before the death of her
father-in-law Mrs Pandora Maxwell sold Munday Dean, a racehorse she owned,
at the Newmarket sales for 14,000 guineas. Bankruptcy trustees are meanwhile
dicussing the 26,000 Irish guineas proceeds of a second horse, Great Max,
earlier this year.
Mr Ian Maxwell still lives in the Belgravia house he occupied at the time of
his father's death, but he is losing a FFr2.5m chateau in France he owned
with Kevin and their respective wives. Bankruptcy trustees are preparing to
put it up for sale.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Spencer's Temptation of St Anthony reaches Pounds 297,000:
Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Stanley Spencer's painting 'The Temptation of St Anthony' sold for
Pounds 297,000 at Sotheby's yesterday. It depicts the saint lying in a tomb
surrounded by naked women - including the artist's wife Hilda - and was
painted in 1945 for a competition organised by a Hollywood film studio for
an art work to appear in the film Bel Ami. Max Ernst won the competition.
Yesterday's price was below estimate but compares well with the Pounds
11,500 paid for the painting at Sotheby's in 1973 and suggests that the
revival of interest in Spencer continues.
Another work, 'Going to Bed', showing the artist, his wife and two daughters
nestling down together, sold to Reed &amp; Lefevre, the London dealers, for
Pounds 143,000 - well below the Pounds 200,000-plus forecast.
The auction of modern British art did reasonably well, totalling almost
Pounds 1.5m with 33 per cent unsold. There was an auction record for an Eric
Gill sculpture: Pounds 66,000 paid for 'Mother and Child', sculpted in 1913.
Another work to beat its forecast was 'Palm Palisade' by Graham Sutherland,
which fetched Pounds 82,280.
There were disappointments - important works by Sargent, Paul Nash, Burra
and Ivon Hitchens failed to sell - but the room was full of mainly private
collectors and when the sellers were flexible about reserves, the paintings
often sold.
'Kelvingrove', by Stephen Conroy, the much promoted young Scottish artist,
found a buyer at Pounds 16,500, against a low estimate of Pounds 18,000. A
portrait of a woman by Gwen John made Pounds 26,400, against a low estimate
of Pounds 30,000. A Lowry, 'The Orator', also sold below estimate at Pounds
49,500.
Irish paintings were in demand and a set of four sketches by Jack Yeats went
for Pounds 66,000. Sir Winston Churchill also transcended the recession in
the art market. One of his landscapes doubled its estimate at Pounds 35,200.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Housing starts show drop of 7 per cent in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of the gloom in the construction industry emerged yesterday
with official figures showing that housing starts - a key leading indicator
of economic activity - fell 7 per cent in July-September period compared
with the corresponding months last year.
The figures from the Environment Department came as the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said shortages of work, competition on fees and lower
tender levels were producing a 'vice-like squeeze on profitability'.
The British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries reported a marked
decline in sales of all materials through the third quarter, with demand in
September down sharply after being stable in July.
Although September's 12,600 housing starts were 300 up on the previous
month, they were still 800 lower than the 13,400 recorded in September last
year. For July to September, housing starts slipped to 39,100 from 42,300 a
year earlier.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, total housing starts in July-September were
down 4 per cent compared with the previous three months. Completions were up
4 per cent. The department said that starts and completions by local
authorities, new towns and government departments remained low.
The RICS survey, issued today, says small practices have suffered a 28 per
cent fall in workload in the past year, compared with a 23 per cent fall for
the whole profession.
In the three months to the end of September, workloads fell 10 per cent at
small practices, compared with a 3.5 per fall across the profession.
Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman, said: 'While larger
practices may be able to ride out the storm, small practices who form the
backbone of the profession cannot. The future of the profession depends on
their survival, but the future looks very gloomy.'
The biggest fall in workloads was in the south-east, with a 'worrying
downward trend' in Scotland after earlier signs of weathering the recession.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Planning delays 'cost Pounds 600m a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS IN the planning system are costing British business Pounds 600m a
year, much of which could be saved by better procedures, according to a
study published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry.
The study, drafted with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, calls
for streamlining of the planning system, with better business input and for
publication of a national policy paper each year.
That would be sponsored jointly by government departments responsible for
the environment, transport, industry and agriculture, and would draw
together a national framework for land use and infrastructure planning for a
five-year period. It would identify priorities and have a guaranteed core
funding commitment from the Treasury.
The CBI task force that prepared the report, headed by Mr Ian Prosser,
chairman and chief executive of Bass, urges government action to give a
clearer lead in strategic guidance; by business, which should take more
responsibility for outlining its needs; and by planning authorities, which
should enhance their quality of service through charters.
The report will be discussed at the CBI conference in Harrogate next Monday,
when Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is expected to give the
government's response.
It is calculated that the cost of planning delays for infrastructure
projects is Pounds 1.47bn for each year of delay, and the cost to business
imposed by the public planning process averages close to 2 per cent of
project costs. That gives the annual total of Pounds 600m.
The task force was established early this year because of mounting concern
among business leaders about the way some big planning decisions become
bogged down with appeals and inquiries.
The Stansted airport development took 25 years to complete all planning
processes and the M40 extension took 17 years.
Mr Prosser said it was understandable that planning was an emotive subject,
and the task force found there were good reasons for many of the checks and
balances in the system. It worked well generally, particularly with smaller
planning applications.
He said: 'The problem is more deep-seated. It results from the absence of a
national consensus between government, business and the public on key
priorities which must be pursued in shaping the nation for the 21st
century.'
In the absence of a national lead, many significant applications were in
danger of being left for local decision in a partial policy vacuum, when
they should be set in the context of clear national policy.
'We put the cart before the horse, using inquiries and appeals to make
decisions in a climate of frustration, contention and uncertainty,' he said.
He regarded the national annual policy paper as the central recommendation,
as it would produce a national framework for a five-year period with
immediate priorities.
'This would help to create a climate of greater certainty for the nation as
a whole, he said. 'This is the crux of our report.'
Shaping the Nation: Report of the Planning Task Force. CBI Publication
Sales, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London, WC1A 1DU. Pounds 20.

FT  05 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL worries ahead of last night's outcome of the vote on the
Maastricht treaty led to cautious trading in stock index futures, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,740, the December contract on the FT-SE Index was soon
driven lower by independent traders to 2,725 on the nervousness.
With many of the large institutions choosing to stay on the sidelines,
December traded sporadically in a tight range of 2,725 and 2,735 until the
afternoon.
The poor opening on Wall Street, along with weakness in sterling, sent the
contract falling to the day's low of 2,715. A period of sharp swings then
ensued before December closed at 2,728, up 14 from Tuesday's close and some
17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 17
points. The futures once again traded at a healthy premium throughout the
day, though volume was a poor 6,130 by the official close.
Asda was the most actively dealt stock option and saw turnover of 6,948
contracts. That total included a single trade in which one seller sold 1,000
contracts of the January 45 calls at 5p. This was followed by Trafalgar
House with a total of 1,782 lots, and by ICI at 1,358 contracts.
The total number of option trades by the close reached 29,714, slightly
ahead of Tuesday's figure, although yesterday's turnover of 6,586 lots in
the FT-SE 100 option was poor.

FT  05 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares ease on political uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market was slipping lower towards the close of yesterday's
trading session as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, opened the
Maastricht debate in the House of Commons. The market's response to the
Clinton success in the US presidential election was somewhat muted, and
cooled further after Wall Street started its new session with a loss of 9
points on the Dow Average.
Oil shares proved to be the first sector of the UK market to react sharply
to the prospect of a Clinton presidency. Suggestions that the new president
might impose stricter anti-pollution and environmental policies upset the
oil majors, which are significant components of leading UK market indices.
Other blue chip UK stocks took a cautious view of suggestions that a Clinton
administration may increase taxation of non-US companies.
After falling by 11 points at first, the FT-SE Index rallied determinedly
and succeeded in regaining the 2,700 mark early in the second half of the
session. But Wall Street's uncertain opening and the focus on the Maastricht
debate in the UK parliament took the heart out of investment interest.
Shares began to drift down again and by the close the FT-SE was 13.9 off at
2,691.7.
However, the underlying mood remained firm. At least two buy programmes were
identified in the market and traders believed that the market would have
gained ground but for the political uncertainties in the background.
The latest surveys of political opinion confirmed only that the outcome of
the Maastricht debate, on which the immediate prospects for government
policy must hang, remained highly uncertain. City analysts left forecasting
to the political strategists yesterday, but admitted that a defeat for the
government in the Maastricht debate would make the future for its economic
strategies even more uncertain.
With no sign of the US buyers who had boosted the London market over the two
previous sessions, trading volume was reduced yesterday. The day's Seaq
total of 506.7m shares compared with 586.6m on Tuesday, when retail, or
customer, business of Pounds 1.24bn maintained the improved levels of recent
weeks.
Although investment activity was restrained by the political uncertainty,
there were signs of continued confidence that action to stimulate the UK
economy will be taken soon. Housebuilding and contruction stocks
outperformed the rest of the market in spite of the sluggishness in their
respective markets.
Firmness in sterling helped to buttress hopes for early cuts in UK base
rates but were offset by weakness in UK government bonds.
Currency-influenced stocks, waiting for US markets to make a more considered
response to the election of President Clinton, traded a mixed path.
The lack of a definite trend left the market susceptible to corporate
statements or to more speculative influences. BAT Industries shares were
better after the company's trading announcement found a welcome reception in
the market. But J. Sainsbury, the food supermarket group, declined after
good profit figures were counterbalanced by reports of a stock overhang.
Market indices were restrained by profit-taking in ICI and Glaxo.

FT  05 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips dip after
Clinton's triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE INITIAL reaction by Wall Street to the first Democratic presidential
election victory in 16 years was mixed yesterday, with blue chip share
prices ending lower on futures-related program selling but the broader
indices putting in a steadier performance, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.44 at 3,223.04,
near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 2.81 off at 417.11, but the Dow Transportation Average, a good
measure of market sentiment, ended 3.02 higher at 1,360.37. The American SE
composite ended down just 0.89 at 381.94 and the Nasdaq composite 0.94
firmer at 605.52.
Turnover on the New York SE was fairly substantial at 194.4m shares, and
declines outpaced rises by 1,003 to 713.
From the opening bell the market struggled to find a direction in the wake
of the election result. Prices opened slightly weaker, then rallied 15 Dow
points only to drop back into negative territory. The lack of a sustained
move either way suggested that the market was unsure about how to respond to
a Democrat win. The fact that Mr Clinton's victory looked a certainty in the
last few days of the campaign was partly to blame for the absence of a
post-election rally.
The lack of a strong reaction to the result from bond, currency and overseas
markets contributed to the relatively subdued response. Domestic economic
concerns were also a factor. The October employment report is to be
published tomorrow and investors were nervous about committing funds to the
market ahead of the important jobs data.
Most of the damage to the Dow was done near the end of the day, when
futures-related program selling doubled the Dow's loss in the final
half-hour of trading.
Among individual sectors, drug companies ran into selling on revived worries
that Mr Clinton will introduce controls on pharmaceutical prices. Bristol
Myers-Squibb fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 1/8 , Pfizer Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 74 3/8 , Glaxo Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 and Merck Dollars 1 to
Dollars 43.
Oil issues continued to lose ground, undermined by falling crude oil prices
and brokers' downgrades. British Petroleum was hurt most severely, dropping
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , while Chevron shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 67
1/2 and Texaco Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, McCaw rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 in turnover
of 2.4m shares, on speculation that a possible merger or big investment deal
with AT&amp;T was near. Trading was subsequently suspended for the announcement
that AT&amp;T was to spend Dollars 3.8bn on a 33 per cent stake in McCaw. AT&amp;T
slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 before being suspended.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended lower for the second consecutive day in continued
active trading. The TSE 300 index declined 16.8 to 3,344.8 and falls led
advances by 304 to 238 after volume of 32.3m shares.
Air Canada, off 2 cents at CDollars 2.88, reported a third-quarter loss,
against a year-earlier net profit.
Quebecor said its third-quarter earnings rose to 27 cents from 13 cents and
increased the semi-annual dividend on its 'A' and 'B' shares. The 'B' stock
put on CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 16 1/2 .

A TECHNICAL reaction to the Clinton victory pushed a number of bourses
lower. However, the volatility of the dollar affected late-closing markets
in different ways, and a late domestic boost allowed Paris to maintain its
uptrend, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was pulled up in the last hour of trading following remarks by the
prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, that Monday's quarter-point cut in the
Bank of France's lending rates would not be the last. The CAC-40 index ended
17.14 higher at 1,804.07 in turnover of FFr2.7bn, of which FFr2bn was
reportedly generated late in the afternoon.
LVMH was volatile on futures and options-related activity, falling to
FFr3,625 before ending FFr122 or 3.3 per cent higher at FFr3,772.
Peugeot fell another FFr7 to FFr504 following October's poor car sales data.
There were also fears that the November data would be even worse.
Eurodisney came off a low of FFr78 to close 20 centimes higher at FFr80.20
on news that its 1991-92 results would be announced on November 19, earlier
than the market had expected.
FRANKFURT moved with early losses on the dollar, the DAX index closing 12.31
lower at 1,472.69, against a backcloth of mounting gloom on the German
economy and fading hopes of interest rate cuts. Turnover eased from DM3.7bn
to DM3.6bn.
Bad unemployment data added to Tuesday's chambers of commerce report, which
said that west German companies were gloomier about the economy than they
had been for 10 years. In addition, senior Bundesbank officials had listed a
string of conditions for new interest rate cuts on Tuesday, while
yesterday's central bank repo tender left short-term rates steady.
Daimler was the worst blue-chip performer, falling DM16, or 3.1 per cent to
DM507.50. Dealers said that the fall might reflect a forecast of lower
profits from MAN, which also has truck-making in its portfolio, and which
announced 4,500 job cuts. MAN fell DM2.20 to DM242.80.
MILAN lost 2.7 per cent in active trading as widely-expected profit-taking
emerged ahead of the close of the trading account next Friday. The Comit
index fell 12.03 to 438.58 in turnover estimated at L283bn after Tuesday's
L264.4bn.
Among leading stocks, Fiat eased L52 to L4,548, Montedison dropped L41 to
L1,201 and Generali fell L650 to L28,750.
The investment bank, Sopaf, attracted buying interest after news that
consolidated net profit for the fiscal year ended June 30 rose 5.4 per cent
and that it was paying an additional, extraordinary dividend of L100 on both
savings and ordinary shares. Its savings shares rose 7 per cent or L119 to
L1,820 while the ordinary shares eased L10 to L2,900, but rose in
after-hours trading.
AMSTERDAM ended lower and blamed earlier softness in the dollar as the CBS
Tendency Index lost 0.9 to 102.3. Short-covering helped Philips ahead of its
third-quarter results, due today, as the shares added 20 cents to Fl 19.10.
KLM, down 70 cents at Fl 22.10, reports its second-quarter figures today.
Hunter Douglas fell 30 cents to Fl 33 as the company said, just before the
close, that it expected 1992 profit to be significantly lower than the Fl
71.4m of 1991.
ZURICH finished below its day's highs after profit-taking late in the
session. The SMI index of leading shares added 8.5 to 1,941.8 after a high
of 1,948.0.
Dealers said that sentiment was buoyed up partly by the eventual rise in the
dollar, but mainly by foreign orders for the index heavyweights Roche, where
the certificates gained SFr20 to SFr3,780, and Nestle, where the bearers
closed SFr15 higher at SFr1,050.
The aluminium and chemical group, Alusuisse, responded to a favourable
forecast it made at a presentation, with the bearers up SFr13 to SFr361.
MADRID had a generally tranquil day, the general index closing 0.49 higher
at 200.14, but the news that Huarte had won one of its biggest projects ever
in a Pta60bn contract to build a workers' town in Indonesia left the
construction group DM71 or 11.4 per cent higher at Pta696.
STOCKHOLM retreated in moderate trading on profit-taking after its recent
gains. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 2.0 to 727.8 as turnover dropped
to SKr413m from SKr766m.
Volvo B shares fell SKr2 to SKr252, seeing SKr250 in London later after news
that the carmaker planned to close two Swedish assembly plants. Astra fell
on profit-taking, with the A shares falling SKr2 to Skr587.
OSLO reflected the early dollar and lower prices for Norway's North Sea oil
as the all-share index dropped 6.32 to 346.10 in thin trading. HELSINKI
continued to soar on strong investor interest, the Hex index putting on
another 5 per cent to close 40 higher at 838.6, with the banks and finance
house index up 17.3 per cent.

FT  05 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Tax-cutting budget helps KL to scale
new heights - The bull run in Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budgets usually make stock markets nervous. Not so in Kuala Lumpur, which
has been scaling new heights since Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance
minister, delivered his budget to parliament last Friday.
Down the road at the stock exchange, there were no signs of budgetary
nervousness. As Mr Anwar spoke, the market was reaching a new record high,
with the KLSE composite index climbing to 641.31. In the following days the
bulls kept running.
By the middle of this week the market had broken through the 650 mark for
the first time, closing at 658.68 yesterday, a rise of more than 17 per cent
since the beginning of the year. Trading also reached new highs, with
turnover on one day this week rising to MDollars 819.7m (USDollars 328m).
Market capitalisation has risen to MDollars 218bn from the level at the end
of last year of MDollars 161bn and Kuala Lumpur is consolidating a position
as one of the biggest and more lively markets in the region.
There were plenty of leaks in advance of the budget. The market knew that
the overall picture was good. Mr Anwar said that GDP growth would be 8.5 per
cent this year, slowing slightly to 8 per cent next year. A current account
deficit of MDollars 12bn last year will be cut back to a deficit of MDollars
7.9bn by the end of 1992.
While the budget made reductions in some areas of government expenditure in
an effort to control inflation and make further inroads into the current
account deficit, business was heartened by corporate and income tax cuts.
'The budget was the tonic the market needed,' says one broker. 'It tackled
some of the problem areas in the economy but did not try to dampen things
down too much. It was still a 'go for growth' budget.'
Gaming and leisure stocks such as Genting, owner of south-east Asia's
biggest casino complex in the hills outside Kuala Lumpur, surged as fears
about tax increases proved unfounded. Construction and engineering were
buoyed by the government's commitment to a wide range of infrastructure
projects.
Other factors have driven the market upward. Like frightened pigeons, some
money took flight from Hong Kong in the aftermath of renewed arguments
between the colony and Beijing. Some of that cash has settled in Kuala
Lumpur.
Malaysia Telekom and Tenaga Nasional, the Malaysian electricity utility,
account for nearly 30 per cent of the total market capitalisation. Telekom
reported pre-tax profits of MDollars 606m for the first half of the year, up
18 per cent from the same period in 1991.
Tenaga, whose share offering earlier this year was the biggest such exercise
in Malaysian corporate history, this week reported a doubling of pre-tax
profits to MDollars 1.41bn for the year ending August 31, 1992.
Brokers say both foreign institutional investors and locals are doing some
heavy dealing, not only in blue chip shares such as Telekom and Tenaga but
also featuring a lot of activity in the more speculative secondary stocks.
Not so long ago Kuala Lumpur would ride the wash of the Singapore market.
That position is now reversed. The Singapore index, inactive for several
weeks, has shown some signs of life recently. Kuala Lumpur is almost twice
the size of Singapore in terms of market capitalisation. On one day this
week more than 50 per cent of the total volume of trade in Singapore was in
Malaysian stocks.
Some analysts say Kuala Lumpur's rise is part of a traditional year-end
burst of activity, as punters look forward to salary bonuses and rush to
pick up stocks before renewed buying in the new year by the big
institutional investors.
A lot of attention will be focused on the results of a MDollars 1.74bn
rights issue earlier this week by Malaysia Airlines. The airline, still more
than 50 per cent government-controlled, has had various financial problems
in recent years. Brokers say buoyancy in the market should help what is
Malaysia's biggest rights issue so far.
There are those who say the market, like the economy, shows signs of
overheating and that some stocks are overbought. But there are many others
who forecast that Kuala Lumpur will go through the 700 level by the end of
the year. In the euphoria of a market surge, the voices of caution are few
and far between.

Pacific Rim responds

<TEXT>
MR BILL Clinton's landslide victory in the US presidential election failed
to spark a response from investors, and share prices rose on futures-related
arbitrage buying and light bargain hunting, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 211.84 up at the day's high of 17,065.20,
surpassing the psychologically important 17,000 level for the first time in
four trading days. Share prices sagged in the morning on small-lot selling
by foreign investors, and the Nikkei set a low for the day of 16,771.72.
However, shares found support on public funds buying, and index-linked
purchases in last-minute trading boosted the index.
Volume remained flat, at 140m shares after Monday's 144m, as uncertainty
over the domestic economy and corporate earnings still loomed over the stock
market.
Advances led declines by 537 to 327, with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks gained 13.41 at 1,293.85, but in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.58 to 1,040.43.
Traders said Japanese investors were not clear about the implications of the
Democrat victory in the US presidential election. 'Investors will have to
wait for the reaction on Wall Street,' remarked Mr Shin Tokoi at Kidder
Peabody Securities. 'The Japanese do not quite understand what the effects
will be,' said Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Large-capital blue chips were firmer on small-lot bargain hunting by public
pension funds. Nippon Steel put on Y8 to Y293. High-technology issues were
higher in spite of a volatile currency market. Hitachi rose Y18 to Y738 and
Toshiba Y6 to Y598.
Dealers concentrated on speculative theme stocks. Denki Kogyo, the day's
most active issue, advanced Y33 to Y966 on the nuclear fusion theme.
Aids-related Green Cross gained Y20 to Y1,420 and Sumitomo Chemical
appreciated Y8 to Y483.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 130.06 firmer at 18,479.85 in volume of
8.6m shares.
The OSE said trading volume plunged 32.8 per cent in October from the
previous year's level to 315m shares, the lowest since May 1958. Trading of
Nikkei 225 futures contracts fell 12.1 per cent to 760,948 lots.
Roundup
THE majority of the region's equity markets rose after the US presidential
election, mainly on the removal of uncertainty.
HONG KONG was spurred from an early decline to a 2.1 per cent gain, the Hang
Seng index closing a net 127.93 ahead at 6,325.37 after an 84-point decline.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 2.58bn to HKDollars 3.53bn.
Banks led the rally, HSBC climbing HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 65.50 and
topping the active list, followed by Bank of East Asia, up 75 cents at
HKDollars 36.50.
AUSTRALIA saw a 5.6 per cent gain in News Corp as the All Ordinaries index
ended 18.3 points higher at 1,431.9.
News Corp will announce its quarterly profits at the close of trading today.
The media group rose ADollars 1.50 to ADollars 27.90 as smaller investors
entered the market in the afternoon, on speculation about a pick-up on Wall
Street later in the day.
MANILA moved from weakness to strength and the composite index closed 10.05
higher at 1,362.57. Once again a projected spill-over from Wall Street
accounted for the change of mood.
BANGKOK bought banks heavily, and their gains boosted the SET index by 1.6
per cent, or 14.79, to 956.87 in heavy turnover of Bt18.64bn.
Krung Thai Bank was the most active stock, in turnover of Bt2.38bn,
finishing at Bt310, up Bt28, after hitting its 10 per cent upper daily
limit.
NEW ZEALAND's mood was neutral, although the NZSE-40 index edged further
above its 13-month low to end 5.2 firmer at 1,372.01.
SEOUL rose on active late institutional support, the composite index adding
13.48 at 619.00 in turnover of Won601.5bn (Won483.4bn).
SINGAPORE managed a mild recovery as the Straits Times Industrial index
improved 15.59 to 1,421.46 in volume of 183.2m shares, against 156.7m.
TAIWAN fell 1.5 per cent in very sluggish trade, the weighted index ending
53.61 off at 3,506.05 in TDollars 6.92bn turnover.

sell-off

<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the UK merchant bank, has been dropped as adviser on
the privatisation of Kobanyai Sorgyar, Hungary's largest brewery, after a
dispute with government authorities.
Hungary's State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, said yesterday
that BZW had invited bids for the brewery from three international companies
which the government had specifically excluded from the sale tender.
BZW strongly denied the agency's claims. 'BZW has complied with all the
instructions it has received,' the firm said in a statement.
A Barclays executive characterised the problem as one of poor communication,
and criticised the SPA for jumping to conclusions.
The SPA said prospectuses for Kobanyai went out to Interbrew, Heineken and
Brau - western brewers which have all established strong market shares in
Hungary - even though the SPA wanted to stop them making further
acquisitions in the interests of competition.
Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of the SPA, said yesterday: 'It is a very
elementary mistake which cannot be explained.'
This is the first time the SPA has publicly dismissed a consultant.
Mr Csepi also said he was dissatisfied with BZW's work on its other
important mandate, the privatisation of Centrum Department Stores.
BZW was one of the first investment banks to explore Hungary, and advised
the SPA itself at the organisation's foundation in 1990.
BZW remained hopeful that it could assuage the SPA in further talks and
contain the damage to relations to avoid blacklisting. But Mr Csepi said the
SPA was considering removing BZW from the shortlist of advisers for the
much-coveted privatisation work on Hungary's four large commercial banks.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Painful reverse out of a
cul-de-sac - The troubled carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO'S painful decision to close two of its three car assembly plants in
Sweden is a bitter blow for the prestige of the carmaker, which has run up
losses in core operations for the past seven quarters.
It is a particular setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the group's
increasingly autocratic chairman, who has tried for two decades to fly in
the face of motor industry wisdom elsewhere by pioneering alternative car
assembly systems in Sweden.
Volvo's announcement that it is to close its Kalmar and Uddevalla final
assembly plants is also a body-blow for successive Swedish governments'
interventionist regional policies, which had sought - particularly in the
1980s - to expand the automotive industry to fill the gap left by the
collapse of Swedish shipbuilding.
It follows only 19 months after Saab, its smaller - and also chronically
loss-making - Swedish rival was forced to close its Malmo final assembly
plant, which had been modelled on the assembly methods of the Volvo plants.
Financial crisis had caught up earlier with Saab, which lacked the resources
of the bigger Volvo group and which was forced to close the Malmo plant less
than 18 months after it had been opened, to great fanfare, on the site of
the defunct Kockums shipyard.
A year earlier, control of Saab had been taken over by General Motors. It
had quickly become clear to the new GM management in 1990 that, while the
Malmo plant was untenable in the increasingly harsh and competitive climate
of the European auto industry, so too were the Volvo plants.
The two Volvo facilities had been conceived in much more comfortable times,
notably the more modern Uddevalla plant, which started production in 1987.
When its planned construction was announced in January 1985, Volvo had just
announced record earnings for 1984 and was surfing on a wave of windfall
profits from the inflated US dollar, which had made it - temporarily -
perhaps the world's most profitable carmaker.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, the French
carmaker and Volvo's partner in a far-reaching Franco-Swedish motor industry
alliance, believes that Volvo's problems stem from its profligacy in those
earlier fat years - when Renault, by contrast, was running up huge losses.
'When the money came in easily as the most profitable carmaker in the world,
they spent lavishly. You see the rich cousin and the poor cousin when you
look at their plants and ours,' Mr Schweitzer said yesterday. 'They have
excess costs, but now they are coming to grips with their problems.'
The clearest warning that Volvo had been heading up a cul-de-sac with its
Scandinavian system for car assembly came from a team of academics which two
years ago published The Machine That Changed The World. This was the
influential treatise on world car industry production methods. It first
coined the phrase 'lean production' to describe the Toyota production system
which has become the model for all western carmakers.
'Simply bolting and screwing together a large number of parts in a long
cycle rather than a small number in a short cycle is a very limited vision
of job enrichment,' wrote the report about the Volvo system.
That the Uddevalla and Kalmar plants have survived so long owes much to the
stubborn vision of Mr Gyllenhammar, who took over as Volvo chief executive
in 1971 and became chairman in 1983.
He has much personal prestige invested in the plants, where he tried to move
the production system away from the traditional Ford assembly line.
The Kalmar plant opened in 1974. It was based on Mr Gyllenhammar's concepts
of a work-team approach, with computer-guided carriers bringing supplies to
decentralised assembly points.
It has taken a severe financial crisis to force Volvo back to the basics of
carmaking at its two traditional plants at Torslanda, Gothenburg, and Ghent
in Belgium.
The closures come at a time of rising unemployment in a country where small
communities are often based around one company. There will be not just the
impact of the direct job losses - 820 at Uddevalla and 800 at Kalmar - but
the knock-on effect of associated job losses.
Unemployment at Uddevalla is set to increase to around 20 per cent following
the closure, and at Kalmar to 15 per cent.
The closure decisions show that Volvo's tough new chief executive, Mr Soren
Gyll, is making an early impact on the group. Far-reaching rationalisation
has been probable ever since he declared in August that 'nothing is holy'.
Against a background of depressed sales in the group's three main markets -
Sweden, the UK and the US - the cuts seemed inevitable. Sweden has just
reported that October car sales were 38 per cent down on a year ago, and
analysts expect a further steep fall in sales next year as a result of
Sweden's austerity programme.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Volvo to close two Swedish
plants

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, Sweden's leading car group, is to close two of its three Swedish car
plants as part of a sweeping rationalisation of its car and truck
operations. The measures, announced yesterday, will result in the loss of
4,500 jobs, or 10 per cent of the overall workforce, by 1995.
The cuts reflect the sharp decline in sales in Volvo's three main markets -
the US, UK and Sweden - and seven quarters of losses in its core operations.
The aim is to achieve group operating income of SKr5.5bn (Dollars 940m) by
1995.
Car production will now be concentrated at the Torslanda plant in Sweden and
at Ghent in Belgium. The Uddevalla and Kalmar plants will be closed to
achieve annual cost savings of SKr350m.
Uddevalla, which only started operations in 1989, will be closed next spring
and Kalmar in mid-1994. A total of 1,600 jobs will be cut.
The closures are a personal setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's
chairman. Under his guidance, both plants fostered new production methods,
involving multi-skilled assembly-work teams, rather than traditional
assembly line methods. The company said the closures were entirely dictated
by market factors, not because of deficiencies in the new techniques.
Volvo expects car sales of just over 200,000 this year, excluding the small
400 series. In Sweden, the US and the UK, it forecasts total sales of
120,000-130,000 large cars, compared with 200,000 in 1988. Production
capacity, following the plant closures, will be 300,000 large cars, compared
with 370,000 today.
Volvo's new chief executive, Mr Soren Gyll, said rationalisation was needed
to safeguard the company's future product development and competitiveness.
'We must reduce our overall cost structure and adjust our organisation to
market conditions.'
Meanwhile, Volvo Trucks announced 2,000 job losses due to a rationalisation
programme which aims to cut costs by SKr2.5bn by 1995. 'There is no
indication of any improvement in the market and an increase in sales in the
near future,' it said.
A total of 500 jobs are also to be cut at Torslanda. There will also be job
cuts at Volvo Penta and at two small car factories.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: MAN sees profits for year down
from recent peaks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAN, one of Germany's biggest engineering groups and in the last two years a
prime beneficiary of German unification, warned yesterday that profits for
the year to the end of next June would be down from the record level of the
last two years.
However, Mr Klaus Gotte, chief executive of the Munich-based manufacturer of
trucks to diesel motors, sounded less pessimistic than many of his fellow
German industrialists when he said that it would only be in the fourth
quarter of the current financial year that the company would face serious
uncertainties.
Although order intake dropped steeply in the three months July to September
 -by 22 per cent in all, as announced last month - the backlog of orders,
the company's financial strength, as well as rationalisation measures
already under way, ensured that the full year profit would be good enough to
ensure the payment of a satisfactory dividend, Mr Gotte said.
In its last financial year, the group - via its MAN Nutzfahrzeuge
subsidiary, the second-largest German manufacturer of commercial vehicles -
reported group earnings up 3 per cent to DM418m (Dollars 267m) on turnover
up under 1 per cent to DM19.2bn.
Although order intake dropped from DM4.17bn to DM3.25bn in the first
three-month period of the current year - because of a 26 per cent fall in
domestic orders and a 19 per cent drop in overseas orders - sales dropped by
a relatively modest 5 per cent to DM3.8bn. Orders outstanding were 3 per
cent down to DM16.31bn.
Mr Gotte warned that in the fourth quarter of the year there were
'uncertainties ahead' because of the likelihood that there would be
inadequate capacity utilisation. He said that the group had initiated
rationalisation measures a year ago in areas of the business not benefiting
from the order boom, particularly in printing. He said that by the end of
this financial year the number of employees would be down 4,500, or 7 per
cent, since the economic downturn began.
As announced last month, profits at MAN Nutzfahrzeuge increased by 29.7 per
cent to DM255m in the year to the end of June, the company's best
performance.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Prague Breweries seeks partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRAGUE Breweries, the second-largest brewing group in the Czech republic,
yesterday announced that it was seeking an international industrial partner.
Mr Stanislav Prochazka, chief executive, said: 'We believe our company has
an excellent platform for future growth, both domestically and through
exports.'
Prague Breweries, which has a dominant market position in the Czech capital,
was included in the first wave of the country's privatisation programme and
will have 72 per cent of its equity owned, as a result, by domestic
shareholders mostly regrouped in the largest seven private investment funds.
Creditanstalt Securities, the Prague-based investment bank, which has been
retained as adviser to the brewery, has a 12 per cent stake in Prague
Breweries.
Other large shareholders include investment funds controlled by leading
commercial banks. A remaining 28 per cent equity stake is held by workers,
management and the state property agency, the Czech government body
monitoring the privatisation programme.
Any international partner would become a shareholder of the company which
employs 1,300 and last year produced 2m hectolitres of beer, 5 per cent of
which was exported.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philips to end PC sales in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to stop selling personal computers
(PCs) to consumers in Britain, Scandinavia, Ireland and Greece, marking a
further retreat from the highly competitive sector.
The company, scheduled to release third-quarter results today, said the
decision to end PC sales in these countries would lead to the closure of its
European PC distribution centre in the Dutch town of Tilburg, with the loss
of 40 jobs.
A Philips spokesman denied that Philips was pulling out of PCs, but the
group has taken a significant step in retreating from PCs as a strategic
product by merging its PC division in the UK with its interactive media
systems business.
'We increasingly see ourselves not as a mainstream PC seller but as selling
applications to users which involves hardware and software,' said Mr Simon
Turner, head of the UK PC operations.
Philips's PCs are sold mainly as part of an overall systems package rather
than on their own. The Eindhoven spokesman said that the group was
continuing to watch developments closely. Fierce competition among PC
manufacturers has led to price wars and eroded margins.
In April, Philips announced that it was cutting 600 of the 1,800 jobs in its
loss-making PC operations and halting the direct sale of PCs in the US. Its
new strategy in the US is to seek to produce PCs for US companies which will
then market the equipment under their own brand names.

Keystone Investment saw its net asset value fall 11 per cent, from 489.13p

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National Trust, a split capital trust managed by Gartmore
Scotland, had a net asset value of 2.8p per capital share, down from 92.8p
over the 12 months to September 30.
The value per income share was 73.1p (68.7p); per zero dividend preference
share 170.8p (153.5p) and per stepped preference share 127.6p (121.6p).
Net revenue was little changed at Pounds 16m, for earnings of 8.74p (8.85p)
per income share.
A proposed final dividend of 3.05p maintains the total at an uncovered 8.85p
with utilisation of part of the revenue reserve. Mr Sandy Struthers,
chairman, said the total for the current year was likely to be reduced to
about 7.5p.

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi sells MSL for Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is selling MSL Group International, its consulting and
recruitment company, to Mr Garry Long, MSL's chairman, in a deal worth
Pounds 3.5m.
Because of the depressed state of MSL's business, Mr Long is paying only
Pounds 10,000 immediately. Saatchi has also been allotted 3.5m preference
shares of Pounds 1 each, redeemable at par in tranches until 1998.
Mr Long said that MSL, which has operated at a loss in the current year,
would redeem the shares out of future profits. If MSL could not make the
payments, Saatchi would have the right to convert the shares, but would not
regain control of MSL as the maximum stake obtainable would be 50 per cent.
MSL has 120 employees in the UK and net tangible assets of Pounds 550,000.
Founded in 1955, it merged with Hay, the US personnel consultancy in the
mid-1960s to form Hay-MSL, which was acquired by Saatchi in 1984. Hay was
sold to its management in 1990.

Impshire Thoroughbreds, the Dublin-based bloodstock group, reduced pre-tax
losses to IPounds 116,000 (Pounds 126,000), for the six months to June 30.
The deficit last time was IPounds 159,000.
Operating losses fell to IPounds 48,000 (IPounds 68,000) and there was a
lower IPounds 68,000 (IPounds 91,000) deficit reflecting the change in value
of bloodstock. The company continued to reduce its bloodstock holdings
because of the continuing weak market.
Losses per share were 1.8p against 2.4p.

Profits were little changed at Grand Central Investment Holdings in the year
to June 30 1992.
On sales up 27 per cent at Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 23.4m) the pre-tax result
was Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 994,000).
The group's interests in the Asia Pacific region include commodities, Kuril
Plantations and Cocoa Specialities, which suffered from the lowest cocoa
prices for some years and the weak pound. The company has decided to divest
itself of these assets.
However, increased profits were reported from confectionery manufacturing
and food distribution.
The dividend is unchanged at 0.45p on earnings per share of 1.47p (1.38p).

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Consortium extends ITN offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFER for 80 per cent of Independent Television News has been extended
to November 18 after yesterday's deadline passed without agreement.
The consortium of four companies - Carlton Communications, Central, London
Weekend and Reuters - agreed to the extension after what they described as
'positive and constructive' discussions with representatives of existing ITN
shareholders.
The consortium has agreed to buy the 322,596 Pounds 1 ITN shares not already
owned by its members at par and inject up to Pounds 30m, mainly to cover a
projected deficit of Pounds 25m over five years on the lease of ITN's London
headquarters.
The proposal terms have not yet been changed. But the fact that the deadline
extension is designed to 'allow possible amendments to the offer to be
explored further' is a sign they might be.
The talks will focus on two areas - the price of the shares and percentage
of the news organisation to be held by non-consortium members.
The price of Pounds 1 will not be acceptable to ITN shareholders who do not
want to stay in. The 20 per cent available to non-consortium members is too
small to accomodate shareholders who want to stay in. Thames, Granada, and
probably Yorkshire want to remain shareholders and are unlikely to accept
less than 10 per cent each.
Unless there is movement on price and size of the available stake it seems
likely that the offer will fail. ITN's articles of association will have to
be changed to enable such a deal to happen. That would need a 75 per cent
majority.

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wounded Stakis keeps to doctor's orders -
Disposals and cutbacks have brought some relief to the leisure and nursing
group, but its problems are not over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OUTPATIENT, says Mr David Michels, chief executive of the Stakis Group,
is still, technically, in hospital. Stakis, he says, is an outpatient: but
it moved out of intensive care some time ago and has since left the ward.
Stakis is the hotels, nursing homes and casinos group that got into severe
trouble early last year. Sir Lewis Robertson, the company doctor, came in as
chairman, replacing Sir Reo Stakis, the Cyprus-born founder who became
president.
In June 1991 Sir Lewis fired Mr Andros Stakis, Sir Reo's son, who was chief
executive, made Pounds 44m of write-offs and provisions, agreed a standstill
on debt repayment with the banks and began a programme of disposals. But
further revival had to wait until Mr Michels had arrived from Hilton
International.
Mr Michels, a sparky 45-year-old Londoner, confronted a group that was
overmanned and living, in some places, on illusions. One of his early moves
was to 'get rid of almost everybody who was stopping us making a profit'.
The seven divisional headquarters, all in the Glasgow area, were merged into
one and headquarters staff was cut from 350 to 150. The hotels division has
cut 700 jobs, including part-time staff, and the group now employs about
7,000 people.
'And yet we feel a lot better for it,' says Mr Michels. 'The operators we've
got left in the business are bloody good.' Stakis, he says, also benefits
from the fact that past managers had a gift for choosing good sites for its
outlets.
On December 21 Stakis will produce its results for the year to September 30
 -last year it lost Pounds 47m on sales of Pounds 171m. It may then indicate
what it intends to do about its Pounds 198m of debt, owed to 21 banks, some
foreign. Until then Mr Michels is unable to give figures.
The hotels division, operating 30 properties all over the UK and accounting
for nearly two thirds of the group's assets, has faced the greatest change.
'Some of it didn't appear to be run for profit,' says Mr Michels, who also
noted that many of the hotels were charging as if they had an extra star
rating.
Mr Michels has repositioned many of the hotels and 'put them where the
customer knew they ought to have been in the first place'. All-night room
service has been withdrawn in some. Stakis' new Country Court chain of six
hotels has been merged with the rest. Earlier this year, Mr Michels
remarked: 'It's difficult enough to establish a brand with 30 hotels; with
six it's impossible.'
Gross operating margin in the hotels has reached 28 per cent in the past
five months - 'a good operator would expect 35 per cent in good times' - and
occupancy has averaged 64.7 per cent across the chain - 'not brilliant, but
acceptable'.
Stakis had hoped to sell its 19 casinos and raise Pounds 100m, but had to
abandon the idea last year when it realised it could not get a good price in
the recession. Instead, the casinos have been redecorated after a gap of two
years, new managers have been installed at some of them and the division is
trading profitably.
The group's third arm, health care, which operates 18 nursing homes under
the Ashbourne name, has improved in the past year. Nursing homes, says Mr
Michels, take between nine to 18 months to fill up with patients, but once
old people have moved in they tend to stay, largely unaffected by economic
circumstances and paying, in upmarket Ashbourne's case, Pounds 470 per week.
Occupancy rates reached 93 per cent across all the homes in the last
financial year and will go higher as the remaining homes fill up.
'The downside is that we have 21 sites for new nursing homes, 19 with
planning permission. They are running up interest charges but we can't
afford to develop them,' says Mr Michels. Some Pounds 50m is needed to
complete the homes.
It comes back to the question of the debt. The company could try to make
another standstill agreement with its banks next March and trade out of its
debt with positive cashflow; it could raise new capital with a rights issue,
for which stock market conditions are not favourable; or sell off a
division.
Stakis has already tried, unsuccessfully, to sell the casinos, and it would
not contemplate selling its hotels. That leaves the nursing homes. 'It's no
secret that we've been looking for a partner to develop the nursing homes
with us,' says Mr Michels. Other possibilities would be an outright sale to
another company, or a separate flotation of Ashbourne.
Rumours that Ashbourne was to be floated (denied by Stakis) caused the
company's shares to jump 5 1/2 p to 32 1/2 p late October, but they have
since fallen back to 30p.
The company may reveal its intentions when it announces its results next
month. Mr Bruce James, an analyst with Smith New Court, says Stakis has
'stopped the rot' and forecasts a net loss of about Pounds 500,000.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Gulf between the old and the new: The emerging split between
drug companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When president-elect Mr Bill Clinton repeated his 'challenge' to drugs
companies 'to give us a new healthcare system', in his victory speech late
on Tuesday night, he might have been expected to send a shudder through the
pharmaceuticals industry.
However, a restructuring of the industry was inevitable regardless of the
election's outcome. The industry is already splitting into two groups, as
shown by the job cuts announced last week by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly
and Syntex.
In the past five years, when most industries have seen earnings constrained
by weak US and European economies, the more successful drugs companies have
turned in steady annual profits growth of 15 to 20 per cent.
For the past decade, pharmaceutical companies without innovative products
that can command a premium have relied on price rises in the US, the world's
largest market, to bolster earnings. Price increases have outpaced inflation
since the late 1970s, leaving the US with some of the highest drugs prices
in the world. According to Mr Viren Mehta, partner at Mehta &amp; Isaly, the New
York analysts, the high prices have helped many companies receive more than
half their profits from the US although only about one-third of total
pharmaceutical sales are made in the US.
However, recession and spiralling healthcare costs have changed the
political climate, making further price increases unacceptable. Mr Clinton's
victory this week shattered any remaining hope of price increases.
Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who has led the congressional
campaign against excessive drugs prices, has called for strong and effective
cost containment against the pharmaceuticals industry, which he claimed, was
making 'record-breaking profits on the backs of the American public'.
Over the last 12 months most companies have felt obliged to announce they
would not make further increases or that they would limit them to the rate
of inflation. The effects were seen in the third-quarter results announced
last week, with a growing divergence in the industry between the 'haves' and
'have-nots'.
Companies such as Merck and Pfizer, which have new and innovative products,
have continued to drive double-digit earnings growth. Companies reliant on
older products, such as Syntex and Upjohn, have stumbled.
Merck led the field with net income growth of 17 per cent. Pfizer saw net
earnings rise 8 per cent.
Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers, the world's third largest drugs group, saw
earnings rise only 5 per cent. Last week it announced a 6 per cent cut in
its workforce.
The move came only days after Syntex announced its first job cuts in 10
years. Mr Hemant Shah, a pharmaceutical analyst at HKS in New Jersey, says
that because of the difficulties facing the industry, many more
pharmaceuticals companies are likely to be forced into similar actions.
Upjohn has also suffered problems. Its earnings for the third quarter were
flat. A number of Upjohn's important drugs will lose their patents by the
end of 1994, and analysts do not expect its new drugs to be big enough to
compensate.
Eli Lilly delivered the biggest surprise of the earnings season, turning in
its first-ever loss, of Dollars 268.5m (Pounds 172m). The deficit mainly
reflected restructuring and other charges of Dollars 519.6m. Lilly's
third-quarter charge also included Dollars 245m for manufacturing
streamlining.
Analysts expect other companies to start targeting manufacturing, an area in
which there is massive over-capacity.
'You are going to see a consolidation in the number of manufacturing
facilities,' said Mr Paul Freiman, chairman of the US Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association and chief executive of Syntex.
As drugs groups look for further savings, the area most likely to be spared
is research and development. R&amp;D is considered the life-blood of the
industry, as it provides the drugs to drive earnings in the future.
Nevertheless, the present rate of R&amp;D investment - which increased from
Dollars 4.5bn in 1987 to Dollars 11bn last year - is unsustainable.
Most companies are now focusing their R&amp;D resources. They are no longer
researching as many therapeutic areas and have reduced the number of drugs
they develop. SmithKline Beecham, for example, made 150 redundancies among
research staff in September and realigned its R&amp;D focus.
Marketing is another area likely to be cut as drug companies adjust to a
changing world. Mr James Sasser, Democratic senator for Tennessee, estimates
US pharmaceuticals companies spend Dollars 5,000 per doctor a year trying to
encourage doctors to prescribe their particular drugs.
In spite of such measures, the industry's position may worsen. Senator
Pryor, the oldest and closest political associate of Governor Clinton, has
promised action to rein in price rises during the first 100 days of a
Democratic administration.
Such action would only add to the pressure already being felt by the
industry. Mr Mehta believes that there will be 'successful consolidation,
where investors can expect to get some value in the short-term, among
successful companies helping each other get more successful. Companies not
in that league will have to continue on their own in a lonely setting until
their valuation has become more realistic.
'We have not really seen the final reverberations of what is unfolding,'
added Mr Mehta.
On Wall Street, drug stocks fell further than the overall market yesterday
morning, reflecting uneasiness about the implications of a Clinton
administration for the industry.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Sainsbury advances 19% at midway: Retailer's results boosted
by strong growth in volume sales of food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. SAINSBURY'S strongest volume sales growth in foods for five years enabled
the UK's biggest retailer to show a faster turn of speed than rival Tesco,
and lift interim pre-tax profits by 19.4 per cent to Pounds 391m.
But the stock market greeted the news by knocking 3.6 per cent off
Sainsbury's share price as some investors were unsettled by the cautious
stance on current trading, and took profits after its recent strong rise.
Presiding over his first results since taking over from his cousin as
chairman, Mr David Sainsbury said the outcome was 'extremely good' given the
harsh economic climate and the fall in food price inflation to its lowest
level in five years.
He attributed the company's continuing resilience to a sharpening of its
offering. 'We have seen a decline in the product quality and the standards
of service elsewhere, while we are giving better value for money than ever
before. Customers are voting with their feet,' he said.
In the UK, sales from Sainsbury's food stores, Savacentre hypermarkets and
Homebase DIY stores rose 12.8 per cent to Pounds 4.75bn. Like-for-like sales
from food stores rose 3.7 per cent - with price inflation averaging 3 per
cent - while 14 new superstores accounted for the remainder of the increase
in turnover. Nine superstores will open in the second half - each at an
average cost of Pounds 25m.
The foodstores' operating profits were 18.9 per cent higher at Pounds
361.2m, benefiting from further cost reductions and productivity
improvements. But Homebase 'bore the scars' of the price war in the DIY
market, lifting profits just 3.1 per cent to Pounds 9.1m.
Sainsbury's US subsidiary, Shaw's, was badly hit by recession and saw
trading profits fall 16.5 per cent to Dollars 21.4m (Pounds 13m) on near
static sales of Dollars 994.7m. Overall, Sainsbury's group sales rose 10 per
cent to Pounds 5.29bn in the half-year to September 26.
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 384m and added the equivalent of 2,800
jobs over last year. But operating profit per full-time employee rose 10 per
cent to Pounds 213 a week as a result of greater operating efficiencies.
Sainsbury said Sunday trading continued to prove popular with more than 1m
customers a week shopping at its stores.
Mr Sainsbury said sales had started well in the second half but the company
remained cautious about sales in the run-up to Christmas.
Earnings per share were 10.8 per cent higher at 14.99p. The interim dividend
was lifted by 12.5 per cent to 2.7p. Sainsbury's shares closed 18p lower at
487p.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Volvo to close two plants after decline in car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, Sweden's leading car group, is to close two of its three Swedish car
plants as part of a sweeping rationalisation of its car and truck
operations. The measures, announced yesterday, will result in the loss of
4,500 jobs, or 10 per cent of the overall workforce, by 1995.
The cuts, which were more severe than anticipated, reflect the sharp decline
in sales in the group's three main markets, the US, UK and Sweden, and seven
quarters of losses in its core operations. The aim is to achieve group
operating income of SKr5.5bn (Pounds 602m) by 1995.
Car production will now be concentrated at the group's Torslanda plant in
Sweden and at Ghent in Belgium. The plants at Uddevalla and Kalmar will be
closed to achieve annual cost savings of SKr350m.
Uddevalla, which only started operations in 1989, will be closed next spring
and Kalmar in mid-1994. A total of 1,600 jobs will be cut.
The closures are a personal setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's
chairman. Under his guidance, both plants fostered new production methods,
involving multi-skilled assembly-work teams, rather than traditional
assembly line methods. The company said the closures were entirely dictated
by market factors, not because of deficiencies in the new techniques.
Volvo expects car sales of just over 200,000 this year, excluding the small
400 series. In Sweden, the US and the UK, it forecasts total sales of
120,000-130,000 large cars, compared with 200,000 in 1988. Production
capacity, following the plant closures, will be 300,000 large cars, compared
with 370,000 today.
Volvo's new chief executive, Soren Gyll, said rationalisation was needed to
safeguard the company's future product development and competitiveness. 'We
must reduce our overall cost structure and adjust our organisation to market
conditions.'
Meanwhile, Volvo Trucks announced 2,000 job losses due to a rationalisation
programme which aims to cut costs by SKr2.5bn by 1995. 'There is no
indication of any improvement in the market and an increase in sales in the
near future,' it said.
A total of 500 jobs are also to be cut at Torslanda and there will also be
job cuts at Volvo Penta and at two small car factories.

FT  05 NOV 92 / BAT lifts profits by 56% to Pounds 1.03bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services company, yesterday
announced that profits rose 56 per cent in the nine months to September 30,
helped by strong worldwide cigarette sales and a turnround from loss to
profit in general insurance.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 657m to Pounds 1.03bn while earnings per
share more than doubled to 35.9p. For the latest quarter, profits increased
60 per cent to Pounds 387m. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the results
were further evidence BAT's growth could be maintained. 'We're really rather
pleased,' he said.
He repeated a pledge that full-year dividend growth would 'at least' match
the 9 per cent interim increase. BAT's shares added 8p to 914p, after
touching a record 922p.
Turnover from continuing operations increased 3 per cent to Pounds 14.5bn.
Tobacco trading profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 805m helped by rising
margins. Exports, mainly to eastern Europe and Asia, grew by a quarter and
now account for 20 per cent of total volumes. Brown &amp; Williamson, the US
subsidiary which had a weak second quarter, reported growth in volumes and
profits in the latest three months, Sir Patrick said.
Trading profits from financial services jumped from Pounds 142m to Pounds
376m, mainly due to reduced losses at Eagle Star. Mortgage indemnity
charges, to cover house repossessions, fell from Pounds 169m a year ago to
Pounds 78m and helped Eagle Star cut its losses from Pounds 248m to Pounds
66m. Sir Patrick said Eagle Star was unlikely to return to profit until 1994
because of continuing uncertainty in the housing market. Mortgage indemnity
charges were likely to continue at about Pounds 25m a quarter.
Other financial services divisions performed well, with US subsidiary
Farmers lifting trading profits 18 per cent to Pounds 305m. Allied Dunbar
increased profits 4 per cent to Pounds 93m. Reduced losses at Eagle Star,
and improved underwriting results, led to profits from general insurance
business of Pounds 173m, against losses of Pounds 39m.
BAT restated its life assurance profits for the past two years under the new
'accruals accounting' method, which would have increased to Pounds 310m
published post-tax profits for 1991 of Pounds 193m.

FT  05 NOV 92 / US fails to win support for anti-EC sanctions: Threat of
trade war is temporarily averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT OF a trade war was temporarily averted yesterday after the US
failed to win support for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) package of sanctions
against the European Community.
Punitive tariffs on food and drink imports into the US from the EC could,
however, still be imposed, scuppering hopes of a world trade agreement.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
in Geneva, asked Gatt's governing council to authorise trade reprisals of up
to Dollars 1bn on EC exports to the US as part of a long-standing dispute
between the US and the EC over the trade in oilseeds.
The US, he said, had shown 'uncommon patience' in the five-year dispute over
subsidised oilseed production. The Dollars 1bn figure represents the trade
which Washington claims its soyabean farmers have lost as a result of EC
oilseed subsidies.
The Gatt council, which has twice condemned the EC subsidies, expressed
sympathy for the US position but refused to endorse sanctions. It opted to
'receive' the US statement.
Mr Tran Van Thinh, EC ambassador to Gatt, warned that a Gatt endorsement of
US sanctions 'would have fatal repercussions on the Uruguay Round'. The two
sides were 'on the brink of an agreement', he said.
Washington's failed attempt to escalate the dispute follows the breakdown on
Tuesday of talks in Chicago between Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary,
and Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. These aimed to resolve
the long-running dispute as part of a broader accord on farm subsidies.
Mr MacSharry, chief EC negotiator in Chicago, said 'the Community has no
alternative whatsoever but to retaliate' if the US went ahead with punitive
tariffs. He added that if Washington proceeded this would make clear the US
doesn't want a Uruguay Round settlement, which is a disgraceful situation'.
He said that 'a very good agreement' to settle the farm chapter of the
Uruguay Round was close. But in the end, senior EC officials say, the US
moved backwards on the separate but linked oilseeds dispute by trying to set
a lower and permanent production limit for the EC.
Mr MacSharry received support from the European Parliament agriculture
committee and the trade committee of the Council of Ministers. But he is
understood to be dismayed at the lack of support from Mr Jacques Delors,
Commission president. There were strong rumours that he had decided to take
no further part in the Gatt negotiations, handing responsibility to Mr
Delors.
One senior EC official says Mr Delors phoned Mr MacSharry in Chicago to say
he would oppose the Gatt deal taking shape, and that France and another
unspecified member state would try to veto the package in the Council of
Ministers, by invoking overwhelming national interest.
Officials in Brussels have already drawn up a list of counter-measures if
the US goes ahead with its sanctions threat.
Washington has not completely ruled out further negotiations.
Last night Mr Bill Clinton implicitly endorsed the Bush administration's
authority to complete farm trade negotiations and if necessary impose
sanctions. Mr Clinton listed issues on which he looked forward to working
closely with Mr Bush, including 'making progress toward a good agreement on
our world trade talks'.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Gummer makes secret visit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Gummer, agriculture secretary, flew secretly to Chicago on Tuesday
in a vain attempt to help break the deadlock in the talks on farm trade and
the Uruguay Round.
Mr Gummer, who was in the US on church business, registered under an assumed
name at a hotel near the Mayfair Regent Hotel where EC and US officials were
holding talks.
He took no part in the negotiations, which Brussels handles for the EC, but
was there to strengthen the hand of Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture
commissioner. The UK currently holds the EC presidency and Mr Gummer chairs
this council.
Mr Gummer's surprise appearance came as Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture
secretary, is understood to have told Mr MacSharry that dealing with the EC
was like 'negotiating with phantoms' because each country had a different
line. The US claimed that Mr MacSharry was going beyond his mandate, or that
he could deliver more within it.
Mr MacSharry dialled Mr Gummer's room and said ask the president of the
council 'if I'm being inflexible'. Mr Gummer duly gave his backing. The US
came up with a compromise, but the talks later collapsed.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Late payment of bills endangers companies' survival, says
survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH INDUSTRY remains locked into a 'vicious circle' of late payment of
bills which is endangering the survival of increasing numbers of businesses.
A survey of more than 800 companies by Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance
group, shows that in spite of moves intended to change corporate attitudes,
delaying the payment of bills is still widespread.
According to Trade Indemnity, none of the companies it approached said it
was typically paid on time, with the average payment almost four weeks late.
Nearly a quarter of the companies said they had to wait 30 days or more
beyond the stated payment date. Some recorded delays of up to 80 days.
Mr Clive Brand, Trade Indemnity's senior economist, said the survey
highlighted a 'cultural problem throughout industry from which no company or
industry escapes'.
'Those who are badly hit by the problem often have no choice but to adopt
the same approach in order to relieve their own cash flow problems,' he
added.
Mr Brand said smaller companies continued to be hit hardest, but noted that
overseas customers were also guilty of late payment. Delays in payment by
export customers cast a shadow over the expected benefits from the
devaluation of sterling.
The survey said the sectors worst hit by late payment were engineering,
paper and printing, timber, motor manufacturing and chemicals. The average
value of debts at least 30 days outstanding is now Pounds 120,000, compared
with Pounds 102,000 in June.
In the last Budget, the chancellor announced measures to tackle the problem,
including the financing of three pilot schemes within trade associations to
provide late payment 'hot lines' for members. Large companies will also have
to state in their accounts how quickly they pay their bills.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: HK Land/Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Land can hardly have expected to raise its stake in Trafalgar House
so soon after its tender offer flopped. It must have stumbled across a
pretty smart operator willing to set up its options package. Presumably that
operator reckons on finding enough institutional holders willing to commit
themselves to selling a portion of their stake at around 85p in February in
exchange for protection against the market value of their remaining holding
finishing below that level in May. With a floor under the price and no other
obvious buyers in the market, Trafalgar's share price looks becalmed. That
may shake out a little more paper, which would help the counterparty meet
its initial commitment of 36m shares.
Land's stake in Trafalgar House will thus move over 20 per cent, allowing it
to equity-account the holding. It might like the outside world to believe
that the deal was worth this simple convenience. The fact remains, though,
that it has also turned up the heat under Trafalgar. The story is not over
yet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now the election is over, attention is switching to the details of
President-elect Clinton's economic policies. And as his package is prepared,
the response of the Federal Reserve will be equally closely watched.
Yesterday the Fed's 'beige book' report on the economy acknowledged that US
growth was patchy, as the figures for third-quarter GNP suggested. But the
Fed is likely to wait and see how much of a fiscal boost the president
intends to give before considering another cut in rates, even if tomorrow's
employment report shows the economy slowing once more.
With short rates so low and inflation subdued, more investors may move from
cash into longer-dated US Treasury paper in the weeks ahead, despite fears
of a higher budget deficit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Appropriately for the company which makes Lucky Strike cigarettes, BAT
Industries is enjoying its fair share of good fortune. Fate has breathed
life into tobacco by opening up new markets from Czechoslovakia to China.
Farmers Insurance missed any serious damage from Hurricane Andrew. Lower US
interest rates mean higher earnings for a company with around Dollars 1bn
floating rate dollar debt. True, mortgage indemnity insurance cost Eagle
Star another Pounds 29m in the third quarter, underlining that BAT remains
hostage to the UK housing market. In the context of a company making Pounds
100m a month from cigarettes, though, this now looks more of an
embarrassment than a threat.
Judging by the Pounds 175m investment in doubling capacity at its main UK
plant, BAT believes tobacco profits have further to go. If the lucky streak
continues, earnings could also be flattered next year by a stronger dollar.
The new accruals method of accounting for long-term insurance business
should make the accounts easier to understand - although not until BAT
deigns to give its underlying assumptions on investment returns, policy
surrenders and so on.
With prospects elsewhere deeply uncertain, the promise of 9 per cent
dividend growth this year looks appealing. Even at yesterday's all-time
high, BAT's shares are trading on a prospective yield higher than the market
average.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: J Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another sparkling half-year performance from Sainsbury shows why Tesco has
cause to fret about the comparison between the two chains. With profits up
19 per cent, at the same time as its market share rose from 10.2 to 11 per
cent, Sainsbury can afford to stand aloof. Even its heavy capital
expenditure programme was more than covered by cash flow in the current
half, and the outflow for the year is likely to be less than Pounds 150m.
This year the company has built on its rock-solid franchise with powerful
marketing and promotion to outpace its rivals once more.
Yet there are caveats. Sainsbury benefited from its special price
promotions, the introduction of credit cards and Sunday opening this year -
factors which will make it all the harder to shine in 1993. While the
company insists devaluation will not add much to shop prices, it is not
clear who will have to absorb the cost. There is also a nagging doubt about
overcapacity. The current aggressive pricing between the chains might be
symptomatic of recession, or it might herald longer-term problems. Industry
returns on new openings are falling, though they are still acceptable. As
new superstores cost Pounds 25m, the costs of exit would be high, with the
battle for survival bitter.
It will be others who feel the majority of that pain. But Sainsbury could
perhaps turn up the heat on its weaker brethren by depreciating the value of
its freehold stores.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: A moment of truth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the UK equity market has been trading at near-record levels in recent
days, investors must have been reasonably sanguine about the Maastricht
vote. The downside risk from a government defeat was after all clear in
advance: political confusion of a sort that is anathema to financial markets
and the prospect of a much weaker pound (which was also holding up
remarkably well against the D-Mark ahead of the vote).
A No vote thus hardly held the promise of an equity market rally of the sort
that greeted the UK's initial departure from the ERM. Then the assumption
was that freedom from the shackles of Europe would give the government the
freedom to pursue an independent economic policy for recovery. Only later
did it dawn that a widening PSBR would be much harder to fund with
institutional cash-flow tight and sterling floating free. Yesterday's modest
fall in long gilts suggests investors in that market too were fairly
relaxed.
None of this means, however, that equities approached last night with much
to look forward to from a favourable vote. An historic market multiple of
over 16 makes shares expensive when there is still no economic recovery and
corporate earnings are stagnant. Besides, many more nasty moments loom on
the political and economic front, such as public sector pay, mine closures,
and the Edinburgh summit.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Irish government set to fall as coalition partners resign
posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government is expected to fall today after the Progressive
Democrats, until now junior partners in the coalition, resigned their
ministerial posts and made clear they would support a 'no confidence' motion
proposed by the opposition Labour party.
Ms Mary Harney, a Progressive Democrat (PD) deputy who quit as junior
minister for the environment, said yesterday: 'The country needs an
election. The government has broken down.' She said the six PD deputies
would vote with the opposition.
The two senior PD ministers in the cabinet - Mr Des O'Malley, industry
minister and PD leader, and Mr Bobby Molloy, energy minister - informed Mr
Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of their resignation from the
government last night after a PD parliamentary group meeting which had been
convened to discuss the coalition crisis.
Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner with 77 seats, will not be able to
muster an overall majority in the 166-seat Dail (parliament) and will
therefore fall. Mr Reynolds is expected to ask President Mary Robinson to
dissolve the Dail this evening.
A general election must then be held within 30 days. Two dates are being
considered - November 26 or December 3. The elections and a controversial
abortion referendum are likely to be held on the same date.
The crisis began last week when Mr Reynolds accused Mr O'Malley of being
dishonest in the evidence Mr O'Malley had given to a parliamentary inquiry
into the country's beef industry earlier this year.
Mr O'Malley had criticised Mr Reynolds' actions as industry minister in 1987
and 1988 in supporting beef sales to Iraq which he claimed had exposed the
Irish taxpayer to unnecessary risks.
The PDs called on Mr Reynolds to withdraw the accusation. He refused,
precipitating the split in the coalition.
Mr Reynolds told his party yesterday he intended to lead it to victory with
an overall majority. Most opinion polls indicate, however, that an absolute
majority will continue to elude it.
Mr Reynolds' future within the party is likely to be called into question.
Some backbenchers warned earlier this week that they felt an election had
been precipitated unnecessarily by Mr Reynolds and that if the party lost
seats in the election, a search for a new leader might begin.
Mr Reynolds has been Fianna Fail leader and prime minister only since
February after he ousted Mr Charles Haughey in an internal party coup.
In the past few days the two main opposition parties, Fine Gael and Labour,
have ruled out entering into a coalition with Fianna Fail after the election
so long as Mr Reynolds remains leader, as have the PDs and the socialist
Democratic Left party.
Labour is reluctant to join a coalition with Fine Gael, because of its
unhappy experience in such a coalition in 1982-87. It could therefore prove
difficult to piece together a stable government after the election without
big compromises or a further general election to break the possible
deadlock.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Bill to curb unions squeezed on to Commons timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT, in an unexpected move, will today publish and give first
reading to a bill imposing further curbs on trade unions. It will include
the right of citizens to take out injunctions against unlawful strikes.
The bill is also expected to pave the way for the abolition of wages
councils, the statutory bodies which set pay rates for more than 2.5m
workers in low-paid jobs. Mr Michael Forsythe, the employment minister, said
in the Commons this week that the government saw no permanent place for
wages councils.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said last week that the
bill, expected to be brought forward this autumn, was being postponed on
technical grounds until later in the year. The bill lost its parliamentary
slot but Conservative party business managers have now squeezed it into the
timetable.
The legislation, on which Tory MPs are united, could be a morale booster to
a party divided on other issues. In addition, the government may feel it
wants to be sure of the new powers relating to strikes and public services
before the full impact of any pay squeeze in the public sector is felt.
The bill, whose architect was Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary
and former employment secretary, is expected to conform broadly to its
original form.
It will include the right of employers to regularly seek employees' consent
for union dues to be deducted from pay on automatic 'check-off'. This is
expected to affect adversely union funds, which are already under pressure.
Unions will also have to give seven days' notice of strikes and individuals
will have the right to join the trade union of their choice regardless of
the Trades Union Congress arrangement for regulating inter-union disputes.
The green paper received a lukewarm reception from employers' organisations,
including the Confederation of British Industry.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Change of course in the economic mainstream: The new
administration's policies are unlikely to represent a return to earlier
Democratic creeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For two long decades, conservative political and economic philosophies have
been in the ascendant. Following the electoral triumphs of Ronald Reagan and
Margaret Thatcher, the industrialised world seemed to change gear,
increasingly accepting the rationality of free markets, limited government
and less generous welfare policies.
The collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at
the end of the 1980s and the conversion of much of the third world to market
economics supposedly completed this historic transformation. Does Bill
Clinton's stunning victory change anything? Is this the end of the
conservative revolution?
It is tempting to say yes. Mr Clinton has criss-crossed America, attacking
'trickle down' economics and the greed of the 1980s. He has dismissed tax
cuts that favour the rich as unjust and ineffectual. He has not been afraid
to proclaim his faith in government's ability to solve economic and social
problems.
At the very least, the US will thus undergo a 'course correction'. Although
the true character of a Clinton administration cannot be judged until the
main White House and Cabinet appointments are announced, we are most
unlikely to witness a reversion to an earlier Democratic era. After the
second world war, conservatives were able to govern only after they had come
to terms with the social and economic upheavals of the 1930s: they did not
attempt to repeal the New Deal or the welfare state.
In the same vein, Mr Clinton's victory represents an accommodation by the
left to the conservative revolution of the past two decades. Mr Clinton may
slightly increase taxes on the rich but he will not return to the sky-high
marginal rates of the pre-Reagan years.
Mr Clinton is basking in an historic victory largely because he convinced
Americans that he is indeed a 'New Demo crat'. Like many conservatives, he
stresses the importance of economic opportunity and personal responsibility;
he has also pledged to 'reinvent' government, making it less bureaucratic
and more entrepreneurial.
American pragmatism has also played a role in Mr Clinton's victory. Many who
voted Democrat on Tuesday favour lower taxes and less govern ment: Mr
Clinton's victory is less a rejection of the values of the 1980s than of
Republican economic performance.
By the standards of many countries, such as Britain, the US may appear to
have had a mild recession. It has been growing sluggishly for 18 months. Yet
the Bush years as a whole were a period of economic stagnation. Per capita
disposable incomes did not rise. Unemployment went up. Debt burdens - public
and pri vate - seemed intolerable. For Americans this was totally
unacceptable; memories of rapid growth under President Reagan were
obliterated.
Worse, Americans began to doubt their longer-term economic future.
Historians speculated about a US version of the celebrated 'British
disease'. Economists pointed out that productivity growth had been sluggish
since 1973 and that much of the population had experienced static or falling
wages for two decades. This, some warned, might be the first generation of
Americans to face lower living standards than their parents. Matters came to
a head last December when Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve and a pillar of the establishment, told Congress: "There is a
deep-seated concern out there that I must say to you I haven't seen in my
lifetime.'
How is Mr Clinton planning to overcome this entrenched mood of pessimism?
All the signs suggest he will follow fairly conventional macroeconomic
policies. He seems unlikely to interfere with the conduct of monetary
policy. During the campaign he declined an invitation to blame the recession
on the Fed, which he believes should remain independent of the executive arm
of government.
On fiscal policy, there is an inherent conflict between his desire to invest
more heavily in education, training and infrastructure and his promise to
'cut the deficit in half' by 1996. Few analysts believe his hopes of raising
large sums from rich individuals and foreign corporations are realistic.
However, it would be wrong to assume that the deficit is bound to rise now
that Democrats control both the White House and Congress.
Mr Clinton is likely to look for ways of restructuring both sides of the
federal balance sheet. The rate of growth of spending could be substantially
reduced if he has the courage to curb the benefits that wealthy Americans
receive from entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions. He may
also opt for a bold reform of taxes: a shift towards consumption-based taxes
could raise revenues while increasing incentives for savings and investment.
Some form of investment tax credit seems certain to form a central plank of
next year's budget.
Mr Clinton's cure for the American economy, however, is likely to look
beyond short-run macroeconomics. His talk of investment in 'people-based
economics' is not just a rhetorical flourish. In a world of intense global
competition, he believes that governments can best promote higher living
standards by focusing on the factors of production that are relatively
fixed, such as the workforce and infrastructure. Additional investment in
education, training and infrastructure is thus an integral part of a
long-term strategy to improve the competitiveness of the private sector.
For Mr Clinton economic and social policies are interwoven. He is the first
president-elect in recent his tory to argue that the US is doing poorly
because government is failing to provide services that other leading nations
take for granted.
He points out that every other industrial nation spends much less than the
US on healthcare yet manages to offer universal coverage. He contrasts the
US's patchy training programmes with Ger many's famed apprenticeship system
and argues that more has to be done for the non-college-bound majority. And
he compares simplistic laissez-faire economics unfavourably with the more
active industrial policies of Japan and continental Europe. The stress on
social policies and workforce skills or 'human capital' should not be seen
as of secondary economic importance.
This, rather than monetary or fiscal policy, is the heart of 'Clintonomics.'
He genuinely believes that the US will prosper in the 21st century only if
it makes fundamental reforms in these often neglected areas.
When President-elect Clinton claims to be seeking a new "third way' that
respects market forces yet also places emphasis on social solidarity, he
should be taken at face value. He is not a throwback to the past but part of
an unfold ing revolution that is more liberal - in the 19th-century sense -
than dirigiste in its fundamental values. Americans have voted for a
technocrat rather than an ideologue; what remains uncertain is his ability
to translate academic theories into practical programmes.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Technology: Brush up on gums - Victoria Griffith describes
why companies are putting a new shine on dental products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the days when our concerned parents urged us to brush our teeth at night,
that was about as far as their exhortations went. These days, though,
parental pleas might include brushing with tartar-control paste, flossing,
and rinsing with a plaque-fighting mouthwash.
Attention to dental care over the last few years has brought forth a flood
of new products that our mothers and fathers would never have recognised. In
the past, tooth decay was the main concern, and fluoride became recognised
as a key compound for control.
Today, as the baby-boom generation enters middle age with most of its teeth
intact, the focus has switched to the prevention of gum disease. With the
improvement in dental hygiene, and regular visits to the dentist, tooth
decay is becoming a disease of the past.
According to a study by the US National Institute for Dental Research, less
than half of American children now have tooth decay, compared with 63 per
cent a decade ago and 72 per cent in the 1970s.
The result is that more people are keeping their teeth longer. Not long ago,
dentures were common in middle-aged adults, but today less than 4 per cent
of Americans under 65 have lost all their teeth.
More teeth has meant more demand for dental products. Because teeth
encourage the build-up of bacteria in the mouth, however, it has also meant
more gum disease. 'The baby-boom generation is moving into a phase of life
in which gum disease is a major threat,' said Aline Christiansen, a product
director at Johnson &amp; Johnson. 'That's why we've seen so many new products
in this line over the last few years.'
Toothbrushes have been the main focus of innovation recently. 'There has
been a small boom in toothbrush products over the last few years,' said
Glenn Archibald, president of California-based toothbrush manufacturer
Oral-B.
The reason is that traditional toothbrushes are not really suitable for gum
stimulation, which is important in the prevention of gum disease. 'Dentists
are now advising their patients to brush their gums as well as their teeth,'
said Chris Burbank of Crest, part of Procter &amp; Gamble. 'But old-fashioned
toothbrushes, if used improperly, can cause gum damage.'
Crest has just come out with its first toothbrush, which is designed to
penetrate further between the teeth without hurting the gums. The toothbrush
has a rippled surface; its bristles are highly polished, and therefore
gentle on gums. 'We have a patented technology to polish, cut and shape the
bristles so that they can be used effectively on the gums,' Burbank
explained.
Colgate has also jumped on the bandwagon by introducing its Precision
toothbrush brand, which has a triangular head. Once again, the goal is to
brush between the teeth. One new toothbrush, Oral-B's Indicator brand, is
aimed at encouraging Americans to replace their toothbrush more often.
'The American Dental Association recommends replacing your toothbrush every
three months,' Archibald points out. 'But most people buy a new one once a
year. By then the bristles have frayed and may start to damage gums.'
The idea behind the Indicator is simple. A row in the middle of the brush is
coloured blue with a food-based die. When the colour fades half-way down the
bristle, the marketing slogan explains, it's time to get a new toothbrush.
Electric toothbrushes have also experienced something of a renaissance.
Braun makes a new product called the 'Plac Remover', with a round head which
moves back and forth. Bausch &amp; Laumb has put out 'Interplak', an electric
toothbrush whose individual tufts rotate in different directions, and
Panasonic and WaterPik have introduced similar products.
Dental floss is also being made more appealing. Although flossing is
considered essential for the effective prevention of gum disease, a study by
the American Dental Association shows that only 44 per cent of Americans
floss daily.
The reason, manufacturers feel, is that many people find floss difficult to
use. Sulca, a Canadian company, has taken advantage of this hole in the
market by introducing what it claims is a substitute for flossing - a
stimulation brush.
The brush, which was tested with encouraging results by Columbia University,
consists of a single tuft of bristles, pointed at the tip and placed in a
rubber base, for easy insertion between the teeth.
'This product works better than dental floss in massaging the gums,' said
Ira Florence, Sulca's sales director. According to the American Dental
Association, mouthwash has been even less successful a product than floss,
with just 16 per cent of the country's population using it on a regular
basis.
Mouthwash manufacturers have been taking advantage of the new concern about
gum disease by pointing out that mouthwash is an effective combatant. The
problem is that many people do not like the taste.
To make the product more amenable, Warner-Lambert has introduced a variation
on its Listerine brand. Its new mouthwash 'maintains a balance of thymol,
menthol, eucalyptol and methyl salicylate, while making it taste more like
mint'. According to Ray Le Febvre, president of the company's consumer
health products group: 'Through a patented process, our scientists
identified the formula to enhance the taste, yet maintain therapeutic
efficacy.'
Although preventing gum disease is the industry's main focus, scientists
have been working on other innovations as well. Johnson &amp; Johnson has just
launched 'synthetic sapphire braces' for general orthodontic use.
'Synthetic sapphire is the second-hardest metal known to man,' said
Christiansen, product director at the company. 'These braces don't stain,
and because they are clear, they blend with teeth colour.'
Other products consumers can expect to see on the market soon are improved
artificial teeth and desk-top computer systems that will show the impact of
orthodontic plans to patients before treatment begins.
The National Institute of Dental Research is also financing the development
of a new fluoride and calcium phosphate mouthrinse for the market. As people
hold on to their teeth longer, industry experts believe dental care products
will continue to be a growing market.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Komatsu's earnings cut in
building slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE slowing of private construction orders and reductions in capital
spending by Japanese manufacturers were blamed by Komatsu, the maker of
construction machinery, for a 40.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y12bn
(Dollars 98m) for the first half to the end of September.
Sales during the period were down 13.9 per cent to Y259.7bn, with sales of
construction equipment down 13.6 per cent to Y200.6bn and those of
industrial machinery down 31.9 per cent to Y28.8bn. The figures reflect weak
demand from the car and electrical goods industries.
Komatsu said the outlook for the rest of this year and next was clouded by
'the lagging recovery in private sector equipment investment and by
political and economic uncertainties at home and abroad'.
But the company is confident the government's emergency economic package,
announced in August, will lead to increased construction equipment orders
for public projects, while a 'relatively mild' recovery is expected in the
US and Europe.
Overseas sales of its construction equipment fell 12.1 per cent, while those
of industrial machinery were down 28.5 per cent during the first half. The
fall in industrial machinery demand is a setback for the company's plans to
broaden machinery production and reduce reliance on the construction market.
Komatsu was weakened by the fall in stock prices as the value of its
holdings fell from Y349.8bn last September to Y226.8bn this September.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Lion Nathan rises 64% after Bond
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LION Nathan, Australia and New Zealand's biggest brewing group, yesterday
announced a 64.3 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 116.65m
(USDollars 61.39m) for the 12 months to August, from NZDollars 70.98m the
year before.
The result reflected the purchase of the former Bond Brewing assets with
effect from March 31. Up to that date, Lion Nathan owned half of the
company, which owns the Swan, Tooheys and Castlemaine XXXX brands.
Directors said that a significant rise in operating profits was achieved in
spite of difficult trading conditions in both Australia and New Zealand.
They said the outlook was for a further strong performance in the 1992-93
year helped by the company's portfolio of strong brands.
But increased competition and difficult trading conditions in New Zealand
and Australia would be a challenge.
While the result was slightly above analysts' expectations, there was
surprise at the high level of extraordinary losses of NZDollars 95.49m.
These included the sale of the former Woolworths New Zealand department
store group Deka to Maori interests, resulting in a NZDollars 30.25m loss.
Other extraordinary losses included a write-down on property interests of
NZDollars 54.41m, a loss of NZDollars 10.39m on discontinuing stopping
certain business involvements, and NZDollars 10.34m due to the sale and
writing-down of investments associated with the unsuccessful merger with
Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the former Bond company. ACIL is
now controlled by Brierley Investments, the New Zealand holding company.
In a settlement announced to the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges
last night, Lion Nathan said it had reached an agreement with ACIL to end
litigation and finalise the price of the brewery purchases.
Under this, Lion Nathan will pay ADollars 38.38m to ACIL, which will be
settled by the issue of Lion Nathan junior capital stock and ordinary
shares.
The Australian beer market shrank by 3.5 per cent during the year and there
was little growth in the soft drink industry. However, the directors said
there were signs that the contraction in the beer markets in both Australia
and New Zealand had bottomed out.
Lion Nathan Australia saw its national market share rise above 40 per cent.
In New Zealand, the group's market share remained at 57 per cent.
New Zealand liquor activities produced net profits of NZDollars 97.5m
compared with NZDollars 105.03m on lower sales of NZDollars 625.59m against
NZDollars 711.49m. Net losses of NZDollars 13.93m were incurred on soft
drinks compared with NZDollars 16.48m, on turnover of NZDollars 131.04m
against NZDollars 112.35m.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sparkle on Fair and Reasonable
diamonds - The upheaval caused by the Japanese jewellery retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR, a Japanese jewellery importer and retailer, is adding to the present
woes of De Beers, the South African group, by taking a new approach in
Japan's diamond market. This has grown into one of the world's largest,
thanks to the demand for luxury goods in the boom of the late 1980s.
Not only has FR - which stands for Fair and Reasonable - snatched a contract
to import polished diamonds from the recently re-named autonomous republic
of Sakha - formerly Yakutia - which produces most of Russia's diamonds, it
has also shocked the trade by publishing a monthly diamond price index,
something De Beers believes strongly should be avoided.
With worldwide demand for diamonds languishing because of recession, the
last thing De Beers needs is disarray in the Japanese market, which vies
with the US as the world's biggest and accounts for about one-third of total
diamond retail sales.
FR, a newcomer to the Y1,000bn (Dollars 8.18bn) Japanese retail market, is
aggressively expanding at a time when other diamond distributors are cutting
stocks. Last July, it set up a diamond shop in Ginza, the classy shopping
district of Tokyo.
FR was listed on the over-the-counter market in April last year and has
grown at a speed unprecedented in Japan. Headed by Mr Yoshihiko Suzuki, the
33-year-old president, sales have risen to Y26bn since it was set up 10
years ago. But FR's share price has plunged 63 per cent from the beginning
of last month after rumours of financial difficulties.
Mr Suzuki refutes the rumours, and stock market analysts suggest the stories
may have been started by FR's competitors. 'The company is up against the
world's largest diamond cartel as well as long-standing Japanese retailers,'
points out Ms Setsu Yamazaki, retail analyst at brokers James Capel. But Ms
Yamazaki adds that FR undoubtedly faces hard times because of the fall in
consumer spending.
Mr Suzuki says imports of polished diamonds from Sakha will start this
month. He says FR has a contract to distribute 10 per cent of the diamonds
which will be cut and polished in the republic by a joint venture company
established in May between Yakutia and Arda, a Japanese trading company.
Diamond cutters are being recruited from Moscow.
However, De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough
diamonds, claimed last week that it had been given an undertaking by Sakha
that, if a cutting centre was set up, De Beers would take charge, not the
Japanese company.
Nevertheless, FR has already opened a stone polishing and cutting factory in
Yamanashi prefecture, west of Tokyo, and wants to bring over trainees from
Sakha. The company expects imports from Sakha, which will total some 6,000
carats during the next two months, gradually to increase to an annual
300,000 carats.
Meanwhile, FR has derived a bid and offering price for customers, by adding
a 17 per cent margin to the average importers' price. Mr Suzuki says diamond
prices at other retailers are two to five times higher than that of FR's.
He adds FR is ready to buy customers' diamonds bought from other retailers.
'Before, people only had the option of a pawn shop to cash their diamonds. I
want to create a secondary market,' he says.
Mr Suzuki's scheme to create a secondary diamond market in Japan has
triggered scorn among his competitors. It is virtually impossible anywhere
in the world to get even two traders to agree on the price of a polished
diamond.
Despite the recession, Mr Suzuki puts on a brave face. He says that by
offering quality diamonds at affordable prices, FR's sales and profits are
expected to grow steadily. 'In the bubble age, you could sell anything, even
if it was expensive. Now people want to be satisfied without spending that
much,' he says.

TENAGA Nasional, Malaysia's partially-privatised electricity utility, has
announced a doubling in taxable profits to MDollars 1.41bn (Dollars 561m)
for the 12 months ending August 1992. This compares with MDollars 702m the
year before.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to MDollars 4.28bn from MDollars 3.70bn. The group
said the increase in turnover was mainly due to a big growth in demand for
electricity from the industrial sector.
Malaysia's economy grew by 8.7 per cent last year and is forecast to grow by
8.5 per cent this year.
Tenaga said the results also reflected the gains made by a shift to
lower-cost gas fuel from coal and oil.
The group had also been helped by the strengthening of the Malaysian dollar.
Tenaga was partially privatised in May and is now the biggest company on the
Kuala Lumpur stock ex-change.
The group said it expected to maintain turnover and profit levels for the
remainder of the present financial year.

CARTER Holt Harvey, the New Zealand forestry group, expects to announce the
sale of Sealord, its fishing subsidiary, later this week, Mr Wilson
Whineray, deputy managing director, said yesterday.
This followed the decision by the New Zealand appeal court yesterday that it
would not interfere with a deal under which the government plans to advance
NZDollars 150m (USDollars 78.9m) to a group of Maori people to help them
form a joint venture with Brierley Investments to buy Sealord.
Sir Robin Cook, appeal court chairman, described the agreement between the
Maori people and the government, which is aimed at settling fishing claims
dating back to an 1840 treaty between the Maori tribes and Queen Victoria,
as an 'historic step'.
It has received two bids for Sealord: one from Ashlar Corporation - a
consortium of Danish and New Zealand companies, led by the fishing group
Royal Greenland - and the Maori-Brierley consortium. Both are believed to
value Sealord at between NZDollars 300 and NZDollars 400m. It is New
Zealand's biggest fishing company.
However, two Maori groups opposed to the deal to buy Sealord say they will
appeal to either the United Nations or the British Privy Council.
They are opposed to the deal which sets out to be a 'final settlement' to
the claims.

NIPPON Mining, the Japanese metal processing and oil refining group,
yesterday reported a 36.5 per cent slide to Y3.06bn (Dollars 25m) in parent
company pre-tax profits in the half-year to September from Y4.81bn a year
earlier, as a result of weak demand and prices throughout its core
businesses.
Sales fell by 11.7 per cent to Y384.84bn from Y435.72bn.
In the metals side of the business, sales fell by Y13.9bn to Y141.1bn, with
sales of copper, gold, and silver all reduced in value. The volume of zinc
sales fell, although a rise in prices helped improve the value of sales.
The volume of petroleum products sales fell from 8.69m kilolitres to 8.16
kilolitres, while the value of sales was off by Y39.45bn to Y241.26bn.
At the net level, Nippon Mining's profits fell by 64.5 per cent to Y905m
from Y2.55bn.

<TEXT>
THAI Airways International, the partially-privatised national airline, has
announced a fall in net profits to Bt3.02bn (Dollars 118m) in the year ended
September 30, down from Bt3.50bn the previous year.
In the September quarter, net profits fell 49 per cent to Bt1.2bn from
Bt2.35bn a year earlier, reflecting fierce regional competition and higher
costs.
Civilians chosen by the previous government took control of the airline's
board from the air force in early September, and the new management is
attempting to improve the company's performance and shake off allegations of
corruption which have sullied the airline's image in recent years.
Most stock analysts are encouraged by the boardroom revolution, although
they still regard the company's shares as overpriced compared with those of
regional competitors Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines.
Profits have again been boosted by aircraft disposals, but brokers say the
latest sales make sense because they rationalise the fleet and help reduce
over-capacity; in 1991 the airline sold air-craft and immediately leased
them back simply to raise cash.
Brokers are waiting for further details of the 1992 results and for the
company's revised profit forecasts. Sales in the 1992 financial year rose
5.9 per cent to Bt48.43bn, while in the September quarter they rose 4.1 per
cent to Bt12.27 over the same period last year.

INDIAN Petrochemicals Corporation, India's largest petrochemicals company
which was set to become the country's first state-owned company to offer
equity to foreign investors, has postponed its planned issue until the
second quarter of the financial year to March 1994.
The issue, expected to raise around Rs6.5bn (Dollars 228m), was slated for
the first quarter of 1993-94.
The company had proposed to offer about 14 per cent of its equity in two
tranches to foreign investors. One reason for the delay was the lukewarm
response companies floating similar issues had receiv-ed.
A board meeting this week decided not to proceed with the issue until it had
been thoroughly discussed with Mr K. G. Ramanathan, the chairman who took
over this month.
The company will, however, go ahead with a local share issue on November 16
to raise Rs200m and reduce the government stake to 51 per cent.

AIR CANADA, which has dropped its merger plan with rival Canadian Airlines
International, reported a CDollars 14m (USDollars 11.6m) loss for the third
quarter, its busiest period, writes Robert Gibbens.
The latest loss, equivalent to 19 cents a share, compares with a profit of

4.6 per cent to just over CDollars 1bn. Revenue passenger miles flown
totalled 4.6bn, up from 4.2bn.
Operating profit before financial charges for the latest quarter was
CDollars 39m, against CDollars 47m, while asset sales increased cash by
CDollars 407m to CDollars 511m. The nine-month loss was CDollars 307m, or
CDollars 4.14 a share, against a deficit of CDollars 126m, or CDollars 1.70
a share, a year earlier, on revenues almost static at CDollars 2.7bn.

<TEXT>
WOOLWORTH Corporation, the US retailer which operates both general
merchandise outlets and specialty stores, yesterday reported sharply
improved third-quarter results. The group hoisted after-tax profits from
Dollars 41m a year ago to Dollars 65m.
The profits increase came on sales up by 3.2 per cent, at Dollars 2.5bn
overall.
Within this advance, Woolworth saw faster progress on the specialty store
side - sales rising by 4.4 per cent - while the general merchandise revenues
only increased by 2.2 per cent.
However, Mr Harold Sells, chairman, said the group was 'encouraged that the
rate of increase in sales and profits in the third quarter was greater than
that of the first half'. He added that the progress being made with
Woolworth's store redeployment programme should mean 'further improvements
in sales and profits throughout the all-important fourth quarter'.
The third-quarter results mean the stores group has now reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 115m for the first nine months of the year, on sales of
Dollars 6.83bn.
This compares with a net loss of Dollars 38m in the same period of 1991, but
the 1991 came after a one-off, non-cash charge of Dollars 113m related to a
change in accounting standards.
Yesterday, Woolworth shares responsed with a Dollars  3/8 rise to Dollars 33
3/8 at close of trading.
Woolworth said its revenues in the US were 'essentially flat'. However,
there was a reduction of approximately 8 per cent, year-on-year, in the
number of stores operated, and on a comparable-store basis, sales rose by
2.4 per cent.
Overseas revenues rose by 7.5 per cent in US dollar terms, although if the
currency translation was made at year-earlier foreign exchange rates, the
rise would have been 4.6 per cent.
FW Woolworth, a unit of Woolworth , said up to 40 locations would be added
to its new The Bargain] chain.
The company said the locations to be acquired were mainly in Ontario and
eastern Canada and were occupied by the Bargain Harold's chain.
It said some 20 The Bargain] locations would be opened by the end of the
month, and the balance early in the new year.

European consumer businesses, according to a new study prepared by banking
analysts at Salomon Brothers in New York.
Salomon estimates the expense base of the bank's European consumer operation
is now about Dollars 300m less per year than the Dollars 1.5bn it was in
1990 as a result of asset disposals and restructuring.
Ms Diane Glossman, the Salomon banking analyst, said yesterday she believed
Citicorp's European consumer activities suffered a loss of Dollars 50m to
Dollars 100m in 1990 but made a small profit last year, thanks largely to a
Dollars 125m pre-tax gain on the disposal of a 48-branch Italian subsidiary.
Ms Glossman also cited moves in the UK, France, Germany and Austria that
have contributed to the improvement.
Among these was the bank's recent move to consolidate its German
retail-oriented operations under one holding company.
'We estimate that the investment in building the European consumer effort
has equalled about Dollars 150m annually during the past few years,' the
Salomon report said.
The German investment alone will continue at an estimated rate of Dollars
50m during the 1992-1993 period, with the installation of another set of
automated teller machines and development of new software.
The revenues lost as a result of the sale of businesses should be replaced
over the next couple of years, according to Salomon.
Ms Glossman said she expected Citicorp to introduce a basic
product-and-service package in four core countries - Belgium, Germany,
Greece and Spain.
She also estimated that by year-end Citicorp would have a base of about
500,000 credit cards in Europe, reaching break-even in 1993 before achieving
substantial returns in 1994.

GENERAL Mills, the Minneapolis-based packaged foods group, has called off
the proposed purchase of RJR Nabisco's remaining 'cold cereal' business,
writes Nikki Tait.
It blamed the length of time which would have been involv-ed in the
anti-trust regulators' review of the agreement.
Following news late on Tuesday that the transaction was being aborted,
speculation quickly mounted that another large consumer products company
might acquire the operations.
Both Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and beer company, and Quaker Oats were
touted as buyers yesterday.
The deal, first announced on September 1, would have involved General Mills
in buying the business for Dollars 450m in cash.

REYNOLDS Metals, third-largest of the world's aluminium groups, is to spend
Dollars 26m on a plant at Auburn, Indiana, to produce aluminium extruded

Technology for the components - bumper systems, door intrusion beams and
sun-roof tracks - was developed at Reynolds' Netherlands plant.
Several employees will be transferred from there to the new facility in the
US, due to start up late next year.
Reynolds and other western world aluminium companies see the automotive

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: RBC to set aside extra CDollars
900m for provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, is almost
doubling its 1992 loan loss provisions to reflect unexpectedly heavy
write-downs on its real estate portfolio and other corporate loans to
customers in the Toronto area.
The additional provisions and a one-time restructuring charge will slash the
bank's net earnings for fiscal 1992 to about CDollars 100m (USDollars 83m),
down from CDollars 983m in 1991.
The bank said it was setting aside an extra CDollars 900m in provisions for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992, which ended on October 31. This would
raise provisions for the year to CDollars 2.1bn, from an earlier estimate of
CDollars 1.2bn.
Restructuring costs of CDollars 130m will also be charged against income.
These charges will result in a fourth-quarter loss of about CDollars 480m,
or CDollars 1.65 per share.
The bank said more than half the additional write-down applied to 'a number
of accounts' in the commercial real estate industry.
Earlier this year, RBC added CDollars 300m to its loan-loss reserves,
largely to cover expected losses from CDollars 780m exposure to Olympia &amp;
York. But this was offset by an identical reversal in earlier provisions on
third world loans.
RBC said the remaining write-downs were concentrated among corporate
customers around Toronto, which has been among the hardest-hit parts of
Canada during the recession.
Non-performing loans on October 31 totalled about CDollars 3.7bn, a CDollars
500m increase from three months earlier. The bank said it had classified as
non-accrual accounts those which are still servicing their debts but which
may run into difficulty later on.
RBC said it expected to maintain its dividend and its capital ratios
remained well above regulatory requirements. It added that problems were
confined to its corporate loan portfolio while its retail, treasury and
securities businesses were performing strongly.

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nissan faces a strategic dilemma
 -A look at the Japanese group's attempts at recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest vehicle maker, announced Y21.99bn
(Dollars 180m) parent company net interim losses this week, Mr Atushi
Muramatsu, executive vice-president, gave a telling clue about the terrible
dilemma the company faces as it charts a path to recovery.
According to Mr Muramatsu, Nissan lost domestic market share partly because
Nissan dealers were not discounting vehicles enough to match the
competition. Instead, they were attempting to boost profits by maintaining a
reasonable margin on each sale. In the future, Mr Muramatsu suggested,
prices would have to be cut to prevent Nissan losing even more customers.
His remarks are an ironic turnabout for the company. Just half a year ago,
Mr Yutaka Kume, then president and now chairman, said Nissan would stop
placing so much emphasis on market share and would attempt to sell vehicles
by stressing high quality, not low prices.
In six months, the strategy appears to have run its course. With unit sales
plummeting 12.5 per cent at home and its domestic market share falling by
1.2 points to 22.2 per cent, Nissan is in no position to dictate prices to
its customers.
The fact remains that Nissan manages a capital-intensive, volume-driven
business, in which the economies of scale, and therefore profits, collapse
rapidly when sales decline.
While Nissan's short-term difficulties are no doubt caused by the collapse
in consumer spending in Japan, the sales volume versus profit margin choice
reflects a deeper difficulty facing the company: how to position itself
between Toyota, with a commanding 40 per cent share of the market, and
company's such as Honda, Mazda and Mitsubishi Motors, which are smaller and
more nimble.
For years Nissan tried to take on Toyota, selling a full range of
middle-of-the road vehicles designed to appeal to a mass, high-volume
market.
Nissan, however, could never match Toyota's economies of scale and never
approached Toyota's super-efficient management style. It watched its market
share erode steadily from 30 per cent to 24 per cent by the mid-1980s.
Mr Kume managed to stem the slide for several years by introducing a
proliferation of radically-styled vehicles that brightened the image of the
company among consumers. Unfortunately, however, where Nissan led, Honda,
Mitsubishi, Mazda and to some extent Toyota, followed with great success,
virtually wiping out any gains for Nissan.
Nissan now finds itself with a broad slate of models on the market, about
the same number as Toyota, but with only half of Toyota's volumes. And its
consolidated debt has risen dangerously, to a net Y3,568bn, or 147 per cent
of equity, at the end of March.
More fundamentally, Nissan's strategic dilemma is unsolved: should it be the
general motor manufacturer offering a full range of models to serve all
needs, or should it be more like its smaller rivals, which have very
successfully targeted individual models to well-defined customer groups?
For the time being, Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, appointed Nissan president in June,
appears content to straddle the line between these two choices while
focusing his attention on reducing costs.
Mr Tsuji, who came out of the engineering side of the business, believes
Nissan's cars are too complicated to build, and he has set a goal of raising
labour productivity by 10 per cent a year for three years.
Nissan is adopting other measures to cut costs, such as banning overtime,
reducing new hiring, and shrinking the size of the workforce by 4,000, or 6
per cent, in three years.
The question, however, is whether Nissan's competitors and its customers
will give it this much time to adjust. Nissan says it should be able to
break even in the second half of the year, but this appears optimistic given
the steep plunge in its sales in recent months. While vehicles sales in
Japan fell by 14 per cent in October, Nissan sales plummeted by 23 per cent.
At the same time, Toyota has shown no sign of wanting to lift its margins by
raising prices. Rather, its value-for-money approach to serving customers is
riding through the recession unscathed and this directly increases the
pressure on Nissan.
The fact is that with Toyota, Nissan and Mazda recently building new
factories, Japan has far too much manufacturing capacity. Most analysts
reckon the market is unlikely to regain its 1990 peak in sales volume until
after 1995, and is unlikely, for demographic reasons, ever again to show
sustained, rapid growth, following the surge of the late 1980s.
Thus manufacturing capacity will have to be severely pruned and given
Nissan's weak balance sheet and poor profitability, it could easily be
forced to make unpalatable choices in the months ahead.

ST Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, suffered
losses in the third quarter and first nine months because of the recession,
writes Robert Gibbens.
The company, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, does not see much
hope of recovery until the second half of 1993, and is retrenching further.
St Lawrence Cement recorded a loss of CDollars 2m (USDollars 1.7m), or 5
cents a share, in the third quarter, against net profit of CDollars 6.2m, or
15 cents a share, last time. Sales slipped to CDollars 151m, compared with
CDollars 168m.
The nine-month net loss was CDollars 21.7m, or 51 cents a share, on sales of
CDollars 33lm, against a loss of CDollars 4.8m, or 12 cents a share, on
sales of CDollars 367m a year earlier.

<TEXT>
AIR CANADA, which has dropped its merger plan with rival Canadian Airlines
International, reported a CDollars 14m (USDollars 11.6m) loss for the third
quarter, its busiest period.
The latest loss, equivalent to 19 cents a share, compares with a profit of
CDollars 4m, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating revenues were up
4.6 per cent to just over CDollars 1bn.
Revenue passenger miles flown totalled 4.6bn, up from 4.2bn and with three
new Boeing 747s brought out of storage last spring, capacity was up 14 per
cent.
Mr Hollis Harris, president and chief executive, said that 'during the third
quarter, strict cost control measures have helped us achieve a 14 per cent
increase in available seat miles with only a 6 per cent increase in
operating expense.
'However, the worldwide softness in passenger yields, particularly on
transatlantic routes, has eroded much of the benefits produced by the
aggressive management of costs.'
Operating profit before financial charges for the latest quarter was
CDollars 39m, against CDollars 47m, while asset sales increased cash by
CDollars 407m to CDollars 511m. The main disposal was the En Route credit
card operation.
The nine-month loss came out at CDollars 307m, or CDollars 4.14 a share,
against a deficit of CDollars 126m, or CDollars 1.70 a share, a year
earlier, on revenues virtually static at CDollars 2.7bn. The period included
a loss of CDollars 97m on operations, interest charges of CDollars 166m and
severance costs of CDollars 52m.
Air Canada announced this week it had failed to reach a merger deal with
Canadian because it maintained the pre-merger terms would not have created a
viable airline and was not in its shareholders' best interests.
Industry sources say Air Canada may attempt a new merger deal or try to
acquire some assets from Canadian. Canadian has begun new talks with
American Airlines which are aimed at reviving American's offer to buy a 25
per cent equity stake in Canadian's parent company, PWA, for CDollars 250m.
Canadian's employees would make pay concessions and find further equity - a
package worth Dollars 300m.
Air Canada is now one of three remaining bidders for Continental Airlines of
the US. Lufthansa dropped out on Monday. Air Canada and a Texas group have
offered USDollars 425m for a restructured Continental, and the winner is
expected to be announced early next week.

REYNOLDS Metals, third-largest of the world's aluminium groups, is to spend
Dollars 26m on a plant at Auburn, Indiana, to produce aluminium extruded

Technology for the components - such as bumper systems, door intrusion beams
and sunroof tracks - was developed at a Reynolds' plant in the Netherlands.

Mr Richard Holder, chairman, said recently the most conservative forecasts
predicted the aluminium content of the average US car would more than double
in the next five years from 170lbs in 1991 to 350lbs.
He said Reynolds would make a much better return on its aluminium in this
kind of fabricated form.
The Indiana plant will be highly automated, employ about 120 people, and
have the capacity to use 14m lb of aluminium a year. Reynolds is following
in the wake of its main rival, the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa),
which is setting up its own aluminium car component plant in Germany and has
joint ventures in Japan and the US with Kobe Steel and Aluminium.
Hydro Aluminium of Norway is also expected shortly to announce an aluminium
car components plant at a facility in Michigan.

Nabisco's former cereal line in the UK has already been acquired by Cereal

that 'preoccupation with a prolonged review process would not be in the best
interest of either company.'

BULGARIA fears instability in the Balkans could be deepened by the Yugoslav
conflict spilling over into neighbouring countries, President Zhelyu Zhelev
said yesterday.
'There is a strong possibility that the conflict could spill over into
Kosovo and Macedonia and from there into other parts of the volatile Balkan
region. The tensions in Kosovo are such that one spark could set that area
on fire,' he said.
Mr Zhelev called on the west to intervene militarily to stop the fighting
and warned that if the conflict spread to Macedonia it would be difficult to
prevent the involvement of Bulgaria, which has been without a government
since Prime Minister Philip Dimitrov lost a confidence vote last week.
'We could not possibly stop the influx of refugees and this would provoke
Bulgarians living on the border, most of whom have relatives in Macedonia,
to take arms and go to the rescue,' he said.
A Bulgarian team left for Frankfurt last night to continue talks over
repayment of the country's Dollars 10bn debt to 300 commercial banks led by
Deutsche Bank. The resumption of partial interest payments in September
opened the way for these negotiations which had been thrown into doubt by
the government's resignation.

DOMINION Textile, North America's international integrated textile group,
has returned to profitability after two years of losses and heavy
rationalisation.
It will keep its big yarn division and is investing CDollars 30m (USDollars
24.1m) to expand non-woven products capacity in the US and in France.
No further asset sales are planned, according to Mr Charles Hantho,
president. The company operates manufacturing and import-export businesses
in Canada, the US, Europe, North Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia.
It is North America's leading denim cloth producer.
Domtex earned CDollars 3.6m or 7 cents a share in the first quarter to
end-September, against a loss of CDollars 12.5m, or 40 cents a share a year
earlier. Sales gained 8 per cent to almost CDollars 300m.
The board will consider restoring common share dividends later in fiscal
1993, and profit is expected to improve in each successive quarter. Domtex
last paid a dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 1991.
The yarn group represents 25 per cent of Domtex's North American business,
employing 2,000 in Canada and the US.
Mr Hantho said Domtex's overall business had turned round and it was no
longer necessary to sell the yarn business. It is profitable and faces
expanding markets particularly for knitted garments.
The company is negotiating payment schedules on CDollars 400m of debt due in
1994-1995.

FT  05 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Securicor rises amid BT talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GAINS in the two classes of Securicor stock as well as associate
Security Services shares led to a revival of suspicions in the market that
BT could be considering buying out the minority in Cellnet held by
Securicor/Security Services. The Securicor companies hold a 40 per cent
stake in Cellnet, one of the two UK cellular phone networks, with BT holding
the remainder.
There were hints in the market of determined buying interest in Securicor
shares from top quality brokers. The buying was accompanied by stories,
confirmed last night, that BT may be considering selling its stake in McCaw
Cellular Communications, the largest of the US cellular phone companies, to
telecoms group AT&amp;T.
Last night, the three companies confirmed that AT&amp;T was negotiating to take
a 33 per cent stake in McCaw for Dollars 3.8bn as party of a broad alliance
between the two businesses in wireless communications. If the deal goes
through, BT, which bought its 35.8m class 'A' and 'B' stock for Dollars
41.50 a share in 1989, would sell out at Dollars 49.
In spite of considerable scepticism in the market about the stories,
Securicor ordinary shares raced up 18 to 868p, the 'A' shares 19 to 562p and
Security Services 18 to 463p. But they pointed out that turnover of 1m was
well in excess of normal levels of activity in Securicor 'A'. The latter
have risen sharply from around 480p in mid-September. BT 'old' were 3 1/2
off at 376 1/2 p on low turnover of 2.8m.
Sainsbury setback
Solid interim results from J. Sainsbury failed to impress the stock market,
which went into hurried retreat as analysts disagreed on the immediate
outlook. Most agreed that the shares had enjoyed a good run ahead of
yesterday's announcement and that some profit-taking had followed the
results.
However, talk that one agency broker was holding 8m shares was also put
forward by some in the market as a reason for the shares tumbling 18 to
487p. Turnover was a sizeable 6.5m shares.
There was also some dissent from the mostly positive response from analysts
that sales from the British Airways promotion in Sainsbury's shops had been
disappointing. Together with the launch this week of a new price promotion
by Tesco, this has sparked fears of a price war and overhung the sector. In
addition, hectic activity in the options market last week - which saw the
equivalent of 9m Sainsbury shares bought - was also thought to have
undermined the price.
Invergordon active
Buying activity in Invergordon Distillers led to inevitable speculation that
Whyte &amp; Mackay was returning to haunt the company that it mounted an
unsuccessful Pounds 350m bid for a year ago. The deadline forbidding Whyte
to return to the fray passed at the weekend and yesterday saw the first busy
day's trading since then.
However, while acknowledging Whyte's continuing interest - the US-owned
drinks group still holds a 41.3 per cent stake in Invergordon - analysts
countered that the Scottish whisky company has underperformed in recent
months and that the stock looked good value. The shares leapt 15 to 326p in
turnover of nearly 1m.
Carlton slips
A spate of rumours conspired to prompt a fall in Carlton Communications.
However, one securities house argued that the talk was spurious and
yesterday's slide of 16 to 700p presented a buying opportunity.
Initially there was talk that the new US president's threat to increase
taxes on overseas companies would hit Carlton, which has a big US exposure.
There were also rumbles of critical articles in the specialist press. Then,
Lehman Brothers told clients that even if a tax charge was levied it would
have a minimal effect on Carlton's profits. No one discovered any foundation
to the talk of bearish press stories.
Wellcome recovered 25 to 1018p following recent gains by the two other big
UK pharmaceutical companies with substantial US exposure, Glaxo and
SmithKline Beecham.
The shares responded to a short squeeze and were helped by talk that the
company's anti-epilepsy drug was about to be discussed by the US Food and
Drug Administration. However, analysts said that an FDA meeting had been
anticipated for some time and the shares were really just catching up.
SmithKline held steady at 540p in the 'A's but Glaxo slipped 13 to 822p.
Reuters Holdings was a strong performer as Lehman handled sizeable buying
orders in the US and the UK. The shares were squeezed up 41 before settling
with the market to close 31 up at 1221p. In its latest media review Hoare
Govett said the stock had 10 per cent underperformed over the past three
weeks and looked attractive.
BAT Industries rose 8 to 914p on improved third quarter profits.
Some persistent selling pressure from one of the integrated securities
houses was behind the steep decline in Lloyds Abbey Life which retreated 16
to 367p, although dealers pointed out that turnover remained below 1m
shares.
The Clinton victory was given a distinct thumbs down by the oil sector. The
majors fell heavily, with BP down 3.9 per cent and Shell down 2.4 per cent,
and many of the second line issues down over 3 per cent.
Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker, said Clinton's win:
'will not be celebrated in oil industry boardrooms; there appears to be a
strong antipathy between the industry and the new president.' The analyst
said there were concerns in the US of a possible increase in federal taxes
on gasoline and the possible imposition of an import tariff on crude oil.
Strauss said sentiment amongst US investors could become negative and
described BP as 'massively overvalued with downside to around 170p.' BP
stock closed 9 off at 223p on 6.1m traded after the group confirmed
long-running market stories by announcing the sale of its 49 per cent stake
in the Olympic Dam copper/uranium/gold/silver project in south Australia for
Dollars 456m. Shell, a weak hold according to Strauss and still weighed down
by the negative stance adopted recently by County NatWest, lost 13 to 527p
on 5.3m traded.
The Lasmo presentation to analysts failed to sustain the share price which
dipped 7 to 176p on heavy turnover of 4.2m.
The profits warning from Burnfield stunned the market which reacted by
chopping the share price from an overnight 165p to 85p before a close of
87p, a net decline of 78.
Shares in Inchcape fell 16 to 491p, with sentiment hit by reports of profit
downgradings, after a series of analysts' visits to the company. English
China Clays gave up 7 to 423p after agency broker James Capel downgraded its
current year profit estimates because of continued weakness in the European
paper making industry.
Shares in Tomkins, currently locked in a bid battle with Hanson for food
manufacturer RHM, eased a penny to 225p. The company has been doing the
rounds of City institutions in an attempt to win support for the agreed
offer and there was talk in some quarters that a number of institutions were
as a result, less hostile to the bid. Shares in Hanson closed 2 3/4 ahead at
229p and RHM softened a half-penny to 262p.
Bid speculation surrounding APV gained further strength yesterday sending
the shares climbing 9 to 98p, and turnover soaring to 5.8m. The attention
once again centred on Siebe, which unsuccessfuly bid for APV in 1986, as the
likely predator. Shares in Siebe edged a penny forward to 350p.
International drinks groups were weak in the face of worries over GATT and
US taxation changes. Grand Metropolitan shed 3 to 415p and Guinness 7 to
531p. However, Allied Lyons benefited from news that it was to sell one of
its French vineyards, with a price tag in excess of Pounds 100m.

automotive to post increased sales.
Rockwell reported net income of Dollars 138.1m, or Dollars 0.62 per share
for the fourth quarter against net income of Dollars 152.4m, or Dollars 0.66
per share, after a gain in the previous-year period.
It reported a fiscal year net loss of Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 4.62 per

FT  05 NOV 92 / BR chairman warns on sell-off plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BOB REID, chairman of British Rail, warned yesterday that 'major
questions' over the proposed privatisation of the railways were in danger of
disrupting the government's plans.
The timetable for privatisation was very tight, he said, and serious
obstacles remained to be overcome. 'Until I am absolutely satisfied that we
have got a workable proposition, we don't go,' he told MPs.
The government is planning to introduce the privatisation legislation by the
end of this month. It hopes to have the framework in place by April 1994 if
Royal Assent follows next summer.
Sir Bob told the Commons transport committee that the government had yet to
publish its plans for the single most important element of privatisation -
the system of charging train operators for use of the railway tracks.
He also voiced his concern over the lack of any clear-cut plans for
investment in new rolling stock immediately after privatisation, since
private-sector operators would be unlikely to risk investing in trains until
they had built up experience. He also warned against excessive bureaucracy.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Time on ministers' side over Euro-bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government's narrow escape means the Maastricht ratification process
will continue.
As ministers breathed again, however, it was evident that urgency was the
last thing on their mind.
In his winding-up speech to the Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, made clear that the government believes there is 'a reasonable
chance' that December's Edinburgh summit will agree a package for Denmark.
At the same time, language to harden the definition of subsidiarity - the
passing down of decision-making to the lowest appropriate tier of government
 -is also expected to be hammered out.
If that goes according to plan and the Danish parliament approves a second
referendum, a new plebiscite could be held by May.
Mr Hurd implicitly made clear, however, that both issues might run into
snags. But that is a Community concern and Britain should have at least
three months to complete the committee stage and reach a third reading.
In the short term, the British government's efforts to press on with
ratification will be merely symbolic - a goodwill gesture of good faith to
offer its Community colleagues at the Edinburgh gathering.
Ministers and business managers have hinted that as little as two days of
the committee stage will probably be held before December 12.
After the summit, there might be a couple more committee days before the
Christmas recess.
But as the government plans to achieve its goal of ratification by
attrition, the real slog will not begin until the Commons returns in the new
year.
One government minister indicated yesterday that the initial plan is to
allow the normal processes to run their course.
Labour will harry the government with ambushes, intent on maximising
disruption to its legislative programme.
There is a wide belief, though, that the filibuster that it is anticipated
will be launched by the Tory Euro-sceptics will soon tire the clear majority
around the house who favour early nights and long weekends.
Furthermore, aware that the Labour leadership will eventually call for
abstention on the final vote, the opposition taste for the fight will
diminish, too.
'If people start finding that a bunch of single-issue fanatics are beginning
to interfere with their chances to take advantage of their daughter's
half-term from school, then opinion will harden against them,' the minister
said.
Nonetheless, it is plain that many of the fiercest 'oppositionists' are
planning just that.
Mr Bill Cash, one of the most prominent campaigners, will boast to anyone
ready to listen that he has 250 amendments to the bill already tabled, with
more to come.
If the process goes to March, Mr Cash can expect his personal popularity to
be wearing thin.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Major lives on to fight another day -
Philip Stephens reports that last night's vote may prove to be a turning
point for the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS as nerve-racking as it was dangerous. But Mr John Major lives to
fight another day.
Last night's vote on the Maastricht treaty was his first political success
since sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism threw his government
into crisis on September 16. It marked a step along the road to
rehabilitation.
Even so, there are plenty of obstacles still to be cleared.
The prime minister's confidence, drained by the collapse of his economic
policy on Black Wednesday and by a succession of political miscalculations
subsequently, has received a significant boost. He gambled his political
future on Europe. He won, albeit by a hair's breadth.
His performance in yesterday's debate was one of his strongest since the
general election. He nodded frequently in the direction of the soft
Euro-sceptics - offering reassurances that there would be no single
currency, no common defence policy, no cession of control over immigration.
But his strongest and most important message was the one central to the
debate: Britain has a choice whether to remain at the centre of events in
Europe or slink away to the fringes.
What Mr Major is inclined to describe as a struggle for the soul of the Tory
party has not been settled conclusively. The Euro-sceptics are a resilient
bunch.
But enough in his party realised as they trooped through the Commons
division lobbies at 10pm last night that there was nothing to be gained from
destroying the prime minister. His premiership has lost the brief magic that
accompanied his April general election victory. For the moment, though, his
party has decided it has nowhere else to go.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is a serious loser. He judged that to hold
his party together he had to lead them into the lobbies against the
government. But Labour's Europeanism has been tarnished. Attacks on the
Liberal Democrats for their support for Mr Major will not soothe the his own
party's obvious discomfort.
If Mr Major heeds the advice of elder statesmen such as Lord Whitelaw he
will now tread carefully, seeking to rebuild his authority on the Tory back
benches with calm self-confidence rather than with unnecessary
confrontations. In the metaphor of one experienced backbench Tory, his
government must stop putting padlocks on fire exits and then throwing away
the key. Flexibility is occasionally a sign of strength.
Mr Major has won the point on Europe. With Labour unlikely to oppose the
legislation in the substantive debates that will follow, the Euro-sceptics
have lost their best chance to wreck the ratification process.
So the prime minister can go to next month's Edinburgh summit with tangible
evidence that he is true to his word.
His European partners will have seen his political problems, but if they
still hold hopes for Maastricht it will be in their interest to help rather
than hinder him.
His priority now must be the economy. The disgruntlement on his back benches
reflects more than anything else the government's failure to deliver
economic recovery. The reality rather than the empty promise of an end to
the recession could transform the political landscape.
The prime minister must convince his own supporters - and the country at
large - that he can construct an economic policy which will deliver that
recovery.
It will not be easy. The cabinet bargaining on the share-out of the Pounds
244.5bn public-spending cake for next year has been less than edifying.
The limited resources in the Treasury's contingency reserve have been more
than absorbed by higher spending on unemployment-related benefits, on EC
farm spending, on the expansion of tertiary education and on a sharp
increase in legal aid.
Everyone else is facing a sharp reduction in previously agreed budgets. They
are warning of dire consequences inside and outside Westminster.
The council tax bills that will land on doormats in the south of England
next spring threaten a political explosion comparable to that over the
government's ill-fated coal closures plan. In spite of the promise of some
creative accounting, the final decisions across all Whitehall programmes
will be harsher than expected.
It will take considerable sleight of hand to dress up a freeze or sharp
restriction on public-sector pay, large job losses in defence-related
industries, and a squeeze on state benefits as an Autumn Statement for
recovery.
So the accompanying package of measures will have to be convincing.
An interest rate cut is regarded on the Conservative backbenches as a sine
qua non. But there will have to be other measures of substance - to boost
the construction industry, to steady consumer confidence - if the
government's supporters are to be convinced the spending cuts are a price
worth paying.
Last night Mr Major could raise his head and smile for the first time in
nearly two months. It might prove a turning point for a government that has
looked hell-bent on self-destruction. But the House of Commons did not write
the prime minister a blank cheque. For now, all he can claim is a line of
credit.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Appeals to support government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPEALS TO wavering rebels to support the government came from senior Tory
backbenchers on both sides of the argument, though the moves to rally
backbenchers also contained warnings for ministers about their conduct of
the UK presidency of the Community, Alison Smith writes.
The message from the few hardline Tory Euro-sceptics who spoke in the debate
was defiant, however. Mr Michael Carttiss, the Tory MP for Great Yarmouth,
said he was going to vote both against the Labour amendment and the
government motion.
He said unless the prime minister established a coherent economic programme,
he risked going 'the same way as George Bush, only quicker. This Maastricht
Bill is a monstrous irrelevance to the real issues that face this government
and the country.'
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister who took the UK into the EC,
urged potential rebels to recognise that, in previous cases where the Tory
party had been divided, such as Suez, dissidents had held back from
endangering the government.
Mr Paul Channon, a former cabinet minister, professed himself sceptical on
the Maastricht treaty but argued that Tories should support the government
to strengthen its hand in negotiating to achieve a decentralised EC. 'It
would have saved us all a great deal of trouble if the French had voted
against it,' he said.

FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Ashdown berated for relief of besieged
PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders accused Mr Paddy Ashdown and his Liberal Democrat followers
of providing a lifeboat for Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the
Commons last night, when the government survived two crucial votes on the
Maastricht treaty by majorities of three and six.
In tumultuous scenes in the crowded chamber, Mr John Smith and his
colleagues on the Labour front bench knew they were on the wrong end of a
see-sawing debate seconds before the result was officially announced.
Mr Ashdown took the brunt of the verbal assaults unleashed by Labour MPs as
soon as the emergence of Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, from
behind the speaker's chair signalled that the government had successfully
survived the first vote with a majority of six.
The insults directed at the Liberal Democrats who voted with Mr Major and
his supporters in both divisions became even more abusive when it was
announced that the main government motion had been carried by a majority of
only three.
In a bitter comment after the hubbub subsided, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's
shadow environment secretary, charged Mr Ashdown and his party with
betraying the millions of people who voted for them in April's general
election. 'The only thing the Liberals have been true to is their colours -
yellow,' he said.
An unrepentant Mr Ashdown renewed his charge that it was Mr John Smith who
had abandoned his principles by refusing to support the government and
sullying his record as a consistent supporter of Britain's membership of the
European Community.
Earlier the Labour leader had insisted that the ambiguous and anodyne
government motion had more to do with the internal crisis in the
Conservative party than with the EC and the Maastricht treaty.
In a vigorous defence of Mr Smith at the close of the debate Mr John
Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the prime objective of the main
motion was to re-establish the authority 'of an increasingly accident-prone
and embattled prime minister trying to establish his authority over his
increasingly querulous party'.
Labour would not assist in that objective, he said, and in a pointed thrust
at the Liberals warned 'those who do will be required to account for their
actions to an angry and incredulous British public'.
Mr Smith highlighted the sharply contrasting indications from government
quarters in recent weeks about the importance that ministers attached to the
debate.
He emphasised that a briefing by Downing Street officials had led to
newspaper reports that a government defeat would result in Mr Major calling
a general election.
Scoffing at the navety of Liberal Democrat MPs, he said they had been
'conned by the Conservatives'.
Mr Smith said that for Labour MPs to adopt the same course would amount to
an endorsement of the government's decision to opt out from the social
chapter - 'that might suit the Liberal Democrats but it would be a betrayal
for us'.
Mr Smith argued that further proceedings on the bill should be delayed until
after the Edinburgh summit in December, when the terms secured by the Danish
government for staging a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty would be
clarified.
He contended that a statement made by the the prime minister in September
amounted to an acceptance that the 'framework' for the second Danish
referendum would have to be agreed at the Edinburgh summit before MPs were
asked to deal with the next stage of the bill.

MANY business organisations last night welcomed the government's narrow
victory.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said:
'We welcome the outcome of the vote, which is what the business community
wanted.
'We now look to the Edinburgh summit for further clarification of the
important principle of subsidiarity.
'We hope that formal ratification by the House of Commons can proceed as
soon as possible to resolve uncertainty about our position in Europe.'
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the British Chambers of Commerce,
said: 'Business will be breathing a huge sigh of relief tonight.
'The past two months have been very unsettled for the business community and
this should put us back on a stable course for Europe and the single
market.'
But Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, sounded
a note of caution: 'As it stands, the treaty is an imperfect document of
many contradictions. There is an urgent need for more information about the
practical effects of the treaty on UK business.'

defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE narrowness of the government victory last night is highlighted by a
breakdown of the results.
If an extra two Tories had switched sides and voted against the government
on its motion, or a handful more had abstained, Mr Major would be
contemplating defeat this morning.
Both the Labour and Conservative parties achieved a full turnout of members
 -267 and 332 MPs respectively. In the first vote - on Labour's amendment to
the government motion - there were 10 abstentions by Tory MPs and 23 who
voted against the government.
But in the second vote, on the government's motion, three more Conservative
MPs - Mr David Porter (Waveney), Mr Michael Lord (Suffolk Central) and Mr
John Carlisle (Luton North) - joined the Conservative rebellion.
In addition there were seven abstentions, cutting the government majority to
just three.
Four speakers and deputy speakers, plus the two tellers for each side, do
not count in the final voting figures. A total of 319 members voted for the
government motion to proceed with ratification. They included 299
Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats and one Ulster Populist Unionist MP. A
total of 316 members voted against the government motion, consisting of 267
Labour, 26 Conservatives, one Liberal Democrat, four SDLP, three Scottish
Nationalists, four Welsh Nationalists, eight Ulster Unionists and three
Democratic Unionists. The 26 Tories who voted against the government motion
were Mr John Biffen (Shropshire N), Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston),
Mr Nicholas Budgen (Woverhampton SW), Mr John Butcher (Coventry SW), Mr John
Carlisle (Luton N), Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Dr Michael Clark (Rochford), Mr
James Cran (Beverley), Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford), Mr Christopher Gill
(Ludlow), Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham), Mr
Roger Knapman (Stroud), Mr Barry Legg (Milton Keynes SW), Mr Michael Lord
(Suffolk C), Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton N), Mr David Porter (Waveney), Mr
Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Sir Trevor Skeet (Bedfordshire N),
Mr Michael Spicer (Worcestershire S), Sir Peter Tapsell (Lindsey E), Sir
Teddy Taylor (Southend E), Mr Bill Walker (Tayside N), Mr John Wilkinson
(Ruislip Northwood), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton), Mr Nicholas Winterton
(Macclesfield).

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Paramount names heads of film
and TV activities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Pictures moved quickly to name a new studio head to replace Mr
Brandon Tartikoff, who resigned last week citing family obligations.
Ms Sherry Lansing, the best known woman in Hollywood film making, was
appointed to the newly created position of chairman of the Paramount's
motion picture group.
The 48-year-old Ms Lansing first made her name in the early 1980s when she
served for three years as president of production at 20th Century Fox.
Before that she had been a senior vice-president at Columbia Pictures.
Paramount said the appointment of Ms Lansing reflected a structural change
in the Paramount Pictures organisation.
Mr Tartikoff had previously headed both film and television activities. But
the company yesterday named Mr Kerry McCluggage as head of the television
division. Both he and Ms Lansing will report to Mr Stanley Jaffe, who is
president and chief operating officer of Paramount Communications, the

Meanwhile, Mr Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings, the investment and

FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: US insurer tumbles into red and
cuts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Corporation, the large US property-casualty insurer whose shares
plunged in late-September because of the adverse impact of recent
catastrophe losses, yesterday reported a Dollars 142.1m deficit after tax in
the third quarter, to end-September. In the same period of 1991, Continental
made a net profit of Dollars 20.5m.
In September, Continental warned the market it would take a Dollars 120m
pre-tax charge to cover the cost of leaving both the reinsurance business
and the writing of insurance for small foreign companies. A further Dollars
200m pre-tax outlay was expected to cover losses from Hurricanes Andrew and
Iniki, plus the cost of reinstating catastrophe reinsurance.
Continental also slashed its dividend, and said it would lock in more than
Dollars 100m of realised capital gains, to help protect its capital base. On
the day of these announcements, Continental's chief operating officer, Mr
William Thiele, left the company to pursue other interests.
Yesterday's results generally reflected these moves. Continental said its
'discontinued operations' produced a loss of Dollars 156.5m, after the
Dollars 120m charge. The ongoing operations made a pre-tax profit of Dollars
20.9m, down from Dollars 42.8m a year earlier. The decrease resulted from
the hurricane-related losses and costs, with higher realised capital gains
offsetting much of the damage. The insurer's total realised capital gains in
the third quarter were Dollars 166.4m, against Dollars 32.1m in the third
quarter of 1992.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications will sell its 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular
Communications of the US if moves by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to buy a
33 per cent stake in McCaw are successful. AT&amp;T is negotiating a Dollars
3.8bn deal as part of a broad alliance.
If the alliance goes ahead it will represent a dramatic plunge by AT&amp;T, the
largest long-distance telecommunications company in the US, into the rapidly
growing wireless communications market, which is dominated, apart from the
independent McCaw, by large local telephone companies.
It will also take AT&amp;T back into the local telecommunications market which
it left in 1984 under a court-ordered break-up, which spun off from it seven
local 'Baby Bell' telephone companies.
For McCaw - an entrepreneurial company which has grown extremely fast from
modest origins to become the biggest company in the US cellular telephone
market - the alliance opens up great opportunities to tap the brand name and
technological resources of AT&amp;T. It will also get a Dollars 2bn cash
infusion which will allow it to pay the Dollars 5.3bn of debt on its balance
sheet.
The two companies yesterday claimed that the pact would speed up the
development in the US of the first seamless wireless communications network
 -allowing cellular subscribers to communicate easily with other parties
anywhere else in the nation.
Mr Barry Romeril, finance director of British Telecom, which bought its
stake in McCaw in 1989, said McCaw and AT&amp;T were complimentary and AT&amp;T
would not be affected, as BT had been, by US regulatory restraints on
foreign ownership.
'This is an excellent opportunity for BT to realise shareholder value from
its investment,' he added. BT, which bought its 35.8m class A and B stock
for Dollars 41.50 a share, would sell at Dollars 49.
AT&amp;T would pay McCaw Dollars 42 a share for a further 47m newly issued
shares and would have the right to later acquire control of the group from
Mr Craig McCaw, its chairman. The two sides hope to complete the deal in the
first or second quarters of next year.
Before news of the deal McCaw shares were suspended yesterday at Dollars 26
 3/4 , up Dollars 2  1/8 . AT&amp;T shares closed down Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 42
3/4 .

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government is expected to fall today after the Progressive
Democrats, until now junior partners in the coalition, resigned their
ministerial posts and made clear they would support a 'no confidence' motion
proposed by the opposition Labour party.
Ms Mary Harney, a Progressive Democrat (PD) deputy who quit as junior
minister for the environment, said yesterday: 'The country needs an
election. The government has broken down.' She said there was no question
that the six PD deputies would vote with the opposition.
The two senior PD ministers in the cabinet - Mr Des O'Malley, industry
minister and PD leader, and Mr Bobby Molloy, energy minister - informed Mr
Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of their resignation from the
government last night after a PD parliamentary group meeting which had been
convened to discuss the coalition crisis.
Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner with 77 seats, will not be able to
muster an overall majority in the 166-seat Dail (parliament) and will
therefore fall. Mr Reynolds is expected to ask President Mary Robinson to
dissolve the Dail this evening.
A general election must then be held within 30 days. Two dates are being
considered - November 26 or December 3. The elections and a controversial
abortion referendum are likely to be held on the same day.
The crisis began last week when Mr Reynolds accused Mr O'Malley of being
dishonest in the evidence Mr O'Malley had given to a parliamentary inquiry
into the country's beef industry earlier this year.
Mr O'Malley had criticised Mr Reynolds' actions as industry minister in 1987
and 1988 in supporting beef sales to Iraq which he claimed had exposed the
Irish taxpayer to unnecessary risks. The PDs called on Mr Reynolds to
withdraw the accusation. He refused, precipitating the split.
Mr Reynolds told his party yesterday that, after 15 years of Fianna Fail
leading minority governments, he intended to lead it to victory with an
overall majority. Most opinion polls indicate that an absolute majority will
continue to elude the party.
Mr Reynolds' future in the party is likely to be called into question. Some
backbenchers warned this week that they felt an election had been
precipitated unnecessarily and that a search for a new leader might begin if
the party lost seats.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: At last, a small victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The narrow but sufficient majority of three, the prime minister won the vote
on Europe in the House of Commons last night. The house can now proceed with
the committee stage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The government's victory could not have been achieved without the support of
the Liberal Democrats and a number of abstentions by opponents of the bill.
It does, however, give Mr John Major a chance to make a fresh start. It is
the first success he has chalked up since Black Wednesday, September 16,
when the ejection of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism knocked the
stuffing out of his European and economic policies. It is a welcome change
from the series of disasters that has struck the Conservatives since then.
The prime minister did the right thing and won. He can now reasonably hope
to work on the immensely difficult task of restoring both his personal
authority and that of the government.
It will be a long and painful slog, with no guarantee of success. The next
important stage will come with the statement on public spending plans, due a
week from today. The prime minister has, characteristically, tied his
reputation to a single figure, Pounds 244.5bn. He will try to meet it, but
he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If spending for 1993-94
cannot be held to Pounds 244.5bn he will be condemned for another U-turn; if
it is met, it will entail a severe squeeze on public services.
Mr Major and his colleagues will have to show greater skill in apportioning
this pain than they did in the case of the pit closures. Following the
autumn statement, which needs to be accompanied by a fleshing out of the
government's still uncertain economic strategy, a reshuffle of ministers
would demonstrate to the public that the prime minister means business.
The reintroduction of the Maastricht bill may be less difficult to push
through the house now that last night's vote is safely over, but the
Conservative rebels are not going to retire.
The ratification bill promises to gum up the parliamentary works for months,
keeping at simmering point the party's recriminations and distracting the
government's attention from the management of the economy. There will be
many occasions for slip-ups, not least as the EC wrestles, initially under
Britain's presidency, with the Danish demand for legally-binding changes to
a treaty that eleven member states have sworn not to renegotiate.
In short, there is no quick route back to the victorious atmosphere which
followed last April's general election. The irreconcilable Thatcherites and
diehard nationalists within the Conservative party will continue to obstruct
the government. They have tasted power in a house where the government's
supposed majority is a mere 21. Their continuous rebellion is sustained by
the continuing recession. Mr Major must live from crisis to crisis, if he
can, until the economic upturn comes.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Government will proceed with bill to curb unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT, in an unexpected move, will today publish and give first
reading to a bill imposing further curbs on trade unions. It will include
the right of citizens to take out injunctions against unlawful strikes.
The bill is also expected to pave the way for the abolition of wages
councils, the statutory bodies that set pay rates for more than 2.5m workers
in low-paid jobs. Mr Michael Forsythe, the employment minister, said in the
Commons this week that the government saw no permanent place for wages
councils.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said last week that the
bill, expected to be brought forward this autumn, was being postponed on
technical grounds until later in the year.
The bill lost its parliamentary slot but Conservative party business
managers have now squeezed it into the timetable.
The legislation, on which Tory MPs are united, could be a morale booster to
a party divided on other issues.
In addition, the government may feel it wants to be sure of the new powers
relating to strikes and public services before the full impact is felt of
any pay squeeze in the public sector.
The bill, whose architect was Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary
and former employment secretary, is expected to conform broadly to its
original form.
It will include the right of employers to regularly seek employees' consent
for union dues to be deducted from pay on automatic 'check-off'. That is
expected to adversely affect union funds, which are already under pressure.
Unions will also have to give seven days' notice of strikes and individuals
will have the right to join the trade union of their choice regardless of
the Trades Union Congress arrangement for regulating inter-union disputes.
The green paper received a lukewarm reception from employers' organisations,
including the Confederation of British Industry.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Crack of the whips tames rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE end their discipline just failed them.
Last night's nail-biting government victory confirmed that a hard core of
Tory rebels had just fallen short in their attempts to derail the Maastricht
ratification process - in spite of an impressively well-drilled campaign
waged in the corridors and committee rooms of Westminster.
A no-holds-barred lobbying effort mounted by a desperate government machine
succeeded in deterring just enough prospective rebels to head off a
disastrous defeat.
The reverse will come as a bitter blow to rebel leaders like Mr James Cran,
the MP for Beverley, who had repeatedly expressed confidence in his side's
ability to win through.
They know that they may not get another chance to inflict serious damage on
the document, referred to by Mr Michael Spicer, another rebel leader, as a
treaty too far.
Opportunity would knock again only if Labour could be coaxed once more into
opposing a Maastricht-related motion.
The comments of two rebels who wavered illustrate the extraordinary lengths
to which the government was obliged to resort in order to win the day.
Mr Walter Sweeney, the newly-elected MP for Vale of Glamorgan, cited two
factors which coaxed him out of the hard-line rebel camp and persuaded him
to abstain on both divisions.
The first was a faxed message he received yesterday from his constituency
executive saying that they were 'deeply concerned' about his reported views
and urging him to review his decision.
This was sent following a visit to the executive on Tuesday night by a Tory
central office official. At this meeting, 'the executive voted by 15 votes
to 6 with 4 abstentions to send me the message', Mr Sweeney said.
The other factor influencing him was his perception that the division was
being interpreted 'quite wrongly' as a vote on Mr Major's future. 'In a way
I wanted the motion to be defeated but I did not want the prime minister to
be defeated,' he said. 'Now that the government has won by three votes . . .
I am very torn.'
He said he had spoken to a number of whips during the day, including Mr
Richard Ryder, the chief whip. Their message was that the future of the
prime minister was at stake and that his vote might prove decisive.
Mr Michael Carttiss, MP for Great Yarmouth and another Tory expected to
rebel, said he had decided to support the government motion and oppose the
Labour amendment after last-minute meetings with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Major.
Although he disagreed with the government's policies on Europe, he could not
bring himself to bring down the government, he said.
Mr Vivian Bendall, MP for Ilford North who had intended to abstain in both
divisions, decided to support the government motion when he saw that the
Labour amendment had fallen by just six votes.
'I thought the second vote would be closer and that the prime minister might
resign if (it) was lost,' he said. He had pressed two colleagues to abstain
on the second division instead of voting against.
Mr Heseltine had given him an assurance in the chamber that the third
reading of the Maastricht bill would not take place until after a second
Danish referendum, he added.

FT  05 NOV 92 / Major fights to restore authority: PM warns Tory rebels
economic recovery is closely bound with UK's place in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR fought to restore his authority yesterday with a stark warning
to Tory rebels that Britain's economic recovery and its place at the heart
of Europe were inextricably linked.
In a tense and frequently angry House of Commons debate which turned into a
crucial test of the prime minister's standing, he warned that failure to
proceed with the ratification of the Maastricht treaty could leave Britain
'scowling' in frustration on the fringes of Europe.
Mr Major's rallying call came in a last-ditch plea for House of Commons
backing for his European strategy from Tory Euro-sceptics pledged to wreck
British ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But as MPs prepared for last
night's vital vote on whether to press ahead with the ratification process,
the outcome still looked dangerously uncertain.
Senior ministers privately predicted a narrow victory for Mr Major with 19
of the 20 Liberal Democrats MPs pledging to vote alongside the
Conservatives. But a hard-core of more than 30 Tory Euro-sceptics insisted
that when their votes were added to those of Labour and other opposition
parties, the government's majority of 21 would be overturned.
Mr Major, who called yesterday's vote in an attempt to restore his authority
at home and strengthen his negotiating hand in the European Community,
sought to turn the debate into a fundamental choice about Britain's place in
Europe.
In a powerful speech which brought noisy applause from most Conservatives
but left many of the hard-line Euro-sceptics unmoved, Mr Major said: 'The
essential question is simply: are we or are we not in this country to play a
central role in Europe's development?'
Warning that an attempt to renege now on the Maastricht treaty would
severely damage Britain's economic prospects, he said the 'centralist'
Europe feared by the Euro-sceptics was most likely 'if we do stand aside and
let others run Europe, while Britain scowls in frustration on the fringes'.
Clashing repeatedly with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, over an
opposition amendment which would delay resumption of the ratification
process at least until after next month's Edinburgh summit, Mr Major added:
'I have to tell the House, and I have to tell the country, that we cannot
continue to make a success of our membership of the Community unless we
ratify the Treaty that we have agreed to.'
But conscious that Tory party managers were still scurrying around the
lobbies of Westminster seeking to win back waverers from the rebel camp, he
sought also to assuage their fears that Maastricht was a step towards a
federal Europe.
He insisted that Britain would retain freedom over when to rejoin the
Exchange Rate Mechanism and whether to move to a single currency, that it
retained a veto over European-wide immigration policies, and that the powers
of the Brussels Commission would be curbed.
As Mr Smith swapped insults with Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader, over the latter's support for the government, Mr Major bitterly
attacked Labour for its about-turn on the treaty.
But in a less than confident speech which exposed many of the tensions in
his own party over Europe, Mr Smith insisted that the debate was not about
Maastricht but about a desperate attempt by the government to shore up its
authority.
Insisting it had 'more to do with the internal problems of the Conservative
Party, than it has to do with the European Community', Mr Smith added: 'The
truth of the present situation, the background to the debate, is that an
increasingly angry and bewildered nation is watching with astonishment and
dismay as this Government stumbles from one disaster to another.'
Mr Ashdown, however, also accused Mr Smith of 'discreditable opportunism',
dismissing Labour claims that the vote was one of confidence in the
government or the prime minister.

FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar embarks on cost reduction plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics company, is closing its
UK non-wovens business and implementing a cost cutting programme at its
Canadian operations.
The company, which has annual sales of about Pounds 300m, is to close Bonar
Carelle, which employs 32 people, by the end of the year.
The closure will involve an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.8m to cover the
writing off of investment, but will eliminate Pounds 700,000 of UK losses.
Low &amp; Bonar will concentrate its non-woven operations on its Bonar Fabrics
plant in South Carolina which is 'on the positive side of break-even,'
according to Mr Jim Leng, chief executive.
Both plants use the group's powder bonding process to make fabrics but
although the South Carolina plant now has a good market supplying linings
for computer diskettes, hopes that the Scottish plant would develop new
products and markets for this technology have not been fulfilled and it has
secured only a small part of the European market.
'This is the penalty for developing new products in new markets with new
technology,' said Mr Leng. The Dundee plant had incurred losses for six
years.
The decision further reduces Low &amp; Bonar's manufacturing presence in
Scotland, where only 5 per cent of the company's 4,400 employees are
engaged. It still has packaging and polypropylene operations in Dundee.
In Canada, where the bulk of the group's North American operations are
located, the workforce is to be cut by 7 per cent producing a saving of
CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.5m).
The next phase will entail rationalising manufacturing plants and making
additional manpower reductions.
Costs are expected to be substantial and will be charged as an exceptional
item this year.
Bonar Inc, the group's Canadian subsidiary, achieved net income of CDollars
3m (CDollars 4.95m) in the nine months to August 29 on sales of CDollars
146.2m (CDollars 153.9m).

<TEXT>
DAME SHIRLEY Porter, the controversial Conservative politician, and her son,
John, are riding to the rescue of LBC, the London commercial radio station.
The Porters are in advanced negotiations for the restructuring of Crown
Communications, the loss-making parent of LBC.
Under the deal now being discussed, Mr John Porter, a California-based wine
maker and venture capitalist, would take a substantial stake in LBC in a
deal that would swap debt for equity.
Lady Porter, heiress to the Tesco fortune and former Lord Mayor of
Westminster, would also be involved - possibly as an LBC director.
The Radio Authority, the regulatory body for the commercial radio industry,
has been informed about the plan is and believed to be enthusiastic.
The deal would provide much needed financial underpinning for LBC until its
franchise comes up for renewal next year.
A source close to the Porter family said that the deal was 'a hard-nosed
business venture' although Lady Porter would also be able to use her London
contacts and knowledge to help the development of LBC, London's speech-based
commercial radio station.
Under the deal being discussed, LBC, which has been described by Mr
Christopher Chataway, its chairman, as 'cash positive', would be clearly
separated from loss-making Crown.
It is not clear how much of Crown would then be left. The company has said
it intended to sell off 'non-core assets' - everything apart from LBC.
Lady Porter, who is still a Westminster City councillor, was a director of
rival Capital Radio in London from 1982-88. She recently said in an
interview that her ambition was 'to promote London'.

HENRY ANSBACHER, the UK merchant bank, yesterday confirmed that it had

Majority shareholders, accounting for 73.1 per cent of the shares, have

However, Mr Richard Fenhalls, chairman and chief executive, could not
recommend that price to minority shareholders, who are to be offered 32p a
share.
Mr Fenhalls said: 'It is the job of management to get the best possible deal
for shareholders. We dug our heels in to get a better result for the
minorities.'
The majority shareholders' price assumes that First National will set aside
money in escrow arrangements in case any outstanding claims against
Ansbacher materialise.
Shareholders representing 89.3 per cent have given irrevocable undertakings
to accept.

ALCAN ALUMINIUM'S Brazilian subsidiary said yesterday that it was
temporarily suspending production of 27,000 tonnes a year of aluminium at
its smelter in Aratu, Bahia state, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro.
The Alcan Aluminio do Brasil plant in north-eastern Brazil produces 57,000
tonnes a year of primary aluminium. With the suspension it will produce
30,000. The company on Tuesday began turning off one of its two lines of
furnaces at the smelter.
Alcan Alumino said the move was temporary and that as soon as economic
conditions permitted the furnace line would be reactivated.
In the last two years the company has accumulated losses of about Dollars
20m because of a prolonged economic recession in Brazil.
It also blamed low domestic and world aluminium prices, which it said were
about 20 per cent below its production costs, as well as high electricity
tariffs in Brazil. Alcan Alumino said that electricity costs, which
accounted for about 35 per cent of its total production costs, were about 70
per cent above what was paid by most of the world's top producers.

<TEXT>
MR LUBOMIR Soudek, the new chief executive of Skoda Pilsen, Czechoslovakia's
largest engineering group, has called for the renegotiation of its two joint
ventures with Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group.
His move follows the Czech government's decision to sell him and two leading
Czech commercial banks a 38 per cent stake in Skoda Pilsen. Mr Soudek was
appointed chief executive last Monday.
KWU, Siemens' energy unit, last December acquired 67 per cent of Skoda's
energy subsidiary. The German group is also planning a second joint venture
with Skoda's transport arm, and is close to acquiring a 51 per cent stake.
However, Mr Bernhard Weiss, head of the Siemens team which negotiated the
transport joint-venture, ruled out a renegotiation. 'We discussed 99 per
cent of the joint-venture contracts with the old management last year and
are not willing to start the whole procedure again. We will make it clear to
the Czech government that we are only willing to discuss on the basis of
what has been agreed so far,' he said. The Czech government has been
hard-pressed to find ways of privatising Skoda, which has an estimated
SKr4bn (Dollars 140.35m) of debt and recently laid off 1,200 workers.

FT  05 NOV 92 / BP to sell stake in Australian mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM, the UK oil group, yesterday said Minorco, the overseas
investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South
Africa, had conditionally agreed to pay US Dollars 456m (Pounds 294m) for
its 49 per cent holding in the Olympic Dam copper/gold/silver/uranium mine
in South Australia.
Western Mining (WMC), the Australian resources group which operates Olympic
Dam and owns the other 51 per cent, has pre-emptive rights to buy the BP
stake within 90 days of being notified of the terms.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, was not available for comment but a
company official said WMC had not been notified of the terms and had not yet
decided whether to exercise its rights. However, most analysts expect WMC to
allow the Minorco deal to go through.
The deal was announced after-hours in Australia but the WMC share price was
virtually unmoved in London yesterday. Analysts suggested the price would
have fallen if it was widely anticipated WMC would have to find funds for
the deal.
The sale is subject to approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review
Board (Firb) and the state government of South Australia. However, BP is
understood to have discussed the sale, which might have raised problems
because of Minorco's South African parentage, with Firb before announcing
the deal.
Minorco would pay USDollars 240m for equity in the Olympic Dam joint venture
company plus Dollars 216m for the project financing loans BP has advanced to
WMC. The loans have a face value of Dollars 290m so Minorco is receiving a
26 per cent discount because of the risk involved - they are non-recourse
loans serviced from WMC's share of the venture.
Minorco would inherit from BP an obligation to fund all future expansion of
Olympic Dam.
Mr Mike Gordon, Minorco vice-president, corporate finance, said WMC was
paying a commercial rate on the BP loans and was covering interest payments
and some repayment of capital from income from the mine.
WMC reported an operating profit (before tax and interest) of ADollars 19m
(Pounds 8m) on its Olympic Dam investment in the year to end 1992, on
revenue of ADollars 130m.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (10): Thessaloniki looks to 1997 -
Blocked overland routes have cut the number of foreign tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS, northern Greece seemed to lack both of the essential components
of Greek tourism: impressive archaeological remains and a range of
spectacular beaches.
The region's main attraction for foreigners was the theocratic republic of
Mount Athos, where Orthodox monks offer ascetic hospitality and keep a
strict ban on women.
Quite suddenly, both ruins and beaches were discovered. The excavation in
1977 of the tomb of King Philip of Macedon, Alexander the Great's father, at
Vergina, put northern Greece firmly on the archaeological map. The tomb's
glittering contents - from jewellery and gold-decorated armour to silver
drinking cups and ivory miniatures - can capture the attention of even the
most reluctant museum-goer.
At the same time, the Halkikidi district was opened up for mass tourism,
with a new road around the remote Sithonia peninsula, giving access to
dozens of sandy beaches. With 18,000 hotel beds and a motorway link with
Thessaloniki, Halkidiki is now the package holiday centre for the north of
the country.
However, the violent break-up of Yugoslavia, the route to Greece for
tourists driving from central Europe, has brought problems. Despite a marked
increase in charter flights to Thessaloniki, tourist arrivals dropped by 37
per cent in the first eight months of 1992.
'We used to have Germans and Austrians driving down to Halkidiki, but now
it's Hungarians and Czechs coming by bus and car through Bulgaria. They
can't afford the same standard of holiday,' says Mr Vassilios Brovas,
chairman of the Thessaloniki Hoteliers' Federation.
The flow of Yugoslav visitors from Belgrade and weekend shoppers from
Skopje, amounting to over 1.2m arrivals in 1989, has also dried up.
Smaller hotels in Thessaloniki and Halkidiki have suffered most from the
tourist slump, with average occupancy rates dropping to only 43 per cent.
The big hotels, with occupancy still above 60 per cent, can rely on the
city's commercial attractions to bring in business.
More than 1.5m visitors, both Greeks and foreigners, attend the half-dozen
big trade fairs staged every year at Thessaloniki's international exhibition
centre. Conference tourism is also on the rise, extending the season - two
months shorter than in the rest of Greece - by several weeks in spring and
autumn.
For the moment, hotels in Thessaloniki can combine their facilities to
handle conferences of up to 2,000 people. That will change after 1995, when
a new congress hall is due to open at the exhibition centre, with capacity
for 8,000 delegates.
But the year already inked in on every hotelier's calendar is 1997, when
Thessaloniki becomes the European City of Culture. The city's first major
facelift in almost a century is already under way. Its centrepiece is a
Dr65bn (Pounds 200m) project to build an underground railway through the
city centre, to reduce traffic congestion.
Although the timetable will be tight, after a long dispute over finding a
site, city officials are still confident that a new Dr17bn concert hall can
be built in time for 1997.
Meanwhile, the city's unique collection of Byzantine churches, some still
shrouded in scaffolding following an earthquake 15 years ago, is being
spruced up, so that frescoes and mosaics will be on view again. A new
Byzantine museum, displaying artefacts from all over northern Greece is due
to open next year.
In Halkidiki, hoteliers have turned to the international tour operators,
accepting low room rates in return for guaranteed arrivals this season. The
number of arrivals by charter flights to Thessaloniki rose by 50 per cent
this summer, bringing over 200,000 tourists from northern Europe.
'Increased charter flights to Thessaloniki are an encouraging sign that
Macedonia can be a place that people choose to come to, rather than just
pass through says Mr Thomas Gudantsis, National Tourist Organisation
director for Macedonia and Thrace.
The expansion of passenger shipping in the northern Aegean is also bringing
more tourists to Macedonia. Along with regular ferry connections to Piraeus
and the southern islands, a hydrofoil service now links Thessaloniki with
the Sporades islands, off central Greece.
The city can now cater for two categories of sought-after tourists:
passengers on cruise ships and on yachts, who spend much more freely than
the package holidaymakers. A new passenger terminal at Thessaloniki port has
encouraged cruise ships to make more regular calls, offering excursions
around the city and to Vergina. The city marina has at last been completed,
offering facilities for yachts in a still uncrowded part of the
Mediterranean.
Nevertheless, Macedonia's loss has been Epirus's gain in terms of tourist
arrivals, with drivers taking a ferry from Italy to north-western Greece in
order to avoid the former Yugoslavia. Epirus is still one of the
least-visited regions of Greece, though it is not short of antiquities set
in dramatic mountain scenery.
Ioannina, the provincial capital, which is set on a lake, was a favourite
stopover for 19th century tourists who liked to call on Ali Pasha, its
hospitable but unpredictable ruler. A sizeable collection of Ottoman-era
buildings survives inside the fortifications of the old castle - from which
Ali Pasha's enemies were thrown into the lake - along with his summer
retreat on a reed-fringed island.

The terms of a pre-merger agreement made by Air Canada and PWA, parent of
Canadian, on October 8 'contained conditions that cannot be met'. The deal

Under the merger plan, Air Canada and Canadian would have continued as

shareholders of each group exchanging their stock for new shares in the

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Stet suffers from crossed lines
with investors - The problems of Italy's state-run telecoms sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE an international telecoms group as a collection of separate
companies. One specialises in local calls, the others foreign traffic,
equipment manufacturing and so on. Each has its own board, and stock market
quotation.
Add a highly politicised management and the normal in-fighting of a big
corporation, and you have a fairly clear picture of how Italy's state-run
telecommunications sector works.
Enmeshed in a L40,000bn (Dollars 29.79bn) four-year investment programme,
Italy's telecoms companies have raised productivity and quality. Many
analysts praise Stet for boosting investment and services, which should
increase profits.
But lamentable co-ordination and political differences often leaves the
telecoms companies vulnerable. Last month, Stet, the holding company, was
forced on to the defensive after buying Finsiel, a computer software company
controlled by IRI, the state holding concern that also owns Stet.
For many analysts, frustrated by the group's poor transparency and steadily
falling share price, spending L700bn on Finsiel was the final straw. It was
widely suspected that the deal, sprung on a Friday evening after the markets
had closed, was merely an excuse to raise funds for cash-strapped IRI.
Stet's shares plunged 23 per cent when trading resumed, though they have
since recovered.
Analysts were unconvinced by Stet's claim that the purchase was essential to
provide badly-needed software expertise. 'I can understand there have been
criticisms, but I don't think they have been fair,' says Mr Umberto
Silvestri, one of Stet's two managing directors. 'The important thing in any
acquisition is that it should have an industrial logic, not who buys the
company from whom.'
He claims that Finsiel, which has a virtual monopoly in writing software for
Italy's public sector, will give Stet a technological leap. Mr Francesco
Silvano, Stet's other managing director, points to opportunities. Although
most of Finsiel's business has nothing to do with telecoms, the link between
communications and data processing is growing, he argues.
Both men defend the price tag for Finsiel, which they say is in line with
similar deals. Mr Michael Armitage, a Morgan Stanley analyst, also backs the
transaction, even if critical of its presentation.
But at hastily-arranged meetings in London and Milan last month, investors
voiced very different views. Many are convinced acquiring Finsiel, which
earned just L29.4bn on sales of L1,283bn last year, will depress Stet's
earnings, raise debt and have little benefit for the foreseeable future.
Such cynicism contrasts with the appeal of many international telecoms
stocks which, in spite of heavy spending on modernisation and new
value-added services, have become a favourite longer-term investment for
fund managers.
For state-owned companies, privatisation has added a speculative edge. For
Italy's Amato government, striving to cut a huge budget deficit, telecoms
could also be a rich source of privatisation revenue.
However, privatisation is still a dream for Stet. Although IRI's stake has
fallen to 53 per cent, the state is still in charge. Stet's own holdings in
its subsidiaries have also been falling, but there, too, it retains a
majority in all but Sirti, the network engineering arm where control is
guaranteed through a pact with the biggest private shareholder.
Attempts to rationalise Italy's telecoms companies have been fraught with
political difficulties. Earlier this year, the government finally approved
the long-awaited incorporation of ASST, the agency controlling inter-urban
and some international communications, into IRI.
That could have been the first step towards a single 'Telecom Italia', along
the lines of the UK, Germany or France. Instead, IRI's proposal shuffled
some ASST activities around the existing companies, while leaving the
overall number unchanged by transferring other operations to Iritel, an
embryonic successor.
Stet executives are unwilling to discuss re-organisation and privatisation,
arguing that such issues are outside their competence. But such replies are
becoming unacceptable now that the role of outside shareholders is growing.
'It's a shame Stet is so atrocious when it comes to investor relations,'
says one analyst. 'At L1,035 (the share's floor price in the immediate
aftermath of the Finsiel deal) it was an extraordinarily good buy.'
'I hope last month's events made its executives more aware of their
responsibilities to investors,' adds a banker. Like many colleagues, he
complains that many state-sector executives act as if they are in a vacuum
when it comes to the markets. 'They didn't like what they heard from big
investors. But it may have done them good,' he says.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cigna stays in the black despite
heavy storm losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the biggest composite insurers in the US, unveiled a large
drop in third-quarter earnings, but was profitable despite heavy losses from
Hurricane Andrew which ravaged southern Florida and Louisiana in August.
Cigna said that after-tax profits for the three months to end-September
totalled Dollars 55m, down from Dollars 123m a year ago, with realised
investment gains contributing Dollars 52m (Dollars 10m).
The third-quarter results reflected catastrophe losses of Dollars 139m,
before tax, of which Dollars 131m came from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, a
second storm system which hit Hawaii later in the autumn.
In the same three months of 1991, Cigna's catastrophe losses were Dollars
17m.
As a result of these losses, Cigna's property-casualty division produced a
Dollars 270m deficit for the quarter, despite after-tax investment gains of
Dollars 29m against a Dollars 5m profit, including after-tax investment
gains of Dollars 7m, in the same period in 1991.
However, the company added that its other three divisions had 'strong'
earnings in the third quarter.
Cigna is showing after-tax profits of Dollars 286m for the first nine months
of the year, including realised investment gains of Dollars 122m. At the
same stage in 1991, the figure was Dollars 341m, helped by realised
investment gains of Dollars 51m.

<TEXT>
THE New York Stock Exchange has called for an inquiry into the the
all-electronic share trading system run by Nasdaq, a rival stock market
operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities
industry watchdog, the NYSE argues that elements of Nasdaq's SelectNet
trading system circumvent the SEC's rules on information disclosure.
SelectNet allows traders to negotiate prices and execute trades over a
computer screen.
This is more advanced than normal Nasdaq market trading, where share prices
are listed on screens but most trades are initiated over the telephone.
Currently, only Nasdaq stocks can be traded on SelectNet, but Nasdaq filed
for SEC approval earlier this year to begin trading NYSE-listed stocks on
the system.
The NYSE's opposition to SelectNet is based on its claim that prices are not
disseminated widely enough on the system to ensure that the standards of
price discovery mandated by government regulations are met.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: New team for GM drive in Europe
 -A look at efforts to revive the US carmaker's bruised fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jack Smith, the new chief executive and president of General Motors, has
brought together a small and trusted team to try to resuscitate the battered
fortunes of the world's largest industrial corporation.
'The chemistry goes back a long way,' says Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM
Europe and since Monday also executive vice-president with responsibility
for international operations.
GM's New York treasury office and the group's European operations run like a
common thread through the careers of the small group of key executives
chosen on Monday by a frustrated GM board desperate to staunch the group's
massive losses in its North American automotive operations.
'The group knows itself very well,' said Mr Hughes yesterday after landing
in the UK from Monday's climactic New York board meeting.
Today the company is opening its Pounds 190m (Dollars 290.7m) V6 engine
plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, in north-west England as part of its
increase in capacity by 25 per cent in Europe from 1990 to 1995.
'Bill Hoglund (GM assistant treasurer in New York from 1972-74) hired me,
and Jack Smith was reporting to Bill at the time in the treasurer's office.
Later I hired Rick Wagoner to that office, said Mr Hughes.'
These four, together with Mr Harry Pearce the group's general counsel, now
form GM's key five-man management committee.
The appointments have radically reduced the age of the top GM team, with Mr
Smith at 54, Mr Hoglund, now a member of the board and assisting Mr Smith in
the running of the North American operations, 58, Mr Pearce at 50, Mr Hughes
at 43 and Mr Wagoner, now chief financial officer, 39.
When Mr Hughes left Adam Opel, GM's key German subsidiary and the heart of
its European operations, to become president of General Motors Europe in
April this year, he was presented with a crystal ball by the workers'
council at Opel's Russelsheim plant, near Frankfurt.
It now sits in his Zurich office. 'It does not help me tell the future,' he
said yesterday, and even his crystal ball might have been reluctant to
predict quite such a meteoric rise for himself during 1992.
In less than eight 8 months he has gone from the post of chief executive at
Opel to his positions at GM. However, despite being a member of the five-man
inner circle at GM, Mr Hughes will continue to be based in Zurich at the GM
Europe headquarters.
'It makes sense,' he said in an interview yesterday. 'We are trying to take
out layers of management. Europe is the critical mass of our international
operations. It is part of our strategy to use Opel engineering and the Opel
brand worldwide outside North America. 'And the other critical mass in
Europe is Saab. It makes no sense to sit in Detroit with all the challenges
in Europe. We will have to get better telecommunications for our management
meetings.'
Mr Hughes sees GM Europe with Opel's German engineering at its heart playing
an increasingly central role in GM's worldwide operations outside North
America.
Opel technology already supports GM's Holden operation in Australia, it has
previously supported Daewoo Motor in South Korea until last month's divorce
between GM and the Daewoo group became absolute. Opel cars will be assembled
in Taiwan from next year, and there are growing links in both products and
components with South America.
'We hope that if Brazil gets into volume production of our Opel cars, we can
ship some components, while they manufacture and export through Latin
America.
'We already design in Germany for so many countries,' said Mr Hughes, 'but
we must be cost-competitive.
'We will transform the structure of the international operations. It's time
to re-think the way we have done business. We cannot ship all the support
staffs from Detroit to Zurich, which is one of the most expensive cities in
the world to have as headquarters.
'For me it is a clean sheet of paper. I am willing to think about anything
in terms of structure. We have a new management committee and we are going
to have a new GM. That is the only we are going to win.'
He insisted yesterday that GM's financial traumas in North America had not
undermined any capital investment or product programmes in Europe, where GM
is the most profitable volume carmaker.
After dipping in the late 1980s GM Europe capital spending had begun to
climb rapidly at the beginning of the 1990s, and spending would be high for
the 'next few years', said Mr Hughes.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hurricane Andrew takes its toll
on Travelers Corp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAMAGE claims from Hurricane Andrew, the storm which devastated parts of
southern Florida in late August, helped push Travelers Corporation, the
Connecticut-based composite insurer, to a Dollars 385m after-tax loss in the
third quarter. For the 1991 period, it made Dollars 65m profit.
The group has suffered from a souring property investment portfolio and has
been attempting to boost capital through disposals and the sale of a
minority share stake to Primerica.
Travelers said the after-tax cost of the hurricane was Dollars 240m. It had
estimated the loss at Dollars 175m to Dollars 225m, and blamed the higher
figure on 'the widespread disruption and dislocation of resources necessary
to rebuild damaged homes and businesses in south Florida'.
News of the hurricane claims was combined with a larger-than-expected
restructuring charge, Dollars 202m, which further depressed results.
Travelers had said it would take a Dollars 132m charge, largely to cover
3,500 job cuts. It now says it plans to axe a further 1,500 jobs among its
corporate and administrative staff over the next two years - explaining the
additional Dollars 70m charge.
'Our core businesses are sensitive to the protracted weak economy, and
therefore we are continuing an intensive process to streamline operations,'
said Mr Edward Budd, Travelers' chairman. He claimed that savings from the
job cuts should start to show next year, with the annual after-tax boost
topping Dollars 100m by mid-1994.
Travelers' after-tax loss came after realised investment gains of Dollars
37.6m, compared with a Dollars 15m loss in the same period of 1991. Net
investment income was Dollars 696.3m, down from Dollars 792.3m a year ago -
largely due to under-performing mortgage loans and real estate.
However, 'under-performing' property assets remained at Dollars 5.2bn,
unchanged year-on-year. This represents roughly one-third of the total
property portfolio.
The group took only a modest Dollars 17m addition to reserves for potential
property-asset losses in the third quarter, bringing the overall property
valuation reserve to Dollars 828m by the end of the period.
Stripping out the effects of the hurricane, restructuring charges and the
accounting changes, Travelers said 'core' operating earnings slipped from
Dollars 68m to Dollars 44m in the quarter.
This was mainly because of a decline in commercial lines, agency business
and another loss in the asset management and pension services division. The
property-casualty personal lines business made some progress, however, and
life insurance sales remained strong.
Mr Budd painted a bleak picture. He cited the weak economy, declining
interest rates, very weak pricing in some property-casualty segments, and
the property market problems, and suggested: 'We do not expect the pressure
on earning to abate over the near-term.'
Travelers posted an after-tax deficit of Dollars 68m for the first nine
months, compared with net profits of Dollars 249m last time.
The sale of the 27 per cent stake to Primerica, the financial services
group, is still awaiting regulatory and shareholder approval, but will add
Dollars 722.5m of new equity capital. That will bring total capital raised
by Travelers this year to Dollars 1.4bn.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Akzo bucks trend by maintaining
earnings

<TEXT>
AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, yesterday posted unchanged profits for the
third quarter, bucking the trend of sharply lower earnings which have been
reported by many of its European competitors in recent weeks.
The company also said it still hoped to post higher full-year net profit
before extraordinary items, despite the general economic slowdown and
adverse foreign currency movements.
Net profit in the third quarter was virtually flat at Fl 162.1m (Dollars
93.7m), compared with Fl 161.5m in the same period of last year. However,
net profit for the first nine months rose by 8 per cent to Fl 586.2m.
Mr Syb Bergsma, finance director, attributed the company's ability to
maintain profits partly to its product mix, which features speciality
products not only in the chemicals sector and pharmaceuticals but also in
fibres and coatings. Last month, Akzo's Dutch competitor DSM, which is a big
producer of base chemicals, reported a decline of more than 50 per cent in
third-quarter results.
Other factors were greater efficiency following 2,200 job losses since early
1992 and an improved contribution from activities in the US, which accounts
for 25 per cent of turnover.
Overall, the strength of the guilder against many foreign currencies,
particularly the dollar, meant that group turnover fell 3 per cent to Fl
4.0bn, despite a 2 per cent rise in sales volume and a 1 per cent rise in
average selling prices.
Operating profit showed a small decline to Fl 274m from Fl 279.9m. Coatings,
fibres and pharmaceuticals posted slight increases in operating profit but
this was not enough to outweigh the fall in chemical products' results to Fl
68m from Fl 91m a year earlier.
Akzo's interim dividend was held at Fl 1.50.

SHARES in Olipar, the French property company linked to Mr Christian
Pellerin, the property developer, and Lucia, one of its associate companies,
are expected to resume trading on the Paris stock market tomorrow.
The shares were suspended pending the completion of the arrangements for the
recapitalisation of Lucia, which involves a number of France's most
prestigious financial institutions as well as Olipar, and the announcement
of Olipar's interim results.
Olipar and Lucia, like a number of other French property companies, have
been badly affected by the slowdown in the property sector.
Lucia fell into heavy losses. On Friday it announced details of a FFr1.1bn
(Dollars 206m) recapitalisation involving injections of capital from its
major shareholders including the Axa insurance group and Banque Nationale de
Paris, as well as Suez and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, two of France's
largest holding companies.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tapie in talks on sale of Adidas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Tapie, the French businessman and politician, is said to be
holding new discussions on the sale of Adidas, the German sporting goods
group controlled by his holding company, following the collapse last month
of its proposed sale to Pentland of the UK.
The future of Adidas, which is controlled by a German holding company in
which Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) is the majority shareholder, has been
shrouded by uncertainty since Pentland withdrew its Pounds 215m (Dollars
329m) offer.
Mr Tapie is known to be keen to reduce his business interests in order to
rebuild his political career. This summer he was forced to resign from the
French cabinet after a seven-week stint as minister of urban affairs because
of his involvement in a fraud case.
The fraud case has since been settled. Mr Georges Tranchant, the French
businessman who bought the case, dropped his suit last weekend after Mr
Tapie agreed to an out-of-court settlement, thereby defusing the legal
threat to his political prospects.
A newspaper report yesterday said Mr Tapie planned to sell Adidas, or to
sever his links with BTF, to concentrate on politics again. BTF and Mr Tapie
refused to comment on the issue. However, banking sources close to BTF said
the report was 'close to the truth'.
Since the abandonment of the Pentland offer, US and Japanese sportswear
groups have been mooted as potential purchasers for Adidas. Credit Lyonnais,
the state-controlled French bank which owns 10 per cent of BTF, has also
been cited as a possible investor in Adidas.
BTF originally put Adidas up for sale in order to raise capital to pay off
the debts incurred by its acquisitions during the 1980s. The sale to
Pentland would have eradicated the debt leaving it with a cash surplus.
It is now thought to be under renewed financial pressure after the collapse
of the Pentland deal and the proposed disposals of the Terraillon weighing
machine business and La Vie Claire health food chain.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 2.8m acquisition by Prime People
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME PEOPLE, the Manchester-based human resources group, is to acquire
Bowford Engineering Services for Pounds 2.8m and meet part of the
consideration via a rights issue.
Bowford has six skills training centres throughout the UK.
Consideration will be met by the allotment to vendors of 31m shares at 4 1/4
p, payment of Pounds 1.07m cash and the issue of Pounds 387,500 loan notes.
The vendors, Mr Geoff Bowers and Mr John Ashford, will control a maximum
38.2 per cent of the Prime capital, and shareholders will need to approve
the deal.
The rights will be on the basis of 1-for-3 at 4 1/4 p each, and raise Pounds
530,000 before expenses. There will also be issued up to 2.5m warrants at
the rate of 1-for-5 shares, entitling subscription to one share on March 31
in the years 1993-96 inclusive.
For the year ended October 31 1992 Bowford is forecast to make pre-tax
profits of Pounds 395,000, compared with Pounds 1m. The decline is largely
attributable to costs incurred in preparing two projects for the Ministry of
Defence and Mobil.
Results from USM-quoted Prime for the half year ended June 30 show a loss of
Pounds 161,000 (Pounds 121,000 after exceptionals of Pounds 86,000), from
turnover of Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 595,000). Losses per share were 0.01p
(1.5p).

Mr MA McDowell and Mr Paul Bews have resigned from the Blystad board, along
with the three members of the Norwegian Blystad family. However, they are

arisen after lengthy talks when they were close to agreement.
Over the weekend Mr Locke, who now controls more than 75 per cent of

Extraordinary items amounted to Pounds 161,152, mainly costs attributed to
the decision to withdraw from the low-margin general contracting and

Explaura Holdings, the North American aggregates company quoted on the USM,
reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.7m for the six months to June
30, against Pounds 1.35m.
Turnover almost trebled from Pounds 409,000 to Pounds 1.1m.
The results were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 780,000
against an outstanding debt. Explaura has applied to have the company
involved wound up.
Explaura also announced that Mr David Finch has returned to the
chairmanship. Mr Rudolph Agnew has resigned because of the increasing
likelihood of a conflict of interest between Explaura and Federated
Aggregates. Mr David Singleton has resigned as managing director for the
same reason. Mr Agnew and Mr Singleton are joint chairmen of Federated.
Mr Finch said he was confident of greatly improved results in 1993 but
difficulties with its previous contract would affect the second half of
1992. He added that the group continued to need short term liquidity which
was being addressed by the board.
Losses per share were unchanged at 1.15p.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Gloomy Frederick Cooper halves dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREDERICK COOPER, the West Midlands-based group with interests in
architectural hardware, specialist coatings and electrical products, is
halving its total dividend in acknowledgement that there would be no rapid
end to the recession.
'We are taking the view that there will not be any improvement until spring
1994 - we're running the business on that basis,' said Mr Ed Kirk, chairman,
as he unveiled pre-tax profits down from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 3.4m for the
year to July 31.
The outcome was struck after an exceptional credit of Pounds 165,000 (charge
of Pounds 268,000) as reorganisation costs were offset by a Pounds 600,000
surplus on the winding-up of pension schemes.
In the previous year, the group paid an uncovered total of 4p, but this time
the proposed final is cut to 0.5p, bringing the total distribution to 2p.
'We could have afforded to pay more,' Mr Kirk said, 'but we have to be
certain we can pay next year and the year after.'
Like most industrial groups, Frederick Cooper has been striving for
productivity gains, exercising stringent cost controls - the increase in
overheads was held to 2 per cent over the year - and rationalising. The
workforce was cut by 10 per cent to 1,500 people.
Against a background of growing pressure on margins, Mr Kirk warned that
'the ongoing effect of the 1992 productivity gains will undoubtedly help but
there is little scope for further cost savings without harming the
production capacity of the group.'
Cooper was willing to accept margins pressure as a necessary price for
seizing extra market share, especially in the architectural products
division which accounts for 60 per cent of sales.
Overall turnover was only fractionally lower at Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 82.8m).
Within that total, export sales rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 15.9m. At the
operating profit level - Pounds 4.33m against Pounds 5.37m - returns from
metal finishing were higher, thanks partly to buoyant sales in Germany, but
those from electrical products were lower. Operating profits from
architectural products were maintained.
Earnings per share were 2.3p (3.5p) basic and 5.1p (6p) fully diluted.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BAT poised to light up new market - A look
at the potential for its latest cigarette ventures in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST snow of the Russian winter dusted the roofs of the Kremlin across
the river from the Kempinski hotel where Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT
Industries, the UK-based tobacco conglomerate, recently opened formal
negotiations for a joint venture with Moscow's largest cigarette factory.
At breakfast in the German-run hotel, Mr IN Ordjonikidze, deputy mayor of
Moscow, and Mr LJ Sinelnikov, director of the Yava factory, warmly toasted
with champagne the prospect of a deal that would modernise a small but
important piece of the country's antiquated industry.
In Russia's hard-pressed economy, cigarettes are regarded not as a health
hazard but as socially benign. Demand heavily outweighs supply, giving them
the status of a surrogate currency which, unlike the rouble, does not
depreciate. Factories that produce cigarettes provide secure jobs and
finance local community services.
The letters of intent signed in Moscow marked a further advance in BAT's
long-term expansion strategy in the former communist republics - markets for
a potential 700bn cigarettes a year, seven times larger than the UK.
BAT, which presents its third-quarter results today, established its first
base in eastern Europe earlier this year when it agreed a joint venture deal
with the state-owned cigarette factory at Pecs in Hungary. It is investing
Pounds 20m in the operation over three years.
Two cigarette joint ventures are being set up in the Ukraine, at Prilucky -
where the factory supports two schools and a sports stadium  - and
Cherkassy, south of Kiev. BAT, which is helping to improve the republic's
tobacco crop, is also talking about investing in a leaf processing plant at
Monastirisk.
Apart from the Yava factory in Moscow, BAT's team has visited more than half
of Russia's other 23 cigarette producers. At least two more joint ventures
seem likely to follow; one near Moscow, another in Siberia.
Exploratory talks continue about possible developments in other former
Soviet republics, and also in Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.
'The investments we are making are essentially long-term,' says Sir Patrick.
'We do not expect to be making significant profits for at least 10 years,
possibly 25 years.'
However, the Hungarian venture is already surpassing the group's most
optimistic forecasts, Sir Patrick says.
'When we took over, we inherited a management geared to loss not profit,
since that was the route to subsidy; a workforce rewarded not with cash but
free accommodation and holiday homes; and a distribution network so inured
to selling whatever the state monopoly chose to supply that it scarcely
believed it could order what it wanted.'
Pecs is now producing more cigarettes more economically than ever before.
The factory, which previously supplied 40 per cent of Hungary's 27bn
cigarettes a year, has profitably raised its market share to more than 50
per cent. Its Sobianae brand is the market leader.
'That was achieved not only by investing in new technology, but also by
revolutionising the management of the business and so making more productive
use of a willing, skilled, and highly educated workforce.'
But if the Pecs venture is beginning to show what rewards are possible, the
practical obstacles to reaching even that stage of development remain
immense.
There is a willingness to embrace free markets, says Sir Patrick, but a lack
of institutions to make them work. Commercial law is inadequate, taxes are
liable to unpredictable change, banking systems are inefficient.
'In some places, it is virtually impossible to predict the course of
official policy,' he says.
In Czechoslovakia, where BAT competed against Philip Morris for control of
the Tabak cigarette monopoly, the UK group was given three weeks to tender,
a week to inspect the factories, and a brief meeting with management. 'It
subsequently emerged that the privatisation ministry, in conjunction with
its Japanese advisers, had already sewn up a deal with the Americans, and
that our role was simply to make up the numbers.'
Poland, in contrast, threw open its doors to every cigarette company that
knocked on them. The market, as a result, is in total confusion.
The break-up of the Soviet Union and the transfer of power to individual
republics has lengthened rather than reduced the bureaucratic process.
Central decision-making is now anathema. To clinch the Yava deal, BAT will
have to secure the agreement of the 1,400 factory workers and management;
but at the same time it will have to negotiate a labyrinth of city
government rules and regulations.
Merely valuing Yava's assets could be a bigger problem than any BAT may face
in re-equipping the cramped five-storey pre-1915 factory, raising
efficiency, and improving the quality of its output of 14bn cigarettes a
year.
Russian officials welcome BAT's policy of maintaining and developing local
brands; but until they can make up the shortfall in supply, the group is
exporting its international brands from Germany, the UK, US, and Brazil.
BAT's German factories alone have exported 7bn cigarettes to eastern Europe
since the Berlin Wall came down. Total BAT exports have surged in the first
nine months of this year, running at nearly three times the volumes of a
year ago.
Sales to Russia, hitherto largely dependent on barter deals, have been
boosted by the government's decision earlier this year to allow any private
trader with hard currency to import cigarettes.
Truckloads of Pall Mall, HB, Hollywood, Kent, and Lucky Strike are now the
currency in which many a domestic business deal is settled as well as a
staple part of the retail trade.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: TIP Europe up 26% as interest charges fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIP EUROPE, the trailer rental company which was forced to refinance last
year after breaching banking covenants, yesterday reported a 26 per cent
profits increase thanks to lower interest charges and higher rental rates.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 7.54m in the year to
July 31 while turnover rose 3.3 per cent to Pounds 106.5m. At the interim
stage profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 3.72m.
Mr Jim Davis, chairman, said the results showed 'steady progress'. He added:
'We're feeling much better than we did this time last year.'
Interest costs fell more than Pounds 2m to Pounds 14m as last year's Pounds
29m rights issue repaid debt. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 149.6m to
Pounds 118.4m, taking gearing from 3.53 times to 1.62 times enlarged
shareholders funds. Interest cover improved from 1.37 times to 1.54 times.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 22.1m because of slower
growth in continental markets, especially Germany. Benelux failed to recover
from a bad first quarter while profits in Denmark were wiped out by losses
in Finland and Sweden.
The average fleet was reduced by over 1,000 units to 17,900 to reflect lower
demand. This helped maintain utilisation rates close to 75 per cent, while
the company achieved price rises of 7 per cent. In the UK, rates increased
10 per cent to Pounds 11.83 a day.
In the general leasing division, falling used vehicle sales were more than
made up by a Pounds 1m increase in profits from Mobiel, which supplies
temporary buildings.
Exceptional reorganisation and refinancing costs totalled Pounds 558,000
(Pounds 1.68m). The April sale of the group's truck rental division led to
extraordinary charges of Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 683,000).
Earnings fell 7.4 per cent to 3.9p, even after last year's figure was
restated from 5.05p to 4.21p to reflect the rights issue.
TIP is proposing to cut its final dividend in line with the fall in
earnings. A final of 0.76p is proposed, to make total dividends for the year
of 1.4p, against 1.82p.
The shares fell 1 1/2 p to 31p.
COMMENT
TIP deserves credit for squeezing profits from a business as hard hit as
most, especially since the company's survival was in question less than a
year ago. A new management team, a more cautious approach and reduced
borrowings have all won applause in the City. But TIP is being forced to
sell trailers to control costs. It will therefore benefit less when recovery
comes - it will have to buy new trailers which are less profitable in the
first few years of operation. With the German economy apparently slowing,
analysts have scaled back forecasts for this year to Pounds 8.8m, putting
the shares on a prospective p/e of 8. Without evidence of recovery in the
UK, or resistance to a weaker Europe, that rating looks about right.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Redundancies at Pru offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance, a subsidiary of Prudential Corporation and
the UK's biggest reinsurance company, will be making some of its
underwriters redundant later this week following the downturn in business.
Further redundancies among support staff are also likely before Christmas as
part of a package of measures to reduce costs.
Mr John Engestrom, the chief executive who took office in July, said that
staff would be informed later this week. He added that there were 132
underwriting staff out of 1,500 total employees worldwide.
The job losses follow a statement from the company at the beginning of last

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (9): They can't afford to quarrel
 -Businessmen are attracted by Bulgaria's new market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

IT TAKES five hours to drive from Thessaloniki to Athens, but only three to
reach Sofia, the Bulgarian capital.
That is one reason why northern Greek businessmen are enthusiastic about
working in Bulgaria, despite their concerns about the lack of a clear legal
framework for foreign investment and property ownership.
To circumvent these problems, Greeks are going into partnership with
Bulgarians. Over 200 Greek-Bulgarian joint ventures have been established
since Bulgaria started its transition to a market economy.
'The joint ventures cover a very wide range of activities, from retail and
marketing to consultancy and manufacturing, though this is developing rather
slowly,' says Mr Emmanuel Vlahogiannis, treasurer of the Thessaloniki
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
'Bulgaria is an attractive market for Greece, being about the same size and
in need of the kind of consumer goods that we can provide. Their development
is going to be rather like ours in the 1950s and 60s.'
Fast-moving consumer goods are the mainstay of the Greek retail trade in
Bulgaria. Coffee, chocolate, ice-cream, jeans and training shoes are the
most popular items, according to Greek exporters.
A scramble is on to find business premises in Sofia, preferably in a
building that has already been restored to its original owners - to avoid
the possibility of being summarily evicted if the property changes hands.
There appears to be little difficulty in converting payments in Bulgarian
lev into US dollars, which are handed over in cash at Bulgarian banks, but
there can be problems with arranging a transfer to a Greek bank in
Thessaloniki.
'You can't just drive home with a briefcase of dollars in the boot. It took
me months to organise payments through the banking system, because Bulgarian
banks aren't geared up for sending money out of the country. But now I can
get a transfer through in one week,' says Mr Apostolos Genitsaris, whose
activities in Bulgaria extend from setting up an ice-cream distribution
network to trading in oil and petroleum products.
However, the free-wheeling climate of Greek-Bulgarian trade is starting to
change, following a Bulgarian decision to impose a 30 per cent import tariff
and set up a quota system for a wide range of goods.
Business on the Greek side of the border consists mainly of Bulgarians
arriving to shop at a large Greek supermarket just over the frontier. Some
Bulgarians come as far as Kavalla or Thessaloniki in search of spare parts
or a service for their car.
It is hoped that dealings with Bulgaria will happen on a more organised
footing once the new Greek-Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce starts operating,
probably early next year. Meanwhile, seven medium-sized Greek towns close to
the Bulgarian border are promoting commercial links with four others in
southern Bulgaria under the European Community's Interreg programme for
cross-border co-operation.
Greek affiliates of international accounting and consultancy companies are
participating in the EC's Phare programmes for assisting Bulgarian economic
development. They also seem keen to get involved in Bulgaria's privatisation
programme as financial advisers.
'There may soon be enough work available for us in Bulgaria to justify
opening an office there,' says Mr Yiangos Charalambous, a partner at KPMG
Peat Marwick Kyriacou, which earlier this year carried out an audit for the
new American-funded university at Blagoevgrad in southern Bulgaria.
But several Thessaloniki-based manufacturing companies have postponed plans
to set up plants in Bulgaria, because of the difficulties of acquiring a
greenfield site. Under current Bulgarian law, foreigners are allowed to buy
buildings but can only lease land.
Meanwhile, four fast-growing Athens-based companies are already establishing
themselves in Bulgaria. Hellenic Bottling, which holds the Coca-Cola
franchise for Greece and Ireland, has launched a Dollars 18m joint venture
to produce Coca-Cola and other soft drinks at five Bulgarian bottling
plants. Delta Dairy, a food processor, is setting up an ice-cream plant at
Varna, a Black Sea resort.
Intracom, a telecommunications company, is negotiating the sale of a
computerised lottery game to the Bulgarian state. The Vardinoyannis group,
with oil and banking interests, has opened the first in what is planned as a
network of petrol stations in Bulgaria, to be supplied from its refinery in
Greece.
However, the business environment for Greek companies in Bulgaria is to some
extent clouded by a distinct coolness in the two countries' political
relations.
The Greek government was angered by Bulgaria's decision to recognise the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia earlier this year, though this was
somewhat mitigated by a Bulgarian decision not to send an ambassador to
Sofia until the EC approves recognition of the newly independent republic.
Greek politicians are unhappy about the Bulgarian government's dependence on
parliamentary support from the country's ethnic Turkish party. Before the
collapse of communism, Greece and Bulgaria - though members of opposing
alliances - found common cause in their mutual suspicion of Turkey.
It does not help that talks have stalled in a long-running dispute over how
much water the Bulgarians are entitled to pump out of the river Nestos
before it reaches Greece. The Bulgarians, for their part, are upset that
their requests for new border crossings into Greece to be opened up, and for
access to the port of Alexandroupolis in Thrace, only 30 miles from the
Bulgarian frontier, have not yet been granted.
But given the threat of increased political instability in the southern
Balkans, Greece and Bulgaria cannot afford to start quarrelling.
'If there is real trouble in ex-Yugoslav Macedonia, the road through
Bulgaria will be Greece's only overland link to western Europe. Obviously,
they need each other,' says a western diplomat.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (7): Migrants readily find jobs -
Epirus: Albanians continue to flood across the frontier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEAN, weatherbeaten men tramping the roads of Epirus, their possessions
kept in a cloth bag slung over one shoulder, are immigrants from Albania.
They can be seen at any hour of day or night, travelling in twos and threes
to look for work.
The trickle of Albanians crossing the border in north-western Greece has
turned into a flood over the past year. There are thought to be over 200,000
Albanians - about 6 per cent of the country's population - in Greece. Among
them are former diplomats and university professors. But an overwhelming
majority are young men who enter Epirus illegally across the mountainous
border.
As part of its commitment to improve relations with Albania's democratic
government, Greece has adopted an attitude of laissez faire tolerance
towards the immigrants, who do not ask to be treated as refugees.
In fact, it would require draconian measures to keep them out. Greek
commandos patrol the border, but villagers on the Albanian side make a
living out of guiding immigrants to out-of-the-way footpaths leading into
Greece.
A senior police officer in Ioannina, the provincial capital, says: 'Most
days, we pick up about 500 Albanians in Epirus who don't have valid visas in
their passports, and bus them back to the border. But there are probably
more than that number coming across.'
Greece issues visas to Albanians of Greek descent, most of them
Greek-speakers from the North Epirus region of southern Albania, adjoining
north-western Greece. Over 40,000 North Epirots and their families are now
legitimate residents. In addition, Greece has agreed with the democratic
government in Tirana to accept another 30,000 Albanians as short-term
migrant workers.
It says something about the size of the black economy in Greece that
Albanian immigrants have little trouble in finding jobs, however temporary.
Albanians are in much demand as casual workers in agriculture and
construction, as they will accept a daily wage of Dr3,000 (Pounds 9). While
this is less than half the basic rate for Greeks, it is equivalent to almost
a month's salary in Albania.
The flow of arrivals looking for seasonal work increased dramatically after
Albania's democratic government launched a tough economic reform programme
in July, in return for a stand-by loan from the World Bank, freeing food
prices and cutting unemployment benefits.
It is clear that the plight of the impoverished North Epirots, cut off from
Greece during Albania's 40 years of Stalinist self-isolation, touches Greek
sensibilities.
Although there are few organised reception facilities for them, North
Epirots use a network of extended family contacts in Greece to find
better-paid jobs in the service sector. They are given preference over other
unskilled workers applying for work, and employers are more willing to help
ease them into the legal economy by meeting their social security
obligations.
Inevitably, the impact of the Albanian migration is felt most strongly in
Ioannina. Thousands of Albanians have settled in the city, which is only a
two-hour bus ride from Argyrokastro, the nearest big Albanian town - where
most transactions are now carried out Greek drachmas rather than Albanian
lek.
Ioannina is where returning migrants buy up household appliances, food
supplies and (increasingly) second-hand cars, to take home. Several thousand
refrigerators, television sets and washing machines are taken across the
border every week, according to Greek customs officials.
'The shops do well, but there are social problems. The Albanians have a
tradition of violence, and we have much-increased rates of crime and
prostitution,' says a provincial official.
With the aim of slowing the immigration rate, the Greek government is
preparing a medium-term aid and development programme, to be focused on
southern Albania.
It is awaiting approval, by the Group of 24 western industrialised
countries, of a Dollars 75m plan for setting up agro-industries in Albania,
from chicken-farming and pig-raising to canneries and the launch of a
fishing fleet.
'Informal and disorganised as it may be, the Albanian immigrants are getting
valuable exposure to a free-market system. That experience will be important
in making their own economic transition,' says a Greek official.
The government has also extended its incentive scheme for promoting
investment in remote regions of Greece to southern Albania, offering grant
aid and tax concessions even for small-scale projects.
However, the complex bureaucracy inherited from the communist past, together
with the slow pace of decision-making in Tirana, seem daunting to Greek
businessmen.
'The public administration is still in very weak shape, and there are doubts
about the legality of property transfers. You can sign a protocol, but there
is no guarantee it will lead anywhere,' says Mr Costas Aslanides, a Greek
contractor who wants to modernise a hotel in southern Albania.
In the meantime, a government-sponsored organisation, the Foundation for
Returning Greeks, is shipping European Community food aid to Albania. Truck
convoys leave the Epirus port of Preveza several times a week, carrying
flour to state bakeries in Albanian towns.
Greece itself will provide Dollars 35m in aid to Albania this year, largely
to meet specific requests from the Albanians for a variety of essentials,
from potatoes and pasta to light bulbs and soap.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (8): Moslems get a fairer deal -
Thrace: the government is directing EC funding to the province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one campaign promise that prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis
has lived up to, it was to address the problems of Thrace, the
farthest-flung Greek province and the least-developed area of the European
Community.
It was not so much its remoteness that cut Thrace off from the mainstream of
Greek development as the presence there of a large Moslem minority, mainly
of ethnic Turkish descent.
The Moslems mostly belong to a farming community left behind when Greece and
Turkey carried out an exchange of populations in 1923, after Greece's
attempt to invade Asia Minor had been thwarted by Kemal Ataturk. The Treaty
of Lausanne spelled out the rights of both the ethnic Turkish minority in
Thrace and its Greek equivalent in Istanbul.
But while asserting that the terms of the treaty were being observed,
successive Greek governments quietly pursued a policy of economic
discrimination against the Moslems.
This, it is argued, was justified retaliation for Turkish pressure on the
Greek shopkeepers and businessmen of Istanbul, where the minority has shrunk
from 220,000 in the 1920s to under 4,000 today as a result of economic
harassment and periodic anti-Greek violence.
The size of the Moslem minority in Greece, about 110,000, is much the same
as in 1923. In fact, a high birth-rate in the villages of Thrace has
effectively disguised the steady stream of departures to Turkey and, since
free movement of labour was permitted in the European Community, to Germany.
The hostile climate of Greek-Turkish relations in recent years was also
reflected in Greek policy towards the minority, with Thrace remaining firmly
at the bottom of the agenda for regional spending.
Mr Mitsotakis's government is reversing the pattern of neglect, directing
European Community funding for regional development specifically to Thrace.
It is trying to change ingrained attitudes among local officials so that
obstacles to active Moslem participation in the local economy are removed.
The government is also well aware that its new approach is likely to give
Greece's image abroad on human rights issues a considerable boost.
Moslems no longer find it hard to get tractor permits or driving licences.
They do not have pay kickbacks to get permission to open a shop or make
improvements to their homes.
Most important of all, Moslems can buy and sell property freely and obtain
loans from the state-owned banks that control local financing on the same
terms as Christian residents of Thrace.
'The bureaucracy has grown much more responsive to the minority in the past
year. You put in your application for whatever it may be and get an answer
in days, instead of the endless delays and prevarication there used to be,'
says Mr Abdulhalim Dede, secretary of the mufti's office in Komotini.
The government has launched a Dr80bn (Pounds 247m) programme of
infrastructure improvements, up to 70 per cent of which is to be funded out
of EC structural funds. The main priority is to bring the road network up to
international standards and expand the province's two small ports, with a
view to attracting investment.
The current investment-incentives law offers especially favourable treatment
for investors who set up in Thrace, including generous grants and sharply
reduced tax rates. According to Mr Dimitris Karahalios, governor of the
Komotini district, more than Dr4bn of new investment has arrived in the past
two years, creating jobs in textiles, timber processing and metalworking
plants.
'Thrace used to miss out on private investment, so it is encouraging to see
confidence developing. Once we get the infrastructure into shape, we can
expect bigger inflows,' Mr Karahalios says.
Several projects will directly benefit the minority. The mountain villages
along the border with Bulgaria, home of the Pomaks - Moslem sheep- and
cattle-breeders whose ethnic origins are fiercely debated - are at last
being linked to the electricity grid. Plans for expanding irrigation,
upgrading telecommunications and improving school facilities will also have
a greater impact on the Moslem villages.
However, for the Moslems, whose first language is still Turkish, the
inadequacies of the educational system set up for the minority are now of
pressing concern.
Teaching in Turkish at the village schools is of a low standard as the
educators are trained in Greece, not Turkey. Attendance at Turkish
high-schools is declining, because textbooks approved 40 years ago under the
Lausanne treaty are too out-of-date to equip students for university
entrance exams in Greece or Turkey.
'The most important problem the minority faces now is how to get the schools
up to an acceptable level. It's a big test for the government's new policy,'
says Mr Dede.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (6): A wood trader with polish -
Profiles of three forward-looking companies with eyes on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMAGE of a Greek industrial company is often that of a jealously guarded
bastion of family interests, prevented from competing in the broader
European market by its unwillingness to surrender even a modicum of control
to outside managers or shareholders.
Yet the experience of Balkan Export, which started out as a timber trading
company owned by several northern Greek families, demonstrates that
modernisation can be worthwhile.
Balkan Export is now Greece's second-largest wood-processor, with a widening
product line, increased exports and a profitable subsidiary that produces
furniture and fittings.
It is also among only a handful of northern Greek companies listed on the
Athens Stock Exchange. Three years ago, 35 per cent of the company was
floated, raising Dr5.5bn (Pounds 17m) in fresh capital.
'We were one of the first Greek exporters going into the Middle East
markets. From that experience, we realised we had to grow, regardless of the
changes involved,' says Mr Tasos Kyriakides, marketing manager.
'Taking the decision to go public was a turning point. Bank interest rates
were crippling, and we were planning large-scale investments which would
enable us to stay competitive for a decade.'
Balkan Export now runs seven product lines, manufacturing different types of
chipboard, plywood and blockboard. Its most recent investment was a Dr3.5bn
chipboard production line installed last year.
The company has also boosted production of sawn timber from imported
tropical woods, and strengthened distribution of imported red woods from
Scandinavia and white woods from eastern Europe for making floors and window
frames.
'We've become a sort of supermarket in wood products. But the test of
staying competitive will be our ability to keep up with demand for better
quality products,' says Mr Kyriakides.
The other side of the coin is that Balkan Export is now more susceptible to
the effects of recession. The pace of new construction in Greece slowed by
about 15 per cent last year. The building industry is particularly sensitive
to any decline in economic activity.
Sales increased by only 7 per cent last year, to Dr13.4bn. However, exports
surged by 32 per cent to Dr2.8bn, the result of a successful marketing drive
in Germany and Holland. This year sales are forecast to rise by around 10
per cent, assuming that exports can be sustained.
'We're in a very volatile environment at the moment. On the on hand timber
costs are coming down, but on the other we've been affected by the war in
Yugoslavia. We can't pass on extra transport costs to our customers in
Germany, because the market there is so competitive,' says Mr Michael
Kefalopoulos, export manager.
At the same time, the international trade embargo against Serbia, formerly a
major customer for Greek wood products, will deprive Balkan Export of about
15 per cent of projected export sales this year.
Fortunately, the company's furniture subsidiary, Eldoor, seems immune to
recession, having increased sales by 46 per cent in 1991 to Dr2.8bn. Another
40 per cent rise is forecast this year.
Eldoor makes floors, doors and window frames and kitchen furniture, and also
imports a wide range of household fittings. With showrooms proliferating
around Greece and no direct competition, it is steadily taking business away
from hundreds of small joinery and furniture-making companies.
Eldoor will also lead the company's efforts to establish new joint ventures
in eastern Europe. 'There are delays and difficulties, but Romania and
Bulgaria are a promising market for us. We plan to start on a small scale,
opening an Eldoor shop in Bucharest as a joint venture, and then another in
Sofia,' says Mr Vasili Takas, managing director.
Fast food, soft lighting and tasty profits
THE fastfoodzadiko is now as much a part of the Greece eating scene as the
traditional taverna or souvlaki stand.
However, McDonald's and Burger King, both fairly recent arrivals in Greece,
have some way to go before they can rival Goody's, a Thessaloniki-based
restaurant chain with over 60 outlets and aggressive plans for expansion.
Mr Achilleus Folias, managing director of the Goody's group, says: 'Everyone
associates this business with America. It may sound a bit surprising, but we
are the second-largest European hamburger chain, after Quick in France and
Belgium.'
Goody's introduced franchising to the restaurant business in Greece 10 years
ago. But growth has speeded up recently as American hamburger and pizza
chains have started opening there. From this year, Goody's plans to open 10
new restaurants a year.
Its outlets in 19 Greek towns and cities serve standardised menus of
hamburgers, chicken and fish, supplied from its catering and warehouse
complex outside Thessaloniki.
Group profits last year reached Dollars 3.1m on turnover of Dollars 31.4m.
Its production arm, Hellenic Catering, contributes most to overall earnings,
with profits last year of Dollars 1.9m on turnover of Dollars 10m. For 1992,
the forecast for Hellenic Catering is a 50 per cent increase in turnover,
and earnings of Dollars 2.6m.
This year, Goody's baking subsidiary is launching new production lines to
make what Mr Folias calls 'the extra-soft white bun that goes best with a
hamburger.' Meat and fish are imported from western Europe for preparation
to European Community food processing standards, he says.
'We keep a close check on quality control at every stage - processing,
distribution and points of sale. Everyone employed by a new franchisee comes
to Thessaloniki for training.'
Goody's has recently altered its strategy, to meet what could be intense
competition from the American quick-service chains in the next few years. At
new outlets, neon-glare and metallic surfaces are replaced by softer
lighting and indoor plants. The menu is broadening to include more salads
and, in major cities, salad bars.
'We want to get away from the harsh look. Greek consumers are getting more
demanding and more health-conscious,' Mr Folias says.
Though quick-service restaurants in Greece are frequented mostly by the
17-24 age group, the new Goody's look is attracting a much wider range of
customers. Moving upmarket is also bringing more tourists into outlets in
resort areas.
The first Goody's franchisee on the island of Crete is the owner of a chain
of first-class hotels, in partnership with the managing director of the
island's biggest shipping line. The restaurant itself is part of an
architecturally ambitious shopping complex on the waterfront at Rethymnon,
on the north coast.
The company is also preparing to expand abroad. Its first Bulgarian
franchise has been agreed, with a restaurant due to open in Sofia in the
next few months. Cyprus will come next, while a feasibility study is under
way for opening a restaurant in Istanbul.
'The Sofia outlet will be very much a pilot project. There are so many
uncertainties in the Bulgarian market - pricing is going to be difficult,
for example. On the other hand, Cyprus is an obvious market for us, with a
lot of potential.'
While franchising will remain the key to growth, Goody's catering service to
schools, factory canteens and summer camps is to expand. A Dollars 2.5m
investment programme, including a series of satellite kitchens, will raise
capacity to over 100,000 meals a day.
The other growth area is in confectionery and ice-cream. Floca, an
old-established Athens confectionery business acquired by Goody's five years
ago, is making profits again. Mr Folias is keen to transfrom it into a
nationwide cafe chain on a franchise basis, selling high-quality ice-cream
and a restricted range of confectionery.
'The sticky Greek pastry belongs to the past. Lighter confectionery is much
more in demand, and at this point we probably have both the infrastructure
and the distribution network to support a parallel chain,' he says.
New bank has its roots in the north
TAXI-DRIVERS in Thessaloniki like to joke about Egnatia Bank, because its
biggest branch is in a field near the airport - hardly a promising site for
attracting customers.
The building in question houses the bank's Dollars 8m computer system, one
of the most advanced in Europe and the key to Egnatia's plans for becoming
an international bank based in Thessaloniki.
Egnatia, which opened its doors late last year, is one of a series of new
Greek private banks established by prominent local personalities in
shipping, insurance and industry. But it is the only one to have made its
headquarters in northern Greece.
'There was clearly room for a bank that could develop a branch network
giving priority to the north of the country - though we certainly aren't
ignoring Athens,' says Mr Stathis Potamitis, vice-president.
The bank's major shareholders are a group of northern Greek businessmen
interested in broadening their activities. Its senior managers are Greeks
who were persuaded to leave jobs in London, New York or with foreign banks
in Athens by the prospect of launching an innovative Greek bank.
Egnatia Bank's capital base amounts to Dr6bn (Pounds 18.5m), well above the
Dr4bn minimum required for a banking licence in Greece.
By the end of this year Egnatia will have 14 branches in operation. It plans
to open a representative office in Sofia and add another 10 branches next
year 'before we sit back and take stock,' Mr Potamitis says.
The emphasis on rapid expansion reflects Egnatia's view that a Greek bank
must have a strong deposit base if it is to compete effectively. But this
does not mean acquiring an imposing set of assets.
'We haven't spent a drachma on bricks and mortar. All our premises are
rented, and that isn't likely to change. The bank is being created around
the computer system,' says Mr George Michelis, head of the bank's economic
intelligence unit.
In addition to keeping costs down by reducing back-office paperwork to a
minimum, the computer system is intended to provide a standard of customer
service new to a country where cheque books are rarely used and a statement
sent by post is a novelty.
The system will also be used to design new banking products, taking
advantage of each new stage in the liberalisation of Greek banking.
'We want to be able to exploit deregulation as it happens. We aim to have
any new product ready within one week,' says Mr Andreas Yiannacopoulos, the
bank's automation manager.
The system, which uses an IBM mainframe with a software package provided by
Hogan, is able to produce on line real-time balance sheets, and can operate
in over 20 different currencies. According to Mr Yiannacopoulos, the system
is designed so that Egnatia can open a branch in Greece or abroad within two
hours of defining the base currency and which reports the branch can
produce.
However, Egnatia's managers dismiss the suggestion that their technology
might be unnecessarily sophisticated for a small and relatively undeveloped
banking market.
'We chose the best available technology so that we don't find ourselves in
the position of other Greek banks - having to spend a lot more money
upgrading the system after two or three years,' Mr Michelis says.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (4): Farther to go, more to pay -
War in the former Yugoslavia has made exporting complicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROAD from Greece to western Europe has grown longer and more hazardous
since war broke out in the former Yugoslavia. In recent months, political
roadblocks raised by the UN embargo on trade with Serbia have added to
exporters' problems of rising costs and uncertain delivery dates.
The difficulties are most acute for companies in northern Greece, which
account for just over 50 per cent of total Greek exports valued at Dollars
6.8bn last year.
The region's highest-earning exports are fresh fruit - citrus in winter and
cherries, peaches and grapes in summer - together with yarn and textiles.
Exporters in Thessaloniki note that for both categories, timely delivery,
with no loss of quality on the road, is crucial to remaining competitive.
During 12 years of European Community membership, Greek exports to the
Community have risen from 38 per cent to 65 per cent of total exports. Yet
Greece is at a considerable disadvantage, compared with the other
Mediterranean EC members, because of the extra distance its goods must
travel. It takes almost 24 hours by ferry to cross the Adriatic to southern
Italy, the nearest EC market, and just as long to reach Germany, the biggest
market for Greek exports.
'Now the choice is between an expensive route by ship to Italy or a
time-consuming route through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary,' says Mr Jordan
Adamidis, director of the Exporters' Association of Northern Greece.
A recent study by the association forecasts that exporters in Macedonia and
Thrace will face losses of up to Dollars 500m this year, as a result of
higher transport costs and lost trade with Serbia and Montenegro.
Textile exporters have fared worst, with average transport costs soaring by
43 per cent. Some manufacturers are resorting to air freight to ship their
goods, while others use the overland route through Bulgaria.
Many food exporters have switched to the Italian route, with costs rising on
average by 29 per cent, according to the study. However, fruit exporters
complain that at peak periods there is not enough capacity for refrigerated
trucks on the ferries serving western Greek ports.
The pressure of increased truck traffic this year during the tourist season
underlined the need for extra quay space and better customs facilities at
ports like Patras, the main crossing point for Italy, and Igoumenitsa to the
north. The government has announced plans for upgrading both ports with the
help of the EC regional fund, but work will not start before 1993.
According to Greek truck drivers and freight forwarders, the alternative
route through eastern Europe is fraught with danger. Roads in Bulgaria and
Romania are narrow and badly maintained, while unwary drivers who pull over
for a nap may wake up to find their load has been stolen.
Further along the route, transit fees through Hungary for TIR trucks have
risen sharply, while Hungarian regulations restrict loads to 20 tonnes
rather than the usual 25 tonnes.
'It's a nuisance, because it adds another 20 per cent to your costs, but
there isn't an alternative route,' says Mr Michael Mistakidis, who exports
rice to central Europe.
The exporters' problems grew worse in July, with the UN embargo on trade
with Serbia and Montenegro. Although overall trade with Greece declined as
the Yugoslav federation started to disintegrate, the southern republics
continued to import Greek fruit and vegetables, textiles and consumer goods
after Slovenia and Croatia broke away last year. Greek exports to Yugoslavia
in 1991, with Serbia much the largest customer, were valued at Dollars 160m,
down from Dollars 180m the previous year.
'Food processors say they've lost 90 per cent of their trade with former
Yugoslavia. The trade in fresh produce has been almost wiped out, because of
the embargo,' Mr Adamidis says.
Even before the embargo was imposed, a well-established trading relationship
with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, adjoining northern Greece,
had been upset by the dispute over what the newly independent should call
itself.
Greek objections to having a country named Macedonia on the doorstep of its
own province of the same name have affected bilateral trade almost as much
as the new state's worsening economic problems. But the situation was
exacerbated by complaints from Greece's EC partners over the summer that oil
sold by Greek companies to ex-Yugoslav Macedonia was being passed on to
Serbia.
Greece is the main supplier of both crude oil and refined products to the
neighbouring republic, in normal circumstances shipping about 120,000 tonnes
monthly by road and rail to a refinery near Skopje.
The Greek government banned local companies from selling oil to its
neighbour, pending the introduction of a new system of import licensing
designed to make sanction-breaking more difficult.
However, another dispute erupted over what ex-Yugoslav Macedonia should be
called on the new import documents. After weeks of acrimonious discussion in
the EC, a compromise solution permits the new state to use the name
Macedonia on its own documents.
The decision will allow more goods to start moving into Skopje, but the
noisy protests from the Greek government suggest that politics will continue
to obstruct exports for some time to come.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (5): Planners hope for EC
assistance - The government sees Thessaloniki as a transit centre for the
Balkans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TAKE ONE look at a map of the Balkans, and the potential role of
Thessaloniki as a hub for trade and communications becomes clear.
The city is an obvious outlet to the Mediterranean for the former
Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria. It also sits astride what could become the
main land transport route from Italy to Turkey.
The break-up of Yugoslavia has had mixed consequences for Thessaloniki. On
one hand, a lively exchange of goods and services was slowed by the outbreak
of war and, since July, virtually halted as a result of the UN embargo
against Serbia - an important trading partner for Greece.
On the other, Serbia's loss of access to the Adriatic ports of Koper and
Rijeka, now in the independent republics of Slovenia and Croatia
respectively, should mean that under normal conditions Thessaloniki could
expect to handle much of Serbia's international trade.
That, at any rate, is the view of the Greek government, now revising its
infrastructure development policy for northern Greece. The premise is that
Thessaloniki can become a transit centre for the Balkans, resuming a role it
played most successfully in the Byzantine period.
There is a sense of urgency in the air, because much of the funding must be
approved by Greece's European Community partners this year. Greece hopes to
get up to Dollars 14bn in EC assistance from 1993 to 1998 under the second
Delors package for improving infrastructure in poorer EC member countries.
Thessaloniki Port Authority, one of Greece's profitable state-controlled
enterprises, with earnings of over Dr1bn (Pounds 3m) annually, has already
launched its own Dr30bn development plan. Its later stages are to be
included in the new EC funding.
'Our contribution to the development plan amounts to self-financing, because
we don't have to ask for allocations from the public investment budget,'
says Mr John Marinides, director of the port's free zone.
Last year, dry cargo traffic through Thessaloniki totalled 6.5m tonnes. The
projection for 1992 is 7.2m tonnes. Despite the loss of Serbian shipments,
dry cargo traffic through Thessaloniki port was up by 15 per cent in the
first seven months of this year. Oil shipments, which totalled 7.5m tonnes
in 1991, rose by 11 per cent in the same period, Mr Marinides said.
The port's chronic labour problems have eased somewhat in the past year.
Although the 1,000 stevedores still work only one daily shift, with overtime
considered a built-in part of the wage scale, the container terminal now
operates around the clock. Container traffic soared in the first eight
months of 1992.
Cargoes from Romania and Bulgaria have increased, as Thessaloniki becomes a
transshipment centre for both countries. Their exporters are no longer
required to use the facilities of state-owned enterprises, whether railways,
transport agencies or ports, or to follow designated itineraries imposed by
the government.
The development plan for Thessaloniki port aims at doubling capacity for
receiving overland cargoes, adding new warehouses to store bulky and heavy
cargoes and building a new Dr600m railway terminal for handling freight
close to the quayside. The main pier for handling container shipments is to
be extended. Dredging operations will deepen the harbour to 14 metres so
that larger vessels can be handled. A Dr5.2bn earthfill operation will
create additional space for warehouses. Nine new gantry and mobile cranes
will be installed.
'By the end of the decade we should be able to cater for up to 4,000 ships
and handle 9m tonnes of dry cargo a year,' said Mr Marinides.
The EC is also expected to continue funding a highway-building programme
launched in the 1980s. Thessaloniki is the only city in Greece to boast a
dual-carriageway ring road, opened last year, together with a highway to
Halkidiki, the main northern Greek resort area, 100km from the city.
'There's an orgy of road-building going on. There are so many years of
neglect to be made up for,' says Mr George Misaelides, secretary general for
infrastructure projects in central Macedonia.
The challenge for the government is to secure EC approval for completion of
the Egnatia highway, named after the imperial Roman road that crossed the
Balkans from Durres in Albania to Thessaloniki and Istanbul.
The revised route would start at Igoumenitsa, a small western Greek port due
to be upgraded as a ferry terminal for truck traffic. Scattered sections of
the highway already exist, constructed in the haphazard way of past
governments anxious to secure votes through funding small-scale public works
in carefully selected districts.
Thessaloniki airport, used by more than 1.5m passengers a year but still
lacking a runway that can handle wide-body jets, is also in need of
attention. There are daily flights to a dozen western European cities, but
only rudimentary aircraft-parking and maintenance facilities.
However, the most far-reaching plan for exploiting Thessaloniki's position
will involve much more than physical infrastructure. An EC-financed study is
under way, to examine the possibility of basing a Balkan trade centre and
mercantile exchange in the city.
Trade originating in the Balkan countries amounted to Dollars 82.3bn in
1989. But only Dollars 16.9bn of that amount passed through Greece, while
Greece's own trade with the Balkan countries totalled just Dollars 1.6bn.
'The Balkan countries are going to be producing substantial amounts of
low-value added goods for some time to come. Finding markets for them would
be much easier through an exchange forum in the region,' says Mr Costas
Mitropoulos, of Kantor Management Consultants, who are preparing the study.
While financial services in Thessaloniki are improving fast, with almost 30
Greek and foreign banks in the city, it would take a sizeable effort of
political will to establish a regulatory framework and a system for handling
transactions generated by an international exchange centre.
Much will depend on how quickly political stability and economic reforms
take root in the region, allowing the Balkan countries to join the
international trading system without the hindrances of bilateral agreements
and foreign exchange shortages. Greece, for its part, can set an example by
eliminating the politically-inspired bureaucracy that, in the communist era,
significantly hampered the growth of trade with its Balkan neighbours.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (2): EC membership lifts
prosperity - Agriculture: about a third of Greek output now comes from the
north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FARMING IN northern Greece is now a business rather than a way of life.
Holdings are larger, crops more varied and mechanisation more extensive than
in the south of the country.
Farmers' incomes are high, in some places rivalling those of Cretan
vegetable-growers, the wealthiest Greek producers.
Almost 12 years of European Community membership has brought a dramatic rise
in Greek farmers' standard of living. About two-thirds of EC transfers,
amounting to over Dollars 17bn since Greek accession, have gone to support
prices for agricultural products. For most crops, even the withdrawal prices
provide farmers with a comfortable living.
About one-third of Greek agricultural output now comes from northern Greece,
with production concentrated in the plains of Macedonia. Northern farmers
grow 62 per cent of cereals, 50 per cent of maize and 80 per cent of sugar
beet produced in Greece.
In addition, about 55 per cent of the tobacco crop comes from the north.
Irrigation is well-advanced: the region also specialises in growing cotton,
to supply the local yarn and textile industry, and is one of the few
rice-producing areas in the EC.
Over the past decade, fruit-growing on the hillsides above the Macedonian
plains has developed into a major commercial activity. Apples and pears are
grown for domestic consumption, while peaches, pears and cherries have
become high-earning exports.
'Farmers in this region are professional in their outlook, despite the
relatively small size of their holdings. They're willing to change crops,
and they're susceptible to new ideas about machinery, because they work the
land themselves,' says Mr Nikos Efthymiades, of K&amp;N Efthymiades, Greece's
leading agrochemicals manufacturer.
Agriculture has not always flourished in this part of Greece. Farming
remained a subsistence occupation, even after the population exchange
between Greece and Turkey in 1922 had brought thousands of skilled farmers
to the region from Asia Minor. The newcomers were granted what were fairly
large landholdings by Greek standards, averaging about 10 acres, as former
Turkish-owned properties were handed over and big estates were broken up.
But it was only after the completion of large-scale anti-flood and drainage
programmes, carried out with government funding and US expertise, that
output started to increase significantly. Another 300,000 acres of
cultivable land became available, mainly in fertile river valleys in
Macedonia and Thrace.
Tobacco is still the traditional crop in Thrace, although the oriental
varieties, suited to the district's poorer soil, face a steady decline in
demand. Macedonian farmers are taking over, growing more Virginia tobacco,
which commands much better prices. Younger farmers in Thrace are starting to
give up tobacco, switching to cotton and wheat instead.
The picture is rather different in Epirus, a much more mountainous region.
In the valleys and coastal plains, olive and citrus cultivation remain the
main agricultural activities. In the mountains, sheep-raising is still
important, and considerable amounts of cheese are produced by traditional
methods.
However, the main growth area in all the northern Greek provinces is dairy
production. Output has grown rapidly since the early 1980s in response to
sharply rising consumer demand. As a result, large Greek milk and yoghurt
producers compete in providing incentives for farmers to keep small herds of
dairy cows.
These include extending loans to farmers to buy Dutch and French cows,
providing veterinary back-up, and help in getting EC subsidies to build
cowsheds. Some companies take Greek dairy farmers to Holland for seminars in
animal husbandry.
Demand for sheep and goat's milk is also high, with the shepherds of Epirus
able to claim payment three or four months in advance for their winter and
spring milk production.
Milk output in Greece now totals 1.78m tonnes yearly, of which 694,000
tonnes is produced by cows, 640,000 tonnes by sheep and 462,000 tonnes by
goats. Most sheep and goat milk is used for cheese-making, with only a small
percentage used for yoghurt.
'Demand for cow's milk is still increasing at the rate of about 5 per cent
yearly, and there is probably some way to go, since canned evaporated milk
still covers about 40 per cent of the market. Per capita consumption of
fresh milk in Greece is still less than half the the EC average,' says Mr
Thanassis Kravas, marketing director of Mevgal, a milk and yoghurt producer
near Thessaloniki.
Although small family-run dairies continue to make sheep's yoghurt, about
three-quarters of Greek yoghurt output, amounting to around 77,000 tonnes
annually, is now factory- produced. Exports have risen from 2,000 tonnes in
1987 to 7,500 tonnes last year, with sales concentrated in Britain France
and Italy.
However, surpluses of other farm products are showing an increase. This
year, more than half of a record peach crop, reaching over 920,000 tonnes,
was dumped. Greece is one of the world's largest producers of canned
peaches, with 90 per cent of industrial peaches grown in western Macedonia.
But canning capacity, at only 250,000 tonnes, has failed to keep pace with
the growth in production.
Citrus output is also heavily in surplus, partly because Greek oranges are
mainly old-fashioned varieties which cannot compete in EC markets with
Spanish or Israeli produce. At the same time, demand from eastern European
countries, which used to buy large quantities of Greek citrus under
bilateral government-to-government trade agreements, has shrunk in the past
two years.
One reason for the rising surpluses is that Greek farmers receive
comparatively little support or advice from the state agricultural extension
service. Until recently, seed production and sales were a state monopoly,
with the result that research and development of new seed varieties has
lagged behind the rest of Europe. At the other end of the production cycle,
marketing and exporting of Greek produce is in need of better co-ordination.
From next year, farmers face a sizeable drop in product prices under the
revised EC agricultural policy. Support rates for both marketed produce and
withdrawals will start declining at a time when costs are increasing.
Fertiliser prices have soared since the government lifted all remaining
price controls earlier this year.
Mr Alkis Giziades, who farms 20 acres of his own land outside Thessaloniki
and another 15 acres of rented property, sums up the farmer's dilemma:
'Fertiliser prices have tripled in less than a year, and diesel is up by 30
per cent. Wheat and cotton prices will be down by 10 per cent at least. That
makes you wonder whether you should plant less and switch to milk - even
though feed's gone up and cows are hard work to look after.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (3): Non-investors lose ground -
Textiles are the largest export, but a two-tier industry is developing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STROLL down one of Thessaloniki's main shopping streets reveals the
strength of the local textile and clothing industry. Boutiques displaying
imported labels are vastly outnumbered by windows filled with Greek-made
fabrics and garments.
From the automated weaving plants of large manufacturers in countryside
towns to the basement workshops in Thessaloniki's poorer neighbourhoods, the
industry employs more than 40 per cent of Macedonia's workforce. Over 4,000
companies, about one-third of the industry total, are based in the region.
Production is strongly export-oriented, with over 70 per cent of local
companies selling abroad. Germany is much the largest market for both
fabrics and ready-wear.
'Northern Greek companies cannot compete on price with the Asian
garment-makers. But they are well placed to carry out smaller 'repeat'
orders for big German traders, having acquired a reputation for good
quality-control and punctuality in meeting delivery dates,' says Mr Rigas
Tzelepoglou, a Thessaloniki-based management consultant.
Greece's textile industry developed rapidly from the 1970s, thanks to
increased output of locally grown cotton and low labour costs. Import
tariffs, together with substantial export subsidies, provided an additional
stimulus for expansion.
Northern Greece attracted textile companies keen to take advantage of
government incentives for industrial investment outside Athens, as well as
the lower cost of labour in the north of the country, while transport from
Thessaloniki for companies exporting to northern Europe was also cheaper at
that time.
After joining the European Community, Greece was no longer subject to quotas
for textile exports; but, on the other hand, was obliged to phase out both
tariffs and the export subsidy system that had kept less efficient
manufacturers comfortably afloat. Meanwhile, competitiveness started to
erode as labour costs moved steadily higher.
Textiles are still Greece's largest export, earning Dollars 1.8bn last year.
But a two-tier industry has emerged, with a widening gulf between successful
companies, maintaining competitiveness through continuous investment, and
manufacturers who are rapidly losing ground through their inability to renew
machinery and equipment.
'We've gone from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive business. To
compete, you have to renovate equipment, organise better and keep on
improving quality and customer service,' says Mr Christos Accas, managing
director of Hellenic Fabrics, the largest Greek textile group with annual
turnover of Dr30bn (Pounds 97.3m).
Unlike most Greek textile companies, the group is both vertically and
horizontally integrated, running a cotton-ginning plant near Thessaloniki
and manufacturing yarns, fabric and garments. Its largest unit is an
integrated spinning and weaving mill, which produces denim for the jeans
industry, mainly for export.
'There is still room for expansion: after all, we produce one of the best
cottons. But it's hard to keep reducing production costs, and the industry
as a whole is gradually losing competitiveness. There are going to be big
problems in the future,' Mr Accas says.
According to some analysts, up to 50 per cent of Greek textile producers and
garment-makers are likely to go out of business over the next few years.
Competition from the eastern European countries is expected to grow, with
new spinning and weaving mills being set up to take advantage of cheap
labour and proximity to the German market.
Yet garment-makers are likely to be hardest-hit. Three-quarters of Greek
ready-wear manufacturing is done by small family units with five or fewer
employees. There are only 24 companies that employ more than 200 workers.
The focus on small-scale production based on imported patterns gave little
scope for developing Greek-produced designs. As a result, Greek
garment-makers have been unable to create products with brand names or build
sales networks abroad.
Until recently, the flexibility of small producers enabled them to keep on
winning orders from abroad. But rising costs and aggressive competition from
Spain and Turkey are making things difficult at a time when domestic demand
is shrinking. For the moment, companies in Thessaloniki, where some 40 per
cent of Greek garment-makers are based, seem to be holding on to customers
more successfully than in the south of the country, according to local
exporters.
However, the industry now faces an additional problem as a result of the
government's efforts to tighten exchange-rate policy, pegging the drachma
more firmly to the Deutsche Mark and slowing the depreciation rate against
other European currencies.
'Devaluation of the peseta and the lira is going to have adverse effects on
our competitiveness. The export market has been getting more difficult, and
now the drachma is overvalued by at least 10 per cent,' says Mr George
Athanassiades, of Hellenic Pella Mills, a yarn-producer.
With spinning mills facing slackening demand for ordinary cotton yarns, Mr
Athanassiades has switched to making yarns that combine cotton with acrylic
and polyester fibres, and coloured yarns. He says his company has spent
Dr650m on new investment in the past three years, mostly out of its own
funds.
Mr Athanassiades has also diversified into importing, becoming the agent for
Adidas shoes and athletic wear in Greece. He says: 'Continuous investment is
important in this business, If you slip behind, you can't meet demand for
better quality. But it's also important to reduce risk - and sales of brand
name products in Greece are healthy.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (1): Efficient yet unsure of
itself - Although a third of the country's manufacturing originates in the
north, where businesses show a higher return on capital, the people of the
region feel that prosperity has been achieved in spite of centralised
government policies
</HEADLINE>

ALONG WITH democracy and much else besides, the Greeks invented the idea of
a north-south divide. The ancient Athenian orator Demosthenes, for one, made
a career out of criticising the Macedonians of northern Greece as aggressive
and uncivilised outsiders.
The modern inhabitants of Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace, the three northern
Greek provinces, certainly consider themselves political outsiders, though
in economic terms they have caught up with, and in some areas - such as
central Macedonia - overtaken, the rest of the country. While overall annual
growth in Greece in the 1980s averaged only 1.7 per cent, the rate for
northern Greece was 2.3 per cent.
Epirus, a mountainous province with the country's highest emigration rate in
the 1960s, has started to develop its own tourist industry and to export
traditional products - wine, cheese and marble. Thessaloniki claims to have
a higher per capita income than Athens, while even Thrace, perennially
neglected because of its large Moslem minority and proximity to Turkey, is
making progress.
To back their claims of being more industrious and efficient than the
volatile Athenians, local businessmen point out that one-third of
manufacturing output and over half of exports originate in the north.
Northern Greek companies, generally medium-sized and family-run, show a
higher return on capital and a stronger commitment to investing than those
elsewhere in Greece. And although both the export-oriented textile industry
and manufacturing for the domestic market are feeling the effects of
recession, unemployment is estimated at 2-to-3 percentage points below the 9
per cent national average.
Costs are rising, but support prices for crops like cotton, tobacco and
rice, grown widely in northern Greece but only on a small scale elsewhere in
the Community, are expected to remain at satisfactory levels.
There is considerable scope for developing tourism, mostly confined to
Thessaloniki itself and the Halkidiki peninsula. But this is not to say that
northern Greece is undiscovered: remote mountain villages in Epirus and the
Prespa lakes, on the border with Albania and the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia, can seem surprisingly full of north European walkers and
birdwatchers.
Yet the northern Greeks feel strongly that prosperity has been achieved in
spite of, rather than with, the support of the government. The country's
centralised power structure, with decision-making concentrated in Athens,
have made it easy to ignore the problems and the potential of northern
Greece. Even when large EC grants started to become available, programmes
were approved and allocations made in the capital.
'The minister for Macedonia and Thrace is only a figurehead. This is
recognised in Athens but political will is needed to change the situation.
It's an urgent issue, because this is a time when we can build relationships
in the Balkans from Thessaloniki,' says Mr George Tzitzikostas, a
conservative deputy who held the portfolio last year.
The collapse of communism in the Balkans opened the door to increased trade
and investment in an area where Greek merchant communities flourished from
the late 18th century until the second world war. But the heady optimism of
two years ago, with expectations of Thessaloniki's becoming a platform for
western investment in the southern Balkans, has dissipated in the face of
the violent break-up of Yugoslavia and the slow pace of economic reform in
Albania and Bulgaria.
Indeed, there is growing concern that conflict in the former Yugoslavia
could spread as far south as the Greek border, sending a wave of refugees
into northern Greece. Meanwhile, Greece's own dispute with the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over nomenclature adds to the uncertainty.
Greek insistence that the neighbouring republic cannot be recognised under
the name of Macedonia exasperates the rest of the EC, all the more so since
the Athens government is not willing to sit down and negotiate a solution
with its counterpart in Skopje.
As borders start to be questioned elsewhere, the Greek view that recognition
of ex-Yugoslav Macedonia could one day give rise to a territorial claim on
its own province of Macedonia no longer seems so far-fetched. But to foreign
observers, Greece not only has little to fear as the only Nato and EC member
in the Balkans, but risks losing a chance to play a leading role in the
region's transition to a market economy.
It therefore comes as a surprise to hear the western-educated business elite
in Thessaloniki endorse the government's hardline position. Despite the loss
of trade and even some manufacturing facilities in ex-Yugoslav Macedonia as
a result of the dispute, the northern Greeks are for once firmly behind
Athens.
This attitude seems rooted in a previous Balkan upheaval after Epirus,
Macedonia and Thrace were prised away from the Ottoman empire to form a much
larger Greece. For the Greeks, the culminating victory in the Balkan wars
was the capture of Thessaloniki in 1912.
However, northern Greece only acquired its modern demographic shape a decade
later, with the arrival of 700,000 Greeks from Turkey in a population
exchange following a disastrous Greek military defeat in Asia Minor. 'The
Greeks expelled from Asia Minor, whether merchants or farmers, were the key
to Macedonia's development. The history of that period still influences the
present,' says Prof John Koliopoulos, of Thessaloniki University.
If the northern Greeks still have a sense of insecurity, despite their
achievements, it is only to be expected that the issue of minorities is a
sensitive one. Although successive Greek governments have tried to emphasise
the homogeneity of the modern state - with the exception of the Moslems in
Thrace - it is proving impossible to keep the lid on the Slav-speakers of
northern Greece.
Officially, Slav-speakers number 35,000; but add up the figures given by
local officials across northern Greece, and it is clear that some 100,000
people have an understanding of the Slav dialect used in Greece. The Greek
worry is that they will one day demand to be treated as an ethnic minority,
fuelling a possible territorial claim by the Slavs of ex-Yugoslav Macedonia.
Recently, one or two attempts by Slav-speakers to form cultural clubs have
been turned down by local courts. 'We don't pose a threat to anyone. We're
Greek citizens, but we have a rich cultural tradition and a language we want
to preserve,' says Mr Traianos Pasois, who belongs to a group of
Slav-speaking activists.
While turmoil in ex-Yugoslavia casts a definite shadow over northern
Greece's present prospects, it contributes, paradoxically, to a feeling of
confidence about the medium-term outlook. With the road through Serbia to
western Europe blocked, priority must be given to completing an alternative
export route across northern Greece to ports in Epirus. The port of
Thessaloniki also stands to gain as an outlet for Romania and Bulgaria.
Northern Greek exporters are taking a strong interest in the Bulgarian
market, while contacts are being made in Russia and the Ukraine.
However, if the efficiently run companies in northern Greece are to make the
most of new opportunities in the region, they will have to start considering
some restructuring and modernisation of management. Investment banking is
not yet a serious part of Thessaloniki business life, but it is significant
that of 300 northern companies which meet the requirements for a listing on
the Athens Stock Exchange, only a dozen have so far taken the plunge.

FT  04 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks lead advance in shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor

<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR dollar stocks ahead of the outcome of the US presidential
election took the London stock market yesterday to around one percentage
point under the all-time closing high reached just after the re-election of
Mr John Major's Conservative government.
Paradoxically, domestic shares remained less confident, overshadowed by the
uncertain prospects for tonight's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht
proposals.
The London market brushed aside the weakness in the US dollar itself, taking
its cue from Wall Street's overnight gain and from perceptions that Governor
Clinton, leading the opinion polls as voting in the presidential election
commenced, would, if elected, act to stimulate the US economy.
Share prices opened smartly higher in London on the back of the US buying
seen at the close of the previous day. The day's peak of 2,713.4 on the
FT-SE Index was reached very early, however, and the gain was cut back at
midsession as the dollar turned easier.
London resumed its upward trend when Wall Street, after initial uncertainty,
edged higher in early trading in its new session. At the close, the FT-SE
Index stood at 2,705.6 for a gain of 17.8 on the day. The Footsie reached
its closing peak of 2,737.8 on May 11 this year but has not been able to
hold above the 2,700 mark since then.
The trend was set for the equity market by widespread gains in US-orientated
stocks, ranging from ICI and Cable and Wireless to Rank Organisation.
Pharmaceuticals, which had been restrained by concern that a new US
president might restructure healthcare charges, joined in the advance.
Trading volume was boosted by the focus on the big international stocks. The
day's Seaq total rose to 586.6m shares, compared with 519.3m on the previous
day. Monday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.1bn, maintaining the
improved business levels of recent weeks and helping to restore the
financial health of the London-based securities industry. However, hints of
further staff cutbacks in UK stock market trading firms have continued to
circulate in the City this week.
The electricity power generating stocks responded to reports that the deal
with the coal supply contracts may be signed shortly. But the broader range
of UK manufacturing and retail sectors remained under the shadow of the
economic recession, reinforced yesterday by the disclosure that the fall in
domestic house prices accelerated last month.
Firmness in sterling and in government bond prices, reflected in easier
rates in London money markets, gave some encouragement to hopes for another
cut in UK base rates in the near future. But the stock market has assumed
that such hopes must now await the outcome of the Maastricht debate in
parliament and could, in any event, be postponed until the government makes
its autumn economic statement at the end of next week.
While traders were cautious of over-enthusiasm yesterday, pointing out that
share gains had been extended in early trading by a squeeze on trading
positions at marketmaking firms still bent on keeping tight books, the mood
appeared optimistic. However, the fear of a political crisis should Mr
Major's government fail to secure support for its Maastricht policies acted
as a restraining factor.

into the London office market produced firmer hints of the imminent signing
of three major contracts in the City.
Sterling's devaluation has brought German and other overseas investors back
into the UK property sector, reported to have around Pounds 400m of funds
available for equity and real capital requirements. Yesterday, both forms of
investment opportunity appeared to attract attention as MEPC and Hammerson
were subject to big disposal rumours, and dealers reported overseas buying
in selected property shares.
MEPC was said to be close to selling its Finsbury Circus development to
Difa, a German investment trust, for close on Pounds 80m. The Bank of Tokyo
is a long term tenant of the office block. MEPC refused to comment on the
rumour, which surfaced in the trade press last week. Hammerson also declined
to comment on strong hints that it had received a Pounds 30m offer from a
private German investor for its Sceptre Court development in the City of
London, and a further Pounds 20m for its Lonsdale Chambers block, in the
West End.
Finally, Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French banking group, was said to be
negotiating to buy the freehold of its Broadgate base from developer
Rosehaugh.
The renewed interest in the London office market, while bringing relief to
debt-ridden owners, was dismissed by analysts as speculative and not the
harbinger of good times for a property sector still under a recessionary
cloud. 'What we are seeing is some buying from the Continent which sees the
market as cheap following devaluation,' said Mr Ray Jones at Paribas.
Others said the rises would not be sustained and the recent gain had been
overdone. Yesterday, Hammerson Ordinary rose 8 to 229p, the 'A' shares 9 to
220p, Land Securities 9 to 415p and MEPC 11 to 341p.
Burmah wanted
A series of positive presentations to investment institutions in Scotland
led to a sharp rally in Burmah Castrol shares.
The lubricants company addressed the Scottish fund managers under the
auspices of County NatWest at a dinner in Glasgow and a breakfast meeting in
Edinburgh.
Burmah, a notable beneficiary from the recent devaluation of sterling, earns
around 25 per cent of its profits in Germany, via its Castrol and Foseco
businesses, and is believed to have been largely unaffected by the apparent
slowdown of economic activity in that country.
Burmah shares raced up to 658p during early trading but eased back to close
a net 13 higher at 651p.
Today's seminar on the group's Indonesian gas operation and a story that SG
Warburg Securities had increased its net asset value by 20 per cent to 210p
a share because of the recent fall in sterling against the dollar, gave a
big push to Lasmo shares. The stock ended a busy session a net 8 1/2 firmer
at 183p after exceptionally heavy turnover of 5.5m shares.
Enterprise saw good support, edging up 3 to 456p on 1.7m. Bottled gas
company Calor closed 10 to the good at 239p on relatively high turnover of
1m, with buyers chasing the stock for the dividend, payable at the end of
the month.
Oil sector specialists pointed out that worries about increasing production
by Opec countries were again affecting the oil market. BP slipped 2 1/2 to
232p but Shell, still boosted by a recent BZW buy recommendation, added 2 at
540p. BZW said: 'We believe that a number of fears that investors have about
the stock are unfounded and continue to believe that fair value is a market
yield; that equates to 610p in the current market.'
Dollar influenced stocks were generally stronger despite the uninspiring
performance from the US currency. The stocks responded more to the impending
continuity of the next presidential term security. Glaxo, helped by a
Wertheim Schroder recommendation, was up 23 before easing with the market to
close 15 firmer at 835p. Wellcome rose 12 to 993p. Nikko Europe was
reiterating both of them in its latest quarterly sector review. SmithKline
Beecham 'A' gained 12 to 540p and ICI improved 24 to 1060p.
The long-awaited but widely expected downgrade of Barclays by BZW duly
arrived and produced a bout of heavy trading and - much to the surprise of
marketmakers - a near 3 per cent decline in Barclays shares. The stock
settled 10 lower at 340p, having fallen to 333p early in the day.
BZW forecast a Pounds 65m loss for Barclays in the current year, against a
previous prediction of Pounds 305m, and expects the bank to cut the dividend
to 14.15p. For 1993 BZW has pencilled in a profit figure of Pounds 375m.
Lloyds Bank benefited from switching out of Barclays and settled with a 13
gain at 493p on good turnover of 4m.
Cable and Wireless continued to reflect the recent Kleinwort Benson
recommendation and added 14 at 632p.
Several engineering and motor stocks came under pressure after Kleinwort
Benson downgraded profit expectations. GKN gave up 8 to 394p on high volume
of 5.6m. The broker is believed to be expecting GKN to report current year
profits of Pounds 125m, and Pounds 115 for the following year. Also
downgraded was BBA, 2 lighter at 132p, and Laird Group, up 6 to 278p with
the strong market. Shares in TI Group also discounted the cut in profit
expectations from Kleinwort Benson and instead moved 6 ahead to 308p,
boosted by the strengthening dollar.
British Aerospace shares were wanted and gained 6 1/2 to 149 1/2 p. The
stock is favoured by agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite and Mr Brian Newman
at Henderson believes the shares to be a buy because 'the share price
discounts the current uncertainties and the recent decline of sterling will
help recovery prospects'. Volume reached 6.1m.
Speculation that APV would soon be on the receiving end of a bid from Siebe
continued. The former added 4 at 90p and the latter firmed 5 to 349p. A
squeeze was behind the advance in Smiths Industries, which closed 8 up at
323p.
Shares in William Cook, which reports interim results next week, eased a
penny to 88p. A squeeze was seen in a number of transport stocks. These
included BAA, up 5 at 754p, and P&amp;O which jumped 12 to 464p.
In a firm drinks sector, Bass jumped 15 to 571p, helped by a buy
recommnedation from James Capel. Early talk that Kingfisher was considering
a money-raising excercise to build a war chest reignited old bid stories
about Lloyds Chemist. While the rumour found little substance among
analysts, few expressed surprise, Kingfisher being cash-rich and known to be
casting its eye not only over the domestic situation but also Europe. After
early strength, the shares fell back 4 to 526p. Lloyds advanced 2 to 216p.
Weakness in Tate and Lyle saw the shares off 1 at 349p. The company
announced it was stopping production of its Sucralose sweetener pending US
approval.
Food retailers were weak on vague hints of a price war after Tesco, off 7 at
225p, started a new promotion. Kwik Save fell 11 to 719p and Argyll 9 to
350p.
Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson lost recent gains after its
broker and one other securities house cut back profit forecasts. Broker
Cazenove, which never comments on its actions, was said to have cut its 1992
forecast to Pounds 135m after seeing the company on Monday. The figure is
well below last week's revised consensus of around Pounds 144m. Smith New
Court, which also visited the company, reduced to Pounds 134m for this year
and Pounds 157m for 1993. Pearson shares fell 13 to 350p.
Small television group TVS jumped 4 1/2 to 26 after announcing that it had
received a bid approach.

FT  04 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG opening in futures soon gave way to concern about the outcome of
today's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht treaty, before a late rally
led to a firm finish.
The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE Index was struck at a
strong 2,733, boosted in no small way by the good overnight performance by
Wall Street stocks.
The early buying interest quickly faded as worries over Maastricht gained
the upper hand and December retreated, falling to 2,719 by mid-morning,
which proved to be the day's low.
Light buying thereafter helped December slowly regain momentum, as it crept
gently forward for the rest of the session with a bout of strong buying
activity seen in the last hour of trading which ensured a strong close.
The contract finished at 2,744, up 30 from the previous session and around
22 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 17.
Turnover was 7,824 lots.
Investors showed renewed enthusiasm for traded options, sending turnover
climbing to 29,054 contracts by the close, with some 7,446 lots dealt in the
FT-SE 100 option.
British Aerospace, also busy in the underlying equities after a broker's
recommendation, was the most active stock option with a total of 2,173 lots
transacted. This was followed by BTR, in which 1,298 contracts were traded,
and then by HSBC.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Cautious trading as US goes
to the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices weakened slightly in busy yet cautious trading yesterday as
voters went to the polls to elect a new President, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 9.73 off at 3,252.48. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 slipped 2.83 to 419.92 and the Nasdaq composite shed 2.99 to
604.58. Turnover amounted to 208m shares.
Analysts attributed some of the early selling to profit-taking following
Monday's advance. News of a 0.3 per cent decline in September's leading
economic indicators also contributed, suggesting that the economy remains
trapped in a weak growth phase.
Overall, however, sentiment was positive about the likely outcome of the
presidential vote. Some observers said the market was in a 'no-lose'
situation. If Mr Bill Clinton wins, the market would be pleased because its
expectations would have been met and because a Democrat president would
immediately stimulate economic activity with an aggressive fiscal package.
On the other hand, if President George Bush earns a stunning victory,
analysts said the market would celebrate because, ultimately, equity
investors will always favour a Republican over a Democrat.
The big corporate story remained General Motors, following the shake-up on
Monday of its senior management. The stock added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 32
1/4 in turnover of 5.8m as investors welcomed the appointment of Mr John
Smale as chairman and Mr Jack Smith as chief executive, and the introduction
of new, younger managers to run a company burdened by high costs and a
shrinking market share.
Oil issues were broadly lower, Chevron losing Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 68
1/2 and Texaco Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 .
Berlitz International dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 in busy
trading after the Japanese publisher planning to buy the company announced
that he wanted to renegotiate the terms of the acquisition in the wake of
the sharp fall in Berlitz's third-quarter operating income.
On the Nasdaq market, Coventry retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 19 after
reporting third-quarter net profits of 29 cents a share, up from the 20
cents earned a year ago but slightly below analysts' forecasts.
Canada
TORONTO finished lower after heavy trading, with bank stocks coming under
pressure after Royal Bank of Canada raised loan loss provisions by CDollars
900,000.
The TSE 300 index receded 17.4 to 3,361.6 and falls led rises by 310 to 249.
Volume expanded to 34.8m shares and included a block trade of 1m shares in
TransCanada PipeLines. The financial services index tumbled 2.3 per cent
after Royal Bank, down CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 24, announced that its loan
loss provisions would rise to about CDollars 2.05bn for fiscal 1992.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: New issue flood looms over Bombay
equities - The prospects for India's stock markets after this year's
scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R C MURTHY and STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp decline in India's scandal-hit stock markets in the past month is
making life increasingly difficult for companies seeking to raise funds in
the capital markets.
The Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) 30-share index dropped by 14.5 per cent
between October 1 and last Friday, including a 5.3 per cent fall last week.
After Friday's ban on short sales, and closing for settlement work on
Monday, it recovered 3.3 per cent to 2,928 yesterday; but volume was thin
and institutional interest was limited.
Confidence has been hit by lingering concern about the scandal in the
inter-bank securities market, in which leading stockbrokers are involved,
and by the shock of mass tax raids on brokers' offices two weeks ago.
Investors have also been swamped by a flood of new issues, including rights
issues. Companies are planning to raise an estimated Rs150bn (Dollars 5.3bn)
in equity and equity-linked bonds in the financial year which started in
April, compared with Rs57.4bn in the whole of 1991-92.
It is surprising that signs of financial indigestion did not appear earlier.
The scandal first erupted in April and punctured a 15-month rally in equity
prices in the secondary market. The BSE 30-share index slid from its April
peak as financial institutions reported heavy scandal-linked losses and the
exchange closed for a month.
However, investors' appetite for primary issues has remained strong,
primarily because of the extremely large discounts offered in the primary
market. Lured by mass-marketing campaigns involving posters and newspaper
advertisements, investors flocked to stag issues - that is to buy in the
primary market and quickly sell the stock in the secondary market.
The market's recent plunge has closed the stags' window of opportunity as
prices in the secondary market have fallen, sharply reducing the discounts
offered in the new issue market. Mr R Sankaran, managing director of
Ind-Global Financial Services, a leading securities company, says: 'The
investor is becoming more mature and consequently more discriminating in
subscribing to new issues and rights issues. He has a choice now.'
The first big company to have run into difficulties is Ceat Tyres, one of
India's largest tyre makers and a member of the RPG group, a Calcutta-based
industrial conglomerate. Ceat initially set a deadline of October 14 for
acceptances for a Rs1.1bn rights issue, but has extended the offer to
October 31 to give shareholders more time to respond. It said application
forms had been held up in the post.
But the poor response from shareholders may be more readily explained by the
fact that the discount between the offer price of Rs75 and the market price
has dropped in the past month from Rs60 to Rs37.
Other companies could well avoid the same fate if they stick to the deep
discounts traditionally offered in the Bombay stock market.
For example, investment bankers see little difficulty in the issues planned
by Gujarat Fertilisers, a large fertiliser producer, and HCL-Hewlett
Packard, an electronics group linked to Hewlett Packard, of the US. Both are
launching convertible bonds where the conversion price is only one-third of
the market price.
Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Credit Capital Finance, a leading investment
bank, believes that the good issues will go through. He also believes that
investors will, if necessary, sell existing holdings to buy competitively
priced new stock.
If new issues have to be cancelled or postponed, companies will lose a
valuable source of new capital, just as they are gearing up to invest to
take advantage of the opportunities created by the reformist policies of the
government of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. With bank credit tight
and commercial lending rates running at around 18 per cent, equity capital
has been a key source of cheap funds since dividend yields average around
1.3 per cent.
Moreover, companies have only been able to raise funds freely through equity
issues since March this year, when the government abolished a rule which
required issue prices to be set by a bureaucrat - the capital issues
controller. The controller typically insisted on deep discounts in order to
favour state-owned financial institutions, which are India's principal
investors.
Under the new system, issues have to be vetted by the Securities and
Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, which examines claims made
in prospectuses.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar's strength helps to
lift continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES rose on a stronger dollar and the early closing markets,
particularly, were lifted by Wall Street's overnight gains, writes Our
Markets Staff. But for some, the stimuli were stronger, and more specific.
PARIS closed just below the day's high, encouraged by Monday's interest rate
cut and on hopes that there was scope for further easing. A strong Matif and
a firm dollar also lifted the market. The CAC-40 index ended 44.53 or 2.6
per cent higher at 1,786.93, in good turnover of FFr2.9bn, although dealers
said a substantial part was options-related.
Rises were across the board, with Elf up FFr5.50 to FFr355.50, Alcatel FFr19
higher at FFr659 and Lafarge FFr15.10 up at FFr309.
But Rhone-Poulenc CIs dropped FFr9 to FFr502 after its unit Institut Merieux
International confirmed that until November 1985 it exported a blood product
for haemophiliacs which had not been tested for the AIDS virus or heated to
kill the virus. Shares in Merieux were temporarily suspended and later lost
FFr740 or 9.6 per cent to FFr7,000.
Peugeot also bucked the firmer trend, losing FFr4 or FFr511 on news that
registrations of cars made by the Peugeot-Citroen group tumbled by 11.1 per
cent in October.
FRANKFURT had another quiet day, with German stock market turnover estimated
at little more than Monday's DM3.1bn as the DAX index rose 12.43 to
1,485.00.
Mr Thomas Nolten, a dealer with B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the direct
effect of the dollar and Wall Street's overnight gains was that traders,
including DTB DAX futures traders, felt obliged to close their short
positions.
Big DAX stocks moved accordingly although in chemicals, where the bad news
came from Bayer on Monday, the big gains were reserved for BASF and Hoechst,
up DM4.50 to DM411 and DM5 to DM236 respectively, while Bayer put on only
DM1.90 to DM256.40.
Constructions performed well, led by Holzmann which closed DM30 higher at
DM30. The sector still has good orders for the short- and medium-term, noted
Mr Nolten.
STOCKHOLM jumped 2.3 per cent in heavy trading on the stronger dollar. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 16.6 to 729.8 in strong turnover of SKr766m
after SKr454m.
Dollar-sensitive issues rose, while demand remained strong for Astra ahead
of its nine-month report, due on November 11. The A shares were up SKr13 to
SKr589, while the B shares rose SKr12 to SKr570.
COPENHAGEN's banks and shipping shares led the Danish advance as the KFX
index gained 1.01 to 72.62 in turnover of DKr179m. Danske Bank and Unibank
recovered some of their recent sharp declines to close DKr5 and DKr3 higher
at DKr109 and DKr204 respectively, while D/S Svendborg, part of the
export-dependent shipping and oil group, AP Moeller, rose DKr3,500 to
DKr108,500.
HELSINKI jumped 5.3 per cent, the Hex index closing 40.4 higher at 798.6 in
turnover of FM83.2m, extending its recovery to some 30 per cent in just over
two weeks. The banks and finance house index gained 14.1 per cent,
reflecting the sharp fall in Finnish interest rates over the last few weeks.
AMSTERDAM closed firmer, boosted by a strong rise in Akzo shares in the wake
of its pleasing third-quarter results. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.1 to
103.2.
Akzo rose Fl 6.20 or 4.9 per cent to Fl 134.00 after its 0.4 per cent
increase in third-quarter net profit pleased the market, since it had
expected a decline.
The firmer dollar helped to lift Ahold, Aegon, Royal Dutch and Unilever.
MILAN ended up but well off early highs as demand fell back after the
official fixing. The Comit index rose 4.36 to 450.61 in turnover estimated
around Tuesday's L226.3bn.
Among leading stocks, Fiat rose L111 to L4,600 and Montedison added L7 to
L1,242. Stet rose L50 to L1,530 but Mediobanca fell L240 to L12,000.
ZURICH lost some of its early gains as the dollar declined in the afternoon,
and New York opened flat. The SMI index put on 11.5 to 1,933.1, after a
morning high of 1,940.4.
BRUSSELS rose in brisk trading following a three-day weekend. The Bel-20
index added 16.26 or 1.4 per cent to 1,156.22. Petrofina continued its
recent recovery with a rise of BFr230 to BFr8,310.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim waits for US
outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE absence of Tokyo, trading in the Pacific Rim was influenced by the US
presidential election, writes Our Markets Staff. Some markets dipped on

HONG KONG was pulled below 6,200 by a sell-off in China Light shares after

FT  04 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Divisions remain over dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ

<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR suffered a setback against the D-Mark yesterday after the
Bundesbank president issued a cautious note on the prospects for a further
easing in German credit policy, writes James Blitz.
After Monday's dramatic 3-pfennig rise, the US currency fell back yesterday
to close at DM1.5635, down about  1/2 pfennig on the day. However, the
decline has not changed the perception of dealers that the dollar will rise
sharply against the German currency in the longer term. In New York trading
the dollar improved to finish at DM1.5670.
Yesterday's decline was partly due to pre-election jitters. There were
rumours that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, wants
the dollar to drop back to Y100 against the yen to reduce the Japanese trade
surplus. These were denied by Mr Clinton's advisers.
A more serious setback was delivered by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, who said further cuts in interest rates depended on
success in reducing the budget deficit and the level of domestic wages for
1993.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, believes
that the dollar rise cannot be capped much longer by tight Bundesbank
policy. He thinks that the market's fixation with Germany's credit policy
will fade as the country's economic situation deteriorates. 'Germany faces
next to zero growth in the short term and stubborn inflation, while real
yields on German bonds are moving below those in the US,' says Mr Brett.
'Are you sure you want to hold a currency that is underpinned by short-term
interest rates and nothing else?' he asks.
In his view, a high currency yield will prove no better a shield for the
Bundesbank than it was for the Bank of England.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at the European securities wing of
International Bank of Japan, says the dollar rise will remain constrained.
'The dollar could reach DM1.65 or DM1.70,' he adds. 'But those are next
year's rates.'
In his view, uncertainty over the US economic upturn will restrain the
dollar revival before then. This week's non-farm payroll figure will
indicate whether the Federal Reserve will have to ease rates further. In the
longer term, Mr Hannah believes that the budget deficit increase sanctioned
by Mr Clinton, if he is elected, will become a problem for the dollar.
He also believes that, although German rates will come down, the easing may
not happen until the turn of the year. Money markets have already priced in
all the easing that will happen before the end of 1993. 'Where is the
surprise element that will boost the dollar further?' he asks.

FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Exotic spots for the future - Sara Webb
reviews a survey of emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lanka, Iceland, Iran and Uruguay have been tipped as a few of the more
exotic emerging markets of the future, according to a recent survey* on
investor attitudes to equity and bond markets, and some of the more
adventurous international fund managers plan to invest in these countries
within the next two years.
They would also consider investing in Colombia, India and Israel. However,
better-known emerging markets such as Portugal, Greece and South Korea are
expected to attract the most new investment over the same timescale.
The response to the survey, conducted by Euromoney Publications, suggests
that rather than looking en masse for the next emerging market in which they
might double their money in a year, institutional investors plan to remain
conservative with regard to geographical diversification.
Respondents said they were exposed to 16 out of the survey's list of 42
'emerging and sub-emerging' markets. Mexico and Portugal jointly led the
list of emerging markets in which participants already invest, followed by
South Africa, which the survey also classified as an emerging market. They
were followed by Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil and Turkey.
Respondents said they also invested in Argentina, Chile, Greece, Indonesia,
Israel, South Korea, the Philippines and Venezuela.
The survey points out that growing investor interest in the emerging markets
will increase the demand for specialist analysts, thus creating new
opportunities for the broking community.
The report says: 'Almost certainly within five years, those investment banks
which are currently revered for their research on French, German or Dutch
equities will be aggressively competing for the top-ranked Polish and Czech
equity analysts; shortly afterwards, they will presumably be doing the same
for Russian and Ukrainian gurus.'
The survey was based on the responses of 136 international institutional
investors, including large insurance companies, pension funds and other fund
managers responsible for managing a total of Dollars 1,759bn.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Ignore the bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLISH sentiment dominated most of Europe's money markets yesterday, with
the short-dated sterling and D-Mark futures all showing strong rises, writes
James Blitz.
However, some dealers thought that these moves, reflecting confidence that
interest rates will soon come down, were flying in the face of reality.
In Britain, the political crisis is reaching a climax. Today's vote in the
UK parliament on whether to move towards ratifying the Maastricht treaty
looks set to be close, leaving the future of Mr John Major's government very
uncertain.
In Germany, the Bundesbank shows a new unwillingness to lower official
rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said yesterday that
further cuts in interest rates depended on success in reducing the budget
deficit for 1993.
However, dealers in Europe's futures and cash markets seemed blissfully
unaware of the darkening clouds.
Cash rates in the sterling money market dropped sharply, with three-month
interbank rates offered at 7 7/16 per cent, their lowest level since 8 per
cent base rate was introduced. Three-month certificates of deposit were as
low as 7 1/8 per cent, discount-ing a full percentage point cut in rates.
December short sterling was up 20 basis points on the day, closing at 93.60.
In Euromark trading, the March contract was 10 basis points higher on the
day, at 92.55, pricing in a drop of 145 basis points in three-month rates by
the spring.
Dealers doubtless had reasons for taking an aggressively bullish view. In
Britain the assumption was that another cut in UK interest rates will be
announced with next week's Autumn Statement. The small shortage of Pounds
200m forecast by the Bank of England yesterday also helped sentiment.
A report yesterday from the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce
pointed to increased economic gloom, implying the need to stimulate the
economy. The federation said that a third of western German firms expect to
cut their workforce next year.
The wonder was that French franc futures closed unchanged at 90.81, in the
market's first full trading day following Monday's reduction in French
official rates.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Burmese drills grinding to a
halt - Disappointed explorers are ready to pull out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL international oil companies are on the verge of abandoning efforts
to find oil and gas in Burma after collectively spending more than USDollars
400m in three years on almost fruitless exploratory drilling.
Among those that have already decided to drop their onshore exploration
blocks are BHP of Australia and Clyde of the UK.
The military government awarded a round of three-year contracts in late
1989. Oil companies have the option of extending the contracts, but most of
them - disappointed by poor results and higher than expected costs - are
likely to pull out, according to oil company executives and western
diplomats.
Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, which faces a
deepening energy crisis, is pinning its hopes on a project awarded this year
to Total of France to exploit known offshore gas reserves in the Gulf of
Martaban.
The plan is to export most of the gas to Thailand by pipeline, but the
Dollars 1bn project will not come on stream until the second half of the
decade.
Crude oil was extracted from hand-dug wells in Burma as far back as the
tenth century, and the country - officially renamed Myanmar - now produces
about 15,000 barrels a day of oil and 85m cubic feet a day of gas.
The oil companies operating in Burma - including Shell, Amoco, Unocal and
Idemitsu - were hopeful that they would find large oil-bearing structures in
the country.
'But after three years of exploring, everything seems to be technically more
complex - hard to find and hard to develop,' says one oil company executive
in the capital Rangoon. In the words of one western diplomat: 'They have
spent an awful lot of money not finding oil'.
Obstacles included the complexity of Burma's geology, the inadequacy of its
transport and communications networks, the seasonal monsoon rains and the
embarrassment of working with a military junta notorious for the brutality
with which it suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988.
In a paper presented at a regional oil and gas conference in Bangkok earlier
this year, the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise spoke admiringly
of Amoco's logistical achievement in hauling thousands of tonnes of
equipment by helicopter and river barge to its concession in remote northern
Burma.
The military government, acutely aware of the country's energy deficit, has
to rely on foreign oil companies because of its own shortage of funds and
expertise. Power cuts are common, refineries are operating at 30 per cent of
capacity and petrol at the official price is rationed, although supplies are
freely available on the black market.
Government officials seem philosophical, however, about the departure of
some of the oil companies.
'That's the nature of oil exploration,' says Commander Thein Tun, a former
naval officer who heads the energy planning department. 'Companies are going
out and companies are coming in.
'This year the price of oil is not very encouraging to the explorers and so
most of the oil companies in the US have to retrench, and the oil companies
in Japan also have problems. We are quite aware that the infrastructure in
some areas is not adequate and that they have some logistical problems.'
The only bright spot of the last three years was in January this year when
Shell struck a barely commercial amount of gas at one of the three
exploratory wells on its concession in central Burma; the gas is now being
fed into the domestic grid.
Commander Thein Tun says the government is negotiating with Shell in the
hope that the company will take on four small blocks in a previously
explored area next to its existing concession.
The US companies Apache Oil and Trend International were awarded two blocks
each this year, and Kailis Resources of Australia took a block on the west
coast, but several onshore blocks remain open.
Offshore, meanwhile, the only activity is in three blocks operated by Texaco
and in the area to be exploited by Total.
Total's first job will be to appraise the gas discovered by MOGE in 1983.
The enterprise estimates that reserves exceed six trillion (million million)
cubic feet of gas, Burmese officials say, but other studies suggest a figure
of between 2.6 trillion and 3.5 trillion cu ft.
A quarter of the estimated 400m cu ft a day of gas produced could be used
inside Burma, and the rest is likely to be exported to Thailand by pipeline
following negotiations involving the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.
The proposed pipeline would cross an area where rebels opposed to the ruling
council are active, but Commander Thein Tun said his government had told the
Thais that the Burmese would look after the pipeline on the Burmese side of
the frontier.
'Maybe there are only one or two strongholds of the Karens (the rebels)
there,' he said; 'and the government is at the moment trying to talk with
the ethnic groups.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK government urged to rethink
milk co-op plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK GOVERNMENT was urged yesterday to think again before it went ahead
with its plans to replace the statutory Milk Marketing Board with a single
voluntary co-operative.
Continuing his fierce opposition to the proposed reforms of the MMB, Mr
Brian Smith, president of the Dairy Trade Federation, asked how a government
that believed in free market competition could consider such legislation.
'What a recipe for a price explosion]' he told the DTF annual lunch in
London. In a year when the regulatory bodies of other privatised industries
had had to act to curb price increases, 'government is proposing to create a
situation where a very dominant selling organisation of a product whose
supply is fixed by quota is to have no regulatory checks and balances at
all'.
Mr David Curry, junior minister of agriculture, said the most important
benefit of the reforms had been obscured by the 'hurly-burly of arguments
for and against a single voluntary co-operative'. The fact was that the
abolition of the MMB would mean that for the first time in 60 years
producers would be free to sell their milk to whomever they wanted.
'It is a major liberalisation,' he said, adding that many individual
producer would want to sell direct to dairy companies, while other producers
would undertake joint marketing initiatives.
He suggested that the DTF's regulatory fears were exaggerated. The MMB's
successor would come under the full scrutiny of the European Commission as
well as being 'subject to the full rigour of UK competition law'.
At a later press conference Mr Smith said he had not been reassured by Mr
Curry's remarks. DTF members were particularly worried about the proposed
co-operative taking over all the MMB's assets apart from Dairy Crest, its
wholly-owned dairy subsidiary, which is to be hived off. The concentration
of assets in one co-op would not help the formation of other bodies, he
suggested.
Mr Curry pointed out that the agriculture ministry had been besieged by
people clamouring to get out of the MMB rather than in. He would give no
timetable fo the legislation, only saying that it would appear 'relatively
soon'. But he stressed the importance of ending the statutory scheme before
it collapse of its own accord.

London's robusta COFFEE erased losses and established a fresh nine-month
high, tracking a similar turn-round in New York as the markets resumed their
upward trends after absorbing bouts of profit taking. Dealers said the mood
remained constructive. With little sign of origins selling aggressively into
the rally, there appears to be potential for the market to go even higher.
The January contract closed Dollars 12 higher at Dollars 947 a tonne after
peaking at Dollars 950. A hesitant tone was evident in LME BASE METALS in
the afternoon, with earlier falls halted by short covering ahead of a
possible bounce in prices once uncertainty over the US election outcome is
resolved. One broker's report suggested that Clinton's pledge to improve
infrastructure clearly suggested spending on transport and communications,
indicating support for copper, aluminium and steel markets. New York COTTON
futures hit the 2 cent daily limit after a report said that China's 1992-93
output was sharply down.

market protest

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S farmers yesterday ended a 48-hour lockout to protest against the
government's free market policies, which they claim threaten the survival of
small and medium-sized farms.
Three farmers' groups representing the majority of Argentina's 300,000
farmers on Monday stopped shipping cattle and grain to market, although they
maintained deliveries of perishable produce such as milk and vegetables.
Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an economist at Coninagro, a farm co-operative umbrella
organisation, said 'the government's policies are bankrupting small and
medium farms by forcing them to adjust without providing adequate credit'.
But Mr Marcelo Regunaga, agriculture and fisheries secretary, said the
protest 'will not have any effect on the government's economic policy'.
Farmers are already heavily indebted but are unable to refinance their loans
at reasonable terms. Mr Sarachu said banks only lend for a maximum 210 days
at high interest rates of 18 per cent a year in dollar terms.
He admitted, however, that Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister was
trying to improve farmers' profitability. Last week the government abolished
an 18 per cent fuel tax and reduced other federal taxes. That should raise
farm revenues by about USDollars 450m a year. If promised reductions in
provincial taxes were implemented, farmers would double that gain.
However, farmers' incomes are being squeezed by inflation of 20 per cent a
year, an overvalued exchange rate and the US-EC subsidy war that depresses
international prices. Unrest over the costs of economic adjustment and
falling incomes is rising throughout Argentina. The CGT trade union
confederation has called a general strike for next Monday.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big Chinese zinc imports
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S SURGING demand for metals is likely to have an even more profound
impact on the zinc market than it is having on the copper business,
according to a study from the Economist Intelligence Unit consultancy
organisation.
It suggests that Chinese zinc production will fall behind consumption and
leave by 1995 an apparent net import requirement of 117,000 tonnes,
equivalent to 2.4 per cent of last year's western consumption.
The EIU suggests that China's demand for imported copper will reach 167,000
tonnes in 1995, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of 1991's western consumption.
In contrast, China was in 1990 a net exporter of 12,000 tonnes of unwrought
refined zinc and imported only 21,000 tonnes of copper.
Mr Richard Vivian, author of the study, assumes that China's annual economic
growth during its present five-year plan (1991-95) will average more than 8
per cent compared with China's own forecast of 6 per cent and that rapid
expansion takes place in the first three years rather than the last three
years, as predicted by the Chinese.
Consequently, China's copper supply deficit is forecast to be 123,000 tonnes
this year and 139,000 tonnes in 1993. The supply deficit of refined zinc is
forecast to be 60,000 tonnes this year and 95,000 tonnes in 1993.
Mr Vivian says China needs some additional zinc refining capacity in order
to avoid the anomaly of surplus mine production alongside a deficit in
refined metal.
He points out that China's five-year plan gives priority to increasing
aluminium production so the country's soaring demand for this metal is not
expected to throw up a big import requirement.
However, even though China plans a 75 per cent increase in primary aluminium
output between 1991 and 1995, the EIU foresees only a 'modest' exportable
surplus of 77,000 tonnes by 1995. Next year, however, China's aluminium
imports could peak at 82,000 tonnes.
The study also predicts rapid growth in Chinese nickel consumption, which is
expected to result in a marked reversal of China's trade in refined metal
and nickel in concentrates (an intermediate product). This arises because a
big expansion of smelter capacity at Jinchuan came in 1991 whereas the
associated mine capacity expansion is scheduled for 1993. This means that
China at present has apparently a need to import concentrates but has an
exportable surplus of refined nickel. But by 1995 the study suggests China
could be importing 3,600 tonnes of refined nickel and exporting 4,000 tonnes
of concentrates. China's Metals and World Markets: Emerging opportunities

FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green laws 'may cost refiners
Dollars 50bn'
</HEADLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN OIL refiners might have to invest Dollars 50bn by the end of the
decade in meeting tighter environmental legislation, delegates at the
Financial Times Petroleum and Gas conference heard yesterday.
Mr Michael Brandt, manager of supply co-ordination and planning with Shell
Internationale in The Hague, told the conference, which focused on new
challenges for Europe's oil refining industries, that the cost to refiners
of meeting environmental legislation over the next three years was likely to
be between Dollars 12bn and Dollars 16bn. The eventual cost could be as high
as Dollars 50bn.
Mr Wilson Berry, managing director of manufacturing and marketing at Texaco,
also told delegates that investment in upgrading refineries, improving the
quality of products, and meeting tougher environmental standards could be as
much as Dollars 40bn.
Mr Berry warned that such investment would have to be made despite a
continued pessimistic outlook for European refiners, who had been hit hard
by worldwide recession resulting in a fall in demand for oil products. He
said that only modest increases in demand for gasoline and middle
distillates were likely through to the end of the century.
The trend for cutting capacity, he warned, had recently been reversed,
despite the excess of capacity in western Europe, and capacity was forecast
to increase again by between 2 and 3 per cent by 1995.
Mr Berry said new investment would have to be carefully-focused, and urged
closer collaboration between industry, government, the academic world and
public interest groups in tackling environmental issues.
Mr Brandt agreed that total oil product demand in Europe was likely to
remain fairly constant in the next ten years, as western economies became
less energy-intensive and decreased their reliance on oil. But demand for
lighter oil products of higher quality was likely to increase.
Speakers also expressed concern about the possible impact of a carbon tax.
Mr Saadallah al-Fathi, head of energy studies at the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, said the oil cartel was strongly
opposed to European Community proposals for a Dollars 3 a barrel tax, rising
to Dollars 10 a barrel.
He warned that such a tax would cut Dollars 30bn from Opec's revenues by the
end of the decade. 'Why should we develop new supplies if no one is going to
buy them? Even if it is only on a European level, the impact will be
tremendous on the organisation.' He added that the impact could be
multiplied up to five-fold if a tax was adopted by all the countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Mr al-Fathi also forecast that European reliance on Opec oil was likely to
increase by the year 2000 to 9.6m barrels a day, from 6.32m b/d in 1990, as
other sources declined. This would lift Opec's contribution to European oil
demand from 44.5 per cent to 61.5 per cent.
Mr Peter Gaffney, senior partner at Gaffney, Cline &amp; Associates, the energy
consultants, said the petroleum industry was already heavily taxed, compared
with coal and nuclear industries, which were often subsidised. He said on

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (5): Waiting in the wings - Profile of
Jean-Claude Juncker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 37, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker is a young man seemingly in no hurry to assume
what most Luxembourgers take for granted will be his destiny - to become
prime minister, perhaps for a decade or two.
The Grand Duchy's finance minister (he also holds the labour and social
security portfolio), Mr Juncker has enjoyed a fast-track ascent through the
ranks of government and of his Christian Social party - mirroring those of
the current premier, Mr Jacques Santer, and his predecessor Mr Pierre
Werner.
But Mr Santer, aged 55, appears in no great haste to hand over the reins of
power, and there has been widespread speculation that Mr Juncker might take
a sabbatical as an EC commissioner in Brussels, starting at the beginning of
next year.
The suggestion was made to the Luxembourg government by Mr Jacques Delors.
The Commission president was apparently impressed by Mr Juncker's
performance during Luxembourg's EC presidency in the first half of 1991,
when he helped steer negotiations on economic and monetary union (Emu)
towards agreement in Maastricht, and brokered agreement on harmonisation of
indirect taxes, a vital element of the single-market programme.
The putative commissioner is non-committal about his future: 'It's up to the
government to decide, and I am not privy to all its secrets.' If Mr Juncker
does not, after all, go to Brussels, it may be because there is no obvious
replacement capable of filling his shoes at the finance ministry.
Born in the small town of Redange-sur-Attert, on the Belgian border, he
inherited a taste for politics from his uncle, a Christian Social party MP
and mayor of the northern city of Ettelbruck.
Like many Luxembourg politicians, he has a degree in law (from Strasbourg),
but has never practised. After leaving university, his first job was as
parliamentary secretary for his party, and it was from this position that he
was abruptly brought into government in December 1980, at the age of 28.
Initially secretary of state (junior minister) for labour and social
security, Mr Juncker was promoted to full minister in 1984. He inherited the
finance ministry, one traditional stepping stone on the way to the
premiership, five years later, and another, the chairmanship of his party,
two years ago.
The nearest thing he has known to a setback to his career was a serious car
accident in 1989, in which he suffered a broken leg and collarbone.
According to those who know him well, the accident has enhanced Mr Juncker's
already strong sense of public duty, even mission, as well as his confidence
in his own ability to carry this out.
He presents a somewhat austere public image. Unlike many of his ministerial
colleagues, he is no social glad-hander, and is notably frank and direct in
conversation - something which has tended to make Mr Juncker a lightning rod
for criticism from the domestic political opposition.
Two years ago, when he introduced a realignment of personal income tax
rates, he was singled out for attack because certain taxpayers, who had been
favoured under the previous system, notably widows and divorced and
separated women, found themselves less well off.
Last December he was again in the front line, when Luxembourg decided to
implement a reshuffle of VAT rates, intended to meet post-1992 EC
requirements, a year ahead of schedule. But the personal criticism seems to
leave him unmoved.
Now, Mr Juncker has a new challenge - to bring home to Luxembourgers the
fact that the free-spending days of the 1980s are over, as the 1990 tax
reform and economic slowdown plunges the government budget into deficit for
the first time since 1984.
He says: 'I don't have the impression that (my) analysis has been much
listened to during the past few years. I don't think politicians, or
Luxembourgers themselves, have really understood that the fat years are over
 -or even members of the government.'
The message may be getting through, with Mr Juncker's draft budget for 1993,
which takes an axe to or defers several big public works projects, including
a new motorway, a national indoor sports centre and, most notably, the
controversial modern art museum designed by IM Pei.
It is a source of pride to Mr Juncker that Luxembourg is one of the handful
of EC members which meets the Maastricht criteria for membership of the
single-currency club, and he intends prudence to remain the watchword:
'Greece, Belgium and other countries show what happens when public spending
gets out of hand.'
He is a strong supporter of European union - and also of the EC Commission,
which he views as a vital bulwark for the smaller EC nations against being
steamrollered by their bigger neighbours.
Mr Juncker has little time for politicians who blame the Commission and its
supposed meddling for domestic problems. 'The Commission proposes, the
Council disposes,' he says, and to suggest otherwise is 'mediocre thinking'.
No wonder Mr Delors wants him in Brussels.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (6): Patient still healthy -
Predictions of banking gloom remain unfulfilled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT a year ago, analysts were predicting that a combination of
competitive, regulatory and economic were conspiring to send Luxembourg's
financial industry - the main pillar of its GDP and employer of nearly 10
per cent of its workforce - into a steady decline.
Evidence certainly pointed to tougher times. In 1990, profits in the banking
sector had been squeezed hard by competition and extensive provision against
problem loans. The number of new banks lining up to set up shop in the Grand
Duchy was tailing off and new competitors, such as Dublin, threatened growth
areas such as investment funds.
At the same time, Luxembourg was reckoned vulnerable to renewed efforts by
its EC partners to abolish the advantages offered by statutory banking
secrecy and the lack of a withholding tax on investment income for
non-residents.
Such moves, it was said, would dampen the attraction of Luxembourg for
private investors, just when their confidence in the stability of the Grand
Duchy's banks had been rocked by the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
Finally, banking in Luxembourg appeared to be pricing itself out of business
with a lethal combination of exorbitant salaries and inflated property
costs. Attempts to rein in personnel costs threatened to shatter one of the
sector's vital assets - an almost strike-free tradition.
Yet a year later, the patient stubbornly refuses to sicken. Many of the
troubling indicators - such as profitability - have turned upward again. New
regulatory constraints remain below the horizon. And the financial sector
seems to be achieving a leaner, more competitive profile.
Quality is more important than quantity, says Mr Pierre Jaans, director of
the Grand Duchy's regulatory body, the Luxembourg Monetary Institute (IML),
refering to the authorities' policy of encouraging only top-drawer financial
institutions to set up subsidiaries or branches in the country.
It is a policy which has gained more importance since the demise of BCCI in
July 1991. Mr Jaans argues that the fraud-ridden bank was a legacy of the
much more lax regulatory regime prevailing throughout Europe in the 1970s,
and that such a bank would not be given a licence today. For example, he
says the IML would not now accept a bank which had a Luxembourg holding
company as a leading shareholder.
Although Mr Jaans and his colleagues do not acknowledge it, observers
believe a discreet 'spring-cleaning' operation is under way as various
institutions with connections to BCCI or not seeming to meet the new
standards of transparency on which the IML insists are politely invited to
take their business elsewhere.
Other banks (such as the loss-making subsidiary of Britain's TSB), have quit
Luxembourg for a variety of reason's, while the ranks of Scandinavian and
German regional banks have been thinned by mergers.
Even so, at the end of August, Luxembourg boasted 192 banks, not far short
of the 200-mark viewed by Mr Jaans as a rough natural limit. Recent
newcomers have included several institutions from Germany and Italy, and a
new contingent from South Korea.
The new arrivals have found a more hospitable economic climate. While growth
in the aggregate balance sheet total of Luxembourg banks slowed to a crawl
in 1991, net profits increased by nearly 25 per cent, to LFr23.8bn,
practically their record level of 1989, even after extensive creation of
reserves and provisions.
Just as importantly, the IML's annual report for 1991 records a slow but
steady move away from reliance on interest income, where margins are being
squeezed by competition, as a source of revenue.
The share of interest income has declined as a proportion of total gross
results from 80 to 73.5 per cent since 1987, thanks in large part to growth
in commission income and profits from securities dealing.
Nor does the investment fund sector seem to have suffered unduly from the
competition. During the first eight months of 1992, the number of funds
established in Luxembourg grew from 898 to 983, and their aggregate net
assets soared by 30 per cent to 5,200bn francs.
Meanwhile, banks have been tightening their belts. Employment in the
financial sector, which grew by more than 6,000 between 1984 and 1990, has
if anything declined since then. Redundancies in the course of mergers or
restructuring efforts have become a regular occurrence this year, and most
banks not actively shedding jobs are no longer hiring new staff.
This means a difficult environment for trade unions as they seek to wrest
concessions from Luxembourg Bankers' Association (ABBL) negotiators in a
long wrangle over a new employment structure for the sector.
The banks want changes in a complex and inflexible salary structure which
will allow them to tailor pay more to responsibility and performance, and
less to educational qualifications and seniority.
The unions, which feared this would be used simply to lower pay levels,
called a one-day strike last year which attracted some 11 per cent of the
total workforce. Afterwards the two sides agreed to work out a compromise
based on standards prevailing in rival financial centres, but this has
proved elusive. Last February's deadline for agreement is long gone and
banks and unions remain far apart.
While there is no immediate threat of unwelcome new EC rules which might
discourage private banking, the government is slowly moving toward new rules
in areas such as tax fraud. This, and stiff measures against money
laundering, may erode the edges of banking secrecy, but many Luxembourg
bankers say that would be no great disaster for the sector.
It is appropriate that the ABBL's president, Mr Charles Ruppert of the
Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, began his career as a teacher. Education is now
the watchword within the industry, with the association leading an effort
designed to ensure it is expertise and quality of service which makes
Luxembourg stand out from its rivals.
The Luxembourg Institute for Training in Banking was established by the ABBL
in 1990 to co-ordinate and expand its training activities in areas ranging
from apprenticeship-style courses to language classes (and work experience
programmes for bankers from eastern Europe).
The Luxembourg Banking Academy was created earlier this year, with help from
institutions in Britain, France and Germany, to offer courses enabling
specialists to become all-round bankers. If the initiative is successful,
the programme may be transformed into a fully-fledged MBA.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (3): Volumes need to rise - The Stock
Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TINY Luxembourg stock exchange hopes to evolve into a real centre for
the trading of securities, building on its success as a centre for their
listing.
The exchange, located in unprepossessing premises above a shopping arcade in
the Grand Duchy's capital, has already proved that it is a listing centre to
be reckoned with: the bourse is 'home' to more than 10,000 securities, most
of them international and many denominated in some 20 currencies other than
the Luxembourg franc.
Eighty-eight per cent of the world's outstanding Eurobonds are listed in
Luxembourg, with the exception of Euro-Mark bonds, which tend to be listed
in Germany.
The bourse also lists up to 95 per cent of all the bonds denominated in
Ecus, barring the big British and French sovereign issues which were made
partly to press their own countries' case for capturing more Ecu trading.
Luxembourg has also capitalised quickly on the trend towards investment
funds, listing 1,680 domestic and foreign funds.
Having put itself on the map as a listing centre, Luxembourg now wants to
boost the modest volume of trading that takes place on its floor. In fact,
one important strategy - new computer-assisted trading - will mean that
traders no longer have to be physically present on the trading floor itself.
The new system, which is being introduced in phases for some types of
securities and which has met with some delays since its introduction in
April 1991, means that there is no difference between trades done from a
trading station on the floor itself and those executed from the premises of
a bourse member's offices elsewhere in Luxembourg.
The bourse has also reformed the fee structure, in an attempt to attract
newcomers to the exchange's current list of 84 members and thereby boost
liquidity. Instead of taking a percentage of the commission income generated
by members, as before, the stock exchange has started to charge flat fees,
which means that members will pay relatively less the more they use the
exchange as a trading vehicle.
At the same time, the previously mandatory schedule of fees which banks and
brokers charged clients has now become a 'recommended' table, enabling
market parties to decide among themselves what the fee level should be.
Another plan is for the lengthening of trading hours for the most actively
traded categories of securities. At present, trading is limited to between
10.45 am and 1.15 pm. A decision on which securities will fall under the
expanded hours has not yet been taken, but the most likely candidates are
the most active Luxembourg franc and Ecu bonds, as well as the more
international companies' shares, such as Arbed, the Luxembourg steel group;
Shell; and Philips, the Dutch electronics company.
Eventually, Luxembourg hopes to be able to offer continuous trading in key
listed securities. At the moment, it operates a 'rotated' market, in which
each security is called in succession, with trading taking place only when
the bond or share has actually been called.
Together, the bourse's various initiatives are designed to lure
'off-exchange' transactions between banks and brokers back on to the
Luxembourg exchange.
'We realise that quite of lot of transactions will still continue off the
exchange,' says Mr Edmond Israel, the stock exchange's chairman. 'But the
bourse is meant to be a marketplace, and that means that we need to increase
our trading volume.'
Trading volume in 1991 totalled LFr 34.85bn (Pounds 700m), a rise of 32.5
per cent on 1990, mainly reflecting a higher level of trading in
fixed-interest securities. Volume in the 1992 first half rose by a more
modest 5.5 per cent to LFr19.1bn, compared with LFr18.1bn a year earlier.
Despite these increases, Luxembourg's is still one of Europe's smallest
bourses when measured by turnover alone. Unlike many other exchanges, its
turnover is heavily weighted towards bond trading, reflecting the country's
small pool of listed corporations.
Of the 1991 turnover figure, just one-seventh was generated by stocks and
shares. And of the top 10 traded shares, two are foreign - Philips and Royal
Dutch / Shell. All told, the bourse numbers only 70 domestic shares - the
biggest of which are Arbed and the country's banks - and 196 foreign shares.
Mr Israel says that the bourse hopes to increase the number of stocks and
shares, both domestic and foreign. But he adds that every European stock
exchange should identify and emphasise its strengths and areas of
specialisation, which, in the case of Luxembourg, are bonds and investment
funds. 'I don't believe that it is wise, or even possible, to do
everything,' he says.
'We have to be realistic,' Mr Israel explains. 'The size of the country is
such that the international part of the bourse, particularly the
international bonds, naturally far exceeds the Luxembourg part, particularly
the domestic stocks and shares sector.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (4): No qualms over union - Concerns
focus on the location of the European central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE SOME people in Britain or Germany, Luxembourgers don't worry about
the prospect of giving up their currency for the greater good of European
monetary and economic union (Emu).
After all, nobody under the age of 70 can remember the days before
Luxembourg entered into a monetary and economic union with neighbouring
Belgium in 1922. For nearly three generations, Belgium's central bank has
determined Luxembourg's monetary policy. As a result, Belgian francs have
become fully interchangeable with Luxembourg francs throughout the Grand
Duchy.
When shopping, Luxembourgers do not know or care whether they are paying
with Luxembourg or Belgian francs: the two currencies look different but are
of equal value.
Still, to many people in Luxembourg, a single European currency is
preferable to the link with the Belgian franc. Memories of the Belgian
franc's surprise devaluation in 1982 - when Belgium failed to warn the
Luxembourgers that their own currency would also be worth 8 per cent less
than the day before - have not entirely faded.
'The advantage for us is that we'll have a governor in the new European
central bank, and that we'll have a say in policy as well as a stake in its
capital,' says Mr Jean Asselborn, leader of the Socialists in parliament.
The only element of Emu that does cause excitement in Luxembourg, at least
at the higher levels of the financial community and the political elite, is
the question of where the European central bank will be located.
Luxembourg has staked its claim, based on a 1965 agreement; but many other
European cities have put forward their own candidacies, and Luxembourg's
best chance seems to lie in deadlock between the big EC members.
Whatever the location of the European central bank, tiny Luxembourg, with
its heavy reliance on foreign workers and foreign exports, has little choice
but to look to Europe for its future. 'A Luxembourg without Europe or
Europeans is not possible,' Mr Asselborn says.
Not surprisingly, then, Luxembourg had few fundamental qualms about having
ratified the Maastricht Treaty in July, making it the first EC member to do
so. Although controversy surrounded the move, the debate concerned
procedural matters, focusing on the question of exactly when the Luxembourg
constitution must be changed in order to take account of Maastricht, rather
than on the merits of greater union in monetary, financial and security
matters.
Opposition Liberals argued that elections had to be called before
ratification could take place, in line with the normal procedure for any
planned change in the constitution.
The government, a coalition of the Christian Social party (comparable with
Christian Democrats in other European countries) and the Socialists, said
the changes to the constitution could wait until 1994, the date of the next
scheduled elections.
This was because the one provision in the treaty requiring a change to the
constitution - the right of EC nationals to vote in the local and European
elections of EC countries - will not come into force for Luxembourg until at
least the second half of the 1990s.
The treaty's granting of voting rights to EC nationals is a sensitive matter
in Luxembourg, where more than a third of the population is foreign. In the
capital alone, up to 45 per cent of residents are foreign, most of them from
elsewhere in the EC.
In a country as small as Luxembourg, local government is just one step below
national government, lending much weight and significance to town politics.
'The reality behind municipal elections is very different from country to
country in the EC,' says the mayor of Luxembourg City, Mrs Lydie
Wurth-Polfer.
The issue is so contentious in the Grand Duchy that the framers of the
Maastricht treaty said postponements would be possible for countries facing
special problems. This assurance, drafted specifically for Luxembourg, means
that, although foreigners could theoretically be allowed to vote in 1999
(the first local elections after the scheduled change in the constitution),
they may not be able to exercise this right until the next poll in 2005.
Similarly, Portuguese, Italians and other non-Luxembourgers from EC states
will not be able to vote in elections for the European parliament until 1999
at the earliest.
Thanks to its externally-orientated economy - exports account for nearly 85
per cent of GDP - Luxembourg will not have to make wrenching changes to
prepare for the single European market. But it will have to adapt to new
challenges, not least the opening up of public procurement tenders to other
EC competitors.
In practice, smaller Luxembourg companies, which were used to focusing on
their own home market, will probably find greater competition from companies
in the 'Saar-Lor-Lux' region, which embraces Germany's Saarland and parts of
Rheinland-Pfalz, France's Lorraine, the Belgian province of Luxembourg, and
Luxembourg itself. In this region of 6m people, Luxembourg not only forms
the geographic nucleus but also exerts the greatest economic attraction,
because of its prosperity.
Mr Etienne Reuter, the head of operational consultancy at Arthur Andersen in
Luxembourg and project manager of a study into medium-sized companies in the
Saar-Lor-Lux region, says: 'Construction companies in the region find
Luxembourg attractive, because of its high purchasing and the government's
active investment programme.' To compete, Luxembourg builders will have to
look beyond their national borders for opportunities in neighbouring
regions.
Mr Reuter believes the region holds big economic potential for companies in
all four countries, but says 'national borders are still a problem for
smaller companies.' More and better information is needed to help companies
throughout the Saar-Lor-Lux to take advantage of the single European market
on their doorstep.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (1): Prosperous little oasis - As parts
of Europe plunge into economic and political uncertainty, Luxembourg remains
an island of calm, its size and flexibility enabling it to stay a step ahead
of its neighbours. Can it maintain this position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SMALL WOULD seem to be beautiful for little Luxembourg on the eve of the
European single market. The European Community's smallest member is also its
most prosperous.
And at a time when ethnic tensions and a distrust of foreigners are on the
increase in other parts of Europe, Luxembourg is an oasis of calm, even
though nearly a third of its residents and half of its workers are from
other countries. The Grand Duchy's remarkable process of integration and
acceptance has been assisted by the fact that most of the foreigners are
fellow west Europeans and fellow Catholics from Italy and Portugal, and that
unemployment is negligible at 1.7 per cent.
As the EC's only land-locked member it has always been forced to ply trade
with the rest of the Twelve: in a single European market of 360m consumers,
Luxembourg and its population of 400,000, representing just 0.1 per cent of
the total, will benefit even further from the country's location and its
multi-lingual skills.
But being small is usually not an advantage when it comes to wielding power
and Luxembourg remains vulnerable to European and world events beyond its
control.
Its status as a founding member of the EC in the late 1950s gave it
immediate influence out of all proportion to its size - a mere 57km wide and
82km long. In the original Community of the Six, the Grand Duchy had little
difficulty in making its voice heard. Nor has it found itself badly
outmanoeuvred or outnumbered since the six became 12. But the EC'
enlargement to perhaps as many as 18 states threatens to dilute Luxembourg's
power.
A test case for the future is the siting of the proposed European central
bank. Politicians and financiers say the bank belongs by rights to
Luxembourg, because of a 1965 agreement that it should become home to the
EC's financial and judicial institutions.
Mr Pierre Werner, the former prime minister, elder statesman and the man
whose Werner Report helped set the EC firmly on the road to monetary union
in 1970, says: 'We are duty-bound to claim the bank, because we would
otherwise abandon positions which had been clearly established. You can't
simply sweep the 1965 agreement aside.'
Unfortunately for Luxembourg the decision is clearly a question of politics.
Luxembourg's best chance of winning the bank is its emergence as a
compromise candidate to break any deadlock between Germany, France and
Britain.
Luxembourg is keen to have the bank, partly to crown its achievements of the
past two decades - the creation of a thriving banking and financial centre,
which compensated for the decline of the once all-important steel industry.
Since 1992, the number of banks in Luxembourg has increased fivefold to 192,
providing thousands of new jobs, generating a sizeable amount of government
revenue and making the Grand Duchy a financial centre in its own right,
albeit a specialised one focused on niche areas.
The collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which
was legally domiciled in Luxembourg but which carried out the bulk of its
activities elsewhere, has not, it seems, had a lasting effect on the Grand
Duchy's reputation. BCCI came to Luxembourg at the start of the banking boom
in the early 1970s, and the country's regulatory body, the Institut
Monetaire Luxembourgeois, says a bank of this sort would not be granted a
licence today.
Officials admit that they cannot claim credit for having foreseen the rise
in banking. The reasons for the rapid growth, they say, must be sought in
other countries, principally the US, whose tax-rule changes in the 1960s
created the Eurocurrency market. Banks flocked to Luxembourg to take
advantage of its lack of stamp duty and withholding tax.
But Luxembourg is being too modest. The country has repeatedly shown that it
is capable of moving quickly to exploit a niche market.
One example is the investment fund market. Within a month of the EC
Commission's issuing its directive on European-wide investment funds in
1988, Luxembourg's parliament had revised its domestic laws to reflect the
change, enabling the country to steal a march on larger financial centres.
Today, Luxembourg is home to more than 980 investment funds. A similar case
of niche thinking is Luxembourg's commercial satellite and television
sector.
Another explanation for the country's success is its bank secrecy laws,
which make it a magnet for the wealth of Germans, Dutch, French and
Belgians, who like to keep their savings in a place which they can reach
easily and quickly by car but which is out of bounds to their own countries'
tax authorities.
Flushed with the success of this type of private banking, Luxembourg has no
intention of sacrificing its banking laws on the altar of European unity and
harmonisation. Mr Pierfranco de Vita, managing director of Chase Manhattan
Bank in Luxembourg, says: 'The government has given clear signals that it
would keep Luxembourg's special status alive within the EC.'
But Luxembourg can expect to come under further pressure from its EC
partners, who would like nothing more than to claw back lost savings.
Although Luxembourg will probably manage to fight sweeping changes for years
to come, there is a realisation that the niches which it has been able to
exploit because of differences in national laws are bound to dwindle if
European integration gathers pace.
For this reason, the new buzz-word in Luxembourg financial circles is
'training'. The idea is to refine and boost skills and expertise, so that
the country remains attractive, whatever the future of European regulations.
'The advantages which Luxembourg has will be reduced over time. What must
remain, however, is a high degree of know-how,' says Mr Francois Colling,
leader of the Christian Social party in parliament. 'Look at investment
funds. Why do we have so many here? It has nothing to do with bank secrecy,
but everything to do with specialising in the sector.'
Being small, in other words, means being nimble and flexible enough to keep
one step ahead of more powerful neighbouring countries. So far, Luxembourg
has shown that it is capable of running races with the giants of Europe and
beating them over certain distances and in certain categories. The
challenge, however, is to repeat the feat not just once, but year after
year.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (2): Banking takes up steel slack -
Diversification has helped keep the economy in good shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARADOXICALLY, the strength of the Luxembourg economy in 1992 is probably
best illustrated by the difficulties facing its single biggest employer, the
Arbed steel group.
Thanks to a policy of economic diversification pursued since the big steel
crisis of the mid-1970s, the economy continues to perform well, in spite of
the malaise in steel.
Banking, plastics, rubber and new industries, such as glass production, are
clearly helping to compensate for the downturn in the steel market, which is
hurting not only Arbed but also steel producers across Europe.
The figures testify to the achievements of diversification. Growth in
industrial production held steady at 2 per cent in the 1992 first half, in
spite of the slowdown in demand for steel; and overall economic growth for
1992 is forecast to match the 3.7 per cent increase seen in 1991. Growth in
1993 is projected to be only slightly slower at 3.5 per cent.
Inflation, currently around 3 per cent, has been kept in bounds, defying a
two-point rise in value-added tax (VAT) to 15 per cent, carried out to bring
Luxembourg more into line with its EC partners.
All in all, Luxembourg can boast that it is one of the few signatories to
the Maastricht treaty that already fulfils all five criteria for economic
and monetary union. As a small, open economy, however, it remains
susceptible to weaknesses imported from the outside, particularly from
Germany, its biggest trading partner.
Still, the ease with which Luxembourg has managed - so far - to ride out the
current steel crisis is a far cry from the the country's heavy dependence,
20 years ago, on iron and steel which made it acutely vulnerable to the
steel business cycle.
'At the peak in 1974, Luxembourg was, in per capita terms, the biggest steel
producer the world has ever seen, producing 17 tonnes per head of population
per year, against only half a tonne for the US,' says Mr Michel Waringo, a
director of Banque Generale de Luxembourg.
Since then, Arbed's size has been severely reduced, and the resulting slack
in the economy has been taken up by the banking sector. In nearly 20 years
since the steel industry shrank, the number of banks has increased fivefold
to 192, giving the tiny Luxembourg capital more banks per square metre than
any other city in the world.
The number of people employed by the steel industry has dropped sharply to
just 8,000, from 28,000 in 1974, while the arrival of scores of new banks in
the 1980s has increased employment in the banking sector to 15,000. Overall,
services now generate 65 per cent of GDP, with banking alone accounting for
15 per cent, while traditional industry makes up 25 per cent of GDP - a
near-reversal of the old ratios.
'It would be dangerous to go below this 25 per cent level,' says Mr Georges
Schmit, an industry specialist at the economic affairs ministry. 'Luxembourg
paid a heavy price in the past for relying on one sector, and policy now is
aimed at a balanced, diversified economic structure.'
Mr Lucien Jung, managing director of Fedil, the Luxembourg industry
federation, believes that a target level of 30 to 35 per cent would be
healthier for the economy. Individual investments by companies in the
banking and financial services tend to be lighter than those in
manufacturing industry, making them more transient and less dependable.
'If they (the banks) can earn 10 per cent more in London or Zurich, they
leave. But if an industrial company makes an investment of LFr1bn (Pounds
20m), it's bound not to leave so quickly,' he argues.
The banking community counters this argument by pointing to the recent heavy
investment by foreign banks in new, purpose-built premises and their
new-found efforts to step up the training of staff.
The ultimately successful move away from an over-reliance on steel was
achieved by the use of what has come to be known as the 'Luxembourg model'.
Under this tripartite approach between industry, government and the unions,
Arbed promised not to push through forced redundancies, the unions pledged
not to strike, and the government agreed to help promote industrial
restructuring.
Another part of the model, still at the country's disposal, is the use of
'short-time' working schedules to bridge the peaks and troughs in demand at
otherwise healthy companies. The latest company to introduce short-time is
Villeroy &amp; Boch, the German-based manufacturer of porcelain, tiles and
sanitary fittings, which employs 1,400 people at a tableware factory in
Luxembourg.
Some 1,300 of these employees were put on short-time schedules when the
factory was closed for two weeks in September and October. Similar measures
are expected later in November and December, to help the factory weather a
drop in demand on recession-plagued foreign markets. Government funds,
raised by a 'solidarity levy' on taxpayers, ensure that employees receive up
to 80 per cent of their normal full-time salary while production is shut
down.
Short-time work schedules are one of the reasons why Luxembourg has such a
low rate of unemployment. Only 2,800 people, or about 1.7 per cent of the
working population, are registered as out of work, putting the country close
to achieving the near-impossible feat of full employment.
But Mr Schmit, of the economics ministry, points out that national
statistics are perhaps inappropriate for gauging Luxembourg's labour market.
Purely national statistics do not include the 44,000 cross-border commuters
who stream into the Grand Duchy every working day from Germany, France and
Belgium, filling jobs for which there are simply no more Luxembourgers
available.
This heavy dependence on non-Luxembourg labour - including foreigners living
within Luxembourg and those living just outside - puts the country in a
unique position within the Twelve. Forty-five per cent of jobs in Luxembourg
are held by non-nationals, mainly immigrants from Italy and Portugal and
their children.
For the time being, Luxembourg is finding enough foreign workers to keep its
factories and offices running. But in the longer term, its reliance on
crucial non-national labour is a worry for corporate recruiters and
government policy-makers.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Royal Trust down CDollars 243m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL TRUST, the Canadian financial services group, hopes to shake off
financial problems which have dogged it in recent years with a package of
measures which include a deep dividend cut, an equity issue and a special
loan-loss reserve.
The Toronto-based company said all its operations, with the exception of
those in the UK, were profitable.
But write-downs on discontinued operations and the new bad-debt provision
pushed the company to a third-quarter loss of CDollars 243m (USDollars
195m), or CDollars 1.68 a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 33m, or
10 cents, a year earlier.
Royal Trust's share price closed down more than 15 per cent to CDollars 3.60
on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.
Its problems stem mainly from a disastrous expansion outside Canada in the
late 1980s, including the acquisition of Dow Chemical's financial services
arm and the purchase of a string of US west coast savings and loan
institutions.
The Seattle-based S&amp;Ls, brought together under Pacific First Bank, were sold
last week for CDollars 663m.
Third-quarter earnings include a write-down of CDollars 73m on the
investment in Pacific First. However, Royal said the sale would strengthen
its capital base by CDollars 195m, lifting its capital-to-assets ratio from
9.4 per cent to 12 per cent.
The quarterly dividend has been halved to 5 cents a share and the board has
approved a CDollars 200m equity issue. Terms will be announced later, but
Royal said its controlling shareholder, Trilon Financial, had agreed to take
up its share.

expansion in Greece

<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the US soft drinks maker, is expanding in Greece through the
acquisition of Best Foods, a northern Greek manufacturer of snacks, for a
reported Dr3.2bn (Dollars 16m).
Best Foods, based in Thessaloniki, produces corn curls and other snacks for
the local market. Sales this year are projected to rise from Dr1.7bn to
Dr2.5bn with profits increasing from Dr80m to Dr250m.
The acquisition was made through 7-Up Netherlands, a European subsidiary of
PepsiCo. Earlier this year, PepsiCo took control of Tasty Foods, another
Greek snack manufacturer, following the merger of the US company's European
operations with General Mills.
Pepsico entered the Greek market three years ago with the takeover of Ivi, a
struggling Athens bottler which produced Pepsi Cola and 7-Up, together with
local soft drink brands and mineral water.
After cutting losses in 1991 to Dr2.6bn, down from Dr4bn the previous year,
PepsiCo-Ivi expects to make a modest profit this year. It plans to invest
Dr7bn in the next two years on modernising production and strengthening
distribution, notably among the Aegean islands.
Although sales are up by around 6 per cent this year, PepsiCo-Ivi's share of
the Greek soft drinks market has remained at around 18 per cent. However,
Loutraki Water, the company's leading brand, claims to have increased its
share of Greece's growing mineral water market to 35 per cent.

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELEFONICA de Argentina, Argentina's largest privatised telephone company,
has almost doubled its profits, according to Mr Jose Bustamante, the
company's president.
He said preliminary figures showed an 88 per cent rise in net income to
Dollars 222m for the year to September, against Dollars 118m in 1991. He
added that sales rose more slowly, to Dollars 1.63bn against Dollars 1.037bn
last year.
Telefonica, which is managed by Telefonica Internacional, an arm of Spain's
state-owned telephone company, was privatised in November 1991. It has a
monopoly on services to the southern region of Argentina, including half of
Buenos Aires, for at least seven years.
Profits have climbed due to indexation of rates and an exchange rate that
further magnifies profits. However, the 1991 figures are slightly
understated because they cover an 11-month accounting period.
Telefonica, like Telecom Argentina, the smaller privatised company which
covers the northern half of the country, has also raised profits by
tightening up management, sacking employees and rapidly installing more
lines. But, despite high charges and aggressive investment policies, service
remains mediocre.
Telecom, which has not made any preliminary statement on its 1992
performance, is expected to report an even stronger rise in net income.
Telecom's profits rose to Dollars 117.3m in the first three quarters of the
year on sales of Dollars 862m, against Dollars 53.3m in the 11 months to
September 1991 on sales of Dollars 880m.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Du Pont faces tough test of
fibre - The potential buyers of its carpet capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT'S swap of chemical assets with Imperial Chemical Industries, which
was given the green light last month by the European Commission, could
provide a few headaches for the US group.
A condition of the deal was that Du Pont dispose of 12,000 tonnes of
newly-acquired nylon carpet fibre production.
Du Pont says it has already had a couple of unsolicited expressions of
interest about the capacity, but given the sorry state of the west European
carpet fibres industry, it is far from clear how serious these might be.
Falling demand and substitution by other materials, in particular
polypropylene, has led to gross over-capacity among carpet fibre
manufacturers.
Nylon carpet fibres come in two types. The most common is continuous
filament, while the other is discontinuous or staple fibre. ICI's former
plant at Oestringen, in Germany, which manufactures both types, is the most
likely candidate for disposal, although Du Pont says the final decision is
yet to be made.
European capacity currently exceeds demand. Sales of carpet filament last
year were 164,000 tonnes, compared with a capacity of 230,000 tonnes.
Meanwhile, demand for staple fibre was only 138,000 tonnes, compared with a
capacity of 180,000 tonnes, according to the Brussels-based International
Committee of Rayon and Synthetic Filament (CIRFS). About 70 per cent of
production is used in carpets.
Europe is a net exporter of both types, but has little chance of reducing
over-capacity by raising sales abroad, says Mr Jean-Louis Juvet,
director-general of CIRFS.
The fall in demand has been created not just by consumers putting off
purchases. Large groups, such as department stores, are not replacing floor
coverings, says Mr Stan Davies, an independent consultant. Demand in the
automotive market is also depressed.
Meanwhile, although nylon has 39 per cent of the fibre market for textile
floor-coverings, polypropylene has captured 36 per cent and is shortly
expected to overtake nylon. In addition, nylon is under competition from
cheap wool.
Operating rates in the nylon carpet fibres industry remain terrible, says Mr
Juvet. In filament, only 74 per cent of capacity was running last year,
while staple production was running at 83 per cent. Analysts believe no
European nylon carpet fibre manufacturer is making money.
Casting around for possible purchases of Du Pont's surplus nylon fibre
production, analysts have come up with France's Rhone-Poulenc. The group has
just linked with Snia of Italy to form a joint-venture which has about 15
per cent of the European continuous filament market and about 30 per cent of
the European staple fibre market.
However, Rhone-Poulenc is in the middle of an asset disposal programme aimed
at cutting borrowings by FFr3bn (Dollars 564m) this year. The group's target
is to reduce its debt to equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to
close to 0.5 in 1993.
Other candidates include Germany's BASF. The group has substantial carpet
fibre operations in the US, with four plants and an annual capacity of
100,000 tonnes a year. It has no production in Europe and might be
interested in creating a global presence.
Akzo, the Dutch company, is another possibility. The group has limited nylon
carpet capacity. However, Mr Syb Bergsma, a member of Akzo's management
committee, said in August that its carpet operations were unprofitable. The
company is reducing production and cutting 240 jobs. Analysts expect Akzo to
pull out of the market, if it can find a buyer.
Small to medium-sized candidates include Beaulieu of Belgium, which has
about 12 per cent of the continuous filament market, and Aquafil and
Radicci, both of Italy, which respectively have 11 per cent and 9 per cent
of the west European market.
Further potential buyers include actual carpetmakers. Mr Davies believes
German carpet companies might group together to make a bid. This would free
them from the threat of Du Pont's potentially dominant position.
However, the commission would need to be convinced of the need to sell to
the carpet makers. Competition officials indicated last week that the
capacity and related facilities should be sold to a single competitor, which
ought to be a fibres manufacturer.
A further possibility is a management buy-out by former ICI fibres marketing
employees, says Mr Davies. Their jobs would be most vulnerable in the event
of rationalisation, he explains.
Outside the EC, the most likely is Allied Signal, one of the US's largest
industrial groups. It already imports fibres equivalent to about 9 per cent
of European filament market. And this summer it started a significant
expansion of its industrial fibres operations with construction of a new
Dollars 220m plant in France.
But some analysts believe it may prove difficult for Du Pont to find a buyer
at all. The group has undertaken to make 'best endeavours' to dispose of the
12,000 tonnes within 12 months of the completion of its deal with ICI.
Analysts, however, are far from convinced anybody would want to expand their
share of the market at the moment.
If Du Pont fails to find a buyer, the commission says it will extend the
deadline. But the US group may end up with all of ICI's fibres capacity in
spite of the best efforts of Sir Leon Brittan, the commission's
vice-president, and his trust-busters.

DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, blamed lower shipments and high staff
severance costs for a third-quarter loss of CDollars 14.7m (USDollars
11.8m), or 27 cents a share. This compares with a loss of CDollars 10.1m, or
24 cents, a year earlier.
Steel price pressures and a four-week shutdown at the company's iron ore
mines in Quebec added to the loss. Overseas shipments were off sharply in
the quarter, and revenues dipped 6 per cent to CDollars 468m.
The nine-month loss was CDollars 98.2m, compared with CDollars 23.5m a year
earlier.
Dofasco expects the fourth quarter to be slow, although flat-rolled products
are showing some improvements.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RAND Merchant Bank Holdings (RMBH), one of South Africa's top three merchant
banks, has been granted a listing on the Johannesburg stock exchange from
November 25, offering investors their first chance to invest directly in the
company.
The listing follows the merger earlier this year of Rand Merchant Bank with
Momentum Life, a local insurance company. As a result of the merger RMBH
holds 77 per cent of Momentum, which in turn owns 100 per cent of Rand
Merchant Bank (RMB), the operating arm of RMBH.
Together with UAL, the merchant banking arm of the Nedcor group, and
Standard Merchant Bank, RMBH is one of South Africa's main merchant banks,
with a reputation for innovation and entrepreneurial flair. RMB was
instrumental in establishing the South African futures market in the
mid-1980s.
The listing also offers investors exposure to Momentum, considered by the
market to have good recovery potential in the hands of RMB. In particular,
it is thought that RMB will able to improve returns on the R9.2bn (Dollars
308bn) assets Momentum had under management at the end of June.
The Johannesburg exchange has granted a listing for 55m shares, which
analysts believe will trade at about R10 each, giving the group a market
capitalisation of more than R500m. No capital is being raised through the
listing, which is designed to make shares available to the investment
community and to open the way for future funding.
Currently, directors and management hold 46.3 per cent of RMBH, the Sage
financial services group holds 26.2 per cent, Absa 13.1 per cent, and other
institutions and individuals have 14.4 per cent. Absa, South Africa's
largest bank by market capitalisation, is seeking to sell its stake as it
already possesses merchant banking activities in the form of Absa Merchant
Bank.
Mr Louis Shill, Sage chairman, said yesterday that his company's stake in
RMBH was a strategic investment which it intended to hold.
RMBH will be listed in the insurance sector, reflecting the fact that about
70 per cent of group assets are in insurance, and the generally better
ratings in this sector than in banking.
It disclosed attributable profits of R37m in the year June 1992. Analysts
believe, however, that under the terms of an exemption under the South
African Banks Act, RMBH could have transferred as much as a third of its
profits to internal reserves in the year.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Textiles company tries to
recapture a former industrial glory - Arvind will soon be one of the world's
largest suppliers of denim cloth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the outskirts of Ahmedabad, a dusty city in north-western India,
engineers are fitting out a new textiles mill with state-of-the-art
machinery from Germany and Japan. Bullock carts regularly roll past the site
which will soon be one of the world's largest suppliers of denim cloth and
also a large producer of material for shirts.
This factory is the pride and joy of Mr Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director of
Arvind Mills, the biggest employer in Ahmedabad and one of India's largest
textiles groups.
Mr Lalbhai is trying to win back for Ahmedabad a touch of its former
industrial glory. Once known as the Manchester of the east for its vast
cotton mills, Ahmedabad has long since lost its pre-eminence in textiles
following decades of declining investment.
Mr Lalbhai is determined that Arvind, which was founded by his
great-grandfather and is controlled by his family, should not follow other
companies into liquidation. 'We are very strongly focused on export markets.
And we have modernised, unlike some other mills which have made the same
products on the same machines for 50 years.'
Other large Indian textiles groups are also responding to the government's
economic reform programme by investing in export businesses.
They have seen how decades of over-dependence on a protected low-margin
domestic market has sapped the industry's competitive strengths. Now that
the government is promoting exports, they are trying to put a priority on
overseas markets for the first time in decades.
But few companies are as single-minded in the pursuit of exports as Arvind.
It is investing Rs6bn (Dollars 211.1m) in an attempt to increase textiles
exports from Rs500m in the year to March 1992 to Rs5bn by the year to March
1994, when fully 60 per cent of turnover is planned to come from overseas
sales.
It has this year signed a deal with Cluett, Peabody, the US clothing group,
for the joint manufacture of shirts. Within the next year, it is planning to
become the first Indian textiles group with sales offices overseas - in New
York, London and Hong Kong.
Mr Lalbhai started preparing these moves long before the reformist
government ofprime minister Narasimha Rao took office last year. Arvind's
export programme dates back to the mid-1980s when Mr Lalbhai decided the
group risked going into decline if it continued to rely on low-margin,
low-quality domestic markets.
His first reaction was to diversify - into electronics and other growth
industries. But these moves have brought only modest success. More important
was the decision to upgrade textiles production by greatly increasing
exports.
Mr Lalbhai believes India has considerable competitive advantages in
textiles, including abundant raw cotton, plentiful trained manpower and a
long history of textiles manufacture. But he admits Indian companies must
overcome some serious disadvantages such as poor infrastructure, little
experience of foreign markets and the low-quality image of Indian goods
overseas. He adds that while government reforms have improved business
conditions in the past year - especially cuts in duties on machinery imports
 -severe restrictions remain.
Foreign businessmen who have dealt with Arvind say it is a cut above most
other Indian textiles companies in quality and efficient service. Mr
Lalbhai's ability to project an outward-looking image for Arvind is also not
in doubt.
But one buying agent in Delhi warned: 'Sanjay (Lalbhai) knows where he wants
to take the company. But will the rest of the group follow him? Don't forget
this is a very traditional Indian company.'
Mr Lalbhai is aware of the challenge. He has made a point of reforming
Arvind's recruitment policies - by employing executives from outside the
textiles industry. including marketing and production specialists from the
Indian subsidiaries of multinational companies.
But he admits it is not easy transforming Arvind, let alone the whole Indian
textiles industry. 'There are no short cuts. We must convince the clients
through years of good service. That's what Japan had to do.'

TOKYO Seimitsu, a leading Japanese producer of semiconductor-manufacturing

Tokyo Seimitsu said it would pay Dollars 14m for Silicon Technology, which

companies to expand overseas amid the current slump in the Japanese
semiconductor market. Many Japanese chip equipment makers are eager to
acquire new technology from US companies. Mr Yasuo Komatsuzaki of
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, an international trade
group, said Japanese acquisitions of US equipment makers may accelerate in
the near future.
Tokyo Seimitsu hopes to expand its US distribution network and develop
products with Silicon Technology. Silicon Technology also has a distribution
network in eastern Europe and Russia, which Tokyo Seimitsu hopes to use.

BAUSCH and Lomb India, a joint venture between the Indian Bhai Manjit Singh
group and the US eyecare company, yesterday formally inaugurated India's
first integrated plant to manufacture eyecare products, including Ray-Ban
sunglasses, at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan.
The plant, with an investment of Rs290m (Dollars 10.2m), is also Bausch and
Lomb's first attempt at setting up an integrated optics plant, manufacturing
on one site a range of eyecare products such as soft contact lenses,
cleaning solutions, deproteinising tablets, metallic frames and Ray-Ban
sunglasses.
The US company has a 39.9 per cent equity stake in Bausch and Lomb India,
with an initial investment of Dollars 1.10m. While the agreement was signed
in 1990, test marketing for the products began in June this year.
The company is the first to introduce ready-to-wear soft contact lenses onto
the Indian market - lenses would otherwise be made to order.
The joint venture is part of Bausch and Lomb's plan to establish itself in
markets in different parts of the world, where the market for contact lenses
and other eyecare products is underdeveloped.
In the past few years, Bausch and Lomb has begun developing the untapped
markets of Turkey, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Venezuela.
Mr Daniel E Gill, chairman and chief executive of Bausch and Lomb, said that
the Indian venture is a logical extension of this globalisation.

FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japan's banks sweep up their bad
loan troubles - A complex company is being set up to untangle the sector's
difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past few days, ordinary Japanese have been puzzling over the complex
structure of a company being set up to aid the country's troubled banks by
buying their bad loans and property collateral that has plunged in value.
Meanwhile, the banks have been congratulating themselves on their timely
move to deal with what they are seeking to portray as their temporary
difficulties.
However, this self-congratulatory mood was crushed on Monday evening when
NHK, Japan's sober national broadcaster, laid out the full, gory details of
the country's banking crisis. It made clear that the industry's new company
would hardly impact on problems extending deep into the economy. Armed with
wads of leaked bank documents and a sense of indignation, NHK found that
leading banks have been routinely reselling unwanted land to each other at a
profit, and that the lending for ill-conceived property projects continued
into this year.
In setting up the new company, the Federation of Bankers' Associations faced
the conflicting demands of tackling the banks' fast-growing non-performing
loan portfolios while maintaining the image that the non-performing loans do
not represent a serious threat to the health of Japan's financial system.
The Ministry of Finance announced on Friday - at the same time as the banks
unveiled their new institution - that the non-performing loans of the
leading 21 Japanese banks rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn (Dollars 99.2bn)
in the six months to the end of the September, while the loans not covered
by collateral rose from Y2,562bn to Y4,000bn on a total loan portfolio of
Y396,000bn.
Those figures do not tell the full story, as they represent a very narrow
definition of a non-performing loan and do not include the troubled loans of
all affiliates. A popular estimate for the non-performing portfolios of
leading banks is around Y30,000bn, while there is no accurate estimate of
the total number of non-accrual loans held by regional banks, non-bank banks
and property finance corporations.
The new institution is expected to begin untangling some of this mess early
next year. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at Credit Suisse Research
Japan, said the banks' move was at least 'a step in the right direction'.
But Ms Sasaki-Smith said the company was founded on the questionable
principle that there would be buyers for property collateral which the banks
had so far been unable to offload. That is why, as NHK found, banks have
been selling properties to paper affiliates, booking profits from those
sales and hoping against hope that a worsening property market would
improve.
In some ways, the workings of the new company are not far removed from that
practice. For instance, Bank A, owed Y10bn by an ailing developer, would
sell that loan to the new institution, which would rely on an 'independent'
valuation of the property collateral to calculate the loan's market value.
If the loan and land was estimated to be worth Y7bn, Bank A would provide
the Y7bn for the institution to buy the loan and the right to sell the land.
Thus, a Y10bn non-performing loan to the developer became a Y7bn loan to a
reputable, bank-run company and Bank A could write-off the Y3bn loss this
financial year.
Tax considerations weighed heavily on the bankers' federation, as the
transfer of land to the new company would have drawn a tax charge. But the
new company does allow the banks to sidestep an old dispute with the
National Tax Agency, which insisted that the banks cannot write-off loans
until the property collateral was sold and the loss was clear.
There is an apparent understanding among the banks and the finance ministry
that the land collateral will be generously valued, providing an artificial
floor for the property market and limiting the tax write-offs. If, after
five or six years, the new company is still unable to dispose of the land,
Bank A must buy back the rights and would then take a second write-off,
stretching out the tax concessions and delaying the day of reckoning.
The bankers' federation hopes that the valuations, to be done by a panel of
assessors and accountants, will stimulate a property market that it concedes
is 'dead'. In the hope of stirring demand, the federation will limit initial
dealings with the institution to non-performing loans backed by property
collateral which has a chance of finding a buyer and a clear title.
As such, the company will be of use to the larger, less bruised banks able
to furnish the loan funds and able to produce a clear title to the property.
But smaller institutions, some of which are in particularly bad shape, are
unlikely to make much use of the new body, which will have a start-up
capital of about Y6bn, shared among participating banks.
The issue of title is important, as it is becoming clear that less
honourable property developers borrowed many times on the same piece of
land. Meanwhile, the banks, which insisted they only provided funds
equivalent to 70 per cent cent or less of a property's value, regularly
provided money in excess of valuations made at the height of the financial
'bubble' era in the late 1980s.
One side-effect of these lending habits is a sharp rise in court actions
launched by banks and other financial institutions in an attempt to recover
money through auctions of property collateral. In the first eight months,
cases rose 36 per cent, essentially because institutions could not agree
among themselves on the division of rights to the property.
Clearing away the debris will take many more court cases and far longer than
the banking industry has publicly forecast. A survey of 34 banks by NHK
found that privately, none of these institutions expect the problems to be
solved within three years and half reckon it will take five or more years.
Over that period, the bankers' federation is likely to be forced to alter
the structure of its loan purchase company and the Japanese government, in
one form or another, may have to take the unpopular step of providing public
funds to assist troubled institutions.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Possible new US bidder for TVS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS ENTERTAINMENT, the south of England ITV company which has lost its
franchise, has had a new approach from the US, which could lead to a higher
bid for the company.
The approach has been made through TCW Capital, an Dollars 800m (Pounds
490m) investment arm of Trust, the Los Angeles money management company.
It comes as the offer document for a bid worth Pounds 38.2m from
International Family Entertainment for the ITV company is being finalised.
IFE runs The Family Channel, a cable television channel devoted to wholesome
entertainment which has more than 56m subscribers in the US.
TVS shares, which before the offer in September were as low as 3 1/2 p, rose
4 1/2 p to 26p yesterday.
Senior TVS executives were uncertain who was ultimately behind the new
approach or how serious it was. One suggested possibility was Mr Alan
Hirschfield, a media entrepreneur and a former head of Columbia Pictures. Mr
Hirschfield has built a stake of more than 6 per cent in TVS.
US investors are interested in TVS for two main reasons. The chief is the UK
company's American subsidiary MTM and its library of programmes such as Hill
Street Blues and Lou Grant. But TVS is also seen as a potential vehicle for
entering the UK and continental European programme production market.
Earlier this year Mr Rudolph Agnew, the TVS chairman, took the view that
selling the company would be the best way of realising value for
shareholders. The IFE offer would mean 25p for ordinary shareholders and 45p
for preference shareholders.
The offer has generated considerable opposition particularly from preference
shareholders. Mr James Gatward, former chief executive of TVS, is also
opposed to the IFE offer and said he would be willing to carry out a
restructuring of the company he founded to ensure its survival.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Powerscreen up 18% on lower costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of mobile
screening and stone crushing equipment, increased interim pre-tax profits by
18 per cent, in spite of the decline in the UK construction sector and
weakness of the dollar.
The pre-tax figure rose to Pounds 11.2m from Pounds 9.43m, restated at a
lower level to include the write-off of R &amp; D spending. Powerscreen's share
price responded with a 13p rise to 283p. Turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds
51.3m (Pounds 42m). Included for the first time was Finlay Engineering,
which contributed Pounds 5.5m. Another acquisition called Matbro, a maker of
agricultural equipment, chipped in Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 1.3m). Together they
accounted for about 10 per cent of profits.
Mr Shay McKeown, chairman, said reasons for the continued growth included
low-cost production helped by use of sub-contract labour and standardised
products, 'catering for customer needs rather than our own vanities' and
'avoiding overheads'.
The profit figure would have been Pounds 450,000 better if the
dollar-sterling exchange rate had stayed the same.
The impact of the weak dollar on translation of US figures showed through in
the decline in the North American share of turnover from 38 to 31 per cent.
The UK's share slipped from 31 to 29 per cent in spite of help from
acquisitions.
This lost ground was more than made up by rapid sales expansion in
continental Europe, which accounted for 30 (22) per cent of sales, and in
south-east Asia. Big increases in infrastructure spending in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore, for instance, helped Brown Lenox to push up sales to
Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.9m) in spite of contraction in the UK.
Powerscreen Distribution, the biggest subsidiary, saw sales advance by 4 per
cent to Pounds 18.9m. Mr McKeown said increased sales of larger screening
units had helped offset dollar and UK weaknesses.
Interest costs were again negligible. After the Pounds 5.3m acquisition of
CPV, a maker of stainless steel containers, debt stood at Pounds 1.5m. The
group would be cash positive by the year-end, he added.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 9.6p (8.3p). The interim dividend
goes up to 1.8p (1.7p).
COMMENT
Powerscreen's nimbleness in switching to more buoyant markets when
established beats sag is amply illustrated by its vigorous penetration of
south-east Asian markets. That part of the world - with considerable
potential for infrastructure development - is being talked of as a third leg
to the business alongside Europe and North America. Short term, the company
will receive a fillip from the pound's devaluation, as from its latest
acquisition. Full-year pre-tax profit is forecast to rise to more than
Pounds 22m from Pounds 18.8m, a prospective p/e of nearly 15. Its strong
track record, continued overseas growth and recovery potential in the US and
UK argue for a small premium. Some might say the premium is there if account
is taken of the low tax charge and high market value relative to turnover.
After a good run, the stock remains a strong hold.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Met cuts loss to Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property, Scotland's leading property investment
company, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 489,563 and passed its final dividend
for the year ended August 15.
This compares with a loss of Pounds 8.37m after an exceptional charge of
Pounds 11.6m to cover write-downs and bank fees for renegotiating debt
payments in the previous year.
Net asset value per share fell to 113.8p from 145.4p. The main reason for
this year's loss is the increase in the net interest charge to Pounds 20.7m
(Pounds 14m) charged through the profit and loss account.
Only Pounds 860,000 of interest was capitalised, compared to Pounds 8.86m,
following completion of the group's development programme.
Mr Scott Calms, who was appointed managing director in January, said the
accounting policy was not to capitalise interest beyond practical completion
of a development.
The developments include Saltire Court, 66 per cent let and Hay Weight
House, unlet, in Edinburgh, and National House, 5 per cent let, in
Manchester.
'If we increase letting revenue it will flow directly to the profit and loss
account,' said Mr Calms.
In spite of net property sales of Pounds 31.8m, rental income rose by 16 per
cent to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 19.4m) with revenue from properties up from
Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 21.4m.
The valuation of the group's properties at August 15 was Pounds 285.7m,
which reflected an overall decline of 8 per cent compared with the book
value.
As the group warned at the end of September, there is no final dividend. An
interim of 1.5p (2.53p) was paid in August.
Borrowings were Pounds 170.3m (Pounds 201.3m).
There were losses per share of 0.89p compared with losses of 9.93p.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: T&amp;N poised to make acquisition in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, one of the leading UK automotive component makers, is at an advanced
stage of negotiations to make its first significant acquisition in Germany.
It has held talks with three possible takeover targets, but it is understood
that the most probable candidate is Goetze, a components maker with a
leading world position in the manufacturing of piston rings, an important
engine component.
T&amp;N, which had a turnover last year of Pounds 1.36bn, is a leading producer
of engine components specialising in piston products, as well as bearings
and friction parts, but it has lacked hitherto a strong base in Germany, the
leading vehicle producer in Europe.
Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, has previously indicated
that the planned acquisition in Germany could cost up to Pounds 100m. The
company is planning to finance the move through debt rather than a share
issue.
Goetze, which has its headquarters in Burscheid, near Leverkusen, is still
82.4 per cent family-owned. It had a turnover worldwide last year of DM886m
(Pounds 359m) and has a workforce of about 8,000, of which some 6,000 are in
Germany.
The company has six plants in Germany, including one acquired in Dresden in
eastern Germany last year, which also produces piston rings. It also has
plants in the US, France and Turkey and minority interests in Austria and
India.
An acquisition of Goetze would significantly increase the geographic spread
of T&amp;N's operations. Goetze last year derived 36 per cent of its turnover
from Germany, 29 per cent from other European Community countries, 18 per
cent from North America and 5 per cent from Asia.
As a privately-owned German company few financial details are published, but
it is understood that Goetze's profits have fallen significantly and that it
has recently traded close to break-even.
German component makers have been coming under a growing financial squeeze
as hard-pressed vehicle makers increasingly look for cheaper sources of
supply.
German vehicle makers are increasing their purchase of components from the
UK, where suppliers already had a considerable cost advantage over German
producers, even before the recent substantial devaluation of sterling.
T&amp;N is seeking to add a strong technology base in Germany, but it believes
that a significant acquisition there would also improve its access to supply
the country's vehicle makers from its components plants outside Germany.

FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Simpsons suspended on bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Simpsons of Cornhill, owners of the famous City chop house, were
suspended yesterday after the board received a takeover bid for the
Nottingham-based restaurants group.
Mr Paul Reece, managing director, said he had requested a 48-hour suspension
following an approach from a UK venture company.
Promising to disclose the identity of the bidder before the end of the week,
Mr Reece said there was considerable corporate interest in the group which
comprises Simpsons of Cornhill and the Jamaica Inn in the City and the
Dell'Ugo and Palio bistros in London's west end.
The bidder is not connected to the group of dissident shareholders currently
seeking the overthrow of the current board, he added.
The rebel group, led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select
Appointments, confirmed they had not been approached by bidders seeking to
buy their shares - estimated at 29 per cent of the total.
The bitter struggle for control of the company centred on allegations that
the board had abandoned its strategy of developing a chain of themed chop
house restaurants.
The rebels claimed the company had been made more vulnerable to outside bids
by the acquisition and costly refurbishment of restaurants such as Dell'Ugo
in Soho.
Mr Reece, however, claimed the company was healthy and set for further
expansion following its small pre-tax profit of Pounds 80,000 for the last
full year.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Thames Water lifts profits by 5%: Shares fall 7p despite 8%
increase in interim dividend to 6.9p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES WATER demonstrated that utility companies are not immune to the
recession when it reported half-year pre-tax profits up by only 5 per cent
to Pounds 124m (Pounds 118m).
It increased its interim dividend by 8 per cent to 6.9p (6.4p), but the
stock market was disappointed that the rise was not higher and the shares
dropped by 7p to 485p. Sir Roy Watts, chairman, said the board felt the
dividend balanced the interests of customers and shareholders.
Demand for water from businesses fell by 2.5 per cent or Pounds 5m in the
six months to September 30 (compared with the first half last year).
However, rises in water charges of around 8 per cent and this year's
acquisitions of water services companies pushed turnover up by 15 per cent
to Pounds 502m (Pounds 436m).
Mr Mike Hoffmann, chief executive, said the company had seen an increase in
bad debts in the recession and had disconnected 731 of its 5m customers in
the half year, compared with only a few dozen in the first half last year.
Pre-tax profit was also held back by the rise in interest charges to Pounds
15m (Pounds 3m) as the group took on debt to help fund the utility arm's
10-year Pounds 4bn capital spending programme. The London Ring Main, the
huge new watercourse encircling London, and one of the largest parts of the
programme, is due to be finished in 1995 ahead of schedule. But it has
helped push net debt to Pounds 383m compared to Pounds 327m in March and
Pounds 156m the year before.
Mr David Luffnam, finance director, said that the ratio of debt to
shareholders' funds, now 23 per cent, would probably rise to 30 per cent by
the year end, but would then rise more slowly.
Pre-tax profits from Thames's diversification into water services, which now
make up half of turnover, fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.5m as UK
industrial business weakened and US municipal business slumped ahead of the
presidential election. Profits from UK property sales fell to Pounds 3m
(Pounds 6m) due to the weak property market.
Tax - almost entirely advance corporation tax on dividend payments - fell to
Pounds 8m (Pounds 9m), allowing earnings per share to rise by 6 per cent to
30.1p (28.4p).
Last month Thames agreed with Ofwat, the water regulator, that water prices
would rise by 4.1 per cent on top of retail price inflation in the years to
March 1994 and 1995. Sir Roy Watts said he welcomed the extra predictability
of the two-year deal.

FT  04 NOV 92 / GrandMet sells Express Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan, the UK-based food and drinks group, yesterday completed
the disposal of its Express dairy operations with the sale of Express Foods,
the UK cheese and food service business, to a management-led buy-out team
for Pounds 96m.
GrandMet put its dairy interests up for sale late last year as part of its
strategy of focusing on developing international branded products in the
food, drinks and retailing sectors.
The sale of Express Foods, one of the UK's biggest cheese manufacturers,
means GrandMet has raised a total of around Pounds 550m from the sale of its
dairy operations. The liquid milk and short-life dairy product businesses of
Express Dairy and Eden Vale were sold to Northern Foods in February for
Pounds 359m and the Irish businesses were sold to Waterford Foods and
Carbery Creameries for IPounds 99m (Pounds 108m) in July.
Express Foods, which had trading profits of about Pounds 13m on turnover of
Pounds 270m in the year to September 30, will become an independent company
for the first time since it was established in the 1950s. The Express Dairy
businesses were acquired by GrandMet in 1969.
Mr Roger Davenport, chief executive, who led the management buy-out
supported by Mr Simon Oliver - a leading entrepreneur in the dairy industry
who has been appointed non-executive chairman - expressed confidence
yesterday that the profitability of the business could be further improved.
Funding for the deal was arranged by Electra Kingsway and comprised loans of
Pounds 45m and equity investment of Pounds 51m. The equity was underwritten
by Electra Private Equity Partners and Prudential Venture Managers, while
the debt and working capital has been shared equally between Bank of Tokyo,
Union Bank of Switzerland and Bank of Scotland.
Mr Tim Syder, a director of Electra who will represent the institutional
investors on the board, said the deal represented one of the largest MBOs
this year. However, he said it was also 'much more conservatively funded'
than many earlier management buy-outs, and the purchase price represented a
significant discount to net assests, which totalled 'well over Pounds 100m'.

FT  04 NOV 92 / US, Spain lead bank profit table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US AND Spanish banks are the most profitable banks in the world, according
to a study by Ibca, the UK credit rating agency.
However, not a single Japanese bank is in the world's 100 most profitable,
even though eight of the 10 biggest banks in the world, ranked by assets,
are Japanese. No French banks and only one German bank are in the top 50 and
Germany's biggest, Deutsche, is number 116.
Every year Ibca examines the financial results of the world's 300 biggest
banks. It then calculates each bank's profits as a percentage of equity,
after adjusting for the inflation rate in the bank's home country, to give a
measure of 'real' profitability.
Ibca expresses each bank's profitability in an index form. A score of one
means the bank is earning just enough to maintain its capital after
adjusting for inflation. Any score above one means the bank is adding to its
capital and less than one that it is depleting capital.
Nineteen of the top 50 banks are US-based. That will surprise analysts,
because of problems experienced by many US banks. Indeed, Citicorp, the
biggest US bank, was ranked 282 and earned a negative return.
But the US also has a large number of successful 'super-regional' banks,
such as Banc One, which concentrate on the profitable retail market. Two of
the world's most successful commercial banks, JP Morgan and Bankers Trust,
are also in the US.
Universal banks, or banks combining retail and commercial operations, fare
badly in the league table. The upper ranks are dominated by retail banks.
Three UK banks, National Westminster, Midland and TSB Group, are among the
46 banks earning a negative return.
The UK has six banks and building societies in the top 50, but five of these
 -Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, Lloyds Bank, Leeds Permanent,
the Halifax and the Abbey National - are predominantly retail operations.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Ministers fail to agree on 2% pay rise ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, PHILIP STEPHENS and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLINE of the package of economic measures to be announced in next
week's Autumn Statement was agreed by Mr John Major yesterday as cabinet
battles over next year's Pounds 244.5bn public spending total looked set to
continue right up to the weekend.
After a meeting of almost two hours yesterday morning, ministers said a
cabinet struggle over public sector pay remained unresolved, with some
ministers still pressing for a total freeze rather than a 2 per cent ceiling
on rises, to free more resources for capital programmes.
The cabinet will meet again tomorrow, but some senior ministers signalled
that they expected to have to continue the discussions on Friday.
Tomorrow's meeting is likely to be given an indication of the economic
measures to be announced with the Autumn Statement, including rule changes
on private sector financing of capital projects.
As ministers began going through each department's spending programme, Mr
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was said by colleagues to be
fighting hard to defend his Pounds 2bn-a-year budget for housing
associations, pointing to a manifesto commitment to the associations'
housebuilding programme.
He warned the cabinet separately that too tight a squeeze on overall local
authority spending would threaten a backbench revolt when the House of
Commons votes on the arrangements for the council tax in January.
Plans by EDX, the cabinet committee on public spending, to impose deep cuts
on the defence budget hit strong opposition from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary.
In what a Whitehall insider described as one of a series of 'moving
speeches' around the cabinet table, Mr Rifkind is said to have warned of the
loss of thousands of jobs. Some defence-dependent companies might also be
threatened.
Others arguing strongly for increased allocations were Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment
secretary.
Mrs Shephard is understood to be pressing for next week's statement to show
the government launching a drive to boost industry. This would put the
emphasis not only on capital projects, but also on her department's training
and employment programmes.
Unemployment and the pay of public sector workers were two of the central
concerns raised with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in a meeting with
representatives from the Trades Union Congress.
After the discussion - the first official, bilateral meeting between the
chancellor and the TUC since the early 1980s - Mr Norman Willis, general
secretary of the TUC, said union leaders told Mr Lamont that things were
'awful out there'.
'We told him that the government must tackle jobs and we must have a
recovery, and he listened carefully,' Mr Willis said.
In the 80-minute meeting, the union leaders presented their plan for
economic recovery, and warned Mr Lamont it would be 'morally unacceptable'
for Britain's lowest paid workers to be hit by a pay freeze. The
government's plans to hold down public sector pay were challenged yesterday
with the announcement of a 4.9 per cent pay increase for Britain's 42,000
firefighters.
The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of local
authorities, described the 12-month deal as the last of this year's public
sector pay round.
The government, however, is likely to see it as among the first of next
year's wage agreements, and thus a test of its resolve on public sector pay
rises.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new top team at Allied-Lyons is proving anything but sentimental. The
decision to put Chateau Latour up for sale makes sense in strategic terms,
however strong the temptation to cling on to such a proud name. The estate
has never made the group much of a return. The disposal will take Allied a
stage further down its chosen route of focusing on international growth
brands. Together with a cash injection approaching Pounds 150m from its
Carlsberg venture, the proceeds should soon make a substantial dent in group
net debt of Pounds 1.9bn. Accordingly, interest cover should rise from the
current level of 3.8, which is low in comparison with Grand Metropolitan and
Guinness.
That said, it is difficult to see the company making much of a turn on the
deal. Based on the price at which it acquired the bulk of its stake from
Pearson and other investors since 1988, the estate represents an investment
somewhat in excess of Pounds 100m. Allied has given few details about how
much the business actually earns, but it is a fair bet that it would need to
conclude a sale on a multiple of between 20 and 30 to break even. It must be
hoping that Axa, or whoever the final purchaser turns out to be, will not
also latch on to the folly of buying brand names at unrealistic multiples
simply because of their snob appeal.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will take the currency markets a little while to absorb the US election
result. In the run-up to yesterday's poll there were conflicting opinions
about the likely course of the dollar. One school argued that a Clinton
victory would produce a combination of tighter money and looser fiscal
policy similar to that which pushed the dollar sharply higher in the early
Reagan years.
The dollar would still rise, though less spectacularly, with a Bush victory,
because election uncertainty would be out of the way in the US, while the
German economy looks weaker by the day.
The other school is less certain. It argues that the US recovery remains
elusive, while the Bundesbank may be tantalisingly slow in cutting official
rates. Indeed, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, implied as much
in Leipzig yesterday by reiterating concern about wage increases and the
budget deficit.
Whichever version is correct, at some stage the market focus will shift away
from interest differentials to relative growth prospects. The D-Mark would
suffer all the more in that process if, by then, the Bundesbank had
compounded Germany's downturn by excess of monetary zeal. How much more of
that the market is now prepared to discount is another matter. The election
will hardly produce much short-run change in the US fundamentals. But by
last night's European close the dollar had already risen 13 per cent from
its low against the D-Mark on September 2.

FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Thames turns choppy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It brings back memories of the old days to see a company punished by the
market for delivering interim dividend growth of 'only' 7.8 per cent. In
common with other water companies, Thames has no incentive to apply gloss to
its figures ahead of the periodic review by the regulator in 1994. But
having flourished on expectations of high and stable dividend growth, water
companies can hardly complain when investors are disappointed.
Thames still has to prove it is an effective manager outside the business of
water supply. Its international hodge-podge of waste and engineering
businesses made a profit of less than Pounds 1m in the first half on
turnover of Pounds 123m. Even allowing for the ravages of the cycle, it
looks as though Thames paid too much for the likes of UTAG in east Germany.
Still, Thames has an impressive ability to take out costs in the basic water
business. With a two-year deal with the regulator on pricing already in the
bag, real annual dividend growth of around 4 per cent looks certain, at
least up to the 1994 review.
Soon, though, the market will have to address the issue of how the sector
will fare in the second half of the decade. By changing its licence to stop
Ofwat meddling with its prices between the reviews scheduled at
privatisation, Thames has taken the regulator by the horns. The downside is
that, if costs are higher than expected, the company will be unable to pass
them on to the customer.
True, the regulator has promised to take this into account when setting
Thames' new pricing formula in 1994. But there is precious little hard
information to go on. Ofwat is shortly due to publish details of how the
review will be conducted. That will give the market something more serious
to worry about than a slightly disappointing dividend.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Man from the Pru calls for openness: A look at the views on
disclosure of a leading life industry executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS almost apostasy for the life insurance industry to acknowledge merit
in the growing chorus of public complaints about its products.
Yet Mr Mick Newmarch, chairman of Britain's largest life insurance company,
Prudential, has done just that in a hard-hitting speech to the Institute of
Actuaries last night which is aimed at set-ting a new agenda for the
industry.
Mr Newmarch singled out the thorny issue of disclosure: that is, what should
consumers know about a life insurance product before they buy it? That
question, simple as it appears, has been at the heart of probably the
greatest onslaught of bad press the industry has ever seen.
The life industry has largely been fighting a rearguard action for the past
two years to stave off disclosure.
The information that is wanted ranges from how much commission a sales agent
earns to the exact number of years needed to earn a 100 per cent refund of
premiums paid on an endowment policy cancelled before maturity - information
that the public badly wants to get its hands on.
This rearguard action has only confirmed in the public mind the view that
the industry has something to hide.
Mr Newmarch said: 'The trading practices of the savings industry - and in
particular of life offices - are today subject to attack on an unprecedented
scale and this must be a matter of vital concern to all of us.'
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Newmarch said that the industry
had compounded the difficulty by insisting that its critics did not know
what they were talking about. The recent response that criticism from the
Office of Fair Trading was ill-informed was wrong.
He said in his speech: 'Perhaps we should consider that maybe it is we who
do not understand the fair trading environment.'
Mr Newmarch said the industry had met the challenge of the criticism badly.
'This industry has a public-relations problem,' he said. Resistance to more
and better disclosure had added to public scepticism about the merits of
life insurance - a scepticism that may well be a factor in the recent
decline in sales of life and pension products.
The greatest apostasy committed by Mr Newmarch was to suggest that not only
was the Office of Fair Trading - which is reviewing a new disclosure regime
for life insurance - the appropriate body for setting a disclosure regime,
but that many of its concerns were legiti-mate.
Mr Newmarch said in his speech: 'Either it is possible to persuade the OFT
and the most professionally competent media commentators that the current
level of criticism of life industry products and sales practices is
unjustified, or we must take on board the message that some of our products
and our methods of presenting them have not kept pace with the changing
expectations of the public.'
He told the Financial Times: 'Over the past year or two, life insurance has
become a pejorative term.'
Privately, Mr Newmarch makes no secret of his view that in seeking a tougher
disclosure regime he expects the Pru to benefit. Better disclosure would
show the Pru off to its best advantage and shake some of its competitors out
of the business al-together.
Indeed, Mr Newmarch said, the Pru may consider disclosing to prospective
cus-tomers more than is actually required under the law.
Mr Newmarch suggested that instead of allowing the Securities and
Investments Board to negotiate a disclosure regime acceptable to the OFT,
the insurance industry should open a dialogue directly with it and seek OFT
endorsement of the industry and its practices.
Some industry cynics believe that in making that offer he is hoping to stave
off what might be an even more unattractive disclosure regime to be
developed by the Treasury. Under present rules, if the OFT finds SIB's life
insurance disclosure regime unsatisfactory it is up to the Treasury to
direct SIB to draft a new one.
The last time the OFT turned down an SIB-designed disclosure regime, in
1989, it was the Department of Trade and Industry that ordered it back to
the drawing board.
Treasury sources have made little secret for their distaste for the life
industry and it may turn out to be a far less sympathetic regulator than the
DTI.
Mr Newmarch strenuously objects to the suggestion that he would like the
regulatory ball back in the DTI's court, although he urged in his speech
that the DTI be charged with regulating sales and marketing of retail
financial services.
The DTI, he said, had the power to remove chairman and board directors from
life companies in its powers of prudential supervision. There was no reason
why that could not be extended to the sales and marketing arena as well.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Reserves at Bank fall Pounds 2bn in month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's underlying official reserves fell by Pounds 2bn
(Dollars 3bn) last month, slightly more than expected. But the fall gives
few clues to the extent of the Bank's intervention to prop up sterling in
September.
The drop followed September's record fall of Pounds 4.4bn, but together the
two figures amount to only a part of the Pounds 15bn-Pounds 20bn currency
reserves allegedly spent by the Bank shortly before the pound's devaluation
on September 16.
The Treasury figures show that Britain's overall gold and currency reserves
were Dollars 42.1bn at the end of October, compared with Dollars 42.7bn at
the end of September.
The final net drop of Dollars 539m was smaller than the underlying fall
because the Bank drew upon Dollars 3bn of special borrowing of up to Ecu10bn
in foreign currencies arranged at the beginning of September to boost the
pound.
Overall reserves were also bolstered by Dollars 846m of Ecu Treasury bill
proceeds.
The full amount that the Bank spent in mid September trying to shore up
sterling in Europe's exchange rate mechanism may not be known for months.
While in the ERM it was possible for the Bank to shroud the level of
intervention over any month by borrowing from other European central banks.
Those borrowings did not have to be repaid for up to nine months.
The Bank can also borrow on the foreign exchange forward market. Such loans
can be rolled over indefinitely.
Mr David Simmonds, currency economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'It is
impossible to know firstly how much of the UK's reserves were used during
September, and secondly the repayment schedule for borrowings and the
maturity ladder of forward contracts.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Competition backed for efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION in all sectors of the economy is 'the spur to increased
efficiency and innovation', Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister,
told an audience in London yesterday.
His speech was a reaffirmation by the government of its commitment to
competition as the best weapon against industrial decline.
Speaking to the European Policy Forum, a rightwing think tank, Mr Hamilton
said the government would continue with the policy set out in 1984. He was
speaking on the day after Mr Heseltine, the Trade and Industry Secretary,
apparently signalled a change of policy by waving through British Airways'
takeover of Dan-Air.
The takeover was allowed in spite of concerns about a reduction in
competition.
When Mr Michael Heseltine took over the Department of Trade and Industry
after the general election in April, he was widely expected to pursue an
industrial strategy rather than adhere to the strict competition policy that
dominated the years of the Thatcher government.
In dealing with mergers in particular, it was thought that Mr Heseltine
might move away from the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine' of referring mergers to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation mainly on
competition grounds.
Mr Hamilton denied that merger policy prevented UK companies becoming big
enough to compete internationally. In general, the more competitors there
were in a market, the fewer competition concerns there would be.
That, though, he said was not to say that there could not be adequate
competition where one company had a very significant share of the market.
Mr Hamilton went on to stress the need for an even-handed approach to
competition policy in the European Community. He said that when the EC
merger regulation came up for review next year the government would want to
test any proposals for widening its scope against the UK's original
objectives for the regulation.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Small companies are losing heart, CBI says
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM AMONG small businesses has fallen in the past four months,
according to a Confederation of British Industry report published yesterday.
The report mirrors the falling production, weakening orders and further job
losses predicted in last week's CBI survey of big companies.
Exports are the only positive sign in a bleak outlook, with companies
expecting a slight increase in foreign orders over the next four months.
The survey of more than 800 smaller manufacturers says spending on machinery
and innovation is falling and training schemes have been cut.
Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI's smaller business committee, said
it was 'critical' to boost investment. 'Otherwise smaller UK manufacturers
will not remain competitive in international markets and capture the
business which is necessary to increase the country's employment and
wealth,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An open letter from a citizen of the world to the winner of yesterday's US
election
Sir, You presumably know who you are, and by the time you receive this
letter the world will at least know your name. But as I write, millions of
Americans are still putting their cross against that name - although
millions of others are not. On past form, those who stay away from the
polling booths altogether will outnumber your supporters.
I have a suggestion for next time. Let the votes of those Americans who do
not care enough to use them be given to foreigners, like me, who would
dearly love to. All over the world there are people who believe their lives
will be affected by decisions that you take in the course of the next four
years. No doubt many of those people exaggerate US influence, but they are
not wholly wrong. True, the US no longer dominates the world economy in the
overwhelming way it did for a decade or so after 1945. But it is the
uncontested world champion in military power, more than ever now that the
Soviet Union has scratched from the competition.
Whether the US has really begun a long-term process of overall decline is
debatable. The answer may depend partly on you. But for the present in any
case, and for the foreseeable future, the US enjoys a combination of
economic and military strength which no other country even begins to rival.
Moreover it is still the main inspiration of popular culture throughout the
world, and the country where most non-Americans would like to live if they
left their own.
All that has given you, the American ruling elite, an instinctive
self-confidence about projecting your power overseas, politically as well as
militarily; and it has given us, the rest of the world, an instinctive
deference towards your leadership even when we resent your power or disagree
profoundly with your judgment. We may argue bitterly against your policies,
but we still tend to find ourselves arguing for a different American policy.
The idea that we could just ignore you and do our own thing hardly even
occurs to us.
What do I, as a citizen of the world, hope for from you as leader of the
only superpower?
First of all, I hope that America, if it is declining, is not going to
decline too fast; and that obsession with that possibility will not make it
turn its back on the rest of us or - even worse - blame us and lash out
against us when it finds its own problems too intractable. The danger of
that is clearly greatest in the field of economics and world trade. We all
know the reflex: if you are losing market share, it must be because your
competitors are playing dirty. So instead of trying to improve your own
performance, you concentrate on devising rules to hobble the competition.
Recent US governments have been quite good, by international standards, at
resisting that reflex. But the pressures are strong. To a European,
Americans often seem obsessed with the 'Japanese threat'. Obviously there
are great dangers for the world if the US gets into a trade war with Japan,
but also if it tries to solve the problem by bilateral deals, regulating
both markets at the expense of third parties.
I hope you will tackle that notorious budget deficit, as you have promised
to do. That means you will have to have the courage to tell the American
people that whatever you rashly said during the campaign about not
increasing taxes on this or that category of the population cannot be
interpreted as ruling out effective action to deal with this great national
incubus.
Start with a gasoline tax of at least a dollar a gallon. To us foreigners,
the gas-guzzling habits of Americans appear scandalous on both economic and
environmental grounds. Tell your countrymen they have to limit their energy
consumption both to avoid an embarrassing dependence on Arab sheikhs and to
improve their grandchildren's chances of inheriting a habitable planet. Do
not be swayed by sob stories from those (mid-western farmers, for example)
who say their way of life depends on cheap gasoline; but if any do convince
you, give them the money in cash. Do not repeat the mistake the EC is trying
so painfully to undo in its agricultural policy, of allowing an entire
market to be distorted by the special needs of one social category.
And don't be afraid to cash the 'peace dividend'. America will have no
difficulty in remaining the world's leading military power with a much
smaller financial outlay than was required to compete with the Soviet Union
in a nuclear arms race while maintaining over 300,000 troops on a war
footing in Germany.
Of course there will be plenty of special pleaders urging you to keep bases
open or not to cancel weapons systems. But if you really want to spend
taxpayers' money on keeping people in work, there are many more efficient
ways to do it than by paying them to produce machines which are at best
useless, at worse appallingly destructive. Nor should anyone deceive you
into thinking you are making the world safer by manufacturing weapons for
export. Preventing the spread of weapons, both conventional and those 'of
mass destruction', should be at the top of your priorities.
In the post-cold war era your contribution to world security cannot be
measured by the number of soldiers you keep posted abroad. It will be
measured, in part, by the tasks you let them undertake. There is no longer a
hostile power block, and therefore no front line to man against it. One
interest the US shares with the rest of us is to prevent that situation ever
rising again. So please make every effort to help those who are trying to
turn Russia into a civilised power, integrated into the world economy; and
encourage China to continue opening up; don't drive it back into autarky and
xenophobia.
Even simple objectives such as the defence of one state's sovereignty
against another's aggression (as in Kuwait) may in future be the exception
rather than the rule. Security has become a matter of defending people
against each other - in places where sovereignty and borders are contested
as much by the locals as by outsiders, such as the former Yugoslavia; or
where the state has virtually disappeared, as in several African countries.
Where possible, things should be prevented from getting that far, through
timely diplomacy. Sometimes a show of force at an early stage may avert the
need to use force at a later one.
Of course the US does not want to be a lonely world policeman. These are
tasks for multilateral structures, and above all for the United Nations - an
engine largely of American invention, whose usefulness the US has lately
rediscovered. But recent experience has shown that multilateral structures
can work with US leadership (the Gulf), not without it (Yugoslavia).
Americans must be prepared to do their bit, and pay their whack. Compared
with the cost of the cold war, multilateral police operations will be cheap.
Some of that peace dividend should be spent on them.
Oh, and one last thing. You have an excellent ambassador in London. Since he
is a career diplomat - the first ever appointed to that office - there is no
need to replace him, whichever side has won the election. Let him stay.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: R&amp;D tax breaks are needed up front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When it comes to government incentives for firms to invest in research
and development, tax incentives may well be preferred by certain companies,
such as the 86 per cent of respondents to a recent KPMG Peat Marwick survey
('Tax boost switch urged to boost R&amp;D', October 12).
Yet the full report which I have just received, ignores the important
distinction between large and small firms. While larger companies may be
able to lay out funds now in the expectation of a tax break later, smaller
ones (which provide the bulk of new innovations) need the 50 per cent cash
up front that most R&amp;D schemes provide.
It would be unfortunate if the government, as it seeks to reduce overt
public spending, acted on the survey's apparently well-grounded findings to
cut the already modest budgets of British schemes such as Link and Spur.
Small firms are finding life tough enough as it is.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: Broad customs union should be on Edinburgh agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs SHIRLEY WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hope you will continue to use your considerable influence to campaign
for a Europe-wide customs union that would embrace the eastern European
countries (leading article, 'Eastern vision', October 29). Such a customs
union might also reach a trade agreement with the former Soviet republics,
based on a payments union. Central and eastern Europe lost large parts of
its trade following the collapse of Comecon - part, but not all, of which
has been compensated for by increased trade with the European Community.
From the safe ground of a Europe-wide customs union, natural trade patterns
with the Comonwealth of Independent States could be re-established.
The 'Europe Agreements' between the EC and Poland, Hungary and the Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic have been disappointing, since almost all the
commodities in which these countries have a comparative advantage (steel,
textiles, certain agricultural products) are restricted by quotas. The
agreements are also, as you say in your leader, bilateral.
The central and eastern Europeans are coping bravely with a steep fall in
per capita gross domestic product, rising unemployment and spreading
poverty. Their political and economic stability is vital to us. (The former
Yugoslavia provides a grim lesson in the costs of disintegration.)
The need for a customs union to replace the agreements is therefore urgent.
The EC, and its British presidency, should put this issue on the agenda of
the Edinburgh summit now.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: Lesson to draw is that record of all economic
forecasters is poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK FOLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your analysis of economic forecasters' accuracy during the recession
makes interesting reading ('Britain's top 10 forecasters', October 30), but
the main lesson to be drawn from such analysis is surely the poor
forecasting record of all those included (including ourselves).
Those who feature at the top of the table should not be too hasty in
congratulating themselves. There is much less difference between the best
and worst forecasts in your table than there is between the best and the
actual outcome. On your figures, the best forecaster (Smith New Court)
predicted a total 0.3 per cent rise in GDP in the two recession years, 1991
and 1992. The final outcome looks likely to be a fall of 3.3 per cent.
We have looked recently at the causes of this poor record, to see whether it
can offer any clues as to how forecasts might be improved in the future (see
Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin July 1992). What appears to have made this
recession deeper than forecast was the reaction of businesses to the initial
signs of slowdown: 1990 and 1991 saw very sharp cutbacks in investment,
output, employment and stocks by industry, concentrated first in services
but then spreading to other sectors. This is the natural reaction of
businesses to a deterioration in their external environment, especially when
they are relatively highly geared - and thus highly risk averse - as many
were in the late 1980s. However, it is not one that most economic models are
designed to predict.
The failure of the economy to begin to recover in 1992 (whereas all
forecasters in your table predicted an upturn) can be attributed to the
continued financial fragility of the personal sector (see Lloyds Bank
Economic Bulletin, September 1992). This is another failing for models which
do not appear to take sufficiently sophisticated account of the effect of
personal finances. Peter Warburton was thus right to stop using computer
models when he did. If only the rest of us had done the same] This analysis
suggests, by the way, that to the extent that forecasters of a monetarist
persuasion were more accurate, they appear to have been right for the wrong
reasons.
Finally, one complaint about your assessment method. In times of rapidly
changing views about economic prospects, it is much easier for an
organisation which revises its forecasts monthly to score well than one
which publishes its views only once or twice a year. This suggests to me
that the Treasury forecast compares favourably with even the best in your
table.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: First step towards European integration recalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AUBREY JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In your article, 'Nowhere else to go' (October 30), you relate how the prime
minister said that the UK's first mistake in European policy was 'when we
failed to join the Community at the outset', and ascribe that failure to
Anthony Eden.
I would put the failure back in time, to around 1950. The late Jean Monnet
once described to me a meeting with Sir Stafford Cripps, then Britain's
chancellor of the exchequer, and Edwin (now Lord) Plowden, then a Treasury
adviser.
In that meeting Monnet proposed that the UK should join the then projected
Coal and Steel Community, making it clear that he was interested in more
than just coal and steel, and that coal and steel were but a first step
towards European integration. He was turned down.
I referred to this meeting in a speech in the House of Commons on May 17
1961 (Hansard, vol 640, columns 1,429-1,437). Douglas Jay intervened to
rebut my wider interpretation of Monnet's proposal. However, my memory of
Monnet's conversation with me is quite clear and the wider interpretation is
confirmed in Monnet's memoirs and in an anthology of speeches entitled Les
Etats Unis d'Europe Ont Commence.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Personal View: Shut the stable door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAYARD and CHARLES BEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How to recover without inflating: that is the question. In every recession
we conquer inflation and people say: 'We have dealt with that problem, so
give us a recovery.' And every recovery then brings back inflation.
The problem will be particularly acute this time, owing to the devaluation
of sterling. Experience shows that the competitive gain from devaluation
will soon be wiped out by higher wage inflation - unless this time we
address the wages problem before it arises.
The instinct of almost every businessman is against this, and the reaction
is understandable. Most businesses feel that wages are now the least of
their problems. Business has re-established productivity growth, and for the
moment companies are less worried than usual about their unit labour costs.
What worries them is the lack of demand and the high cost of servicing their
debts. So they are calling for a recovery package based on infrastructure
investment and lower interest rates. Many of them cannot understand why the
government hesitates to give them this.
But the government takes a longer view. It knows that the basic problem of
the British economy is the wages problem. At present wage inflation is still
falling as a result of increasing unemployment. But, once unemployment
stabilises and then begins to fall, wage inflation will start creeping up
again, exactly as it did in the late 1980s.
Almost all our present ills stem from the steady rise of wage inflation at
that time. The main reason for the present recession has been the need to
reduce wage settlements. We needed to reduce average earnings growth from
about 9 to 5 per cent a year. After three terrible years we have nearly got
there but in the end the disinflation was just too late - leading to the
national humiliation of a devaluation.
We must not repeat this stop-go cycle in the years ahead. If we do nothing
about our pay arrangements, it will be very difficult to expand employment
at all without raising inflation above 4 per cent. The business community
must exercise some foresight in its own collective interest.
If business does not believe there is an inflation problem, the financial
markets do. If interest rates are to be cut as much as we need, the pound
will fall and inflation will rise - unless the markets believe pay is under
control. The markets know that pay is the prime cost in the economy (though
for individual businesses it is often minor, due to multi-stage production).
As soon as the labour market improves, individual employers have an
incentive to raise the relative pay of their workers. But the result is a
process of pay leap-frogging. From this process all lose, since it is
inevitably followed by another period of 'stop'. How can we avoid this?
We have to institutionalise the common interest which all employers have in
a low average level of wage settlements, while preserving the needed
flexibility in relativities. In Germany and Japan this common interest has
led to a degree of concerted action among employers, which helps to explain
their good performance.
Our system of pay determination has worked less well and we ought to
consider some change. Given the present economic crisis, we should consider
one quite small alteration, from which we could derive great benefits.
The assumption must be that we shall have some kind of public sector pay
limit. Business has rightly asked for something of that kind. But it is not
a reasonable request unless we can expect that private sector pay (taken as
a whole) will move roughly in line. Companies which are abnormally short of
labour should, of course, be raising the relative pay of their workers. But,
unless the private sector as a whole is more short of labour than the public
sector, there is no reason why the relative pay of the private sector should
rise.
So if the public sector pay limit is x per cent, no private sector company
should be conceding more than x per cent unless it is abnormally short of
labour (or needs to reward an exceptional increase in the efforts of its
workers).
The government should therefore announce a recovery package as the CBI asks
 -on one condition. The CBI should establish a committee which would comment
publicly on any private sector pay settlement above x per cent. The
committee would be expected to criticise all settlements which could not be
justified on the above criteria.
Even this arrangement would favour the private sector, for average earnings
in industry usually rise by about 2 points more than wage settlements, which
does not happen in the public sector.
Some will say the monitoring procedure is unnecessary. If so, it can do no
harm. And, if it is necessary, it will do good. Either way, nobody can
reasonably criticise it.
Too often we have claimed to have licked inflation. If we have any
foresight, we should bolt the stable door now, rather than having again to
grab inflation by the tail, once it has bolted.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Japan banks on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S DEEPENING political and economic difficulties make a worrying
spectacle. The Japanese government has the room to act, both to prevent a
recession and to ensure that its troubled banking sector is purged and ready
for recovery. But the combination of bureaucratic myopia and political
grid-lock may still produce too little action, too late.
Japan faces two distinct recessionary threats. The slowdown in the corporate
sector, and the associated fall in profits, investment, output and prospects
for employment, make headline news. But it is the collapse of the real
estate sector and the resultant troubles in the banking industry which pose
the greater threat to economic growth in the medium term, both for Japan and
the world.
Japanese industry is fundamentally strong, but burdened by excess capacity
at a time when both international and domestic demand is weak. Inventories
are too high. The investment growth of the late 1980s was probably too
rapid. Many observers now expect private investment to remain depressed for
a year or more. Fortunately, Japan's life-time employment system and the
recently agreed Y10,700bn fiscal package of public investments should
together ensure that Japan avoids an outright recession.
Yet it is the threat of an anaemic recovery, not recession, that should
disturb the sleep of Ministry of Finance officials. Japanese monetary growth
may currently be sluggish because the demand for new loans is depressed. But
the pace of recovery, both in Japan and elsewhere, may subsequently be
constrained by the ability and willingness of Japan's banks to lend for new
ventures.
Bad debts
The omens are poor. Bad debts in the US banking industry have hindered the
pace of the US recovery, despite the willingness of the US Federal Reserve
to ease monetary policy aggressively in order to steepen the yield curve and
boost bank profitability.
The scale of the likely bad debts held by Japan's less profitable banking
sector is only slowly becoming apparent. The Ministry of Finance reported
last week that the non-performing loans of the leading 21 Japanese banks
rose by 54 per cent, to Y12,300bn, in the six months to the end of the
September, about a third of the total capital of these banks. Other
estimates, based on a less conservative definition of bad loans and
including regional banks, suggest a figure for bad debts that is four times
as great. In fact, the low level of transactions in the land market and the
artificially inflated level of recorded land prices make it impossible to
know quite how large the damage to bank balance sheets will turn out to be.
Public support
Neither the Bank of Japan or the Ministry of Finance is willing, at least
publicly, to recognise the threat to recovery that these bad debts present.
The Bank of Japan has left the discount rate unchanged since July, while the
gap between short and long-term interest rates is half that in the US. The
Ministry of Finance appeared willing, in August, to consider direct public
support for the banks as did Prime Minister Miyazawa. But these signals have
since been denied in the face of widespread opposition to the use of public
funds to help the banks.
Yet the alternative - a poorly capitalised agency, owned and run by the
private banks, that will purchase their bad loans - is a recipe for delay
and concealment. Writing off the banks' losses at realistic land prices
would destroy much of their capital, and perhaps some banks entirely. In
practice, the agency is likely to buy real estate at inflated prices,
minimising the apparent loss to the banks, but at the price of postponing
the inevitable losses and leaving a still distorted land market.
Herein lies the case for public funds. The banks should be forced to accept
losses that are as large as they can bear, while land prices must fall by
much more than the 10 per cent canvassed by the banks. But this risks
destabilising the financial system unless the agency is sufficiently well
capitalised and firmly run. Only the Bank of Japan can perform that role.
When past errors have been cleared away, along with the managers who made
them, the banks will be able to re-capitalise and finance recovery.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Private way for public roads: Budget constraints are forcing
the UK government to seek new ways of financing transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain badly needs more roads and railways. People are tired of traffic
jams and slow, overcrowded trains; recession has left the construction
industry desperate for work; and after a sudden policy turnabout at the end
of last month, the government has become a convert to the need for big
capital projects to stimulate economic growth.
But who is going to pick up the bill? At a time when ministers are agonising
over ways of meeting next year's Pounds 244.5bn planning total, there is
little enough money in the public purse to maintain existing spending
programmes, still less increase them.
The government, however, believes it has a solution. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, has promised that next week's Autumn Statement will come up with
ways of involving the private sector in the funding of capital projects.
The idea is not a new one. In 1981, during Britain's last deep recession,
there were similar pressures for capital investment to get the economy
moving, and similar calls for private sector involvement to help it along.
The Treasury responded by drawing up the so-called Ryrie rules to define the
conditions in which private sector funding could be allowed.
As befitted a government for which the control of public spending had become
an icon, the rules were a model of fiscal rectitude. One rule, known as the
non-additionality principle, decreed that private money invested in public
sector projects could only be used in place of public spending, not in
addition to it. Another, known as the value-for-money principle, decreed
that private funding would only be allowed if it delivered a project more
cheaply than public sector funding - a most unlikely eventuality since the
government can borrow from the financial markets at much lower rates of
interest than the private sector.
Not surprisingly, the effect of the rules was to stifle private sector
participation rather than to encourage it. But in a sense, it did not matter
much. By that time, the government's privatisation programme had started to
solve the problem in a different way - by transferring state-owned utilities
and their accompanying capital requirements to the private sector.
Transport was a prime target for privatisation. The national airline,
airports, ferries, ports, road freight, buses and coaches were all sold. But
roads and railways remained stubbornly in the public sector, and by the late
1980s were coming under unprecedented strains as a result of strong economic
growth.
The result was a renewal of calls for private sector involvement in funding
transport infrastructure. In May 1989 Mr John Major, then chief secretary to
the Treasury, announced that the Ryrie rules would be scrapped. Days later,
the Department of Transport published a document called New Roads By New
Means, heralding the dawn of an era in which the private sector would be
allowed to build toll roads.
Three years on, these moves have almost wholly failed to achieve their
objectives. True, the privately-funded Dartford Crossing now carries
London's M25 orbital motorway across the Thames, but that was an exceptional
project approved before the abolition of the Ryrie rules. Since 1989, the
construction of the privately-funded Second Severn Crossing has begun, but
the only road or motorway project to have been given the go-ahead is the
Birmingham Northern Relief Road - and that is not expected to open until the
end of the decade.
One reason why the private sector has proved so reluctant to finance as well
as build the nation's transport infrastructure is that the abolition of the
Ryrie rules was largely a sham; the Treasury simply re-created the rules in
its so-called Green Book in April 1991. Its only significant concession was
a softening of the non-additionality principle, allowing for consideration
to be given to the use of private funding to supplement public spending.
In reality, however, there is a much more obvious explanation for the
private sector's lack of interest in road and railway investment than
Treasury rules. It is the fact that companies cannot see an opportunity for
making money out of it.
The risks and costs, for example, can be immense. Lead times for transport
infrastructure projects typically span a decade or more because of the
interminable, and usually controversial, planning processes. Companies are
reluctant to risk millions of pounds working up projects only to see them
collapse or rendered unviable during the planning phase. And when projects
do go ahead, companies may face colossal bills for land acquisition and
environmental protection.
The risks would matter less if companies could be sure of earning
appropriate returns. But in Britain, where existing roads and motorways are
free at the point of use, it is difficult for companies to charge tolls high
enough to cover their costs without losing their customers to free
alternative routes.
Put simply, toll roads only work where users have no cheap or easy option.
In other countries which operate them, such as France, they tend to work
either because alternative routes are also tolled, or because free
alternatives are unsuitable for drivers travelling long distances.
In Britain, it has so far only been possible to introduce tolls on river
crossings, where the alternative is another tolled crossing or a long
detour. If the Birmingham Northern Relief Road works, it will only be
because the motorway route for which it provides an alternative is full.
It follows that another attempt to encourage the private sector to build
toll roads through a softening of Treasury rules will be futile unless it is
accompanied by measures to make such projects viable.
The single most obvious solution would be to sweep away road tax and fuel
excise duties and replace them with a system of electronic road pricing - in
other words, charging people for use of public roads on a pay-as-you-go
basis. This would not only put private roads on a more competitive footing
with public ones, but would have the beneficial side effect of increasing
the viability of rail.
Transport and environment ministers are increasingly suggesting that road
pricing is inevitable, if only as a means of tackling traffic congestion and
pollution. Even so, they have made it clear that they are not quite ready
for it yet.
In the interim, therefore, the next best solution might be to introduce
charges only for those public roads or motorways competing directly with
privately-operated routes. One way of doing this would be to award
concessions for route 'corridors' rather than specific roads, and allow
companies to toll existing roads lying in the corridor to help pay for new
ones.
For example, if the government wanted the private sector to build new
motorway capacity between Birmingham and Manchester, it could grant a
company the Birmingham-Manchester concession and allow it to impose tolls on
the existing M6 motorway to help meet its costs during the planning and
construction of a new road. Similarly, a company could be granted a
concession for the heavily-congested M25 London orbital motorway, imposing
tolls on the existing road to pay for a widening programme.
Precedents for this kind of arrangement already exist. The consortium that
built the Dartford Crossing, led by Trafalgar House, the construction group,
was given a concession to take over the existing Dartford Tunnel. Income
from the tunnel and bridge tolls is being used to service the loans, and
once these are paid off, the tunnel and bridge will revert to the
government. In this case, the consortium's profit comes not from the toll
revenue, but from the construction contract and the fees for arranging the
loans.
A similar agreement has been drawn up for the Second Severn Crossing, so it
is clearly deemed as workable. But it has its drawbacks. One is that it
confers undesirable monopoly powers on the concessionaire, implying a need
for close government control over charges. Worse, where roads are involved,
it means the imposition of tolls where none previously existed, so risking a
public outcry and the possible diversion of traffic onto unsuitable
secondary roads.
In the face of these obstacles, perhaps the most attractive proposal comes
from Sir David Hancock, a former Treasury official who is now a director of
Hambros Bank. He suggests that, if a toll road proposal arouses no private
sector interest because companies believe it would fail to deliver an
adequate return, the government should make it more attractive by offering a
grant towards the project's costs. Companies would then bid to see which
required the smallest subsidy to proceed.
One attraction of the idea is that the Treasury has already accepted the
principle in other areas of transport. In some ways it resembles the scheme
under which the government is prepared to consider grants towards the
construction of jointly-funded light rail systems, such as the Manchester
Metro, to reflect the benefits they can bring to local communities. A still
closer parallel lies in the government's plans for railway privatisation,
where the operation of loss-making passenger services will be franchised out
to the private sector on the basis of which company requires the smallest
subsidy to run them.
The implications of adopting such a scheme for capital works could spread
beyond roads. For example, the government continues to insist that it wants
the private sector to provide the planned Channel Tunnel Rail Link between
London and the Channel tunnel. In reality, there is no possibility that the
link will deliver a return big enough to persuade the private sector to fund
it on its own. But an auction to determine which company or consortium
required the smallest government grant to undertake the project could get
the line built at least cost to the exchequer.
The idea is not a panacea. The Treasury, always highly suspicious of schemes
which mix public and private sector finance, will see it as a way of using
taxpayers' money to subsidise private profit. Mr John Fletcher, a director
of Trafalgar House, says no scheme is likely to take off unless the
government draws up a programme of works large enough for the private sector
to consider it worthwhile getting involved. And even if the government does
succeed in getting private funding off the ground, years will pass before
any projects reach the construction stage - by which time, Britain can only
hope, the country will long since have emerged from recession.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Rethinking City regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW consensus is emerging in the City: that the current system of UK
financial services regulation is so deeply flawed that sweeping changes are
needed.
The latest advocate of this view is Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of
Prudential. 'The Financial Services Act is an unsatisfactory basis for the
protection of savers,' he said yesterday, calling for 'investor protection
on a fully statutory basis under direct government control'.
He is not alone in urging the abandonment of the system of 'practitioner
based' regulation introduced by the act. In private, other City grandees
join the chorus. And even Mr Andrew Large, charged with operating the system
as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), clearly has his
doubts. He envisages 'a clear shift to a less self-regulatory basis' as a
result of his current review of the way SIB works.
The current system, say its critics, doesn't catch crooks; it allowed the
Maxwell pensioners to be defrauded; it imposes an irritating and costly
burden on inter-professional business; it consists of too many second-rate
regulators, imposing too many rules; it has failed to resolve some very
difficult problems of consumer protection; and - says Mr Newmarch - it has
become too prescriptive, imposing the regulators' view of best practice
rather than the legally enshrined criterion of adequacy.
Clumsily divided
Most of these statements command general assent. The enforcement of the
present system - clumsily divided between too many regulators and criminal
prosecutors - is clearly unsatisfactory. The Maxwell affair scarcely came
within the regulatory structure - in itself a criticism of the law - but
where it did, the safeguards failed to work. There is too weak a distinction
between the regulation appropriate to inter-professional business and that
necessary for the protection of savers. There are too many regulators, with
overlapping jurisdictions and conflicting styles - and, probably, too few
really first-rate people.
These issues are largely resolvable within the current legal framework,
though additional legislation would be necessary to protect pensions and to
give SIB the power to exact civil penalties as an alternative to unwieldy
criminal prosecutions.
The remaining criticisms are more intractable. Consumer protection of
individual savers is the most difficult issue tackled by the Financial
Services Act. The imbalance of knowledge between salesman and client - and,
arguably, between industry and regulator - creates very difficult problems
of investor protection. In other countries, this has been resolved by tight
control of the products that can be offered, at the price of stultifying
innovation and entrenching market share.
Free hand
The UK, by contrast, has traditionally allowed insurance companies and other
financial institutions a free hand in product innovation. Since what is sold
is uncontrolled, the debate has shifted to how it is sold. Here, the
regulators have arguably failed most dismally: an industry increasingly
desperate to find outlets for its products is permitted to feed customers
inadequate information and competes through higher commissions for
intermediaries rather than better value for investors.
This is rather different from the problem identified by Mr Newmarch: that
regulators are 'predisposed to believe that the answer to every problem lies
in the extension of their own powers'. Rather, the flaw lies in the
unwillingness of the regulators and - as Mr Newmarch acknowledges - the
industry seriously to address the complaints of consumers.
By urging the industry to face up to these complaints, Mr Newmarch has done
it a service. He deserves credit, also, for saying in public what others
have only been willing to murmur in private.
The way that financial services regulation is conducted does require
scrutiny and debate - and preferably the independent inquiry which Mr
Newmarch recommends. It is too soon to judge whether that debate should lead
to a change in the legal framework that surrounds financial services. What
is certainly needed, though, is a change in the attitude of the retail
financial services industry and those who supervise it.

Unless today's episode of The Secret Agent shows signs within the first few
minutes of speeding up, many viewers will surely desert. The first of the
three episodes was perilously slow, but at least Verloc was finally given
his mission (to blow up the Greenwich observatory) and can now set about
manipulating Stevie, his wife's cerebrally challenged younger brother. The
trouble with Conrad's bitter little tale is that when he wrote it, before
the first World War, bomb-throwing anarchists were a significant political
consideration (9.25 BBC2).
More speed might not go amiss either in Pole To Pole, the series in which
Michael Palin is travelling the world from top to bottom. Today he goes from
Istanbul to Aswan on the Nile, meeting astrologer Patric Walker (who files
his copy to the London papers from a Greek island) and the British garrison
in Akrotiri (9.35 BBC1).
The documentary series The Kennedys reached JFK's death at the end of the
last episode and is now poised to move on to Bobby (10.40 ITV). Cool Hand
Luke is a memorable chain-gang movie for several reasons, not least the
opening sequence (12.20 ITV).

FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Glorious Ninth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the 'Choral', is not long enough to fill an
evening, but what to play before it is always a puzzle. At the Barbican on
Sunday, the conductor Libor Pesek opted for something completely different:
his countryman Bohuslav Martinu's late, almost unknown Rhapsody-Concerto for
viola. The soloist was one of the London Symphony's two viola-Principals,
Paul Silverthorne. This was one of those occasions when an unfamiliar work
bears the unarguable stamp of devoted preparation. The concerto has just two
movements, each of them lyrically ruminative at unhurried tempi. The homely,
wistful air of the first gives way in the second, however, to a darker
elegiac tone and a sharp sense of loss. This performance conveyed all that
with penetration and dignity.
Nonetheless, a really distinguished 'Choral' must erase from memory anything
that has gone before. While it lasted, Pesek's 'Choral' achieved that
superbly. Though the LSO and their Chorus were on splendid form, and young
Michael Druiett's imposingly large bass led a fine solo quartet (with Nancy
Gustafson, Linda Finnie and Dennis O'Neill), it was Pesek's confident,
self-effacing hand that secured the triumph. This was the most satisfying,
un-quirky, beautifully gauged Ninth that I've heard in several years.
Nothing was forced, least of all the orchestra's tone. The peaks of the
score were reached by calmly assured ascents. All the instrumental voices
were encouraged to sing, which ensured a luminous polyphony - not just in
the Scherzo, where clarity is relatively easy (and Kurt-Hans Goedicke proved
yet again to be a peerless master of Beethoven's timpani-part), but in the
recherche thickets of the opening Allegro and the grand Adagio.
Keen music-lovers have long admired Pesek's smooth, soft-grained subtlety,
but his liquid command of this noble score demonstrated a rare authority
that one mightn't have imagined. The chock-full house was hugely
appreciative; it was heartening to find that a 1990s audience can be moved
by a purely musical Ninth, without theatrical Semtex.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: No Man's Land - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harold Pinter returns to the British stage after 24 years, showing he can
act as well as write. He takes the lead alongside Paul Eddington in his
fine, perplexing No Man's Land (1975) at the Almeida Theatre and his acting
teaches how to watch Pinter, cast off bafflement and put on enlightenment
amid silences and the sense of important happenings: take each scene
separately and trust your instincts.
No Man's Land follows Betrayal, Mountain Language, and Party Time into the
Almeida since 1990. There is drama which builds models of the world, telling
you what to think; and then there is drama like this, which leaves
everything to you. Pinter excels in the latter.
Hirst and Spooner meet in a Hampstead pub, and return to Hirst's house.
Hirst drinks, his attention strays; he takes Spooner for a stranger, then an
old friend. Foster and Briggs make up Hirst's household, occasionally
running it or run by it. The play unfolds in exchanges between these four. A
scene shifts with a gesture or silence; by turns one character appears in
charge, then cedes to another.
Given that No Man's Land is about not knowing what is going on, and the
sense of dislocation that comes from that, the best hedge against confusion
is to trust your reactions.
Parts of No Man's Land are extremely funny, the matter without the form of
farce: mistaken identity, confusion, repetition. Pinter, like Oscar Wilde,
uses the tension between the logical and the emotional import of the words.
At the end of No Man's Land, Hirst says: 'Let us change the subject. For the
last time. What have I said?' Foster replies: 'You said you're changing the
subject for the last time.' - 'But what does that mean?' - 'It means you'll
never change the subject again.' Pinter merely invites us to recreate the
world in which this exchange is accurate: straight from AJ Ayer to Zen.
Bob Crowley's black interior helps David Leveaux' direction keep the action
gloomy; the actors move deliberately between the set's totems - drinks
trolley, door, light, chair. The sense of significance hangs everywhere,
sporadically crossed by moments of despair.
The evening is made by the acting. Eddington plays Spooner superbly. He
delivers faded truths with a tilt of the head, tweedy awkwardness with a tug
at the sleeve, Champagne confidence with a hand in the pocket. Opposite him,
Pinter's fine Hirst, also stuck in no man's land, is plain and desperate,
taking each sentence as it comes. Hirst says: 'You find me in the last lap
of a race . . . I had long forgotten to run.' Spooner quips: 'A metaphor.
Things are looking up.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Mixed styles from the BBCSO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One tune that is not often heard in the nation's concert-halls is the theme
of market forces. Earlier in the year the BBC apparently decided that
audiences for its concerts at the Royal Festival Hall had dropped so low
that something had to be done. The answer was to tempt people in with a new
pricing policy, which sells all the seats unreserved at Pounds 9 or Pounds
4.
The hall was still only about half full on Saturday, but at least the
audience looked happy about getting the best seats. Given the strange clash
of styles on the programme, the numbers attracted were, in fact, not bad.
Last year the BBC Symphony Orchestra offered a nebulous piece by the Russian
composer Korndorf and it has now followed that with a mirage of a symphony
by a counterpart of his from Georgia, Giya Kancheli.
A haze of nothing in particular hangs in the air. Kancheli (born 1935) puts
much emphasis on achieving a vaguely religious atmosphere and little on
musical argument. The main aim of his Symphony No 4, 'In Memoria di
Michelangelo', here receiving its first UK performance, is to enter a
cathedral-like structure of grand and spacious emptiness.
There are a few noisy outbursts, which come from nowhere. Towards the middle
harp and celesta tinkle out what sounds like a nursery rhyme, while a pair
of solo violas later burble a rustic refrain. And that was all. Writing
about the symphony is like trying to describe one of those works of art,
which is no more than an empty canvas with a couple of doodles in the middle
and random splashes of colour around the edge.
The Viola Concerto by William Walton may not have the strongest personality
of the composer's major works, but it seemed a more vivid portrait than ever
before in this company. The mixture of brooding melancholy and unashamed
romantic open-heartedness is very much Walton's own and the viola soloist,
Tabea Zimmerman, summoned all the dark and sultry colours for which the
music calls.
Then Beethoven's Seventh Symphony banished any lingering vagueness.
Alexander Lazarev holds a no-nonsense view of the symphony in which each
movement becomes a distinct entity, leading from a lyrical opening movement
to a excitingly ferocious finale. The BBC Symphony Orchestra had been
carefully rehearsed to the extent that the slower music lacked spontaneity.
But at the end audience cheered: it had had its money's worth.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Meredith Monk - Music Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the broad church of American minimalism, Meredith Monk is a distinctive
and refreshingly unpretentious voice. While the music of many of her
contemporaries has become grandiose and self-regarding, Monk has patiently
and quietly cultivated her own furrow, crossing and recrossing the
boundaries between music, dance and theatre, developing her pieces out of
the simplest vocal ideas and the most painstaking preparation.
In Houston last year Monk unveiled her most ambitious piece to date - the
three-act opera Atlas, which Max Loppert welcomed warmly on this page. The
performers brought together for that production are now touring Britain as
the Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble, offering an hour-long concert version of
Atlas with the instrumental scoring boiled down to a pair of electronic
keyboards and an assortment of arcane percussion.
A concert performance of such a work, however witty and musically expert, is
necessarily a second best. In Monk's world the symbiosis between sound and
gesture is a totally intimate one; each depends on the other for meaning and
context. A sequence of non-verbal numbers, beautifully patterned,
attractively homespun, cannot sustain the dramatic weight it requires. The
elegant vocalise (not unlike early Laurie Anderson, without all the
electronic hardware) can be enjoyed in vacuo, but despite Monk's own
introductions to the excerpts from each act, the sense of these numbers from
Atlas building into something much more substantial was hard to imagine.
The programme begins with a sample of a theatre piece from 1990, Facing
North, Monk's celebration of the Canadian Arctic. It is a straightforward
two-hander, and the four extracts given here by Monk herself and Robert Een
suggested a delicate warm-hearted study, accumulating its patterns and tags
from Inuit melodies and spicing them with a modicum of gesture; the folksy
side of Monk is never far from the surface, yet it rarely cloys or becomes
too cosy.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Sinfonietta celebrates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its penchant for celebrating anniversaries, the London Sinfonietta is
spending this season feting its own twenty-fifth. Self-congratulatory, of
course, but pardonable: most of the music in this series was, indeed,
commissioned or co-commissioned by the Sinfonietta and its fraternal Voices,
and on average the quality has been bracingly high.
Still, claiming 'to have defined the course of contemporary music over these
past 25 years' is a bit strong. Since the end of the 1970s, the course of
'contemporary music' has branched into rivulets; the Sinfonietta has managed
to dip a cautious toe into many of them, unlike more doctrinaire ensembles,
but mostly it is loyal to its own favourites.
Saturday's programme at the Queen Elizabeth Hall started with Oliver Knussen
conducting his own Coursing (1979), potent and thrilling as ever - first a
wild unison tootling by everybody, gradually overlaid and underpinned by
slower strands which at last make a towering wall of sound. All that in just
six minutes]
The evening concluded with Elliott Carter's 1981 song-cycle In Sleep, in
Thunder, which even in a superlative performance like this (the intrepid
soloist was Jon Garrison) strikes me as one of his toughest pieces to
digest. Six Robert Lowell poems are set to angular, high-flying vocal lines,
no less vehement than the ensemble with its minatory trumpet. The idea must
be to make the dramatic implications of the verse explicit - dark, troubled,
bitter; as word-setting, however, it seems a long way off Lowell's quietly
tense style.
In between we had Robin Holloway's gentle Evening with Angels (1972), and a
characteristic idyll by Takemitsu. His 1988 Tree Line evinces all the
qualities which have kept him laden with commissions from people wanting
listener-friendly 'new' music: tranquil and pretty, with its delicate
sound-palette, in an idiom just a step beyond early Impressionist Roussel or
Florent Schmitt.
A new piece by the emigre Dmitri Smirnov, The River of Life sounded equally
sincere and out-of-its-time. Here, though, the harking-back was to Skryabin:
not to his exacerbated harmony, but to his tremulous ecstasies. As the
vision developed, a soulful trumpet sealed the resemblance. Skryabin
himself, however, might have stopped short of putting harp, celesta and
glockenspiel in unison to make his celestial effects.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Leighfield is retiring as executive chairman of AT&amp;T Istel, provoking a
game of musical bucket-seats at the US-owned company which was once the
computing arm of British Leyland.
The new man at the top will be Peter Teague (right), 38, currently the
company's director of finance and corporate services.
The present group chief executive, Chris Chiles, 48, is moving to the US as
marketing vice-president in AT&amp;T's Business Communications Services Business
Unit, where he will have special responsibilities for Europe.
John Leighfield, still only 55, is both well known and highly respected in
Europe's computing services community. Formerly with Ford and Plessey, he
joined Leyland in 1972 to pioneer the establishment of a separate IT
services company, BL Systems.
He played a leading role in the negotiations which led to a majority stake
in the company being sold to its management in 1987, and its subsequent sale
to AT&amp;T in 1989.
He will remain a non-exec-utive director of AT&amp;T Istel, thus leaving more
time for his hobby of cartography and his role as a professor at Warwick
University.
Peter Teague, a mathemat-ician and chartered accountant, was formerly a
financial adviser with Arthur Young where he was involved in Istel's
management buy-out. He joined the company in 1987.

FT  04 NOV 92 / People: Steve Bullock elected to chair ALA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steve Bullock, leader of Lewisham Council, has been elected to succeed
Margaret Hodge as chair of the Labour-dominated Association of London
Authorities.
Bullock, 39, hit stardom as the friendly face of local government in the
BBC's serial 'Town Hall' broadcast earlier this year. The Council made a
less than glamorous show - for all its 'we-got-to-the-Citizen's-Charter
first' rhetoric. But Bullock's no-nonsense bluntness scored high, for all
his penchant for floral ties.
Leader of Lewisham for four years, Bullock has spent most of his life in
local government. He worked for the Greater London Council in the 1970s, was
elected to Lewisham in the early 1980s, and was deputy leader by 1985.
Bullock, who was married last week in New York, has a hard act to follow.
Margaret Hodge consigned the loony left to the dustbin and achieved the
unthinkable - making the case for an elected Greater London authority
respectable after Ken Livingstone.
'My priority will be to ensure that London's voice is heard loud and clear
in centres of power,' Bullock said yesterday. 'The absence of a strategic
authority for the capital has left the capital falling behind in Europe and
we need to restore it to world-class status again.'
If he is serious about the voice, his first job will be to get all London's
Labour and Tory councils into one association; such was the bitterness of
the 1980s that the capital's Tory councils have their own.
Alas, he might find it easier to resurrect the GLC - or to follow Margaret
Hodge into the lucrative private sector, advising consultants on local
government.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: A strange case of jungle fever
 -How a billionaire's tropical dream is starting to pay off after 25 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention Jari in Brazilian business circles and people generally raise their
eyebrows. As the world's biggest tropical forestry project, Jari is the
product of an American shipping magnate's dream to plant trees in the Amazon
to produce pulp and paper as well as cultivate rice and raise buffalo.
After 25 years, billions of dollars, a lot of ridicule and setbacks, Jari
may just be turning into a model for industrial development and silviculture
in tropical rainforests.
The project, now run by a group of Brazilian companies, is the largest
employer in the Amazon and this year expects its first net profit. More
important, it is defying the established view that poor Amazonian soil would
not support large-scale agroforestry.
Arriving at the remote site at the confluence of the Amazon and Jari rivers,
it is easy to see why the project was labelled crazy. Accessible only by
small aeroplane or slowboat from Belem, 250 miles away, Jari is a bizarre
sight.
Skimming over lush forest for more than an hour, the aeroplane lands in
Monte Dourado, a neat but somewhat out-of-place company town complete with
club, hospital and identical houses with front lawns.
Drive through the jungle and suddenly at the edge of a muddy river in the
middle of nowhere arises a gleaming metal pulp mill and powerplant. Pines
that would look more at home in the Swiss alps grow in sandy fields. In
cleared areas herds of bemused water buffalo wander, looking as if they
would rather be wallowing in the mud far away.
Nowadays, environmental concerns mean that permission would never be granted
for such a project. But back in the late 1960s Brazil's military rulers were
eager to 'colonise' the Amazon, which makes up 60 per cent of national
territory. Started in 1967, Jari owes its existence to the determination of
the late billionaire Daniel K Ludwig, who loved to do things which everyone
said were impossible.
Intended as his crowning glory, the scheme to tame the jungle and install a
pulp mill, buffalo farm and rice plantation in an area the size of Belgium,
was the biggest and craziest of all.
Convinced of an impending world food and fibre shortage, Ludwig sent men all
over the world in search of the perfect tree for pulp. He also needed a
parcel of land near a deep water harbour in a country with cheap labour.
Undaunted by its remoteness he settled on Jari, an area of wild jungle
populated only by Indians, monkeys and a few rubber-tappers. Inside its 1.6m
hectares, Ludwig built a port, railroad, 9,000km of roads and the town of
Monte Dourado from scratch, shipping in people from the northeast and
industrialised south.
The first problem came when the seedlings planted on the newly cleared land
promptly died. Already 69 when the project began, Ludwig was in a hurry.
Rather than experimenting with many species to see which fared best in the
poor Amazonian soil, he risked millions on a monoculture of gmelina, a tree
native to India and Burma, chosen because it could be harvested for pulp in
just six years.
Gmelina was a disaster, succumbing to disease when it finally did grow. In
1973, Ludwig brought in pine trees, planting many thousands of hectares.
These, however, grew slowly in the sandy soil and torrential rains. The rice
plantation was a dismal failure despite a complicated system of irrigation
by dykes.
In 1978, undaunted by such setbacks, Ludwig shipped in a Japanese pulp mill
with 220,000 tonnes per year capacity. A wood-fired power plant was also
ordered, towed by barges across three oceans and up the Amazon in 87 days.
A year later, eucalyptus was planted and it is now the main crop, taking up
40 per cent of the 100,000 hectares of planted trees. By this time, Jari had
become the focus of Brazilian fears that imperialist foreigners would
expropriate the Amazon.
Rumours abounded that it was an American military training camp. Unable to
find partners or finance, Ludwig had to abandon plans for a second pulp mill
and newsprint plant. Jari was put up for sale in 1980 amid a financial and
managerial crisis.
Ludwig's planned investments of Dollars 300m-Dollars 500m (Pounds
180m-Pounds 300m) had run into billions, while the first year of pulp mill
operation in 1979 saw revenues of just Dollars 70m instead of the Dollars
300m he had predicted.
In 1982 Jari was bought for around Dollars 300m by a group of 22 Brazilian
companies. With the government providing finance and technology in the form
of advisers from Embrapa, the Agricultural Research Institute, the Jari
company is now producing 291,000 tonnes of pulp per year, of which 80 per
cent is exported. This year it will finally move out of the red.
The turnaround has been mostly due to the new attention on technical
concerns. Facing an imminent lack of wood, the new owners decided to
increase the diameter of trees, increase plantation size, and cultivate a
type of eucalyptus more suitable to local conditions.
Contracted in 1984, Sergio Coutinho, the project's forest adviser, developed
a new model. After extensive soil surveys which discovered 23 different soil
types, he classified the land depending on how intensely it could stand
alteration - low, medium, high or very high - and it is now exploited
accordingly. A soil correction programme was initiated as well as cloning to
produce the best tree for each area.
Coutinho has no illusions about the immensity of the task. 'Man is by nature
a destroyer. The big challenge here has been to develop this large frontier
of tropical forest differently.'
As a result of his work Jari has shown an incredible increase in
productivity. Eucalyptus is now yielding an annual 27.7 cu m/hectare - 110
per cent up on 1982; pine 19.9 - 49 per cent up; and gmelina 22.6 - 18.9 per
cent up. These results fly in the face of traditional wisdom that the
shallow nature of Amazonian soil would cause productivity to decrease,
forcing the land to be abandoned as has happened in agricultural projects
all over the forest.
'We expected that with such poor soil, the first rotation would grow but
then production would fall. Instead we now have areas on their third and
fourth rotation and the yield is rising,' Coutinho says. He believes that
through forest management combined with adjusting trees to local soil
characteristics, average yield could reach 40 cu m/hec by the end of this
decade.
A natural target of attack by green activists, environmental concerns have
top priority at Jari. Dismissing the thesis that the forest should be left
untouched as 'absurdly romantic - the people of the Amazon deserve a decent
living too,' Coutinho points out that exploited areas account for less than
10 per cent of the total land. Native forest has been left on slopes and
around water and in 400m-wide bands between plantations to allow circulation
of animals as well as acting as a barrier against the spreading of disease.
Eight 20,000-hectare genetic reserves have been created to serve as fully
preserved control samples of areas of different forest types to be cut down
for economic activity. Coutinho's team has catalogued more than 629 species
of trees, all of which are monitored in situ.
Nevertheless, the sight of rows of spindly eucalyptus replacing centuries
old Amazonian trees is shocking. But Eduardo Barreto, president of the Jari
company, says: 'Producing pulp in the Amazon exposes you to fire, but
criticism is based on ignorance. We have four hectares of native forest for
every one of planted forest. We are protecting biodiversity and proving that
it's possible to generate an environmentally friendly and economically sound
business in the Amazon.'
Ludwig's dream of taming the jungle may not have been realised, nor would
anyone cite Jari as the solution to the Amazon's development problem, but
after 25 years of hard work and enormous amounts of money at least it is
providing an example.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Scott's clean sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As pulp manufacturers gather in London next week to negotiate their annual
round of contracts with buyers, many are being asked about their
environmental performance for the first time.
Their answers may well be crucial. Scott, the world's largest tissue
manufacturer, has decided to exclude suppliers that fail the group's
environmental standards, even if they are cheaper than competitors. At stake
is the 150,000 tonnes of paper Scott uses in the UK every year. In future,
the 700,000 tonnes it consumes in Europe annually will be scrutinised.
Martin Kybert, environmental affairs manager, explains that an assessment of
the life-cycle of its products showed the greatest impact could be made in
the manufacture of wood pulp.
The company launched a two-year environmental assessment programme of its
pulp suppliers. They were asked to provide details of their emissions,
including carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Their forestry practices and
replanting policies were also considered.
The differences, says Kybert, were startling. In the worst case, one
supplier produced 17 times more carbon dioxide than the best supplier.
Scott dropped three of the worst suppliers, which were in North America and
Scandinavia, while giving preferential treatment to the best. Those dropped
represented 10 per cent of all its suppliers.
'Some of those excluded were really surprised. Nobody had ever asked them
before for details of their carbon dioxide emissions,' said Kybert. One
supplier is investing heavily in new plant and telephoning regularly to
report progress.
Kybert says Scott can gain competitive advantage through better
environmental performance. Consumers are demanding products that are less
damaging to the environment but that do not compromise on quality and value
for money.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Roll out timber carpet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US carpet company, Collins and Aikman, has turned the messy business of
carpet recycling on its head.
Instead of labouring to separate the components of a carpet, which often
include wool, nylon and latex or bitumen and several years of grit, the
company has found a way to grind up old carpet and add a catalyst to create
a synthetic timber.
The market for recycling carpets is potentially huge. Millions of tonnes of
carpets are dumped each year in landfill sites in Europe and North America.
Dumping costs up to 75 cents a yard, according to US chemicals company Du
Pont. It may not even be an option for much longer: in Germany, for example,
proposals are being considered to force manufacturers to take back old
carpets.
Recycling has proved impossible. Like unscrambling an egg, it is tough to
separate a carpet into its original components.
Collins and Aikman's solution is to granulate the carpet, backing and all,
and then mix and extrude it with a catalyst. The resulting material can be
mixed with other waste plastics before being moulded into a range of
products including chairs and tables, marine timber, toothbrush handles and
weatherproof flooring. A park bench made from recycled carpet is already on
sale in the US at Dollars 240 (Pounds 150).
The catch is price. The synthetic wood is two to three times more expensive
than timber. But the company argues that buyers of the carpet would save
money through not having to pay for incineration or landfill charges, while
buyers of the synthetic wood benefit from a material which lasts 15 to 25
years instead of five for treated wood.
The company has spent Dollars 8m on new production equipment at its plant in
Dalton, Georgia. 'We will recycle any vinyl-backed carpet free of charge.'
says David Pyles, managing director of international sales at Collins and
Aikman. 'We'll need all the carpet we can get.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Jobs: The long fuse of the human time-bomb - Even after two
years of recession, the crunch effects of plunging morale may be still to
come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors sit in the boardroom confronted by financial crisis. After
grim discussion the decision is taken. They draw up orders for 15 per cent
cuts in staffing all round.
Getting wind of the plan, the personnel manager asks the board for a
hearing. 'I've been reading some research,' he says, 'and it shows that if
you just impose these cuts, they'll have a counter-productive effect on the
staff we keep.' But the directors, after listening impatiently, put the plan
into force.
What happens afterwards was described by the American consultant, Dr Saul
Gellerman, during the Institute of Personnel Management's conference in
Harrogate. Adding gradually to a graph as he went along, he sketched the
typical changes in a company's profitability and its staff's morale and
productivity, which follow peremptory actions such as the sackings cited
above.
The first of the three graphs, A - just up to the right - shows the position
at the end of the first period (which might be a year) after the cuts were
imposed. The thick line represents profitability, which has risen quickly as
a result of reduced costs. The double line represents the employees' morale,
and the grey line below it their productivity, which have both gone on as
before.
At this point, the directors are apt to write off the personnel manager as a
scaremonger whose forebodings have not proved justified. But the research he
mentioned to the board a year earlier was the work of Rensis Likert, of the
Michigan Institute of Social Research, who found that people's morale and
productivity are conditioned by inertia.
When life gets tough humans tend to go on as before for a while, hoping the
hard times will go away again as suddenly as they came. 'The dawn comes
slowly,' Dr Gellerman said, 'but when people see that this isn't just
temporary, the inertia is overcome.'
Graph B shows the position at the end of the third year after the cuts.
Productivity first rose again, albeit less steeply, then levelled off. In
the second year morale started to worsen, and very soon afterwards
productivity also began declining as shown by absenteeism, substandard work,
lack of co-operation and so on.
Once the continue-as-before inertia is overcome, morale and productivity
will go on falling with added momentum. But the less labour-intensive a
company is, the longer the deterioration will stay hidden. In any case, it
will probably be well down the slope before its effect starts to show in
worsening profitability. And it is not until that point, if at all, that the
top executives are likely to remember the personnel manager's warning and
make efforts to regain the confidence and co-operation of their staff.
But what then? According to the research, the same inertia that kept morale
and productivity level for a while following the cuts, will keep them
deteriorating after steps are taken to reverse the decline.
So here we are at C, the end of the fourth year, with the vertical line P
marking the point at which efforts to restore health were begun. If they
were well devised, although profits will continue falling, morale and
productivity will eventually level out for a while before starting to
improve. A bit later, all else being equal, profitability will follow suit.
On the other hand, the top executives may not appreciate the effect of
inertia. Having taken the restorative action only to find it's still not
noticeably working six months later, they might get tough again instead. If
so, said Dr Gellerman, not only morale and productivity but profits to boot
are apt to plummet through the bottom of the chart.
AT which point, I'll pause and ask if any reader has noticed anything odd.
Some who'll certainly have done so are people who were at the Institute of
Personnel Management's conference in Harrogate only last week. For they'll
know Saul Gellerman was not on the programme.
The fact is that, although he has spoken at an IPM conference, it was 24
years ago. The Jobs column has reason to remember it. Except for minor
changes, the above report on what he said was my first article the FT
published, on October 15 1968.
What has sent me back to it, however, is a very contemporary event. It
happened in last week's conference session on motivating workers. Right at
the end, after discussion of the latest research, one of the audience stood
up and said his company had cut its staff savagely, and all those left were
terrified of losing their jobs too.
'They're now working harder, longer and better than ever before,' he
continued. 'What need do managements have of motivation, when so much can be
achieved just by fear?'
On the day, answer came there none - and the silence brought to mind the
late Rensis Likert's work on inertia, as explained by Saul Gellerman so long
ago.
The problem was not cost-cuts as such, he added, but how they were
interpreted by the workforce. Several firms studied had emerged unharmed,
especially when staff had participated in making the crisis decision. And
oddly enough, though that word has lost vogue over the past decade, the
latest evidence is that letting people participate in deciding what's to
happen, is one of the more effective ways of motivating them.
As to whether Rensis Likert's venerable findings still apply in the 1990s,
we'll have to wait and see. Although Britain's recession has been prolonged,
it is only two years or so since the swingeing staff-cutting began. If the
theory is right, where the effects of plunging morale are concerned, the
crunch may be yet to come.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Insurer fined Pounds 80,000 for breaches of rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent

<TEXT>
LONDON AND Manchester Assurance has been fined Pounds 80,000 by the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) - the largest such
fine levied on any insurance company to date - for breaches of sales rules.
It has been ordered to pay the costs of the investigation.
The breaches occurred among 18 of London and Manchester's 540 tied agency
sales outlets, which are not employed by the company directly but which sell
its products exclusively. The company has since reviewed its tied agency
network and pared the number to 250.
Tied agents have been targetted by Lautro for special supervision. All the
19 serious compliance faults uncovered by Lautro in the year to June 30
involved tied agents.
London and Manchester is reviewing policies sold by the tied agents and
expects to make refunds to customers who were sold policies that were
clearly unsuitable.
An official said compensation to clients might total 'hundreds of thousands
of pounds'.
Among the rule breaches were contraventions of the Code of Conduct by
company representatives, and London and Manchester's failure to monitor
adequately new business they sold.
Also, sales agents were not screened properly before being hired and were
allowed to sell policies before they were properly qualified. The character
and suitability of agents was not properly monitored before or after they
were hired, nor were adequate records kept.
Lautro said London and Manchester had since strengthened its compliance
procedures and improved training and supervision of sales agents.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Prudential chief urges statutory regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELF-REGULATION of the UK's financial services industry was a failed
experiment, Mr Mick Newmarch, chairman of Prudential Corporation, Britain's
largest life insurer, said last night. He said it should be scrapped and
replaced with statutory regulation.
'The Financial Services Act is an unsatisfactory basis for the adequate
protection of savers,' Mr Newmarch said in a lecture at the Staple Inn
Actuarial Society.
'The implementation of the act was bold and well intentioned but the
government should now acknowledge that the experiment has failed and begin
to organise investor protection on a fully statutory basis under direct
government control.'
He also called on his own industry, life insurance, to face up to valid
criticism of its sales practices launched by consumer groups, the Office of
Fair Trading and the press.
If the OFT cannot be persuaded to endorse current practices 'we must take on
board the message that our products and our methods of presenting them have
not kept pace with the changing expectations of the public'.
After Mr Newmarch's speech, the audience of about 300 life insurance and
pensions practitioners expressed near-unanimous support for his proposals
through a show of hands.
His remarks come as the Securities and Investments Board, chief watchdog for
the self-regulatory system, prepares a review for the Treasury about its
role. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, has said he favours more statutory
regulation.
Mr Newmarch's remarks are the first call in public by any leading industry
figure to scrap self-regulation and the first public acknowledgement by the
industry of consumer concerns.
Mr Newmarch said he hoped to prompt the industry to begin thinking
constructively about alternative regulatory structures. He also said the
SIB's efforts to reorganise self-regulation for retail financial services -
the toughest issue now before it - faced failure.
The SIB a new framework, the Personal Investments Authority, to subsume two
existing bodies, Fimbra and Lautro, as well as absorb a third of the
membership of another, Imro.
The life insurance industry in general, and Prudential in particular, had
warned it would not join the new PIA unless banks and building societies
joined. So far, those have shown no inclination to join.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Big UK companies back PM's stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest companies yesterday gave near-unanimous backing to the
government's pro-Maastricht stance and warned that the country faced
continuing recession and deepening isolation if its political commitment to
Europe faltered.
More than 50 of the country's biggest corporations contacted by the
Financial Times on the eve of the critical Commons debate said a No vote
risked leaving Britain as a 'semi-detached' member of the Community,
powerless to influence events.
There is evident impatience at the uncertainty surrounding Britain's future
role in Europe and a desire to see an end to a period of mounting confusion.
Many companies voiced fears that Britain's ability to exploit fully the
single market would be seriously undermined if it were not to ratify the
treaty and that inward investment into Britain would be badly hit if the
country appeared to be increasingly isolated within the EC.
Though many companies want the government to clarify elements of the treaty,
they believe its ratification remains an inevitable step in Europe's
political and economic development. Most chief executives say that, whatever
the doubts over Maastricht, the vote will send an important message to
Britain's EC partners and that it must be positive.
Britain's smallest companies appear most hesitant about the implications of
integration. The Federation of Small Businesses said it supported a
referendum on Maastricht, claiming the treaty offered 'threats and
promises'. It feared the negative aspects would hit smaller companies.
A more widespread view was put by Mr Barry Stephens, chairman and chief
executive of Siebe, the engineering group, who said a No vote would
seriously damage Britain's trading and manufacturing prospects. 'I believe
the penalty will be profound - in one word isolation.'
Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, said Britain had to demonstrate political
commitment to reap the full advantages of the single market. 'Now is the
time to move forward from a decade of half-hearted commitment to Europe to a
real commitment.'
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury, the grocery group, said: 'We
cannot keep pretending that we are half-in half-out. To be out would be
disastrous but to be constantly debating whether we are in or not seems to
me to be equally ludicrous.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Observer: Clear as Bell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mystery - what mystery? Amateur sleuths' continuing search for the real-life
original of Sherlock Holmes is exasperating Observer, especially the latest
claim by devotees that the model was American burglar-alarm inventor Edwin
Holmes who had a partner called Thomas Watson.
The matter was cleared up some 70 years back by the detective's creator Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle who said the original was one of his tutors, Scots
surgeon Joseph Bell.
Here is Doyle's own description, quoted in The Story of 25 Years published
by the News Chronicle company in 1935:
'He was a very skilful surgeon, but his strong point was diagnosis, not only
of disease, but of occupation and character . . . . In one of his best
cases, he said to a civilian patient:
Well, my man, you've served in the army? - Aye, sir.
Not long discharged? - No, sir.
A Highland regiment? - Aye, sir.
Non-commissioned officer? - Aye, sir.
Stationed at Barbados? - Aye, sir.
''You see, gentlemen,' he would explain, 'the man is a respectful man, but
did not remove his hat. They do not in the army, but he would have learned
civilian ways had he long been discharged. He has an air of authority and he
is obviously Scottish. As to Barbados, his complaint is elephantiasis, which
is West Indian and not British.''

With gold prices languishing, analyst Graham Birch has long been
recommending producers to cash in on the huge mark-ups available in the
jewellery market. The message seems to be getting through: Western Mining
Corporation, one of Australia's big gold producers, is now offering
shareholders and employees 'the rare opportunity to purchase quality, 18
carat gold jewellery'.
Birch points out that the WMC scheme shows what 'added value' in the gold
market is all about. The corporation is offering, among other items, a
bangle containing not quite one ounce of gold. At today's prices the
intrinsic value of this bauble is about Pounds 175. The price WMC is
charging is Pounds 762.
But, as Birch says, 'WMC is generously throwing in postage and packing for
nothing'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The art of the metaphor is flourishing in South Africa - a country not known
for flights of linguistic fancy.
Thus a few months ago an ANC-aligned group of economists and academics
produced a set of economic analogies which took inspiration from the zoo.
South Africa, it said, faced four scenario options: ostrich, lame duck,
Icarus, and flamingo. These amount to: still keeping heads in the sand;
failing to fly because of structural defects; soaring towards prosperity,
but collapsing in a heap of populist inflation; and flying off serenely into
a glowing sunset.
Now, Nico Cyzpionka, group economist with the Standard Bank group, has
sought refuge in the sea, with apologies to Shakespeare. He says South
Africa has three options: A Midsummer Night's Dream, with 'fair weather,
favourable tides and a sound ship'; All's Well that Ends Well, where 'those
at the helm sail the ship into calmer waters'; and 'The Tempest' where the
wrong course sinks the ship.

If you are wondering about the City analyst who has been turning in those
hefty profit warnings on your company, Citigate may be able to help.
The PR pundits who last week, with Price Waterhouse, published the third
annual Who's Who of Analysts, have just finished reading the tea-leaves on
the information gathered during the course of the directory's compilation.
The stereotype teenage scribblers emerge roughly as follows:
They are male (86 per cent), probably married (64 per cent), and
Oxbridge-educated (24 per cent). A staggeringly well-prepared 16 per cent
have read economics, with the next most popular degree (5 per cent) business
studies. Recruiters obviously pay attention to star signs, because a pushy
and determined 11 per cent are Aries, whereas only a complex, introverted 6
per cent are Scorpios. They are in their mid-30s, and are most interested
(what an uninspired lot) in travel, music and golf.
Their pressured existence notwithstanding, Messrs Average Analyst are big
achievers in the marital stability stakes - with a nationally highly
atypical O84 per cent divorced. The same cannot be said, however, of their
record on the employment continuity front.
Of course, we did know that analysts were an itinerant bunch - shoved from
pillar to post by their employers these days as much as being desperately in
search of the bigger bonus. But Citigate can now reveal that, among those
analysts at firms which appear in both the 1989 and the 1992 surveys, only a
paltry 31.5 per cent have not changed sides in the intervening three years.
'Think of the savings for the pension funds,' mused one scribbler, the
fruits of whose research has landed on his clients' desks from a number of
different addresses.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Legal threat seen over ERM stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN may find itself taken before the European Court of Justice and
threatened with fines if it ratifies the Maastricht Treaty then keeps the
pound outside the European exchange rate mechanism indefinitely, a Tory
barrister warned yesterday.
In a paper that was strongly disputed by the Treasury last night, Mr Martin
Howe, a member of the executive committee of the Society of Conservative
Lawyers, said the UK would be in breach of its European treaty obligations
if it pursued an independent exchange rate policy for more than a limited
period after Maastricht takes effect.
He said the UK would be obliged to accept the legal obligations of stages 1
and 2 of European monetary union and treat its exchange rate policy 'as a
matter of common interest' with other member states if the Treaty comes into
force.
Although Britain can opt out of stage 3 of monetary union with its
'irrevocably fixed' parities, Mr Howe emphasised that it has not opted out
of the lesser objective of exchange rate convergence. Under the Maastricht
convergence criteria, Britain would be required to put sterling into the
narrow band of the ERM and maintain it there without devaluation.
The UK's EC partners would be 'effectively in a position to insist in the
long term upon maintenance of an ERM exchange rate policy as a condition of
(UK) access to the internal market,' Mr Howe said.
He said that Britain, if it chose to stay outside the ERM indefinitely and
Maastricht went ahead, could expect steadily mounting pressure from other
member states, followed by representations from the EC Commission that the
UK's stance did not live up to its Treaty obligations. The issue could then
be referred to the European court if the UK were to pursue a floating
exchange rate policy indefinitely.
Mr Howe's views are potentially embarrassing to the government as it
struggles for a majority in tonight's paving motion on the Maastricht bill.
They were published by the Centre for Policy Studies, a Conservative party
think tank. However, the CPS said Mr Howe's paper did not reflect the
centre's corporate view.
The Treasury said: 'We reject this argument absolutely. The Maastricht
Treaty nowhere imposes any obligation on a member state to be in the ERM
either for legal or policy reasons.'

FT  04 NOV 92 / Senior Tories join property bill revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers strongly attacked the government in the Commons last night
for failing to ensure adequate compensation for leasehold property owners
who may be forced to sell their freeholds to tenants.
Mr Jerry Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare and a former junior defence
minister joined with Labour MPs in voting against the Housing and Urban
Development Bill. It was given a second reading by a government majority of
68 (327-259).
Earlier, Mr Michael Jopling, chief whip in the first Thatcher administration
and a former minister of agriculture, protested that many Tory backbenchers
were 'astonished that this government, of all governments, should be seeking
to force people to sell their property'.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, who wound up the debate, held out little
hope of significant changes being made to the bill.
The likelihood of sustained attempts by Tory backbenchers to secure more
generous treatment for freehold owners during the bill's committee stage was
acknowledged by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.
Mr Jopling, MP for Westmoreland and Lonsdale, dismissed as 'nothing of the
sort' government claims that the freehold of such properties would be
acquired by leaseholders at a fair market price.
He told Mr Howard that the bill gave 'great offence to very many of us'.
Mr Wiggin complained that the bill would provide substantial benefit to
leaseholders at the expense of freeholders.
He said a more appropriate title for the move would be the 'Building
Societies (Robin Hood) Bill'.
Mr Howard insisted that the fair compensation provisions in the bill did not
warrant such criticism.
Refusing to accept Mr Jopling's 'strictures', he said it was impossible to
reform property law without affecting existing interests.
Mr Howard told critics of the bill: 'What is important is that interests
which are so affected should be the subject of proper compensation. I
contend that the bill provides for compensation.'
He said up to 750,000 tenants of leasehold flats and houses would have the
opportunity to buy their freeholds.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's shadow environment secretary, condemned the
government for not including a single line in the bill for building a single
home at a time when there were record homeless people.
Mr Straw said inclusion in the bill of a 'rent to mortgages' scheme when
thousands of owner-occupiers were having their properties repossessed
underscored the government's failure to address the real needs of the
nation.
Mr Michael Alison, Conservative MP for Selby and parliamentary spokesman for
the Church Commissioners, warned that the bill would effectively drive them
and other similar charities out of their traditional housing role in
residential property investment and management.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Working week still shrinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS and manual workers are continuing to negotiate reductions in the
working week in spite of the recession, according to a report from Incomes
Data Services, the independent pay analysts.
Almost one in 10 organisations have cut, or agreed to cut, basic working
hours during the past year.
By autumn 1992, manual workers in 60 per cent of engineering and related
industries had a 37 1/2 -hour week or less and a quarter of all
organisations used a week of 37 or 37 1/2 hours for blue-collar workers.
The most common holiday entitlement was 25 days plus public holidays. The
past two years have shown a rise in the number of companies giving maternity
pay and leave above the statutory entitlement and a sharp increase in those

FT  04 NOV 92 / Cheese factory rescue fails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A YORKSHIRE businessman who wanted cheesemaking to resume at the now defunct
Hawes creamery in Wensleydale has withdrawn his offer to buy the plant after
months of inconclusive negotiations with its owners, Dairy Crest.
The decision by Mr Martin Sterne, a Ripon businessman, is a serious blow for
the Hawes Dairy Rescue Committee, a group of local businesspeople that has
led the campaign to save Wensleydale's last commercial cheese-making site.
The committee had strongly supported Mr Sterne's bid, thought to have been
about Pounds 250,000, in the belief that it offered the best chance of
safeguarding Wensleydale's 800- year-old cheesemaking tradition and that it
would create much-needed employment.
Mr Peter Annison, a member of the committee and chairman of Hawes Chamber of
Trade, said yesterday the committee sympathised with Mr Sterne's decision to
pull out of talks with Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board's manufacturing
subsidiary.
Mr Annison said: 'We've always had the suspicion that Dairy Crest were not
interested in allowing that site to be sold to potential competition; that
suspicion has grown as the weeks and months have gone by. It's very sad for
the area.'
Dairy Crest closed the creamery in May and moved Wensleydale production to
its plant in Longridge, Lancashire, to increase competitiveness and cut
surplus capacity. The closure cost remote Hawes 59 jobs.
Mr Sterne sold catering butchers Holmesterne to the Sims Food Group several
years ago.
He made his offer for the creamery in the summer after lower bids by the
rescue committee were rejected.
He now plans to concentrate on developing his new catering butchers
business, Smith and Sterne, based at Wetherby, West Yorkshire.
Local hopes of reopening the creamery now hang on a bid by several ex-Hawes
management staff who have avoided publicity.
Dairy Crest denied yesterday that it did not want to see cheesemaking resume
at Hawes, but declined to say why no deal had yet been concluded. 'We are
continuing negotiations with other interested parties,' it said.

FT  04 NOV 92 / Waste incinerator in north-east wins approval
</HEADLINE>

THE GOVERNMENT has given approval for Cory Environmental to build an
industrial waste incinerator at Seal Sands, Teesside.
Rejections were announced by the Department of the Environment yesterday for
proposals for two other incinerators, for sewage sludge and industrial
waste, in north-east England.
Yesterday's decision follows a six-month public inquiry two years ago that
heard appeals against rejection of planning permission for all three.
Northumbrian Environmental Management, the Northumbrian Water subsidiary and
a partner in the rejected proposals for sites at Howdon, Tyne and Wear, and
Portrack, Cleveland, said the decision left it with a serious difficulty
because of the ban on sewage sludge dumping at sea after 1998.
NEM said: 'Incineration is the only safe and effective way of dealing with
the large quantities of sewage sludge generated in the region.'
It said the region had the country's highest concentration of chemical and
pharmaceutical companies and faced a 'crisis' in waste management and
disposal.
Integrated Environmental Management, the joint venture between NEM and
US-owned International Technology Europe that proposed the rejected plants,
is expected to appeal.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said the Seal Sands
incinerator site, unlike the other two, had been designated for special
industrial use. He said the appeals were complex, particularly because of
residents' environmental concerns.
Residents and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside development corporations
welcomed rejection of the Howdon and Portrack proposals.
