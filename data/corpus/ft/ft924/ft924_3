FT  22 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: German prices rise on interest rate hopes

GERMAN government bond prices rose on hopes of lower interest rates after Mr
Theo Waigel, the finance minister, was quoted in the press saying that a cut
in interest rates would be the most effective single measure to revive the
German economy.
The Liffe bund future contract crept up from 91.77 to a high of 91.97 before
ending the day at around 91.95, but volume was low at about 9,500 contracts.
Two of the German states reported their inflation figures for the month to
mid-December yesterday. The cost of living in Bavaria climbed 0.2 per cent
in the month to mid-December from mid-November, giving a year-on-year rise
of 4.0 per cent. In Baden-Wurttemberg, prices rose 0.2 per cent in the
month, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.5 per cent.
Last week, Hesse announced a 0.2 per cent rise month-on-month, giving a
year-on-year increase of 4.2 per cent.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, French government bonds closed slightly higher as
pressure on the French franc eased slightly in the foreign exchange markets.
The Bank of France left the intervention rate unchanged at 9.10 per cent at
its securities repurchase tender, but kept market conditions tight by
draining FFr2.4bn in liquidity from the system.
The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 opened with a yield of 8.29 per cent and
ended at 8.27 per cent. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the March
bond futures contract rose from 111.12 to 111.30 although volume was light
ahead of the Christmas holiday.
US Treasury prices posted solid gains in thin trading yesterday as the
market prepared for the week's note auctions and the end of the year.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 102
3/4 , yielding 7.384 per cent. However, prices at the short end of the
market, were flat, with the two-year note trading unchanged at 100, yielding
4.606 per cent.
The lack of fresh economic news meant that attention was focused on
forthcoming supply. Today, the Treasury will sell Dollars 15.5bn in two-year
notes, and tomorrow another Dollars 11.25bn will be raised from the sale of
five-year notes.
Many of the market's players have closed their books for the end of the
year, so traders are expecting demand for the new paper to be weak, which
could push up rates in the short-term. This expectation, plus some
short-covering by dealers and futures-related buying, helped lift prices at
the long end.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds drifted lower in very thin pre-holiday trade, with the
Liffe gilt future slipping to 99.17 from 99.23.
JAPANESE government bonds closed firmer. They were given a lift by buying
from some of the agricultural institutions, dealers said.
Trading volumes were thin and the yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB ended at
4.6 per cent, having moved in a range of 4.595 per cent to 4.61 per cent.
The March futures contract moved in a range of 107.54 to 107.65, and ended
at 107.59 against its close of 107.58 on Friday. The Bank of Japan said
money supply shrank 0.5 per cent in November from a year earlier. This
compared with a 0.6 per cent fall in October. The figure was in line with
expectations.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Syndicated Loans: Italians pay the price in post-Efim market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN borrowers are returning to the international syndicated loan
markets, but in some cases are having to pay more for their funds as a
result of the recent Efim affair.
Efim, the Italian state holding company, was put into voluntary liquidation
in July, and bankers are still waiting to receive their money back.
Italian borrowers were absent from the international syndicated loans market
while bankers lobbied the Italian authorities for a commitment to repay
Efim's debts in full.
The Italian authorities eventually agreed to repay the loans in full.
However, some Italian borrowers who recently launched syndicated credits
have found they are paying double what they would have paid before the Efim
affair.
In addition, bankers claim the Efim affair has forced them to examine
Italian companies' balance sheets more closely. They expect only the top
tier of Italian borrowers to participate in the syndicated loans market, in
spite of the fact that a number of Italian names have heavy borrowing
requirements.
The market is still struggling to find the proper pricing level. Monte dei
Paschi di Siena (MPS) attracted some attention last week with an Ecu50m,
10-year facility for its mortgage lending subsidiary, Monte Paschi Fondiario
e Opere Pubbliche.
Led by Hill Samuel, Bayerische Landesbank, Italian International Bank and
Monte dei Paschi, the deal carries a margin of 52 1/2 basis points over the
London interbank offered rate (Libor) for the first five years, rising to 57
1/2 basis points over Libor thereafter.
The pricing was described as aggressive by some bankers. A similar deal for
MPS, signed in January this year, started at 47.5 basis points over Libor
for five years, rising to 50 basis points for the final five years. The
premium of 5-7 1/2 basis points is considered by some bankers to be too low
in the wake of the Efim affair.
While the 26 1/4 basis points commitment fee and front-end fees ranging from
20 to 35 basis points make the all-in yield around 60 basis points, bankers
maintain this is not generous enough, and many would have been happier if
MPS had not been looking for such long-term funds.
MPS has the status of a foundation and no beneficial owner.
By comparison, a recently completed Dollars 57.5m 2 1/2 -year loan for
Isveimer, the state-owned development bank for southern Italy, carried a
margin of 50 basis points over Libor and offered front-end fees of up to 60
basis points for a more generous all-in yield of around 70 basis points.
Before the Efim affair the margins that Isveimer was paying were lower
though on a rising trend. At the end of 1990, for example, it was paying 25
to 27 1/2 basis points over Libor for seven-year money.
The pricing on its latest facility, arranged by Chase Manhattan, was
dictated by the borrower's recent Dollars 150m five-year floating-rate note
issue.
That offered investors 75 basis points over Libor and a put option every six
months in an attempt to overcome fears about investing in Italy.
In spite of the short maturity and generous yield, the loan was not a
success. The syndicate is complete, but only one of the six banks joining
Chase is not Italian.
Bankers warn against reading too much into the success of Fiat's recent
five-year revolving credit, which was increased to Dollars 800m from the
original Dollars 500m.
Vattenfall, the Swedish electricity producer and distributor, announced its
debut in the international capital markets with a Dollars 750m
multi-currency Eurocommercial paper programme established through Swiss Bank
Corp, the arranger. SBC is joined as a dealer by Deutsche Bank, Lehman
Brothers, JP Morgan and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.
Funds are described as being mainly for working capital, bridge financing
and liquidity reserve purposes.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Bonds: World Bank plans two global issues in
the new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank is planning two global bond issues in the first few weeks of
1993. The bank is looking at the 30-year end of the yield curve for its next
global US dollar issue, early in the new year, said Ms Jessica Einhorn, the
bank's treasurer, probably to raise a maximum of Dollars 1.5bn.
The bank is also planning its first global D-Mark issue, to raise about
DM3bn, for the end of January or early February.
The bank is considering including a feature allowing the dollar bonds to be
stripped of their coupons, which would then be sold as a separate series of
zero-coupon issues.
'The consensus view is that this would make it more marketable to
investors,' said Mr Kenneth Lay, the bank's director of financial
operations.
The bank plans to use the global structure for all future large
transactions, whatever the pattern of international demand at the time of
issue, said Mr Lay.
Now halfway through its fiscal year, the bank is reviewing its borrowing
programme for 1992-93.
Of the original Dollars 13.5bn target, about Dollars 7bn-equivalent has been
raised.
Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB) has established a Dollars 1bn Euro
medium-term note programme as part of its plans to increase its borrowing on
the international capital markets.
The bank, which has an explicit Baden-Wurttemberg state guarantee and a
triple-A debt rating, plans to raise DM7bn to DM8bn internationally in 1993,
up from DM5bn this year, said Ms Gertraud Foos-Olsson, deputy director of
the bank's new issues and derivatives department.
This will account for about half its total borrowing requirements of DM15bn
to DM16bn, with the rest being raised domestically, Ms Foos-Olsson said.
The bank plans to tap the Eurodollar bond market at least twice next year
for up to half the total, and make at least two large benchmark issues in
the international D-Mark market to raise Dollars 1.5 to Dollars 2bn.
LKB also regards French francs and Euroyen as currencies where it should
borrow at least once, and does not rule out further issues in currencies
where cheap funds are available, in addition to its strategic programme. A
trip to the samurai market for around Y25bn is lightly pencilled in.
The Euro-MTN programme allows for the issue of paper in a wide range of
currencies with maturities between one month and 30 years and was arranged
by Merrill Lynch International. There are nine other banks acting as dealers
in addition to Merrill Lynch, including three from Germany.
LKB's preferred minimum maturity under the programme will be two years, and
the bulk of borrowing under the programme will be in the five to 10-year
range, Ms Foos-Olsson said. The programme will also be used to make small,
opportunistic Eurobond issues and possibly for longer term subordinated
debt.
It does not exclude setting up a global programme in the next two to three
years, but feels that its borrowing needs are not large enough, and prefers
to keep its Eurobond and yankee bond programmes separate.
LKB expects to sign in February a Dollars 750m US MTN programme, which it
plans to use for longer maturities. That programme is being arranged by
Morgan Stanley, which will be joined as a dealer by Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan
and Salomon Brothers.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance is likely to lower the minimum credit
rating for corporate issuers of straight and warrant bonds, to BBB from the
current A, further broadening the pool of potential issuers, Reuters
reports.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Fund based on Brazilian debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE range of structured funds aimed at investors who want a geared bet on
Latin American debt has been expanded this week by what is thought to be the
first based on Brazilian debt instruments.
Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has created two tranches of debt
based on Brazilian IDU bonds, with a total face value of Dollars 100m. The
bonds trade at about 60 per cent of face value.
Morgan is selling Dollars 35m of senior notes, based directly on IDU bonds,
and Dollars 25m of junior notes, geared instruments which give about three
times the exposure to the bonds than would be gained by investing directly.

<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest stock broker, announced punitive measures
for its top executives over the company's questionable sales of asset-backed
securities to retail investors.
Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president, will receive a 20 per cent salary cut, and Mr
Tadashi Takubo, senior managing director, faces a 10 per cent pay cut, both
effective for one year. Mr Atsushi Saito, who headed the international sales
unit, was demoted from senior managing director to managing director.
Nomura said it received a written warning from the ministry of finance last
week, for breaching industry regulations, which require brokers to warn
investors of risks involved in investment products.
Nomura last month admitted it had failed to warn retail investors, when
selling its US real estate-backed bonds. The broker has compensated Y23bn
(Dollars 185m) to more than 10,000 clients who had incurred losses on the
securities.

TRADING in shares of Jax, the importer and distributor of Renault cars in
Japan, was suspended yesterday on reports that Volkswagen of Germany is
acquiring a significant stake in the financially troubled dealer group.
VW has been looking for an alternative network to replace a long-standing
partnership with the Yanase car distribution group which is ceasing from the
end of this year.
Renault, meanwhile, is investigating the use of the Japanese sales network
of its partner Volvo, with which it has cross-shareholdings.
Volvo has already expressed its readiness to help Renault. Volvo set up
Volvo Cars Japan as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1986, at about the same
time as Renault was concluding its deal with Jax.
Tokyo-based Jax, whose shares are traded over the counter, described the
deal as a 'tie up', but reports suggested it would issue new shares for
allotment to VW, which will eventually hold a 30 to 40 per cent stake.
VW itself acknowledged last night that links with Jax were in prospect but
made no details available.
Jax is currently the sole distributor for Renault, but has seen sluggish
sales due to the fall in consumer spending.
The company posted a pre-tax loss of Y968m (Dollars 7.85m), on a 3.2 per
cent fall in sales, for the six months to June, and overall borrowings
totalled 91.6 per cent of its assets at the end of last June.
According to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association, imported car sales
are expected to fall 8.7 per cent from the previous year to 180,000 units.

<TEXT>
PT Astra International's chairman, who has been blocking the company's
takeover by a group of leading Indonesian businessmen, will resign today,
Reuter reports from Jakarta.
The Soerydjaya family has been forced to sell its controlling stake in
Astra, Indonesia's second largest private company, to bail out another
family-owned company, the Summa Group, which has run up losses estimated at
more than Dollars 600m.
Analysts said Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo had become a stumbling block to
bids for Astra by two consortia. One is led by timber tycoon Mr Prayogo
Pangestu and the other by Mr Sumitro's son, Mr Hasjim Djojohadikusumo.
Mr Sumitro said earlier he preferred pension funds to buy the shares.
He said Toyota Motor, the Japanese car maker which owns 51 per cent of
Astra's main company, PT Toyota Astra Motors, was worried by the sale of
108m shares or 44.5 per cent of Astra to Mr Prayogo.
His consortium includes Mr Liem Sioe Liong, whose PT Indomobil Utama
assembles Suzuki Motor vehicles and competes with Astra.

PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products group, has reached
an agreement which will lead to the manufacture of P&amp;G detergent products in
Russia.
The announcement comes as some big US consumer product companies are
delaying expansion plans in the former Soviet Union because of the turbulent
situation there and lack of infrastructure. P&amp;G stressed that the detergent
deal does not have significant financial implications.
The agreement has been signed with PO Novomoskovskbytkhim, a state-owned
industrial complex at Novomoskovsk, about 130 miles south of Moscow. The
agreement provides for P&amp;G to supply detergent formulations and technical
assistance.
P&amp;G, whose detergent brands include Ariel, Mr Proper and Dash, has been
selling products in St Petersburg for about a year through a joint venture
with the university there. The products, however, are made in Europe and
imported. Under the new agreement, the products will be made at the
Novomoskovsk plant.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: PNG pledge steadies mining
shares

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Australian mining companies steadied yesterday after the
government of Papua New Guinea undertook not to use expropriation to
increase its stake in mining projects.
Shares in mining groups with PNG interests have tumbled on the Australian
stock exchange since a coalition government led by Mr Paiai Wingti was
elected in July.
The government has taken a tougher line against foreign mining interests
than the previous administration of Mr Rabbie Namaliu, and has said it
intends to increase government holdings in big projects.
However, Senator Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, said PNG
ministers at an Australia-PNG ministerial forum in Tasmania over the weekend
had promised to do everything possible to restore investor confidence.
'The PNG government was certainly interested in pursuing more equity in at
least some of these projects (but had undertaken that) under no
circumstances would there be any expropriation to achieve that,' he said.
Senator Evans said PNG ministers at the conference had acknowledged that
'things had got to an uncomfortably high temperature,' and were keen to
reach an accommodation with the industry.
Shares in CRA, the Australian group which owns the Panguna copper mine on
Bougainville island, rose 40 cents to ADollars 13.24 after Mr Evans'
statement. PNG ministers had suggested that CRA might not be allowed to
reopen the mine, which has been closed by secessionist violence.
The undertaking also steadied shares in the joint venture partners in the
Porgera gold mine, which fell heavily following PNG's announcement of plans
to increase its stake from 10 per cent to 30 per cent.
Placer Pacific closed three cents higher at ADollars 1.22, and Renison
Goldfields closed 12 cents higher at ADollars 2.80. Highlands Gold, a
PNG-registered subsidiary of MIM Holdings, closed one cent lower at 63
cents.
Mr John Kaputin, PNG foreign minister, indicated that the government would
tone down future comments on the mining industry. 'It is not good for
everyone to be bickering through the media,' he said. 'It will not help
anyone and it will certainly not help the value of the shares on the stock
market.'
The PNG government has claimed that officials were misled by the joint
venture partners about the profitability of the Porgera project, which is
one of the world's largest gold mines.
Mr Masket Iangalio, the mining minister, has said that PNG restricted its
holding to 10 per cent because the joint venture partners convinced the then
government that the mine would be a marginal project.
Porgera began production in September 1990. It is expected to produce about
900,000 oz of gold a year until 1996, but is likely to produce 1.4m oz in
the current year.

</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PWA, parent of struggling Canadian Airlines, has sent a draft restructuring
plan to its senior creditors proposing to settle CDollars 506m (USDollars
397m) of claims by issuing new common stock.
However, airline analysts are sceptical about the proposal, saying
acceptance is unlikely unless American Airlines, which has offered to invest
CDollars 246m for a 25 per cent interest in PWA, is fully committed and
other aspects of the restructuring plan are in place.
PWA, under the weight of the airline's operating losses and heavy financial
charges, took the first step in its restructuring last month.
It suspended all the non-operational payments, such as money owed to its
lenders and equipment lessors, to conserve cash. The airline continues
normally but capacity has been cut 15 per cent.
Last Friday Alberta and British Columbia together provided a CDollars 70m
loan guarantee on top of a Federal government guarantee of CDollars 50m. But
these can support PWA's cash needs only through mid-January, analysts say.
The equity swap is the centrepiece of a full corporate restructuring
promised by PWA late in February.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman, said that together with concessions offered by the
15,000 employees worth CDollars 200m over four years, PWA will be ready to
complete the link-up with American Airlines. However, PWA has not explained
how it would deal with American's condition that it switch computer
reservations systems.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIDDONS Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group, yesterday urged
shareholders to reject competing hostile takeover offers from BBA, the UK
toolmaker, and Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group.
In a formal response to BBA, Siddons said an independent valuation by
Schroders Australia had valued the company's stock at between ADollars 2.60
and ADollars 3, representing a significant premium to both offers.
Mr Roger Flynn, managing director, said the ADollars 1.81 a share offer by
BBA, made through its subsidiary Pacific BBA, was totally inadequate and had
been rejected unanimously by the board.
Mr Flynn said Pacific BBA 'does not appear to be serious about its cash and
paper offer', which has been overbid by a cash offer of ADollars 2 a share
from W. A. Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool.
He said Pacific BBA 'must decide soon whether they are up or out'. However,
ITW's offer was below the full value of the company and had been rejected
unanimously by the board.
Schroders estimated Siddons total worth at between ADollars 120m (USDollars
82.7m) and ADollars 139m. Pacific BBA's cash and paper bid values the
company at ADollars 86m. The cash offer from W. A. Deutsher values it at
ADollars 94m.
Schroders forecast that Siddons' sales would increase to ADollars 188m this
year from ADollars 168m in 1991-92, while operating profit after tax but
before abnormals and extraordinaries would rise to ADollars 7.1m from
ADollars 3.2m. Siddons shares closed four cents higher at ADollars 1.96.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: IBM seeks help from two retired
vice-chairmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Akers, beleaguered chairman of IBM, the US computer company, has
recalled two highly experienced former vice-chairmen to help the company
through its most challenging crisis.
He told senior staff late last week that he had asked Mr Paul Rizzo and Mr
Kaspar Cassani, both several years over IBM's statutory retirement age of
60, to become consultants to the company from January 1.
IBM lost money last year and looks certain to do so again this year
principally from the cost of successive waves of redundancies as the company
attempts to match its overheads to reduced business expectations. Last week
Mr Akers said there would be a further 25,000 job losses costing about
Dollars 6bn in 1993.
The two former executives will act in an advisory capacity and will not
become employees of IBM.
IBM's rule on retirement has been broken more and more frequently in recent
years as the company has sought to hold on to the expertise of its most
experienced officers. Mr Cassani, who was chairman of IBM World Trade for
Europe, Middle East and Africa before his move to IBM's Armonk headquarters
as vice-chairman in 1988, was one of the first to have his tenure extended.
Since retiring from IBM in the late 1980s, both men have taken up posts in
education, Mr Rizzo as dean of the school of business administration at the
University of North Carolina and Mr Cassani as first chairman of the Swiss
business school formed from the merger of IMI and Imede. It is not clear
whether they will continue to hold their academic roles.
Mr Akers said that Mr Rizzo would work directly with him in the US, while Mr
Cassani would work with Mr Renato Riverso, head of IBM Europe.
It is expected that Mr Cassani's advice is being sought over the
'segmentation' process at IBM, dividing the company into smaller,
semi-autonomous business units. Mr Cassani introduced decentralised
decision-making while head of Europe long before the US followed suit.
The appointments inevitably throw up questions about the succession at the
top of IBM. While Mr Akers has been criticised for IBM's problems, there has
been no serious challenge yet to his authority either from fellow board
members or investors. The new appointments will render Mr Akers less
isolated but at the same time more protected from rival bids for his job.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Assault on corporate Germany's
defences - David Waller examines the intensifying attacks on the country's
system of voting rights restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate Germany is under fire - both from outside and from within its own
ranks.
Two weeks ago a representative of Calpers, the big US pension fund, stood up
at the annual meeting of RWE, a large German utility, and denounced the
voting restrictions in place at dozens of leading German companies.
This was unprecedented - the first time that an important Anglo-Saxon fund
had delivered such a critique at the annual meeting of a leading German
company.
Equally unprecedented was the call last week from Mr Christian Strenger, the
chief executive of DWS, the investment management arm of the Deutsche Bank
and Germany's largest fund management group, for the introduction of
voluntary rules to govern takeover activity in Germany.
The two issues are interrelated, as Mr Strenger made clear when he proposed
that companies should give up their voting right restrictions as a quid pro
quo for embracing a voluntary takeover code and rules defining disclosure
requirements.
The justification for the voting rights restriction - in place in one form
or another at many large German companies including Deutsche Bank, the DWS
parent, and introduced in the early 1970s amid fears that the crown jewels
of German industry would be bought up by oil-rich countries - is that it is
a company's only defence in the absence of formal rules setting out the way
in which bids should proceed.
This was exactly the argument used by Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche Bank's
investment banking subsidiary, in its successful defence of the Continental
tyre company against a foray from Pirelli. Continental has been able to
preserve its independence to date because it has managed to keep voting
restrictions in place, despite two attempts from shareholders to remove
them.
This put Morgan Grenfell in the embarrassing position of defending something
which would be indefensible in the UK, its home market. In the UK, as in the
US, it is a cardinal principle that all shareholders should be treated
alike.
'Most countries in the world stick to the principle of one share one vote,'
said Mr Joseph Lufkin, the Calpers representative who was incensed at the
voting anomalies in place at RWE, Germany's eighth biggest industrial
conglomerate. For historical reasons, a group of local authorities owns 30
per cent of the company's shares - but wields 60 per cent of the votes.
'There is no reason why one shareholder should get better treatment than
another just because he happens to be more of an insider than the others,'
said Mr Lufkin.
Strenger, like Lufkin, points to another inequity: the lack of any rule
obliging acquiring companies to make a full offer to all shareholders. It is
standard practice in Germany for one company to win control of another by
taking a simple majority or a blocking minority. This means that no premium
is paid for corporate control and the value of remaining shareholders'
holdings can be much diminished.
It was this concern which led to a battle this year between the management
of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second biggest
insurance company, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), a large
state-owned French insurance group which accumulated 25 per cent of the
German company in what was then interpreted as a hostile move.
The management then argued, with the help of SG Warburg, the UK investment
bank, that the French company was trying to win control with the minimum
outlay possible, and refused to recognise the full votes attached to the
share stake.
The argument was subsequently settled when AGF helped find a buyer for AMB's
stake in BfG Bank, the insurance company's troubled banking subsidiary. But
not before the then chief executive resigned and SG Warburg resigned their
mandate.
The sale of the bank to Credit Lyonnais is due to be finalised on December
30 at a special meeting of AMB shareholders. But last-minute difficulties
have emerged in the negotiations and it is possible that Fondiaria, the
Italian group with 20 per cent of AMB's shares, could scupper the
transaction by voting against it at the same meeting.
Analysts suspect that the Italian company feels aggrieved at being left in
the position of minority shareholder, the value of its shares diminished by
the influence accorded to the French.
The AGF/AMB/BfG imbroglio highlights another way in which shareholders are
ill-served by the current regulatory environment. There is minimal
information about the details of a transaction which has been settled over
the head of the shareholders in secret negotiations initiated by the
companies' supervisory boards.
Information obligations are rudimentary. Take just disclosure of share
stakes. In Germany a company does not have to disclose a shareholding until
it reaches 25 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in the UK. This leaves
shareholders - and companies - in the dark.
Mr Strenger proposes that companies should disclose holdings of 5 per cent,
and that banks should help them do this by reporting stake-building. But
this raises the question of the role of the banks, particularly Deutsche
Bank, the biggest bank and owner of numerous substantial portfolios in big
German companies.
The official Deutsche Bank line is that it puts up with voting rights
restrictions only because there is no takeover code. But critics say that
the bank profits from the current state of affairs, being so much better
informed about corporate developments because of the holdings and the
supervisory board mandates which go with them. Why commit itself to equality
between shareholders, when the current inequality works in its favour?
The European Community has drawn up a directive on takeovers and mergers,
but it has yet to be ratified. Strenger says that would be serving its own
interests by introducing a voluntary code long before the law comes into
force.
In practice, it would take years for a voluntary code to take effect.
Takeovers, especially hostile ones, are still regarded as profoundly
anti-social in Germany, as witnessed by the fuss which accompanied the early
stages of Krupp's move to win control of its steel rival Hoesch. German
companies are likely to worry that a set of rules would simply encourage
such behaviour.
At a time when companies are preoccupied with dealing with recession, it is
unlikely that they will encourage anything which would make them vulnerable
to takeover - even if that vulnerability works in the interests of
shareholders.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: BfG deal faces disruption threat
from Fondiaria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIFFERENCES over plans for Credit Lyonnais to take control of Germany's
BfG bank have been resolved, Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the
German insurance group, claimed yesterday.
However, the deal seemed threatened with further disruption as Fondiaria,
the Italian insurer with a 20 per cent stake in AMB, was reported to have
called for a vote of no-confidence in Mr Helmut Gies, chairman of AMB's
supervisory board, at a weekend meeting.
AMB officials did not deny the report, which included claims that Fondiaria
had asked for an extraordinary shareholders' assembly on December 30 to be
postponed 'on material and legal grounds'. If shareholders approve the
resolutions at the meeting, AGF will gain a blocking stake in Germany's
second-biggest insurer, Credit Lyonnais will win a foothold in the top ranks
of German banking, and AMB will rid itself of its barely-profitable banking
subsidiary.
Meanwhile, the German insurer, with 51 per cent of BfG, insisted an
agreement on the deal would be signed before Christmas. The extraordinary
assembly to approve the transaction would be held as planned, despite
rumours of possible postponement, AMB added. The meeting would also be asked
to bless another, linked, agreement, reached earlier this year, under which
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) is to be granted full voting rights on
its 25 per cent stake in AMB.
AGF, the state-owned French insurance group, acted as broker in the deal
with Credit Lyonnais. It accepted the role as part of a peace settlement
with AMB, which had hitherto viewed AGF's holding as hostile and had
withheld full voting rights on its stake.
Fondiaria, which yesterday refused to comment on the weekend meeting,
originally entered enthusiastically into its relationship with AMB.
However, plans to form a three-way alliance of independent European
insurers, including Britain's Royal group, have been left increasingly to
one side as a result of AGF's growing involvement with the German concern.
Relations may also have been soured by developments within Fondiaria itself.
Ferruzzi, the industrial group which jointly controls the insurer, is
believed to be unhappy with Fondiaria's profitability. With AGF threatening
to dominate AMB, the value of the Italian group's 20 per cent holding seems
likely to be diminished both in strategic and financial terms. Unless
Fondiaria can be pacified, it could be tempted to use its votes at the
December 30 meeting in an attempt to block both resolutions.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps director quits
after clash with chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN-JACQUES Delort yesterday resigned as a director of
Pinault-Printemps, the French retailing and timber concern, after a row with
Mr Francois Pinault, chairman and the architect of last year's merger
between his timber company and the Printemps retailing group.
The Pinault group has for some time stirred interest because of its shift in
strategy when Mr Pinault changed direction away from the old
industrial-based interests of his family timber firm by expanding into
retailing. This culminated in the FFr5.3bn (Dollars 991m) partial bid for
Printemps.
The Printemps deal turned Pinault into a leading player in French retailing
with the Conforama furniture chain and La Redoute mail order catalogue as
well as the Printemps department stores.
It also left Pinault with heavy debts. Mr Pinault this autumn orchestrated a
FFr1bn capital increase from Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and has
recently been reported to be negotiating to buy part of the bank's junk bond
portfolio.
Mr Pinault, renowned for his aggressive approach to business, is said to
have clashed with Mr Delort, a prominent figure in the French business
establishment and the former chairman of Printemps, over his plans for the
group. Pinault said in a statement yesterday that Mr Delort had resigned 'at
the request' of Mr Pinault.
After Mr Delort's departure Mr Pinault will replace him as president of the
administrative board of the group.

FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Snecma warns of heavy loss for
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Alice Rawsthorn in Paris
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNECMA, France's state-controlled aircraft engine maker, yesterday warned
that it would make a substantial loss in 1992 and that it saw no prospect of
a return to the black next year.
Mr Gerard Renon, chairman, said the group had been badly affected by the
problems of its customers in the civil aviation industry and by the general
economic slowdown. Snecma specialises in the production of engines for
Airbus jets in both the civil and military sectors.
The chairman, who recently announced a first-half loss for the company,
forecast continued losses for the second half of this year. This would
produce an overall loss of around FFr600m (Dollars 112m) for 1992,
significantly higher than 1991's loss of FFr68m. Snecma lost FFr302.75m on
consolidated sales of FFr6.1bn in the first six months of this year.
Mr Renon also warned of a probable fall in sales for 1992 of around 6 per
cent or 7 per cent to FFr13.5bn. He anticipated a further fall in sales, and
sustained pressure on profitability, next year. 'Given the pressure on sales
and margins, it will be difficult for us to return to break-even,' he said.
Snecma has suffered from depressed demand in 1992. The level of production
of its CFM 56 engines has fallen from 880 in 1991, to 770 this year, and to
a projected 550 in 1993. This problem was recently aggravated by the
cancellation of an order from Northwest Airlines of the US for 74 Airbus
fitted with CFM 56 engines made by the French group and General Electric,
its US partner.
The company has already taken steps to cut costs. Mr Renon warned that there
could be more temporary lay-offs and short-time working at its production
plants, but said there would be no increase in the 800 job losses already
announced. 'We mustn't over-react,' he said. 'We have to ensure that we have
the capacity to recover in the medium term.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sweet smell of success from the right
product mix / A look at Thorntons' strategy for overcoming seasonal sales
variations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHRISTMAS rush has special meaning for Thorntons because the chocolate
maker and retailer derives nearly a third of its yearly turnover from
yuletide sales.
A box of Thorntons Continental chocolates has a shelf-life of three weeks,
an indication of the disaster lurking if the group does not judge the
Christmas market accurately.
Thorntons' dependence on seasonal business is exaggerated by the fact that
another 25 per cent of turnover comes at Easter, Mothering Sunday and St
Valentine's Day.
Turnover for the year to end-June amounted to Pounds 84.3m. Seasonal factors
are aggravated by the group's susceptibility to the weather, which if bad
keeps people off the streets - and away from Thorntons' champagne truffles,
hazelnut pralines and special toffee.
Mr John Thornton, chairman, is one person who is not dreaming of a white
Christmas. Christmas sales will be strong, he says, 'as long as it doesn't
snow'.
The group earns three quarters of its revenue from Thorntons' 395 shops and
franchises on Britain's high streets. They have to woo pedestrian traffic
which has declined in recent years because of the recession and the move
away from high street retailing to superstores.
Thorntons sensitivity to these factors was amply demonstrated in the last
financial year.
Mr Thornton attributes some of the blame for a disappointing 23 per cent
fall in pre-tax profit - from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 9.2m - to unseasonally
hot weather in May and June.
'People don't buy chocolate when it's 80 degrees,' he says.
The company was also hit by its decision not to absorb the VAT increase. It
tried to push up volume to compensate but failed. In addition to the general
recessionary climate, high street rents increased and Easter sales were
upset by the general election in April.
Thorntons' growth and profitability in the 1990s will depend on the success
of the different strategies it has undertaken to cope with the
idiosyncrasies of the UK chocolate business, not only at Christmas.
Mr Thornton says the group is striving to improve the way it manages stock
to ensure 'stock does end up in the right place at the right time'. It
recently installed a computerised stock accounting system whereby shop staff
input sales information into hand-held terminals connected to Thorntons'
main factory near Derby.
The group is also planning to introduce electronic point of sales scanning
equipment, to provide immediately accurate pricing and stock taking by
reading product bar-codes, in the near future.
Thorntons has techniques of its own for combating the Christmas sales
onslaught. It aims to sell out of its speciality Christmas products well
before December 25, relying then on seasonally packaged chocolates and
'seasonalised' products.
The latter are ordinary Thorntons ranges which can be taken out of their
Christmas wrapping for sale in the new year without losing their freshness.
Mr Thornton adds that should sales be overestimated, product can be held
back at the factory where it will last longer in cold storage.
Gauging the progress of Christmas sales is difficult but initial indications
are that response has been good to this year's Christmas advertising
campaign. The relaunch of Thornton's Continental chocolate boxes lifted
sales, and the launch of the Select collection in the autumn added 6 per
cent to turnover at the 150 shops at which it is available.
He says this recession has proved particularly difficult because of the
erosion of high street trade, which had held up well in previous downturns.
Outside of Christmas and Easter, Thorntons relies on impulse buying from
passers-by, and their numbers are falling.
The group has met this challenge in part by expanding its commercial
operations - supplying chocolates and ice-cream to supermarkets, including
Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury and Boots.
These sales are approaching a fifth of overall turnover, and increased more
than 50 per cent to Pounds 14.8m last year.
The group broadened the variety of chocolate products to suit supermarket
shelves, and stepped up its premium ice-cream business. The value of the UK
premium brand ice-cream market has doubled to about Pounds 450m in five
years, of which Thorntons had a 7 per cent share in mid-1992, after New
England (10 per cent) and Grand-Metropolitan's Haagen-Dasz (20 per cent).
However, higher ice-cream sales in the hot weather in May and June were not
enough to offset the fall in higher-value chocolate sales.
Progress has been more disappointing with regard the group's attempt to
break into the European market. Thorntons bought Gartner, a specialist
Belgian chocolate maker, in 1988 but its real push came with the purchase of
French confectioners Sogeco and La Nouvelle de Confiserie in 1989.
The appeal of the French acquisitions was the established brand names which
came with them - particularly the well-known Martial - and the different
market mix.
Mr Thornton says 80 per cent of its UK sales are chocolate and 17 per cent
toffee. In contrast, the French market is divided equally between chocolate,
ice-cream, sugared almonds - traditional fare at weddings - and sugar
confectionery, providing 'a different weather balance'.
However, he admits re-organising the French businesses and returning them to
profit has taken longer than the group expected, not least because of the
different working and sweet-eating cultures.
Thorntons (France) contributed a loss of Pounds 750,000 last year, down from
Pounds 850,000 a year earlier. But comparisons with the UK business are not
easy because French factories supply UK stores and vice-versa. Central
overheads are still too high in relation to the number of shops Thorntons
has, but it is about to accelerate the expansion of its network of 58
Martial outlets this year.
Mr Thornton says the group is investigating the establishment of a retailing
presence in a second country on the Continent, examining the options in
Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Adam may take legal action against KPMG
Peat Marwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADAM &amp; CO, the private Edinburgh-based bank which lost more than twice its
capital in unauthorised foreign exchange dealing, is contemplating
litigation against KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors who were replaced at the
annual meeting yesterday by Ernst &amp; Young.
Sir Charles Fraser, chairman, said the bank had been advised that there was
a prima facie case against Peat Marwick in whom the board had lost
confidence. 'I don't think anyone would be surprised that (litigation) is a
possibility,' he said.
In September Adam &amp; Co revealed that it had lost Pounds 21m in irregular
operations on behalf of a client by two foreign exchange dealers in its
London branch. Although the bank's Pounds 10m capital was wiped out, it was
immediately rescued by Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a 75-year-old
director and principal shareholder who injected Pounds 21m.
Although two foreign exchange dealers have been sacked no one has left the
board as a result of the affair and shareholders re-elected it at
yesterday's relatively peaceful meeting.
But Mr David Simpson, general manager (investment) of Standard Life which is
a shareholder in Adam &amp; Co, questioned at the shareholders meeting whether
it was right that the bank's senior management should remain in place after
the loss.
The annual report, he said, stated that 'the basis of the problem (leading
to the loss) lay in the expansion into an area of business with which
management was unfamiliar, as a result of which the correct controls for
that particular business were not put in place at the time.'
He also quoted a letter which Peat Marwick sent to shareholders in which it
said 'it now appears that (Adam &amp; Co's) control mechanisms over foreign
currency transactions were not properly operated by management.' In previous
years they had recommended strengthening controls. 'These recommendations
were accepted but not fully implemented,' Peat Marwick wrote.
Sir Charles said the bank rejected what Peat Marwick was saying but did not
elaborate on the dispute. He said those responsible for the running of the
bank had to stay in office to help it and its shareholders in their
predicament.
He said that Mr James Laurenson, deputy chairman and managing director, and
any other directors, would have resigned if the report into the affair which
the bank commissioned from Price Waterhouse had so recommended.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: First cracks appear in the
standards-setting machinery - Rule bending in accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, has been highly
animated in the last few days. The reason is not his usual zealotry, but a
growing anger as the first cracks have started to appear in the
standards-setting machinery over which he presides.
Just a little over two years since the ASB was created, companies are
starting to show signs of bending the new rules to suit their own purposes -
while their auditors turn a blind eye.
Last week the ASB issued a curt statement on the way in which some companies
are interpreting a ruling from its urgent issues task force on the treatment
of goodwill on the disposal of an acquisition. Its implications are far
wider.
'As with accounting standards it is important when applying task force
abstracts to be guided by the spirit and reasoning . . so as to achieve
their underlying purpose,' it stressed. 'I'm furious,' says Mr Tweedie. 'I
thought we could get away from this approach. I have told the profession
that they can either play the game and get short standards, or play by the
letter of the law and they will get monster standards.'
The problem dates back almost a year, when the task force issued its third
abstract concerning the treatment of goodwill - the difference between the
purchase price of an acquisition and its net asset value. The ruling said
that from January 23 this year, companies would have to pass through the
profit and loss account the goodwill of a business when they disposed of it.
That caused considerable consternation among businesses, since the amounts
involved were substantial and many companies had previously simply buried
the gain or loss in reserves.
So many voiced concern at the proposals and the speed at which the abstract
was to become mandatory that the ASB was forced to allow greater time for
consultation on future pronouncements.
But that was clearly not enough for many companies. Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual reports, began to
highlight divergences from the ruling in the autumn. Others were drawn to
the ASB's attention from other sources. Audit partners in the larger
accounting firms warned that more clients were on the brink of adopting the
same approach if no action was taken.
Last week's statement from the urgent issues task force stresses two points
in response to alternative treatments beginning to appear:
The goodwill element should be included as part of a single number showing
the profit or loss on disposal, not distanced from it as a separate item.
There should not be a credit to the profit and loss account before the
deduction of dividends which is equal to the amount of goodwill on disposal.
There should be no implication through devices such as a sub-total that
profit is calculated after re-instating the goodwill.
Among those adopting alternative approaches was Enterprise Computer
Holdings. Its accounts for the 15 months to March 31 show separate
extraordinary losses of Pounds 1.1m for sale and closure of subsidiaries,
and Pounds 23.1m for purchased goodwill written off to reserves. It also
breaches the second ASB point by showing a gain of Pounds 23.1m on the
profit and loss account after dividend payments entitled 'reinstatement of
goodwill written off above'.
Racal Electronics - audited by Touche Ross - showed an extraordinary loss of
Pounds 53.8m in its latest accounts. That is explained at the bottom of the
profit and loss account, with separate lines showing a Pounds 1.1m loss on
disposal and closure of businesses, and Pounds 12.2m on acquisition goodwill
written off in prior years.
Hickson International - audited by Price Waterhouse - shows exceptional and
extraordinary losses. The notes on both items listed goodwill separately
from disposal profits and losses. A statement of retained earnings on the
profit and loss account shows a reinstatement of Pounds 9.7m of goodwill.
Halma - also audited by Price Waterhouse - shows a Pounds 1.1m extraordinary
debit, itemised as a Pounds 437,000 loss before goodwill adjustment and a
goodwill adjustment of Pounds 656,000. It then reinstates the goodwill after
profits and before a prominently displayed final 'profit' figure.
Companies bending the rules on goodwill in the future may well end up before
the financial reporting review panel, and their auditors before their
professional bodies. Both will face highly detailed rules if they continue
to ignore the spirit of ASB standards.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Faupel rises to Pounds 0.4m on back of
lower interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTEREST charge reduced from Pounds 402,000 to Pounds 368,000 enabled
Faupel Trading Group, the USM-quoted textile importer, to lift pre-tax
profits from Pounds 611,000 to Pounds 639,000 in the six months to September
30.
A fall in interest payable also lay behind the pre-tax rise in the year to
end-March after operating profits slipped to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 2.04m).
This time they eased Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 1.01m on turnover ahead at
Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 12.1m). Mr Iain Brown, chief executive, said that lower
rates and the fact that Faupel's imports were financed on trust receipts on
dollar rates accounted for the interest fall.
Sales during the summer were 'generally patchy', according to Mr Michael
Molloy, chairman. Mr Brown added that the public's general lack of
confidence had led to an uncertain performance at retail level with a
'disappointing pre-Christmas run'.
When asked about any upturn at the year-end, Mr Brown had said he had seen
half a robin on the lawn, but that it flew away. He said yesterday that so
far it had not returned.
Household textiles, which accounted for about one-third of group turnover,
performed above expectations, though with 'tight margins' at the lower
priced end.
Within garments, which accounted for the other two-thirds, the contract
sales division, which supplied customers such as BhS, Harrods, Empire Stores
and GUS, had difficulties getting 'clients to call in stock on due time'.
Earnings were unchanged at 5.19p per share, as was the interim dividend at
1.85p.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ivory &amp; Sime rises to Pounds 2.27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVORY &amp; SIME, the fund management group, has announced an 8.5 per cent rise,
from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 2.27m, in pre-tax profits for the six months to
October 31.
The Edinburgh-based group is increasing its interim dividend by 40 per cent,
from 1.25p to 1.75p, as part of a strategy of reducing the disparity with
the final. The board said the final would be not less than last year's 4.5p.
Funds under management were stable at Pounds 2.95bn, with the effect of
rising stock markets offsetting the loss of some client funds, such as the
Ensign Trust contract. About half of that total was in investment trusts,
and a quarter in pension funds.
In November Ivory &amp; Sime acquired a direct marketing company called McColl
McGregor, which will help develop its investment trust business.
Mr David Newbigging, chairman, said that earnings per share, up 19 per cent
from 4.15p to 4.94p, had benefited 'from continued attention to cost control
and tighter management of working capital.' Administrative expenses fell
from Pounds 5.14m to Pounds 4.8m, while interest and investment income rose
from Pounds 437,000 to Pounds 581,000. The company also bought 2.25m of its
own shares, for cancellation, during the period.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME MEMBERS of the 38 strong banking group which has loans of Pounds 1bn to
Isosceles, the parent of the Gateway food retail chain, have been given
extra time to respond to the company's request for a standstill on interest
and capital repayments.
Responses were due to be delivered by this morning, and an Isosceles board
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon to approve the standstill. However,
overseas banks have been allowed an extra day to reply, delaying an
announcement that an agreement has been signed until at least tomorrow.
Pressure is on the company and its lenders to come to an agreement before
Christmas, as suppliers are nervous of extending trade credit to the Gateway
chain while its future remains uncertain. Followers of Isosceles recall that
details of its first financial restructuring were posted to shareholders on
Christmas Eve 1990.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ultimatum for ITV companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies have been given 48 hours to sign a news supply agreement
with Independent Television News for the five years from January 1.
After nearly a year of negotiation they have been warned that there may be
no news unless the agreement is signed.
The ITN board yesterday approved an agreement, after it is believed, the
Independent Television Commission expressed concern at the delays.
Mr Andrew Quinn, the chief executive of the ITV Association was also
involved in trying to smooth the path to a deal.
The original plan was for an agreement that would start at Pounds 57m next
year falling to Pounds 50m by year five - an average of Pounds 53.6m
including an allowance for cost of money.
The new deal is for a flat Pounds 53.6m a year which will increase in line
with retail prices.
Provision for a review after two years in the event of significant changes
in the cost structure of ITN is also part of the deal - a provision backed
by Yorkshire Television.
The restructuring of ITN with control passing to six companies led by Mr
Michael Green's Carlton Communications is conditional on the acceptance of
ITN's news supply agreement.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lucas sells division to Danish group for
Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the car and aerospace components maker which plans to
raise Pounds 100m through disposals by next August, yesterday announced the
sale of its fluid power systems division to Sophus Berendsen of Denmark.
The division is the largest of four put up for sale by Lucas in October in
an effort to focus on core businesses, following a sharp fall in profits and
mounting bid rumours.
It has net assets of Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m and the sale price, although
subject to final due diligence, is thought to be about Pounds 30m.
Mr Bernard Carey, director of communications at Lucas, said the company was
talking with other potential buyers for the outstanding three divisions. 'We
are finding interest in all the nominated businesses,' he said.
Lucas' fluid power systems division distributes hydraulic and pneumatic
equipment such as valves and pumps to the construction and agricultural
sectors. It employs nearly 1,000 people with annual sales of more than
Pounds 100m.
Berendsen is best known for its 55 per cent stake in environmental services
company Rentokil. It has been involved in fluid power distribution since the
late 1970s and is one of Lucas's main competitors in the important US
market. Berendsen also has interests in the textile rental and laundry
market, especially in Denmark.
Mr Hans Werdelin, chief executive officer, said the two companies' fluid
power divisions fitted well together. The acquisition would strengthen
Berendsen's value added distribution network, he said. The US and Canada
accounted for about 70 per cent of Lucas's fluid power sales last year,
while Berendsen saw the US as its most important market outside Scandinavia.
The consideration was cautiously welcomed by analysts, although one pointed
out that Lucas was selling at the bottom of a recovering market. The shares
fell 1p to 131p; ahead of the October announcement, which coincided with
news of 4,000 job cuts and an uncovered dividend. the shares fell below
100p.
The three remaining businesses for sale are Lucas Autocentres, a specialist
car repairer, as well as an aircraft windows factory and a missile casings
manufacturer.
Mr Carey said negotiations for one of the sales 'were progressing faster
than the others', but he said no sales were imminent.

GPA Group, the Irish aircraft leasing company struggling to restructure its

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Brokers Whitefriars closed by Bikuben
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEFRIARS, the UK stockbroker acquired by Danish savings bank Bikuben in
1990, has been closed, in the process leaving 90 small British and Irish
companies without a proper market in their shares.
Almost all of the 100 companies in which Bikuben-Whitefriars had made a
market are now covered by only one securities house. Unless another market
maker comes forward, they will be forced on to the London Stock Exchange's
recently-created Seats market for illiquid companies.
Cut-backs in small company market making over the past few months by large
securities houses in London have already left 144 companies on Seats.
The closure of Whitefriars, with the loss over the coming weeks of 25 jobs,
follows financial losses over the past three years.
The total cost to Bikuben, including buying the firm, absorbing its losses
and closing it, will come to under Pounds 5m, the bank said.
Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and
Danish securities regulators, Bikuben will carry on its institutional equity
and bond broking business, as well as its private banking operation, from a
newly-created branch in London, rather than a separate company.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Culver offer for DG Durham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CULVER Holdings, which was formed to make a recommended offer for Wyndham
Group in July last year, is to buy the operating subsidiaries of DG Durham,
the insurance group whose shares were suspended on the USM in October.
Culver will also make an offer of one new Culver share for every five Durham
shares. The offer, equivalent to 0.8p per Durham share, values the whole
company at Pounds 160,000.
However, because Culver does not want to be liable for Durham's borrowings
of Pounds 1.4m or certain outstanding legal claims against the company,
Culver will sell on any shares acquired under the offer to Masterglobal,
which already owns 51 per cent in Durham.
Mr John Biles, the largest shareholder in Culver with 27 per cent, also
controls Durham through a 74 per cent stake in Masterglobal. Two other
Culver directors are directors of Durham.
The acquisition and offer need approval from independent shareholders from
both companies. Durham's independent directors and financial adviser Guiness
Mahon will recommend the offer. Culver's offer is being made by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
Culver will pay up to Pounds 262,000 for Durham's operating subsidiaries,
which include Accident &amp; General, a travel insurance broker. Culver, which
owns Honda and BMW franchises, intends to inject the subsidiaries into a new
insurance division.
Before the proposals were announced, Durham had been unable to file accounts
because its bankers, Barclays, refused to confirm the availability of
continued facilities. The accounts were filed yesterday, showing a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 4.29m in the 15 months to March 31.
Durham's shares are due to resume trading on the USM today. They closed at
4p before suspension.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: OIS Pounds 15m offer comfortably
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS have oversubscribed by 20 per cent for the 30m shares in OIS
International Inspection, the technical inspection services group to be
listed on December 30.
Mr Michael Sawbridge of Neilson Cobbold, the sponsoring brokers, said the
Pounds 15m offer was 'comfortably oversubscribed'. Private investors had
taken up Pounds 4m worth of the 50p shares, the remainder was taken up by
institutions, led by Friends Provident with a 20 per cent stake.
OIS's holding company would use the money raised from the listing to buy OIS
from Adia, the Swiss employment group busy divesting itself of its non-core
interests. OIS would use the Pounds 4m to eliminate most of its long-term
debt and help finance the purchase of new offices in Aberdeen.
OIS is expected to report a small decline in pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.58m
(Pounds 1.68m) on lower turnover of Pounds 45m (Pounds 47m) in the year to
end-December.
Mr Sawbridge said Neilson Cobbold forecast improved profits in 1993 - a
detailed forecast would be made in January - because cashflow would be
boosted by the reduction in gearing to about 5 per cent, new long-term
management contracts, and streamlining of the UK offices.
OIS, which specialises in safety, quality and environmental testing of
industrial installations, was at an advanced stage of talks with two big
clients, who were replacing their in-house inspection teams.
OIS already boasts BP, Shell and British Gas among its corporate clients.

High-Point is reducing net debt by Pounds 1.7m through the sale of
Transportation Planning Associates to Oscar Faber.
Consideration is Pounds 950,000 cash and the discharge by Oscar Faber of all
TPA's debts amounting to Pounds 1m. In the year to May 31 TPA incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 391,000.
The sale is in line with the policy of disposing of businesses outside

Projections show a continued breach of covenants on borrowing facilities,
and the loan facilities are technically repayable on demand.
The board believes that trading for the current year will improve over last

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Regrouped and ready for the fray -
NatWest's investment banking arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank's history in investment banking has been littered
with disappointed hopes.
Since the London stock market was deregulated in 1986, it has been embroiled
in two financial scandals, it has consist-ently made losses or poor
financial returns and a series of senior executives have quit.
However, Mr Martin Owen believes the curse has been lifted. In June he
became chief executive of NatWest Markets, which is a new division of
NatWest combining its investment bank with that part of the commercial bank
serving big com-panies.
'All of NatWest Market's businesses are forecast to be in profit in 1993,
even after full absorption of costs', he said in his first interview since
taking the helm.
The aim is for the business as a whole to make pre-tax profits equal to a 14
per cent return on capital, in addition to the risk-free return on the
capital. He said that means it is intended to make between 15 per cent and
17.5 per cent in total.
His confidence stems from the six months review of the businesses which he
has recently completed. Nonetheless, the challenge he has set himself should
not be underestimated.
If NatWest was brave - some would say foolhardy - to enter securities
trading in the first place in 1986, it is now being even braver by
integrating its securities and investment banking activities with its
lending activities.
In the process, it has created a huge new hybrid institution, with capital
of Pounds 3bn and assets (loans and securities) of Pounds 65bn.
By contrast, its main UK rival, Barclays, has combined foreign exchange and
treasury operations with its investment bank, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, but
balked at including corporate lending in the new division.
Lending bankers are widely regarded in the City of London as undesirable
bedfellows for the more highly paid - and some would also say 'more highly
strung' - investment bankers. Institutions attempting to integrate them have
typically faced difficulties, because they have different business time
horizons (the investment bankers generally have a short-term dealing
mentality).
Nonetheless, NatWest Markets has appointed 40 senior managers - called
service originators - to talk to corporate clients about the full range of
lending, securities and investment management products. These clients make
up 80 per cent of the UK's 300 biggest companies.
In the process of merging the commercial banking and investment banking
operations, certain overlaps have been identified. So in the next few months
a couple of hundred jobs will go from NatWest Market's current tally of
5,000.
Last week, 50 jobs were lost in the global custody - or share registration -
operations in Bristol and 70 people are going because of the decision to
give up a seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The review has also involved an element of 'rebranding', at a cost of less
than Pounds 500,000. A small design company, Ingleton Thomas, has invented a
new logo, incorporating the initials, NWM.
In addition, County NatWest Ventures' name is being changed to NatWest
Ventures, to match the name change of the equities trading operation.
Mr Owen has also belatedly recognised the value of the name, Wood Mackenzie,
which is the name of a broker it acquired after Big Bang. Its corporate
stockbroking business, providing advice to companies on share issues, is
being renamed NatWest Wood Mackenzie.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Shandwick granted new facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers to Shandwick, one of the world's largest public relations agencies,
have agreed to extend facilities to the company until the end of January
1994.
Mr John Huckle, Shandwick finance director, said the early renewal of the
facility, which was due to expire next March, provided a 'positive'
atmosphere for the group's recovery.
The facility amounts to Pounds 69m at current exchange rates in sterling and
foreign currencies.
Shandwick's shares price collapsed from 149p a year ago after the group
severely disappointed with its results and breached some of its banking
covenants.
Yesterday the shares recovered 1 1/2 p to close at 9 1/2 p.
Mr Huckle said Shandwick had been able to prove that cash flow was stronger
than previously expected.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Media group faces life beyond the cult of personality: The
prospects for Time Warner after Steve Ross
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was something unseemly about the way the board shake-up at Time Warner
was announced just hours after the death on Sunday of Mr Steve Ross, the
65-year-old chairman and founder of the world's biggest media and
entertainment group.
Yesterday, as the company mourned the loss of Mr Ross, reports filtered out
of Time Warner of an internal clash that had led to the removal of some of
Mr Ross's closest friends.
Among those said by executives to have been distressed by the developments
were Mr Martin Payson, the Time Warner vice-chairman who resigned from the
company as well as from the board; Mr William vanden Heuvel, who hung on to
his board seat but is expected to lose it next spring; and Mr Arthur Liman,
the lawyer who was not a board member, but was a close friend and adviser to
Mr Ross, handling a large volume of legal work for Time Warner.
Mr Gerald Levin, the president and chief executive of Time Warner who is
expected to eventually succeed Mr Ross as chairman, tried to put a brave
face on the board changes, which will reduce the number of directors from 21
to 12 and are aimed at recruiting more outside members.
The board reduction was the last step in a lengthy review process that he,
Mr Ross and outside directors began last September, Mr Levin declared.
But Mr Geoffrey Holmes, a senior vice-president of Time Warner who was privy
to the decisions, admitted the timing of the announcement was 'extremely
unfortunate' and noted 'it was just a question of should we do it now or
wait a couple of days'.
The board changes appear to favour the Time side of the group and they have
re-ignited speculation about the disparate corporate cultures of the staid
Time and the free-wheeling Warner - the two sides that came together three
years ago in a controversial Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.2bn) merger. The company
claims talk of such cultural divisions is exaggerated.
Whatever the case, it is clear that Time Warner faces a number of more
material challenges as it begins a new era without its charismatic founder.
Chief among these is the need for Time Warner to become more corporate in
its top-level management and decision making and less a cult of personality.
On the financial side, Wall Street has been promised that Time Warner will
come to terms with its Dollars 9bn debt burden, a residue of the 1989
merger, and reduce it by selling off assets.
In strategic terms the company is still searching for more international
partners to buy into its Time Warner Entertainment (TWE) subsidiary, which
last year obtained only Dollars 1bn for a 12.5 per cent stake from Toshiba
and C. Itoh of Japan - half the level desired by Mr Ross.
Finally, it has yet to be shown at Time Warner - as at other companies such
as the Sony group - that the various components can produce synergies that
go beyond rhetoric and make solid contributions to the bottom line.
Mr Ross's goal was to build a media and entertainment giant with global
clout and prime market positions in the Hollywood film industry, recorded
music and publishing (including the Time magazine flagship) as one of the
biggest US cable television operators and as a successful programmer for
cable through the Home Box Office (HBO) division. This he did, and the
company is expected to close 1992 with Dollars 14bn of revenues and profits
in all divisions.
The film division is likely to make Dollars 400m of operating profits,
before depreciation and amortisation, up from Dollars 390m last year; the
music business should produce Dollars 580m of operating income, against
Dollars 560m; HBO should achieve Dollars 215m, up from Dollars 195m; the
cable operations could earn nearly Dollars 1bn in 1992, against Dollars 872m
last year; and publishing should yield Dollars 330m, compared to Dollars
246m in 1991.( The graph gives a divisional breakdown of 1991 operating
profit after depreciation and amortisation.)
Mr Alan Grubman, a leading US entertainment lawyer who knew Mr Ross well,
yesterday called the late Time Warner chairman 'one of the great pioneers of
the modern entertainment industry, along with people like William Paley'.
Yet Mr Ross - a silver-haired extrovert with an affinity for glitz - was an
entrepreneur who suffered from the same problems as many company founders.
As one of his friends put it: 'Steve ran the company as a family. So no
matter how screwed up it was he would never sell off one or two of his
children. I think he had a terribly difficult time trying to deal with
selling assets. Founders of companies usually don't want to let go.'
The need to reduce the debt has been apparent for the past two years,
especially as merger-related special dividend payments have consistently
resulted in net losses despite strong operating profits.
Mr Levin and the new managers of Time Warner are likely to be able to
dispose of assets in a way Mr Ross could not because he was so emotionally
tied to Time Warner holdings. The Levin team has promised to seek to reduce
the debt by Dollars 3bn by selling off non-strategic assets over the next
three years.
Mr Holmes yesterday said debt reduction was a top priority for the
management team and acknowledged that in announcing planned asset sales
recently, he was also seeking to reassure investors dissatisfied with the
price of Time Warner's stock. 'We're not happy with the stock performance
either,' he said.
Mr Holmes also said more international partners are being lined up, and
could be announced during 1993. While alliances are useful for the
distribution of entertainment products and to generate more non-US revenues,
they are also sorely needed to bring in cash to lower the company's debt.
There is no easy answer to the question of achieving strategic synergies;
regardless of how sceptical outside observers may be, companies as diverse
as Time Warner, Sony, Matsushita and Bertelsmann all believe that pooling
different entertainment businesses will yield economies of scale and profits
in the future.
As for a new style of management, Time Warner insiders claim Mr Levin is
firmly in control and they point out that the company's decision-making
process has become much less personality-driven since Mr Ross was sidelined
a year ago by treatments for prostate cancer.
The 52-year-old Mr Levin hails from the Time side, was a prime architect of
the 1989 merger accord and yet is described by insiders as a man who is
committed to Mr Ross's vision of the group as a global force in
entertainment.
Mr Liman stressed yesterday that 'Steve hand-picked Gerry Levin as his
successor'.
The most lasting legacy of the passing of Mr Ross may be that it enables the
company he founded to make difficult decisions without regard to sentiment
or emotion. This was acknowledged yesterday by a Time Warner executive, who
none the less noted that 'things will still never be quite the same'.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Courtaulds Textiles pension scheme to reduce surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS Textiles is to restructure its pension scheme to reduce a surplus
which has reached 55 per cent of liabilities on prudent assumptions.
The clothing and fabrics manufacturer, which was demerged from the
Courtaulds fibres and chemicals group in 1990, will increase benefits and
withdraw Pounds 32m in cash for the company's benefit, although more than
Pounds 12m of this will go in tax. These moves will cost Pounds 38m.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive, said yesterday that the surplus
represented dead money. 'We are trying to bring to life an asset which is
far greater than is required for prudence.'
The plan will be implemented in January now several months of negotiations
with the pension scheme's trustees - who voted 9-1 in favour - and the
Inland Revenue have been completed.
Last March the pension scheme showed a surplus of Pounds 74m on the basis
favoured by the trustees. A less conservative basis, calculated for the
purposes of the accounting standard SSAP 24, indicated a surplus of Pounds
104m (or 85 per cent overfunding).
Courtaulds Textiles has a very immature pension scheme because when it was
split from the main Courtaulds scheme in 1990 all the pensioners stayed with
the original plan and the Textiles scheme took just under 10,000 members in
employment. Much of the surplus was inherited from the main scheme.
It says contributions by Courtaulds in the 1970s and 1980s were in
retrospect too high, while stock market performance was very favourable in
the 1980s and especially good for the Courtaulds fund.
In fact the fund has outperformed the average UK pension fund by 2 per cent
a year on average over the past decade, which explains much of the surplus.
The investment portfolio continues to be managed by the main Courtaulds
scheme, on a unitised basis.
The impact of the restructuring on the company's profit and loss account
will be complex. The Pounds 19m cash will create interest savings in 1993
and some Pounds 0.25m of administration costs are also being transferred to
the pension scheme. However, an accounting benefit from the surplus is
already being received, and this SSAP 24 credit may fall from Pounds 4.8m
for 1992 to under Pounds 2m.

FT  22 DEC 92 / NatWest pledges support for broking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank said yesterday that its stockbroking business had
emerged successfully from its two years probation and there was no longer
any question of closing or selling the business.
However, it also said that the broker's name would be changed from County
NatWest Securities to NatWest Securities from the beginning of the year.
The announcements were made by Dr Martin Owen, in his first interview as
chief executive of NatWest Markets, which groups together all the bank's
investment and corporate banking businesses.
Dr Owen has been conducting a review of all NatWest Markets operations since
he became chief executive in June. The outcome was particularly important
for County NatWest, because Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said in
February 1991 that the securities business had two years to prove its worth.
'We have made a firm commitment to stay in equities', said Dr Owen. 'It is
part of our core business'.
His statement will come as a disappointment to many of his rivals, who had
been hoping that a NatWest withdrawal would reduce excess capacity in the
London securities market.
The renaming follows the adverse publicity County NatWest received from the
Blue Arrow affair, which led to two Department of Trade and Industry
inquiries and a criminal prosecution against the bank.
However, Dr Owen believes that the name still has some value, so its
corporate finance and investment management operations will continue to
trade as County NatWest.
Last week, NatWest gave up its seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is
likely to lead to the loss of more than 70 jobs in Japan. But Dr Owen said
no other parts of the equities business, which employs just over 1,000
people worldwide, were earmarked for closure.
Dr Owen refused to comment on the business's 1992 performance, because the
bank has entered the closed season when it is prohibited from discussing its
latest financial results. However, he was confident that the equities
business would make a profit in 1993 - as would the whole of NatWest
Markets.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Groups face tax rise under new treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY BRITISH multinational companies will be forced to restructure their
operations or face substantial tax rises under a draft treaty between the US
and the Netherlands.
Tax on dividends and interest payments from US-based businesses owned
through a Dutch holding company could increase sharply. Foreign investors in
the US who channel funds through Dutch companies to reduce the tax burden
are also likely to be affected.
The details are contained in the revised US-Dutch tax treaty negotiated over
11 years, which was approved by both governments last week and could be
ratified by the US Senate and the Dutch parliament for implementation as
soon as January 1994.
It comes after pressure for reform of the existing treaty by the US
government, which has been concerned at the use of Dutch holding companies
to avoid US tax liabilities.
Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young in
London, said: 'Many, many companies will be forced to restructure their
operations.'
Mr Duncan Bratschell, group tax manager at Thorn-EMI which has a series of
Dutch companies, said: 'We have done certain things to mitigate the effect
(of the treaty) in the past. But this is one they have kept very close to
their chests.'
Royal Dutch Shell said its lawyers were still studying the agreement but
believed it would not have much impact on the company.
The treaty will increase US withholding taxes on dividends to Dutch
companies from 5 per cent to 30 per cent, and on interest payments from zero
to 30 per cent unless the Dutch company can satisfy new requirements.
That will substantially reduce the scope for UK and other investors to use
Dutch companies to take advantage of differences in international tax
regimes and offset or 'blend' tax liabilities against each other before
remitting them home.
The treaty is particularly important for UK multinationals, because there is
no facility for them to offset these taxes once they have been remitted to
the companies in the UK. It will also affect investors from many countries
without US tax treaties, such as Hong Kong, the Middle East, South Africa,
and Central and South America.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Novell to purchase Unix for Dollars 350m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOVELL, the largest publisher of software that links computers on networks,
has signed a letter of intent to acquire Unix Systems Laboratories, an AT&amp;T
unit responsible for the licensing and development of the widely used Unix
computer operating system.
The proposed Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) acquisition will have profound
implications for vendors and users of 'open systems' computers. It also
signals an intensifying battle between Novell and Microsoft, the world's
largest software company, over control of the market for operating systems
and networking software.
USL is 77 per cent owned by AT&amp;T, which formed the unit in 1991 in response
to rising concerns about AT&amp;T's control over development and licensing of
Unix, which has become the standard operating system for 'open systems' in
which computers from different manufacturers work together.
AT&amp;T encouraged other computer companies to acquire minority stakes in USL
to provide them some control over the development of Unix.
Novell already owns 5 per cent of USL and 11 other computer-industry
companies together own 18 per cent. The deal has been approved by the boards
of Novell and AT&amp;T, but it has not yet been approved by the other Unix
System Labs owners, which include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL, Motorola, NEC, Sun
Microsystems, Oki Electric, Olivetti and Toshiba. Initial reactions from
these ranged from 'neutral to positive' said Mr Roel Pieper, president and
chief executive of USL.
For AT&amp;T and other USL shareholders, the exchange of shares will be tax
free. Based on current Novell stock price, AT&amp;T expects to recognise a gain
in excess of Dollars 100m and will own about 3 per cent of Novell's stock.
Novell will account for the transaction as a purchase and expects to record
a write-off of Dollars 250m.
Mr Peter Stuart, head of midrange marketing strategy for ICL, the UK-based
computer company which has been a European leader in open systems, said it
was beneficial that USL's owner should be a software house which understood
the business and had a long-term view of the market. It would be
disadvantageous if Novell attempted to focus on the desk-top.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Stock Exchange recommends closure of USM by end-1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange recom-mended yesterday that the Unlisted Securities
Market should close at the end of 1995 as it no longer fulfilled its role of
providing capital for smaller companies.
The exchange intends to open 'an identifiable smaller companies sector' on
the official list. The 308 USM companies would have to move to the official
list or lose their quotations.
To help companies make the transition, the initial fee payable on admission
to the main market will be waived and companies will not be required to
produce listing particulars.
A final decision about the USM will be taken in March, and the exchange will
take into account comments received before March 5. If the closure goes
ahead, no new issues will be allowed on the USM after June 30 next year.
Mr Ian Salter, deputy chairman of the exchange, said: 'The USM was a very
successful market for smaller companies raising capital in the 1980s. Our
research shows it is no longer fulfilling that role. A decision to close the
USM on a fixed date with clear arrangements in place . . . is preferable to
allowing the market to disintegrate gradually.'
Speculation about the proposed closure of the market, which opened in 1980,
has grown during the last year while the Stock Exchange was conducting a
review of its future.
The review concluded that there had been a convergence between the USM and
the official list and 'investors' and companies' perceptions of the USM have
markedly deteriorated'. The USM 'is now widely regarded as a dying market'
it said, with companies remaining on the USM because of the cost of moving
to a full listing.
Many USM-quoted companies and followers have welcomed the expected decision.
But there have been some voices of dissent from those who believed the USM
could again provide an important source of equity capital for smaller
companies once the recession lifted. During its review, the exchange
considered a new market for immature companies but found there was
'insufficient demand'.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Panic alleges widespread fraud: Milosevic nationalists head
for victory in Serbian presidential elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR MILAN PANIC, the Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday alleged widespread
fraud in Sunday's Serbian presidential elections as early returns pointed to
a victory for the incumbent, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his nationalists.
Unofficial and partial results showed that Mr Milosevic had Received 56 per
cent compared with 34 per cent for Mr Panic, with about 23 per cent of the
vote counted.
Mr Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Mr Milosevic's Socialist party, said: 'We are
confident that Milosevic is convincingly ahead of Panic and that he will win
in the first round.'
Mr Panic's office claimed, on the basis of exit polls, that the
Yugoslav-born California businessman was still ahead of Mr Milosevic. But
Serbia's Socialists and the allied ultranationalist Serbian Radical party
appeared to be leading the poll for the Serbian and federal parliaments.
The Socialists last night even claimed Mr Milosevic had de-feated Mr Panic
in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, an opposition stronghold.
Mr Panic said he would seek an annulment of Sunday's ballot and demand a
rerun within 90 days.
He said the election committee had counted ballots for the presidential race
in local municipalities instead of sending them to the central electoral
committee where observers were present.
A team of observers from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe backed Mr Panic's claims of election irregularities.
Observers, opposition leaders and diplomats all reported numerous cases of
people's names being deleted from voter registers, ballot box stuffing, and
unsealed ballot boxes.
The US State Department said US and other western observers had found
'significant irregularities' in the conduct of the election in Serbia.
'However, neither we nor the CSCE election observers have been able to make
a judgment yet as to whether these problems with the electoral lists were
the result of deliberate patterns of exclusion or the result of
administrative errors,' said Mr Richard Boucher of the State Department.
Foreign observers said the race was unfair from the start because of the
bias of Television Serbia under Mr Milosevic's control.
The Serbian presidential race overshadowed parliamentary, federal and local
elections in Montenegro. The two republics together claim the mantle of
former Yugoslavia, which is not recognised internationally.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned yesterday that time was
running out for Serbia to make 'rapid and radical' changes to end its
aggression or face total isolation in the international community.
Speaking after a meeting of European Community foreign ministers, he said he
expected the UN Security Council to pass a resolution providing for
enforcement of a no-fly zone over Bosnia.
Mr Hurd said there would be a delay in enforcement while the UN tested
whether the Serbs intended to comply.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Hotline for complaints about EC barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRUSTRATED about frontier controls? Piqued by passport checks? From January,
you can ring a telephone hotline to complain about remaining barriers to
free movement around the European Community.
Euro Citizen Action Service, a Brussels-based lobby group for citizens'
rights, yesterday launched a fax and telephone service which will field
complaints that the EC has missed its January 1 deadline for ending passport
checks at internal borders.
Ecas is running the service between January 4-8 only, hoping to tap a
supposed undercurrent of discontent about the failure of most countries to
lift all internal border controls on people.
But the complaints hotline will undoubtedly not satisfy some free-travel
proponents, who favour a more direct approach. Some federalist members of
the European Parliament are likely to test the legality of British
resistance to lifting controls by crossing to Dover without a passport early
in the new year in the hope of being turned away.
Ecas volunteers will tell callers of a more timid disposition how to lodge a
formal complaint with the European Commission, and will compile a list of
gripes which could be used in a European Court case against Brussels or
individual EC governments. Ecas also wants to encourage people to complain
if they are deprived of information at borders about their rights in the new
internal market.
At the Edinburgh summit 10 days ago leaders of the 12 Community countries
admitted that free movement of people - one of the aims of the single market
 -could not be 'completely assured' by January 1. Nine Continental countries
aim to lift internal controls at land frontiers by the middle of next year.
But airports have been given until December 1 to end passport checks on
internal EC flights. Britain, Denmark and Ireland may lighten passport
controls but are likely to retain some form of check at all internal borders
beyond that date.
The Commission shares the Ecas interpretation of EC treaty rules that all
controls should go, but appears to have dropped the immediate threat of
legal action against member states which maintain passport checks.
Ecas, Rue Defacqz 1, 1050 Brussels, Belgium. Frontier control hotline
(available only from January 4 to January 8): Brussels 534 8325 (telephone),
534 5275 (fax).

FT  22 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perplexing that Lucas, which constantly lauds the virtues of the
long-term approach, should choose to sell its fluid power systems business
near the bottom of the cycle. Although the disposal was flagged in the
company's latest annual report, Lucas is jettisoning a long-established
company just when it might flourish from a US recovery. The suspicion
remains that the disposal programme is motivated more by a desire to
maintain the dividend than to preserve long-term value. The sale may realise
a useful Pounds 30m. Further asset sales could bring total disposal proceeds
to Pounds 100m by the financial year-end.
Lucas argues that an earnings recovery will enable it to preserve the payout
this year. But it is difficult to see from where the necessary uplift will
come. Prospects for the aerospace arm remain unfathomable given its
dependence on the stricken defence sector. The automotive side will continue
to suffer from the travails of the truck market and the downwards lurch
among German carmakers.
Still, Lucas undoubtedly retains a powerful position in these markets. And
with margins of only 1 per cent on sales of Pounds 2.3bn it possesses
considerable recovery potential. The question remains: who will best realise
it? Management may have decided that a hasty sale of the family brass is the
best defence against the much-rumoured bid. The problem is that without a
bid premium, Lucas's shares look unduly heavy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That Courtaulds Textiles can afford to take a slice out of its pension fund
surplus after three years of generally lousy investment returns testifies to
nimble fund management. Actuarial valuations of most company pension funds
are unlikely to be so kind. Many will reveal dwindling surpluses, marking
the end of contribution holidays. That means an unwelcome demand on cash
flow for some companies. But it could be good news for the equity and bond
markets as a whole.
One side of Courtaulds Textiles' arrangement takes Pounds 32m out of the
pension fund - invested predominantly in UK equities - and passes the cash
into company coffers. Too many similar instances would have an uncomfortable
impact on institutional cash flow. Courtaulds Textiles is by no means
unique. Its sister chemicals company has accumulated an equal embarrassment
of riches. But higher contributions from companies reaching the end of
pension fund holidays are likely comfortably to offset the cash withdrawals
of companies in the same position as Courtaulds.
Whether any company should be sharing out its pension fund surplus while the
investment outlook is so uncertain is another matter. In Courtaulds
Textiles' case, the action looks justified because by bringing the surplus
below the government threshold the fund avoids paying unnecessary tax. Since
the fund still shows a modest surplus on the government actuary's gloomy
assumptions - including dividends declining by 1.8 per cent a year in real
terms in perpetuity - it is hard to argue that benefits have been put at
risk.

FT  22 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To be charitable, Lasmo's disposal of peripheral assets at least
demonstrates that oilfields can still fetch reasonable prices. Lasmo has
also continued to cut deals in a difficult market. And the company has raked
in some much-needed cash, giving the management more leeway to maintain its
final dividend if it so desires.
Yet, however helpful, pulling in Dollars 145m will not lift the company's
heavy debt burden. Exploration and development spending will fall next year,
but Lasmo must still make further disposals if borrowings are not to rise
once more. That underlines the conundrum facing the company, which was
caught with high gearing when asset values started to fall. Its most
saleable assets are precisely those which would provide the short-term cash
flow to service its debt burden. So to cut its gearing, the company is
selling part of its future.
The bind is all the tighter because crude oil prices show little sign of
rising above Dollars 20 a barrel. As a result the oil industry is having to
cut costs sharply. Efficiency gains from integrating Ultramar are needed if
Lasmo is simply to stand still. Short-term prospects for the share price may
be torn between the attractions of a 7.5 per cent yield, and fears that the
payment cannot be sustained forever. The company really needs a buoyant oil
price.

FT  22 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Protected returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Community foreign ministers failed to make up their minds on
whether to upgrade the EC's trade policy armoury yesterday. But there is no
mistaking the increase in protectionist pressure as completion of the single
market draws near. Adding to the fear that EC companies would be unable to
stand increased internal competition without extra external protection is
worry about imports flooding in from eastern Europe.
The risk of Fortress Europe would diminish if Sir Leon Brittan were to
assume responsibility for trade policy in the new Commission. Yet
anti-dumping will be one of the few trade policy instruments left in the
single market. There is a natural desire to make it easier to use. Which
raises the question of the impact of protection on corporate earnings.
Conventional wisdom says the larger benefit usually accrues to the efficient
foreign exporter whose goods are being targeted. This company pockets extra
margin. The protected company suffers from reduced growth at home as prices
consumers must pay are raised. It also has less incentive to rationalise.
Restrictions on consumer electronics imports did little for Philips. Its
shares underperformed Matsushita by more than 20 per cent in the last 10
years. The evidence, though, is far from clear-cut. Peugeot outperformed
Honda by a factor of eight over the same period. GEC outperformed Mitsubishi
Electric by 8 per cent, admittedly thanks to a steep relative improvement
since 1990.
Then again, such comparisons are crude. Perhaps more competition inside the
single market will offset the indolence induced by protection. It is easy to
forget that a combination of tough domestic competition and external
protection helped Japanese companies succeed in the 1980s.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Pursuit of riches from among the rubble: A new generation of
entrepreneurs is hoping to profit from the depressed UK property industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One by one, the stars of the UK property industry have fallen to earth,
leaving a trail of lost fortunes in their wake. Godfrey Bradman of
Rosehaugh, and the Reichmann brothers of Canary Wharf, are only a few of the
long list of casualties.
But as the dust begins to settle, attention is turning to the entrepreneurs
who turn the devastation in the industry to their advantage. This is no easy
task: in a rising market, anyone can look clever; in a falling market, few
succeed.
After every serious downturn, the property tycoon has been declared extinct
 -only to reappear some years later. That is because the property business
is capitalism in the raw: it allows people the chance to make - and lose -
fortunes, far more rapidly than most manufacturing or service businesses.
The main ingredients of success are good contacts and negotiating skills.
For this reason, many property entrepreneurs begin their careers as estate
agents or chartered surveyors.
Nick Leslau, a surveyor, is one of the new breed. Since joining Burford
Holdings, a newly formed property company in 1983, when he was only 23, he
has acquired a reputation in the City as an astute dealer.
He sold at the top of the market and has bought at distressed prices during
the past 18 months. Sales included Henrietta House in the West End in
mid-1990; acquisitions have concentrated on small offices and properties
outside London.
Another surveyor who has ridden the ups and downs of the market with some
skill is Michael Goldhill, 43. He worked as an estate agent until 1983 when
he set up a property investment company. He sold the company six years later
at the peak of the market, and started again with a vehicle called Hemingway
Properties, a fledgling investment company.
Solicitors can also cross the professional divide. Among the
laywers-turned-entrepreneurs are Peter and Michael Freeman, two brothers who
head Argent Estates, a private company with gross assets of Pounds 170m.
After qualifying at D J Freeman, the family law firm, their first foray into
the property world was in 1981 when they built an office building in
Southampton with the help of Pounds 100,000 of family money.
Argent now occupies offices in the Albany in Piccadilly, a prestigious
London address, and claims its corporate objective is to become 'one of the
largest and best-respected property companies in the country by 2000'.
These investors are vulnerable to the charge that they have moved too early.
Many critics think commercial property values will continue to fall for at
least another year. By contrast, most buyers are convinced they are seizing
an historic opportunity. Property, they say, is cheap compared with its
historical cost.
'The market is turning. It is a marvellous time to set up a business,' says
Martin Barber, the 48-year-old chairman of Capital &amp; Regional, another small
property company which returned to the market in 1991, after selling much of
its property in 1988. 'The last three months of 1992 and the next six months
of 1993 will be a window of opportunity.'
But even those who believe property values are attractive admit that the
odds are stacked against the newcomer.
First, opportunities are hard to come by, both in the development and
investment markets. In development, newcomers have often started by
assembling the site, obtaining planning permission and finding a tenant. An
outside investor could then be brought in while the developer could retain
some of the equity. But this avenue has been largely closed by the glut of
property on the market.
Second, even in the investment market, investors complain that it is
surprisingly difficult to find good-quality buildings at knock-down prices,
despite the large numbers of property owners who need to sell to lighten
their debt burdens. 'It is almost inconceivable there are not some cracking
bargains out there - but we haven't found them yet,' says Leslau.
Another problem for a new property company without a strong asset base or a
distinguished record is the difficult of attracting finance.
Mr Goldhill's first company started out with the help of Pounds 1m from 'a
dozen avuncular shareholders'. It would be harder to find venture capital
today, he says. 'People in all sorts of business have lost a lot of wealth
in recent years. They are more concerned with preserving their wealth than
backing entrepreneurs.'
When entrepreneurs have been successful at attracting capital recently,
personal contacts have tended to be all-important. Hemingway attracted funds
from some of the same institutions that backed Goldhill's previous property
company, including Courtaulds Pension Fund and Clerical Medical &amp; General.
Argent Estates got an injection of Pounds 20m from US investors 18 months
ago as the result of an introduction from an investment banker who lived
next door to Peter Freeman.
Best placed of all are those investors who have substantial capital of their
own. Among them is Jack Walker, patron of Blackburn Rovers football club and
a former steel magnate, who has invested heavily this year in commercial
property. The Tchenguiz family, entrepreneurs who moved from Iran to the UK
after the fall of the Shah, has also invested substantial sums by buying
properties such as Sea Containers House near Blackfriars.
The few established property men who emerged well from the 1980s are also
potentially large deal-makers. Examples include John and Peter Beckwith, two
Old Harrovians who received Pounds 40m each when they sold London &amp;
Edinburgh Trust, their development company, for Pounds 491m in April 1990.
One established figure who is gambling on a market upturn is John Ritblat, a
rare example of an entrepreneurial chairman of a large quoted company. He
runs British Land, which recovered from near-collapse in 1974 to become one
of the largest and most daring property investment companies.
He shares a common characteristic of developers - the ability to put
reserves of optimism, audacity and resilience into a well-timed comeback.
Witness Ronald Lyons, a property veteran who presided over company failures
in 1974 and again in 1983. This year, he has been discussing deals in
eastern Germany with Godfrey Bradman, newly departed from Rosehaugh.
Not even personal bankruptcy need be a lasting deterrent. William Stern, the
most spectacular casualty of the 1974 crash, who accumulated debts of Pounds
104m, had his bankruptcy suspended and was back in the market by 1988.
Such comebacks did not happen overnight, illustrating the protracted nature
of the recovery from the 1970s crash. This time round, the decline has been
steeper and the recovery is likely to be even slower. The entrepreneurs who
are trying to buy at the bottom of the market could have an uncomfortable
few years before their courage is vindicated.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Letter: Real nature of council tendering dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM FLANAGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Could I help to clarify the uncertainty surrounding employee rights on
council tendering ('Disputes over employees' terms threaten council
tendering plans', December 16)? Contracts of employment must be preserved by
a successful tenderer if the EC Acquired Rights Directive or the Transfer of
Undertakings Regulations apply.
To date, the main preoccupation has been with the regulations' requirement
that the entity must be 'in the nature of a commercial venture'. This
requirement is not in the directive and is becoming irrelevant.
However, for either the directive or the regulations to apply, there must
still be an actual transfer of an existing economic entity.
This is a question of fact in every case, involving an analysis of what, if
anything, is being transferred. There is no ideal checklist.
The government's insistence that the regulations do not apply to competitive
tenders 'as a general rule' is just another way of saying that most
contracting out does not involve a transfer of anything. This is usually
correct. Therefore, neither the regulations not the directive should apply.
Nevertheless, the European Court of Justice is applying the directive when
it can and it is impossible to say that it will not apply it to more
contracting out situations.
I can understand the local authorities' dilemma and can suggest that if they
can show that they have made a reasoned decision that the regulations do not
apply, because there is no 'transfer' at all, then any resulting redundancy
payments should not be ultra vires.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Letter: Offshore oil and gas industry confidence endangered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J V PARZIALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate on energy policy, the welter of detail on generating
costs and similar matters has been the principal topic so far in the select
committee and the media. Some larger issues are in danger of being obscured.
These have a big bearing on Britain's offshore oil and gas producing
industry, the enormous investments it represents and the employment it
provides both offshore and onshore.
This industry is a large contributor to the UK economy, not only in balance
of payments and tax revenue generation, but at the pragmatic level of
industrial activity, development of new technology and jobs. All available
figures, including the Department of Trade and Industry's, estimate that
more than 3,000 companies throughout the UK benefit from offshore work.
About 300,000 jobs onshore depend on this work, quite apart from the 30,000
people who are regularly employed offshore. The capital spending programmes
of oil and gas companies have for some years amounted to about one quarter
of total UK industrial investment.
But it is an industry that depends heavily on confidence in the future.
Offshore projects are planned with up to 25-year lives and undertaking
exploration and subsequent production is a high risk business in which large
sums are invested on the basis of sparse information. The industry's
confidence in future political, fiscal and market policies is critical to
planning its activities, particularly when - as at present - high operating
costs in UK waters provide unfavourable economic comparisons with other
international opportunities for investment.
Continuing development of Britain's gas reserves, and the investment and
jobs that go with it, requires a consistent approach on the part of
government and stable policies towards its momentum and growth. We believe
there are sufficient reserves of UK gas to satisfy the nation's needs well
into the next century.
These future opportunities will be put at risk if gas is regarded casually
and mistakenly as a distant resource, always on tap, to be turned on or off
by the short-term arguments of expediency. Continuity of offshore
exploration and development will only occur in a climate of industry
confidence in rational economic and political decision-making. It is this
climate of confidence that may now be endangered.

Sir, Samuel Brittan should be wary of lauding the 'four tigers' - South
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - too highly (Economic Viewpoint,
December 17). I have recently worked in Taiwan for 18 months and government
statistics from this part of the world are highly suspect. For example
inflation in Taiwan was recently thought to be too high, so the index was
changed and inflation was thus reduced - problem solved?
New technology is the motor of gross domestic product and in these economies
 -which are still at the 'catch-up' state with the west - it is relatively
easy to grow by importing foreign technology to a low-cost workforce. The
hard part is developing new technologies beyond the bounds of existing
foreign expertise and so far the omens are not good. Entrepreneurs are
showing relatively little interest in new technological investment at home,
preferring instead to shift low technology production to mainland China,
Malaysia, Vietnam, etc. This has created a crisis in the form of huge
capital outflows. The full story of the four tigers remains to be told.

News that the Courtaulds Textiles pension scheme was handing back part of
its huge surplus should come as no surprise to professional pension fund
watchers.
In an industry which worships the average, Courtaulds in-house pension fund
has always been the odd man out. It has prospered by not following the herd.
John Evans, the current manager, has never been to a National Association of
Pension Funds annual conference, and as he's now 58, he has no intention of
starting now.
His name does not appear in City directories and he is not as well known as
his two predecessors, Alastair Ross Goobey, who is about to run PosTel, and
Matthew Oakeshott, who left to set up Olim, his own money management firm.
However, Evans has been around longer than both of them. He first managed
Courtaulds pension money in the mid-1970s before joining Oliver Marriott -
author of The Property Boom - in the property business. He returned in 1986.
Evans plays down the difficulties in-house pension schemes have in paying
enough to recruit the best investment managers. His team can concentrate on
investing and doesn't have to waste time trying to win new clients.
But more important are his pension fund trustees whom he describes as
'challenging and sympathetic'. Whereas outside managers are ruled by
quarterly valuations, Evans is able to take a longer term and often
contrarian view. He has made money investing in unfashionable parts of the
property market when others lost their shirts. 'You have to earn this
privilege, but once earned, it can become a virtuous circle,' he says.

A most un-Swiss row is boiling up between the olympian Union Bank of
Switzerland and its largest shareholder, BK Vision, an investment trust
formed last year by Martin Ebner's maverick Zurich securities house, BZ
Bank.
UBS threw down the gauntlet at the weekend by announcing that its board
would not renominate to its ranks Christoph Blocher, the feisty right wing
industrialist-politician who led the triumphant campaign last month against
Switzerland joining the European Economic Area.
Blocher's sin, the bank hastened to clarify, was not his opposition to the
EEA. His silencing of UBS chief executive Robert Studer at a public meeting
during the EEA referendum campaign was also irrelevant.
It was his alleged advocacy of government regulation of mortgage interest
rates and of bringing the Swiss central bank under parliamentary control
that rankled the bosses at the country's largest bank.
What is the connection between Blocher and BK Vision? None directly, but
Blocher and Ebner are known to be close business associates. And Ebner, with
nearly 4 per cent of UBS voting stock behind him, likes to talk about
shareholder rights and the importance of having dissent on company boards.
Blocher has kindly prepared the ground for his friend. 'I am not prepared to
stand down voluntarily,' he says defiantly.

Reports are filtering through of a small contretemps in the normally
peaceful senior common room of Chatham House, or the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, to give Britain's premier foreign-policy think tank
its proper title. Gerald Pollio, head of the important energy and
environment programme, is on the way out after less than six months on the
job.
While these types of personnel upheaval are not uncommon in big business, or
US banking where Pollio comes from, they are highly unusual in such an
egghead ambience.
Under Pollio's predecessor Jonathan Stern the institute made quite a name
for itself in the energy and environment game. Its programme has twice as
many corporate sponsors as any other. Hence a certain embarrassment at the
programme chief's departure.
Chatham House high command is keeping mum. But one suggestion is that Pollio
had had some difficulty making the transition from commerce to academe. If
so, corporate sponsors might sympathise with him.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These are trying times for west Berliners whose mains-powered electric
clocks have been running haywire, losing up to 12 minutes a week.
After many a ticking-off from irate customers, the city's power company,
Bewag, has at last identified the fault. Aiming to cushion west Berlin's
previously independent system at peak times, the company decided to import
power from the east European network.
It now transpires that Russian generating stations often diverge from the
standard frequency of 50 cycles a second, with the result that clocks and
such things as they govern in the old Comecon area have been inaccurate for
the past 40 years and have to be adjusted weekly - if not daily.
True, that may not have mattered to managers less worried about their
workers' time-keeping than about whether they would turn up at all.
It would seem that the Russians must have used quartz timers for their space
launches. But alas, Bewag has no similarly sophisticated way of satisfying
its customers' complaints.
Although charging the highest rates for electricity in Germany, it insists
that wayward clocks are a small price to pay for increased power reserves
until it can get round to rectifying the problem sometime in the middle of
next year.

Sir, Your editorial concerning the proposed British Airways investment in
USAir ('Deal in the air', December 18) is right on the mark. It would be a
sad day for international aviation if the US and UK miss this opportunity to
break the log-jam on negotiations toward a liberalised agreement on air
services.
You have correctly identified the Heathrow access restrictions for US air
carriers as the primary obstacle to progress. We agree that if the UK
government is willing to eliminate this barrier, the deal can indeed 'be the
trigger' for a liberalisation of transatlantic air services from which all
would benefit.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Personal View: Tax the speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES TOBIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1973, exchange rates
among leading national currencies have fluctuated, often violently. Much of
their volatility reflects short-term speculation, distorting signals the
markets give for trade and long-range investment. Most experts agree that
the ups and downs have greatly exceeded variations in rational estimates of
currencies' fundamental values.
The travails of the world economy since 1973 inspire nostalgic longings for
Bretton Woods, or even for a single world currency. Other proposals would
keep the floating rate regime while setting limits on fluctuations and
formalising the responsibilities of nations to keep exchange rates within
agreed bands. In Europe, the recent troubles of the exchange rate mechanism
have dramatised such issues.
Here I shall argue for a different proposal, which I first advanced in 1978.
An international uniform tax should be levied on spot transactions in
foreign exchange (including deliveries on futures contracts and options).
The proposal has two basic motivations. One is to increase the weight that
market participants give to long-range fundamentals relative to immediate
speculative opportunities. The second is to allow greater autonomy to
national monetary policies, by making possible greater differences between
short-term interest rates in different currencies.
At the time, I anticipated that the proposed tax would be superimposed on a
regime of market-determined exchange rates with minimal official
interventions. But the tax could also be helpful to systems involving
interventions, from agreements on target bands to full restoration of
Bretton Woods. It could also be useful as an adjunct to the ERM.
My proposal is a realistic, second-best option. A common currency works to
great advantage when sustained by common institutions: free movements of
goods, people, and financial capital; laws, courts, taxes, regulations, and
customs; a uniform system of social security and other entitlements;
assistance to regions and individuals suffering economic reverses. But a
common currency is not viable without those institutions; even in Europe it
may take a decade or two.
Fixed rates of exchange among national currencies, which central banks are
committed to maintain by market interventions, are by no means an
approximation of a single international currency. As long as parity changes
are possible - and often they are inevitable - private agents will speculate
on such changes. In this respect, a system of adjustable pegs of national
currencies - for example, pegs to dollars or to gold - differs very little
from a floating rate regime. The only difference is that adjustments of pegs
occur in discrete and traumatic jumps. Anyone who believes that the shocks
to the world economy since 1973 would have been less disturbing under a
regime of adjustable pegs has a short memory.
Although a true worldwide common currency is decades premature, vast private
funds are prepared to arbitrage away differences in national interest rates
and to speculate on movements of exchange rates. My transactions tax is
designed to make international money markets compatible with modest national
autonomy in monetary and macro-economic policy.
A  1/2 per cent tax on currency transactions is equivalent to a 4 percentage
point difference in annual interest rates on three-month bills, a
considerable deterrent to those contemplating a quick round trip to another
currency. The intent is to slow down speculative capital movements; it would
be too small to deter commodity trade or serious international capital
commitments.
In 1936, Keynes pointed out that a transactions tax could strengthen the
weight of long-range fundamentals in stock market pricing, as against
speculators' guesses of the short-rage behaviours of other speculators. The
same is true for the foreign exchange markets. Vast resources of
intelligence and enterprise are wasted in financial speculation, essentially
in playing zero-sum games. A transaction tax might reallocate some of the
resources. To the extent that it does not, it would at least produce needed
government revenues without bad side-effects. It is estimated that more than
Dollars 1,000bn in gross foreign exchange transactions occur every business
day.
It is obviously necessary to have an international agreement on the tax. My
suggestion is that the proceeds go to the World Bank, but other
dispositions, including less altruistic ones, could be considered.
While the proposed tax would give national macro-economic authorities
somewhat greater autonomy, it would certainly not permit them to ignore the
international repercussions of their policies. The leading economies would
still need to co-ordinate policies. In particular, they must agree a general
level of world interest rates, while allowing for differences among
countries appropriate to their national circumstances.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Japan in the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE tortuous Japanese budgetary process grinds into motion again this
week, with the Ministry of Finance revealing its plans for the 1993 fiscal
year, the same nagging doubts present themselves. Has the official machine
really got the measure of the problems that afflict the economy? And can
Japan adapt to the very different environment that it faces in the aftermath
of the bubble economy?
While the growth forecast for the current year has finally been revised
downwards from 3.5 per cent to 1.6 per cent, next year's budgetary
arithmetic rests on the cheerily implausible assumption of a return to
growth of 3.3 per cent. The Bank of Japan, meantime, has foolishly continued
to resist calls for a further reduction in interest rates despite
overwhelming evidence of increasing fragility in the banking system.
With industry potentially facing a fourth year of declining earnings and the
personal sector throttled by debt, the prospect for growth is more than ever
dependent on domestic budgetary stimulus or a boost from external demand. No
doubt the battle over the 1992 supplementary budget, which was finally
approved by the Diet on December 10, will have to be fought all over again,
with next July's G7 Tokyo summit providing an obvious pressure point.
The unsustainability of the present policy mix is underlined by a current
account surplus now well ahead of the level considered intolerable at the
time of the Plaza accord that preceded the Japanese bubble. With Mr Clinton
en route to the White House, Japan's historic penchant for exporting its way
out of recession is even more politically controversial this time.
Impetus for change
Yet it is possible to underestimate the impetus for change. One straw in the
wind is the state of public opinion. The Japanese were prepared to tolerate
corrupt relations between politicians, businessmen and the criminal
fraternity as long as the system delivered. But since the bursting of the
bubble at the end of 1989 the disillusionment over the failure to translate
high economic growth into a better quality of life has become palpable. That
feeling is reinforced by anger over stock market losses and an oppressive
burden of debt. While the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa is committed to
enhancing housing and infrastructure, its half-hearted measures have so far
failed to convince.
As people have lost patience with the low ethical standards that
characterise Japanese public life, the much criticised system of one-party
democracy has been forced to demonstrate a self-corrective capacity -
witness the shedding of prime ministers and party bosses, when the pressure
from an angry press and public has become overwhelming. The break-up of the
leading faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party also reflects a
reformist tendency among the younger politicians in the party. There have,
of course, been realignments and rumours of a break-up in the LDP before.
All that can be said at this stage is that the climate for change is more
propitious than at many points in the past.
Perverse effects
The new assertiveness of the Japanese public may accelerate structural
economic change in more perverse ways. Hostility towards the banks, after
the excesses of the 1980s, has scuppered a government lifeboat for
over-stretched banks. If the under-capitalised private sector lifeboat that
is now being pressed into service proves less adequate for the task,
economic recovery will be impeded. The longer recovery takes to emerge, the
greater the pressure on industry to sacrifice hallowed employment practices,
since fixed costs are too high after the investment binge of the 1980s.
Increasingly, top companies are talking openly about abandoning seniority
pay in favour of merit pay.
Similarly, the enforced departure of key members of the LDP's old guard
could make striking a deal on rice market liberalisation much harder. A
hostile US response could in these circumstances prove a catalyst for more
rapid change. The longer it takes to pull out of recession, the greater the
pressure for economic and political reform. The agenda looks more open for
Japan than it has done for many years past.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Privatising British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY EVER said railway privatisation was going to be easy, but did the
government have to make it quite so hard? Five months after publishing a
flimsy white paper that raised as many questions as it answered, the
Department of Transport has still to provide the details necessary to
convince a sceptical world that privatisation will actually work. The result
has been a vacuum which opponents have been only too eager to fill.
The latest to join the chorus of disapproval is Sir Bob Reid, the chairman
of British Rail, who has urged the government to adopt a more evolutionary
approach to rail reform. Breaking up BR would make it harder to improve rail
services in the UK, he said, and lead to the closure of branch lines. There
would be problems in maintaining safety standards, and orders would dry up
for UK rolling stock manufacturers. So-called network benefits such as
through ticketing and the national timetable would disappear.
Before writing privatisation off, however, it is as well to consider the
alternative. For under state ownership, desperately-needed investment is
certain to continue to be denied by constraints on public spending, as Sir
Bob himself acknowledged. At the same time management is stultified by
government controls and the lack of a profit motive. More of the same is the
no-hope solution.
Railway renaissance
If Britain is to see a railway renaissance - and growing demands for more
and better transport suggest that it needs one - privatisation offers the
best hope of providing it. The only question is what form it should take.
Since a sell-off is ruled out by the fact that most of the passenger railway
loses money, the government has had to find another way of introducing
private sector skills and capital into the industry.
In reality, privatisation is too strong a word for what is proposed. Only
the freight operations are to be sold outright. On the passenger side, the
private sector is being asked to bid for franchises to operate British
Rail's trains, with the contracts going to the companies requiring the
lowest subsidies. The infrastructure will remain in state ownership, with
train operators being charged for the use of the tracks. It should not be
impossible to preserve network benefits within such a setup.
Flexible approach
This approach is almost infinitely flexible, exactly the sort of
evolutionary approach which Sir Bob commends. On the passenger side, the
government may franchise one train service, half a dozen, or the lot over
the next 10 years, depending on what rate of progress seems sensible. It may
vary the terms of the franchises from one line to another in recognition of
their different attributes. Open access, for example, may be appropriate on
main trunk routes, but impractical on congested commuter lines. It may make
sense to let operators of little-used branch lines rent the tracks as well
as the trains rather than cripple them with track charges. And some services
may need to be franchised for decades at a time if that is what it takes to
persuade the private sector to invest in them.
This is not to say that privatisation will be painless. The transparency
that will result from the introduction of track charges could bring home
some uncomfortable truths about the real costs of the more heavily
loss-making freight and passenger services. But if the result is to prompt a
debate about what price society is prepared to pay to see people and goods
transported by rail rather than road, it should be welcomed.
As for the rest of the objections, most stem more from fear of change than
from any genuine weaknesses in the government's proposals. Separating track
infrastructure from the provision of services is the way of the future in
Europe: Sweden has already successfully implemented it, Germany is doing so
as part of its own rail privatisation plans, and the concept lies at the
heart of EC rail transport policy. Significantly, few if any of the
objectors to Britain's plans have been able to suggest an alternative.
The government bungled the launch of its railway plans, but the proposed
structure itself is sound. All that is needed is a clear demonstration of
the government's will to make it work. It will then be up to BR's senior
management to deliver or step aside.

FT  22 DEC 92 / The empire splits up: The fragmentation of Warsaw Pact
countries is creating an unstable division of military might
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across central and eastern Europe, armed forces are being remodelled or
created anew. In place of a monolithic system, a new military map is in the
making, fragmented, unstructured and disparate.
Since the winding-up last year of the Warsaw Pact and then the Soviet Union
itself, a pattern of new regional powers and spheres of influence has begun
to emerge. In its closing months, after the loss of East Germany in 1989,
the Warsaw Pact had six members. In the new year, when the Czech and Slovak
republics split, the six will have become 21 countries, all either
possessing their own armies, or forming them, or planning to form them, with
differing degrees of civilian control and varying levels of clarity about
doctrines or aims.
Old grievances and suspicions are returning in a region where borders
affecting large swathes of territory and ethnic groups have changed within
living memory. Nationalism is resurgent. Tensions and clashes of interest
are inevitable. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)
counts some 30 current territorial disputes in the Caucasus region alone,
arising from frontier changes in the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s.
On the fringes of the former Soviet Union, war has already struck Georgia,
Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. The conflicts in the former
Yugoslavia have revealed the inability of present European security
structures and mechanisms to tackle crises of this sort.
Military authorities in central and eastern Europe all now profess
democratic principles, but they are largely survivors from the old system.
For 36 years their armies acted as an extension of the Soviet command, with
standardised military doctrines and equipment. Today's reform-oriented
general staff officers come from a background of allegiance to the party and
to the dominant ally.
Reform of army structures is going on while remnants of a Soviet troop
presence remain in Germany and Poland as well as various former Soviet
republics, and while part of Moscow's long-range nuclear arsenal lies
stranded in three republics outside Russia.
Military spending among Moscow's former allies has been dropping for several
years, although according to SIPRI the process slowed down in 1991.
Throughout the region cuts have begun under the Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) treaty, which demands the destruction of large numbers of heavy
weapons, aircraft and helicopters. But the treaty, agreed between the Warsaw
Pact and the Nato nations two years ago, was designed to balance two blocs,
not to secure stability within either group of countries.
There are enormous disparities. Belarus, finding itself unexpectedly
independent, currently has twice as many tanks as Britain, more big guns
than France, more combat aircraft than Germany.
In Ukraine, there are reckoned to be about 700,000 troops, including forces
withdrawn by Moscow from Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Under agreed
manpower ceilings, these are due to be reduced to 450,000 in 1995. The
official aim is a strength of 250,000 - roughly equivalent to the UK's - at
the end of the decade. Most have signed oaths of allegiance to Ukraine.
Experts say some 10,000 officers have refused and are due to leave. But
there may be up to 200,000 Ukrainian officers currently serving in other
republics and eligible to return.
Ukraine now has more tanks, armoured vehicles and combat aircraft than any
other country in Europe after Russia. Even under the CFE cuts its
entitlements for tanks and armoured vehicles are Europe's third largest, and
for artillery and aircraft the second largest, dwarfing those of its
neighbours to the west.
With seven national borders and a Black Sea coast, Ukraine holds a pivotal
position in the region. The greatest source of international concern is its
ambiguity over the nuclear weapons on its soil: 176 SS-19 and SS-24
intercontinental ballistic missiles and two bases with nuclear-armed Bear
and Blackjack bombers. The country's leaders have promised to become
non-nuclear by the end of 1994. But Ukraine has yet to ratify the Start
treaty with the US on reducing strategic arsenals, as Russia and Kazakhstan
have. Unlike Belarus it has refused to accept full Russian control over the
weapons.
In the spring, it stalled over the transfer of short-range nuclear arms for
destruction in Russia. Its aim now appears to be to win the financial
assistance it failed to obtain then. The US has already offered it Dollars
175m to help dismantle the strategic arsenal and store the materials, on
condition that Kiev joins the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
'It is largely a bargaining chip, but we can't be sure,' says Dr Mark Smith,
who heads research on the former Soviet Union at the Royal United Services
Institute in London. Ukraine does not have operational control over the
weapons, nor the command system it would require. But experts believe it
could overcome these hurdles. Under the Soviet system, the most advanced
stages of nuclear weapon production were kept in Russia, but Ukraine could
undoubtedly develop an indigenous capability.
Nato officials are worried that President Leonid Kravchuk may be attracted
to the idea of a place in the family of nuclear-weapon states. Some
parliamentarians have spoken of the desirability of a small nuclear
deterrent.
'Why should they give it away, if they distrust the Russians?' asks Mr Henry
Plater-Zyberk, a military expert at the University of Surrey.
Uncertainty also surrounds the future of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet.
Agreement was reached in August on a temporary joint Russian-Ukrainian
command, putting off the division of the fleet for three years. But there
have been hints that Ukraine may want to extend its naval presence beyond
its coastal waters and possibly into the Mediterranean.
The European countries that have emerged from Moscow's domination have all,
except for Belarus, clearly turned their backs to Russia. Since the Warsaw
Pact's demise in April, 1991, a queue of potential applicants has built up
at Nato's door.
However, officials at the organisation's headquarters in Brussels complain
that the central and eastern European countries have 'exaggerated
expectations of what Nato can do'. The North Atlantic Co-operation Council,
set up by Nato as a forum for these countries, also embraces the former
Soviet Union's central Asian republics, with which they have few interests
in common and which still have ties with Russia.
Nato, created for stability in Europe, has yet to work out what its function
is in that part of the continent which used to be in Moscow's dominion. Mr
Dick Cheney, the outgoing US defence secretary, recently issued a personal
warning to Nato colleagues: 'An organisation devoted to security that does
not address these concerns is not going to survive long-term.' Nato should
ultimately agree to admit 'at least some of these nations', he said.
But Nato allies are reluctant to provide security guarantees over territory
reaching to the borders of the former Soviet Union. They are also anxious
not to sideline Russia.
In the Baltics, Nato has been trying to dampen fears about Russian
aggression and about the concentration of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad
enclave between Lithuania and Poland. This area contains as many as 400,000
troops, officials say, including units being withdrawn from Germany and the
independent Baltic republics. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are creating new
armies - still tiny with hardly any equipment. They are the only three
countries building up their military from scratch.
Elsewhere the greatest advances in ideas for reform and restructuring have
been made in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the members of the Visegrad
group formed last year. All want to redeploy forces concentrated near their
western borders. But in the case of air forces this means building new
airfields. The problem is at its most acute in the division now being
undertaken between Czech and Slovak forces. Military strength, including air
defence, has been concentrated in western Bohemia, although the defence
industry is mostly in Slovakia.
Equipment in these countries lagged behind that of Soviet forces. But
modernising is difficult, with Nato not yet ready to supply arms and
traditional suppliers demanding payment in hard currency.
Hungary, which has had fighters on alert since a cluster bomb fell on a
border village in October last year in a spillover from the fighting in
former Yugoslavia, has obtained aircraft identification equipment from the
US, the first such supplies to a former Warsaw Pact country. It is also
getting spares from the former East German army and recently agreed to take
Dollars 800m worth of equipment from Russia as part of debt repayments.
Most of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States - the fragile
grouping of former Soviet republics other than the Baltics and Georgia -
have founded their own national forces; Tajikistan plans to; Turkmenistan is
the only one planning to share command with Russia.
But if these countries want professional, western-style forces, how are they
going to afford them? Their ministries frequently cannot even afford the
fares to take part in seminars with Nato members.
Implementing the CFE cuts is an awesome problem for all central and eastern
European countries. Cutting up tanks is expensive and environmentally
hazardous. It is unclear how Russia and Ukraine, in particular, will face up
to the force reductions required, with large-scale military unemployment
adding to the effects of economic upheaval.
The deterioration of morale and discipline in the Russian military is
already notorious. Officers are disoriented, some bitterly resentful of the
way arms control has been handled. Most of the Russian forces are now
regarded by Nato as being in poor condition.
Cuts promised for the end of the decade include a 45 per cent reduction in
current troop numbers. But even then, Russia will still have an army of
1.5m, backed by 3,000 long-range nuclear weapons, the accoutrements of a
superpower. When a Nato military official declares that 'none of us is
afraid of the Russians any more', he is speaking for stable, secure western
Europe and not for the countries that have emerged from the Warsaw Pact.

We are in that dreadful pre-Christmas period when the broadcasters unload
the dud movies which they bought in packages along with the good ones they
are reserving for the high days and holidays. There are at least six duds
tonight, and the only offerings of any note are the last in the
Troubleshooter 2 series, and John Huston's film The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre.
In Troubleshooter 2 Sir John Harvey-Jones casts his eye over the old Ipswich
brewery Tolly Cobbold, bought a couple of years ago by two enthusiastic
entrepreneurs who wanted to save it from closure (9.50 BBC2).
The Huston film is not his best, nor Humphrey Bogart's either, but
considering its technical limitations this story of gold prospectors falling
out is remarkably gripping (11.45 BBC1).
If you want to understand the low standard of British audience participation
talk shows watch Donahue: The 25th Anniversary (11.55 ITV). Where the object
on a British show such as 'Kilroy' seems to be heat and controversy, Donahue
thinks on his feet.
Of course American willingness to discuss ultimate intimacies in public
helps.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - American theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA DEITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At his public readings in America, during his Christmas tour of 1867,
Charles Dickens read A Christmas Carol to sell-out audiences (Longfellow
heard him in Boston). By then Dickens was using the story as a sentimental
warm-up for grimmer excerpts that followed.
Knowing this makes all the more commendable a remarkable presentation on
Broadway by the British actor Patrick Stewart, who is packing the house not
with a reading but a performance of Christmas Carol.
A veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Stewart has become an American
pop hero as the starship captain (played like a Shakespearian king) in
television's Star Trek: The Next Generation. But when he enters he is simply
dressed in a nondescript brown suit, making no attempt to be like Dickens or
even of the period.
He snatches up the red-bound volume like a storyteller's trophy and begins
with 'Marley was dead' standing at a lectern. The only other props, all
painted brown, are a high desk and stool, a Windsor chair and a table that
also serves as a four-poster bed. No sooner has the listener's imagination
soared to fogbound City courtyards than, in a flash, the actor is across the
stage to Scrooge's counting-house.
This is when the magic begins. In a series of apparitions as life-like as
Scrooge's Spirits, Stewart proceeds to portray, in voice and manner, all 40
characters in a sort of one-man Nicholas Nickleby. There is nothing easy in
Scrooge's gradual transformation from 'Bah] Humbug]' to a man frightened to
the core by recognition of himself. Nor are there any minor characters, for
each in turn gives weight to the whole.
Stewart has a facility for portraying women, in voice and gesture - the
bustle of Mrs Cratchit at dinner or the capacious Mrs Fezziwig and her three
daughters entering the ball. This event, a tour de force of whirling hands
over hands and steps in stately formations, creates the dizzying effect of
20 couples.
With no sets, lighting designer Fred Allen, expands and contracts space. By
giving a sense of architecture to an empty stage, he uses light to convey
cold city streets or country lanes and, in an instant, returns the action to
Scrooge's cramped upstairs bedroom. The Ghost of Christmas Present arrives
offstage with a warm glow of blazing firelight first emanating from the
adjoining room and then filling the stage as Scrooge appears to enter it.
The image of this Spirit seated atop the table, torch held on high,
indicates some indebtedness to the first-edition illustrations by John
Leech. (This illustration and Dickens' original 1843 manuscript of Christmas
Carol are on view until January 10 at the Pierpont Morgan Library.)
It is hard to convince an audience when everyone knows what is coming, but
at this reading a sigh of relief could be heard when the last Spirit
dissolved into the bedpost.
More people than Ebenezer Scrooge are being transformed by this Christmas
experience. Stewart returns to the lectern briefly to conclude the tale,
before stepping away again to rear stage to return slowly towards the
audience, himself again, arms opened generously in a balletic gesture with a
simple 'And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One]'
Instant standing ovation.
At the Broadhurst Theater, New York until January 3

FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: Salonen and the Philharmonia - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Wednesday young Esa-Pekka Salonen, one of the Philharmonia's two
'principal guest conductors', took the orchestra through Beethoven,
Schoenberg and Stravinsky; and on Friday, Liszt and Mahler. Hearing these
exercises was a stark confirmation that there really are, these days, honest
musicians who have only the dimmest inklings about any music that might
pre-date the Great War.
In Schoenberg's op. 42 piano concerto and in the Liszt A major, the soloist
was Emanuel Ax, who knew very well what he was about. He played the
Schoenberg from the printed score - which might explain a certain lack of
spontaneous flair; but he unfolded the music with as much lyrical delicacy
as confident purpose. It was pleasing to find that Schoenberg's language no
longer causes any detectable dismay: the audience responded to the concerto,
quite rightly, as if it were Rakhmaninov or Prokofiev.
Salonen provided ready, lucid support, as he did as well for the pianist's
elegant Liszt on Friday, but always with a flatter expressive profile than
his soloist's - who was thereby flattered, standing out as the judicially
eloquent voice. It was left to Ax, nevertheless, to explore both the shadows
and the poignant possibilities of both scores, which he did with loyal
imagination.
Everything else was worse. Left to himself with Beethoven's Seventh
Symphony, Salonen rendered it almost ridiculous. The long, bated-breath
introduction to the opening Vivace was taken up-tempo (to put it mildly]),
like the famous Allegretto after it, and yet neither meant anything much.
Although there are good musico-historical arguments for rejecting
'time-honoured' portentousness in this music, there is no excuse for
cantering heedlessly through it.
Salonen maintained a strict, nuance-free beat that took not the slightest
account of old-fashioned harmonic nodes, nor of the dramatic tensions which
radiate from them. The trio of the Scherzo arrived without any change of
dramatic colour; and every movement culminated in an accelerando that
sounded mechanical, propelled by no new musical insight. None of the
instrumental voices could do much more than keep up with the rush (the
Philharmonia players were visibly glum and recalcitrant). It was like
hearing an efficient Martian visitor delivering a score that meant nothing
to him.
Stravinsky ought to fall safely within Salonen's range, but the Orpheus
ballet is particularly tricky to bring off. It needs at once to pay audible
homage to its 18th-century models, and to preserve an astringent
20th-century tautness; here, it sounded flaccid, uncommitted and
under-rehearsed. After those disheartening Wednesday performances, one heard
Mahler's Third Symphony on Friday with a jaundiced ear. Yes, the brazen
orchestral declamations rang out - but where were the raw, seismic upheavals
in the first movement, the twinkling graces of the Menuetto, the comedy of
the Scherzo?
With the arrival of Anne Sofie von Otter's golden mezzo the dark 'Molto
adagio' after Nietzche and the boys'-choir-and-bells Allegro came into much
sharper perspective. At the end, the Philharmonia strings distinguished
themselves in the heart-wrenching Adagio. Mahler's daringly stretched
symphony relies nevertheless upon its initial, hugely dramatic premises.
With those reduced to such two-dimensional tameness, it was no wonder that
the whole symphony seemed too episodic to cut any serious ice with a modern
audience.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: 'Orfeo' lacks drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the background to the composition and first performances of
Monteverdi's three surviving operatic masterpieces remains obscure almost
four centuries later. The first of them, L'Orfeo, at least has the
validation of a printed score, which appeared in Mantua in 1609, two years
after the first performance, but even that definitive text leaves plenty of
room for conjecture and dispute, and for interpreters to find their own
solutions.
The latest to offer his own performing version is Philip Pickett, whose
recording with the New London Consort has been released by L'Oiseau-Lyre
(433 545-2, two CDs); on Friday in the Queen Elizabeth Hall he directed a
concert performance with the same cast.
In the booklet accompanying his recording and the programme notes for the
concert Pickett details the results of his research into the circumstances
of the premiere of L'Orfeo. The musical content of the opera may not be
disputed, but it is the forces involved and the instrumentation that
intrigue him most, and his conclusions give a distinctive tang to the
performance.
His solutions are generally minimalist ones: the chorus is reduced to a
group of seven reinforced by the subsidiary members of the cast; there is as
little instrumental doubling of the vocal lines as possible, and just one
instrument to a part in the continuo and string bands.
What is absent in this lean, potentially flexible approach is any
consideration of the dramatic aspects of the work and how this intimate
group of performers would have been deployed theatrically. In a work in
which drama and music are so miraculously interwoven it seems a strange
omission. Even on disc, the playing and singing seem inert and precious. In
concert the lack of dramatic spark was even more significant.
Something inescapably English coloured the whole performance, not just in
the irredeemably un-Italianate rendering of the text (for an object lesson
in bringing Monteverdi's words to life, hear the new recording of Ulisse
from Rene Jacobs) but in the sound world itself. Even such a fine singer as
John Mark Ainsley seemed curiously inert as Orfeo, although Julia Gooding's
Euridice and especially Tessa Bonner's Ninfa revealed more character. The
assorted shepherds seemed to have been recruited straight out of King's
College Chapel Choir. The passion that drives Monteverdi's vocal lines, that
makes his operas the supreme achievements they are, had been drained away.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: 'Alcina' without the magic - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Handel based three of his Italian operas on Ariosto's Orlando furioso -
Orlando, Ariodante and Alcina. For many Handelians they form the pinnacle of
his operatic art. All three are works of intense erotic charge whose
principals are lashed by tides and cross currents of sensual intrigue and
emotional conflict; and all three are works in which the apparatus of magic
and the supernatural directly carries that charge.
For all the supposed difficulties and antique formalities of the opera seria
convention in which they are framed, all three can speak to us with as much
directness and 'modernity' as Mozart's Figaro or Cos about the emotional
frailties of human nature, the deceptions that people in love or lust can
enact upon each other, the heights of ecstasy and depths of despair to which
passion can lead. And all three operas are works of almost overwhelming
musical abundance.
For me Alcina is the supreme Handel masterpiece, the Desert Island Handel
opera. The prospect of a new Covent Garden production - the first since
Zeffirelli mounted the opera for Sutherland in 1962 - was therefore almost
as enticing as the verdant meadows and bosky woods of Alcina's magic terrain
and the enchantments she practises on her captive knights.
How, then, to convey temperately my disappointment at the dullness of
Friday's opening performance? It was not a disaster, not one of those
enraging 'interventionist' misrepresentations by producer or designer. The
principals parts were not inadequately taken: the cast contains several of
the day's prominent Handelians. The score was more fully and respectfully
given than is often the case (although it is a pity that the boy Oberto
should have been excised).
What it was, a lot of the time, was just plain, plumb boring: a musical
plod, and a dramatic reduction of the spectacle - which should include dance
sequences as well as elaborate scene changes - to virtually a concert in
costume.
Handelians are a hardy breed. They know that the great operas, performed
with rhythmic vivacity, alertness to textural colour and pointedness of
melodic shaping, can 'come across' in defiance of any number of infelicities
in the staging. But equally, they know that such irredeemably flabby musical
direction as John Fisher offered on Friday - letting the life ebb out of
moderate-paced arias, giving no 'lift' to the allegros - is almost always
the coup de grace to any hope of Handel opera-as-drama.
In a country where good Handel conductors abound, it is astonishing that
someone so manifestly incapable of conveying the musical delights of Alcina
should have been invited to conduct it at Covent Garden. The choice of
production team - producer Stephen Wadsworth and designers Thomas P. Lynch
and Dunya Ramicova - proves hardly more successful. Theirs is a
poverty-ridden show, to the eye but even more to the imagination.
On a basic set - a hedge, a desiccated-looking tree, an urn, a blue sky at
the back - the principals go through a set of polite motions. Occasionally
the lighting changes; occasionally fancy little conceits of aria-production
are essayed. Most of the time the design construction keeps the singers
behind the proscenium arch; almost everything in the show seems geared to
muting forwardness of vocal address.
One's heart goes out to the singers: this is no way to help them shine. Ann
Murray, currently Britain's leading female exponent of the great Handel
castrato roles, comes nearest to doing so. Even if sometimes her mezzo
timbre seems to lack a strong 'personal' stamp, the unflustered elegance and
unforced distinction of her musical command compensate greatly. Her Alcina
is Yvonne Kenny (the two were previously partnered in the Covent Garden
Mitridate and ENO Xerxes). The failure of this wonderfully graceful soprano
to sound the role's depths, to catch its glitter no less than its pathos, is
the production's doing; in spite of this she offers much lovely singing.
Other fine performers who do themselves less than proper justice are Judith
Howarth (an excessively pert Morgana), Anthony Rolfe Johnson (almost too
weightily distinguished for the second-string role of Oronte) and Stafford
Dean (Melisso); Kathleen Kuhlmann's Bradamante is on the right lines, and in
fresh voice. So once again in modern times the Royal Opera has failed to
honour fully its Handelian birthright.
In repertory until January 22

FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: Robert Wilson's 'Faustus' - German theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wilson, director, writer, painter, was the Texan little boy lost who
turned European theatre upside down in the 1970s. Now, star entertainer of
Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, his latest revivals are the controversial draws of
this year's Paris Autumn Arts Festival.
His newest piece, Dr Faustus Lights the Light, has all the ingredients
needed to keep Wilson fans cheering: cold artifice; the play of light and
dark; perfectly timed automatic movements; minimalist music; semi-nonsense
text. But the aesthetic is so close to that of Wilson's early work, notably
the 1976 Einstein on the Beach, that this Faustus looks like a parody, or an
anachronism from Wilson's avant-garde days. Has Wilson developed at all in
two decades?
Faustus was written as a libretto by Gertrude Stein in 1938 but never
composed by anyone. Its story - Faust sells his soul for electric light -
has natural appeal for Wilson, who sets it as a ballet of light bulbs and
fluorescent strips interspersed with dances from Devil. A red one sways on a
swing, a black one spurts up on a seesaw. Both are familiar Wilson types,
with the pointed bodies, ashen faces and white hands of the Cabaret-inspired
Devil/emcee from his last show, The Black Rider.
Here too is the ice-hard, jagged imagery: close-cropped heads, razor-sharp
dresses, bony bodies, a gigantic pair of scissors, each snip marked by
shattering glass. Dancing is slick: splits, slits, high kicks. A leg juts
out, three identical heads pop up like gargoyles, behind the curtain.
Against a black sky, light forms into circles. A puppet is shot marching
along a neon sign. Bulbs rise and descend like yo-yos. At last, a single
strip of light shrinks further into the distance. Stage and cast are
swallowed in blackness.
Dramatic, technically clever, but not enough. Wilson carries his chill,
exaggerated aesthetic into actions and words, trying to tie his staging to
the dire absurdity of Stein's text, written in relentless monosyllables. He
enhances the monotony by using German actors who speak no English, who chant
the lines flatly. Movements, jerky, automatic and stylised, echo speech. A
cast of three Fausts and three Margaretes, acting in absolute unison as if
worked by a puppeteer, underlines the absurdist repetition.
Stein's post-modern joke about the meaninglessness of words is impossible as
'spoken opera' - dull as a boring play about boredom. Like all Wilson's
work, this show is a perfectly unified, choreographed vision. But the
vacuous play makes devices that once charmed look empty, worn out.
There are glimmers of the heart that is missing. Faust's poodle is played by
a cabaret-girl with a blond pigtail and grey suit who waddles on 'hind'
legs. She no longer bays at the moon because Faust has destroyed moonlight,
so she pouts 'thank you' endlessly between red painted lips. Hans Peter
Kuhn's fairground music, on accordion and scratchy double bass, hints at the
love, lyricism, painful loss which elude the strait-jacketed performers.
Wilson is still sadly obscure in England. Do not cross Europe for this
Faust, but it is a collector's piece and another episode in Wilson's
tortuous relationship with German theatre. The 1990 love-and-murder musical
hit The Black Rider, still in repertory in Hamburg, was the summit of that
achievement. Here is nothing but artifice; no emotion, no meaning. Wilson,
like Faust, has lost his soul.
Paris Autumn Arts Festival continues to Dec 29. 'Dr Faustus Lights the
Lights', Hebbel Theater, Berlin, Jan 18-24; Comedie, Geneva, Feb 2-5.

Marks and Spencer has promoted Joe Rowe, Jim Benfield and Roger Aldridge,
all divisional directors and long-serving M and S men, to the main board.
Rowe, 45, made a divisional director in 1990, now in charge of poultry,
fish, meat and gifts, joined as a trainee merchandiser in 1975 from Unigate
where he had been a systems analyst and then management consultant. Most of
his M and S career spent in the food and clothing divisions, he also served
a year as Lord Sieff's personal assistant when the latter was chairman.
Benfield, 43, who has been responsible for store development and
construction services, came to the company as a management trainee in 1970.
He has been a divisional director for six years.
Aldridge, 45, an Associate of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors,
now looks after estates. He was at J Hepworth before joining M and S in
1973. He was made a divisional director six years ago.
Andy Lusher, head of store operations and property development, retires at
the end of December.
*****
Ken Schofield, MTM's chief executive, has completed the managerial
stable-cleaning and reorganisation of his troubled chemicals group.
James Friederichsen, president of MTM's US operations, has resigned.
He was the last member of the team led by Richard Lines, chairman and
founder, who resigned in March.
Schofield has simplified MTM's structure into operational units and done
away with geographical divisions. Friederichsen ran the now-closed US
headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, which formerly employed about 20
people.
Ken Carter has been appointed director responsible for fine chemicals, which
represents about 40 per cent of MTM's turnover. His main task, according to
the company, is to increase plant utilisation at the division's sites at
Kirkby and Rock Hill.
*****
Gregory Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, and Ian Duncan, finance
director, have been appointed to the board of Ranks Hovis McDougall, which
the conglomerate took over earlier this month.
Also appointed to the RHM board are Bob Muddimer and Denis Mulhall, both
members of the Tomkins management team who have been in the US integrating
the 1990 acquisition of Philips Industries with Tomkins.
Muddimer will be responsible for RHM's operational management in the UK and
Europe as group president while Mulhall will be chief financial officer.
Tony Reading moves to the main Tomkins board and will be chief operating
officer in the US. He will also have responsibility for RHM's US operations.
Malcolm Swain will take over the position of Tomkins chief financial officer
in the US.
RHM also announced the resignations of Michael Beckett and Bob Rogerson as
non-executive directors of RHM. The other RHM directors who were in place at
the time of the takeover remain on the board.

FT  22 DEC 92 / People: Change of heart at Chrysalis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spurred on by the Cadbury report, music publishing communications and media
company Chrysalis is appointing three non-executive directors - the first
outside directors on the board since the company was merged with Management
Agency and Music in 1985.
Chris Wright, chairman and chief executive, says his previous group managing
director, Terry Connolly, who left three years ago, had been 'very much
opposed to non-executive directors; he didn't think they served a useful
purpose'.
Now Chrysalis has chosen as its most senior non-executive Charles Levison,
previously managing director of WEA Records/Warner Home Video (UK) and then,
until last year, managing director of Virgin Broadcasting. Levison, who is
also a trained lawyer, will chair the audit and remuneration committees at
Chrysalis.
Wright had no need of a headhunter to locate his first non-executive whom he
has known since the late 1960s when Levison was a partner specialising in
the music industry at Harbottle &amp; Lewis. He says he hopes Levison, 50, will
also help the company develop relations with the City, a side Wright admits
he has not been inclined to pay much attention to himself. One of his other
two non-executives will have an accountancy background, with the other
probably coming from the creative side. Again avoiding the headhunting
route, Wright says he will solicit his fellow board members for names of
suitable candidates.
Levison is currently putting together the joint venture between Virgin and
TV-am for Virgin Radio, a national rock station to be launched shortly.
Chrysalis has, however, negotiated first right of refusal over any media
ideas or proposals Levison may have after he joins its board.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Technology: Cutting the cord of power tools - New models
need to be recharged less often
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the pairs of socks and festive chocolates, many weary executives are
likely to find a power tool stuffed into their Christmas stockings. But
rather than a model with yards of rubber-clad cord attached to it, the
chances are that this year's drill or screwdriver will be cordless.
These days, that should raise a smile rather than a grimace. Developments in
battery and charger technology mean that cordless tools can easily perform
most of the handyman's tasks.
'Over the past 10 years, cordless tools have developed to the extent that
they are 200 per cent more efficient,' believes Brian Neighbour, technical
services development manager at power tool maker Bosch.
'When cordless tools first came on the market in the early 1970s, the idea
was right but the technology was not there, ' says Neighbour. 'A man would
go up a ladder to put in a dozen screws, but would have to come down again
when he'd only done five because the tool needed recharging.'
Just how long a do-it-yourself enthusiast can now work with a cordless tool
before the power runs out is as long as the proverbial piece of string. It
all depends, say the manufacturers, on the size of the bit, the material
that is being drilled into, and even the weight of the person using the
tool. But as a rule of thumb, they reckon that one of the more powerful
cordless screwdrivers could drive in 80 screws before needing a re-charge.
Developments in cordless power tools have been incremental rather than
revolutionary. The nickel cadmium batteries - similar to those used in
portable telephones - have become smaller and are able to pack an
increasingly powerful punch.
A lot of work has also gone into the development of circuitry in the charger
which powers the batteries. When cordless tools first came on to the market,
it took 12 hours to re-power them. That was reduced to three hours, then one
hour. Today, manufacturers boast of the 'coffee break' charge - just 12 or
15 minutes.
Like portable computer makers, power tool manufacturers have been trying to
ensure that the tools use as little power as possible, so the batteries last
longer. They have developed a way of lubricating the tools with a special
low-friction grease, which ensures that the drill bit or the screwdriver
twist as easily as possible and so use less power.
Black &amp; Decker estimates that 30 per cent of its tools sold these days are
cordless, with most people buying them as a second tool to use alongside
their existing mains-powered model. Nor is it just drills or screwdrivers
that are cordless: sanders, circular saws, metal shears and even glue guns
are now cutting the cord.
At the more powerful industrial end of the market, not only carpenters and
decorators are using cordless tools - although they have proven particularly
popular in private house building where they can be used before the mains
electricity supply is switched on. These days, even car manufacturers are
beginning to realise the advantages of going cordless.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Technology: Creating dreams on computers / A look at the new
generation of films that use digitalisation techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A magic carpet teases its companions and hides from them; a woman steps out
of a pool with water pouring from a hole in her stomach; cows sing; and a
thousand fans are cloned to fill a baseball stadium.
Even in the fantasy world of films, these scenes would have been impossible
just a few years ago. The reason they are on screen today is that a new
generation of film artists is exploiting a fresh and exciting technique
known as computer digitalisation. The widespread acceptance of
computer-generated images in films has surprised even the pioneers of such
techniques.
'When we started experimenting with computers in films in the early 1980s, a
lot of people didn't want to have anything to do with it,' says John
Lasseter, a film director at Pixar, which has won Academy Awards for its
innovations in computer-animated films. 'Now, it's hard to imagine an
animated film without it. And pretty soon, it may be hard to imagine a
feature film without it.'
Computers work on both a two-dimensional and three-dimensional level with
film. On a two-dimensional level, the computer can be used to fill in
colours and background.
Walt Disney routinely uses a computer colouring system to add in subtle
shadings throughout an animated piece. Disney and Pixar, which helped
develop the system, won a special technical Oscar this year for the
technique's contribution to Beauty and the Beast. The technique digitally
'inks and paints' the animator's drawings before compositing them with
hand-drawn backgrounds and effects.
Industrial Light &amp; Magic, considered the leader in special effects for
feature films, used a two-dimensional digitalisation technique to create the
hole in Goldie Hawn's stomach in Death Becomes Her. 'First we filmed the
scene without Goldie in it, exactly duplicating the camera moves,' says
Thomas Williams, in charge of digital technology at the company. 'Then, we
filmed the scene with her in it. The computer took the two films in its
memory and used them to create the hole, with the background scenery exactly
where it was supposed to be.'
The three-dimensional applications of the technique are even more exciting.
In the same way that a science researcher uses digitalisation to create a
three-dimensional computer model of a molecule - capable of being spun
around and viewed from different angles - film makers create fantasy images,
then work the film around them.
Walt Disney first used the technique for the clock gears in the animated
film The Great Mouse Detective. Digitalisation also created a carriage in
The Little Mermaid and a convincing three-dimensional ballroom in Beauty and
the Beast.
But the company's latest film Aladdin - which has just been released in the
US and will open next year in Britain - has taken the process one step
further. It uses the group's first computer-generated animated object, a
magic carpet, which appears in nearly a third of the film.
'The software and hardware have progressed, and so has people's acceptance,'
says Stephen Goldberg, artistic supervisor with the company's computer
generated imagery (CGI) unit, 'There is a growing sense of trust that we're
not out to take the art out of animation.'
Indeed, most of the people working at CGI have a background in traditional
animation. The magic carpet was initially hand-drawn, then digitalised into
the computer by animator Tina Price. In the computer's memory, the carpet
existed in three dimensions and was able to move around on the film with its
complex pattern - containing magic lamps, crossing swords, and tigers' heads
 -in place.
'It would have been impossible to move the pattern convincingly from frame
to frame using traditional animation methods,' says Goldberg.
Walt Disney also used the technique to create the film's tiger's head, which
emerges from the desert. The tiger's head is made up of many grains of sand
which would have jittered on the surface if conventional methods had been
used. Instead, the computer memory keeps the grains of sand in place.
Although Walt Disney is unparalleled in combining digitalisation techniques
with the more old-fashioned hand-drawn frames, it is Pixar which leads the
field in 100 per cent computer-animated films. Short pieces like Luxo Jr and
Tin Toy, which won an Oscar in 1988, have set the pace for the industry.
'When we started using these techniques in the early 1980s,' says Lasseter,
'there was a misconception that the computer was making the film. That is no
more true than the statement that a word processor writes a journalist's
articles. But once you have the computer tool to use in animation, you
wouldn't want to give it up any more than you would a word processor.'
The biggest challenge for animators is getting the computer to generate
images that are not perfect looking. 'We still want it to look like
animation,' Lasseter adds. 'Computers like geometric, perfect worlds, and we
have to fight against that.'
For feature films, however, the challenge is just the opposite - making
images look as real as possible. Digitalisation has been widely used in
science-fiction and fantasy films.
A three dimensional technique created Meryl Streep's twisted neck in Death
Becomes Her, and helps contribute to many of the special effects in
Terminator 2, including the scene in which a creature rises convincingly
from the surface of a tiled floor.
The film world may get computer-generated characters soon. Steven Spielberg
is said to be working on a film that would use computer-generated dinosaurs,
courtesy of Industrial Light &amp; Magic.
But the use of computers is rapidly moving beyond the science-fiction and
fantasy realm to invade all types of films. Pacific Data Image used computer
generation to clone the extras in scenes for The Babe, a movie about Babe
Ruth, the baseball legend. 'They needed 30,000 fans in period dress,' says
Carl Rosendahl, president. 'But it's expensive to hire 30,000 people and
produce costumes for all of them. So we took 1,000 extras and filmed them in
various parts of the stadium. The computer used its memory to put them all
together and we got a stadium full of screaming fans.'
Computers are being widely used for complex stunts in action movies. 'The
stunt man can act in complete safety, with cables attached, and we later
remove the wires and scan the scenery back into the film,' says Rosendahl.
Computer digitalisation is also making its way into television commercials
and music videos. Lancia car advertisements used an effect called morphing
to make a logo in the desert melt to form a car, which then drove off. The
company also created a singing cow by computer.
Those involved in using computers in films say the new techniques are a long
way from reaching their limits. 'This industry is still in its infancy,'
says Goldberg of Walt Disney. 'At the moment, the possibilities seem
endless.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Year of trials and many errors - The
UK's Serious Fraud Office had a poor 1992. Next year is unlikely to prove
any better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) would, like the Queen, sooner forget
1992.
The year started badly. At the end of January Mr Justice McKinnon, the trial
judge in the year-long Blue Arrow fraud trial, ordered the jury to acquit
the three corporate defendants, County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities. The defendants were accused of conspiring to
mislead the markets over the employment agency's ultimately unsuccessful
1987 rights issue. But the judge said there was insufficient evidence for
the cases against the three to proceed any further.
In February, the SFO dropped charges against two men - Mr David Mayhew, a
partner of stockbroker Cazenove &amp; Co and Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate
finance director at Morgan Grenfell - which would have formed the basis of a
third Guinness trial.
The trial, arising out of the Pounds 2.7bn Guinness takeover of Distillers
in 1986, had been expected to start in the autumn. Charges against Mr Mayhew
and Mr Seelig, who at the time was already standing trial in the second
Guinness prosecution, were dismissed at a brief hearing. Mrs Barbara Mills,
the then SFO director, said there was no longer a realistic prospect of
conviction.
Within a week the second Guinness trial had also collapsed. Mr Justice
Henry, the trial judge, discharged the jury five months into the case
because the mental strain on Mr Seelig, who was representing himself, had
reached a point where it was 'no longer possible for him to conduct his
defence adequately'.
Three days after the collapse of Guinness two, the jury in the Blue Arrow
case convicted four of the remaining defendants, acquitting a fifth. After a
trial lasting a year and four days and estimated to have cost Pounds 35m,
six of the original 10 defendants had been found not guilty.
Sandwiched in between the decision to drop charges in Guinness three and the
collapse of Guinness two, the SFO had, after a seven-month trial, secured
the conviction of Mr Peter Clowes on 18 counts of theft and fraud. Clowes's
conviction came three and a half years after the Pounds 150m collapse of his
investment company, Barlow Clowes.
Within the space of seven days in February the SFO and the whole fight
against so-called 'white collar' crime had come within a hair's breadth of
disaster (a fact underscored when the convictions of the four Blue Arrow
defendants were overturned by the Appeal Court in July. Subsequent Blue
Arrow prosecutions were also abandoned.)
In fairness, not all the blame for the collapse of these cases should be
attached to the SFO. In the Blue Arrow case, some of the blame for the
inordinate length of the trial was because of the easy-going style of Mr
Justice McKinnon, the trial judge. In Guinness two, Mr Seelig's conduct of
his own defence inevitably prolonged the trial.
The collapse of these cases provoked a public uproar. Indignant MPs swiftly
demanded an explanation for the apparent waste of so much taxpayers' money.
Mr Justice Henry called for a radical solution to the problems of long fraud
trials. 'It seems to me inevitable that we must find a cheaper and quicker
way to deal with serious fraud trials and the likelihood is we shall need a
radical solution rather than merely tinkering with procedures,' he said.
Mr Justice Phillips, thanking the jury at the end of the Barlow Clowes
trial, said: 'Until recent times, no-one could have imagined that our legal
system could place such a burden on anyone's time.'
Lord Roskill, the former law lord who chaired the 1983-1986 inquiry into
fraud trials, echoed these views. He said the government had been wrong to
ignore his earlier advice that complex and lengthy fraud cases were
unsuitable for jury trial.
'I'm impenitent about non-jury trials for complex frauds. This view was
right in 1986 and nothing has happened to change my mind,' he said.
In the wake of the public outcry, the government promised an immediate
review. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the then attorney general, talked of adopting a
simple all-embracing fraud offence similar to that used in Scotland as a
means of reducing the number of indictments and focusing on the issues at
trial.
However, as the year wore on little more was heard of this idea. The
government seemed content to leave the big issues - such as whether complex
fraud should be tried by jury or by special fraud tribunals, or whether
there should be a simple all-embracing fraud offence and whether certain
market offences should be decriminalised - to the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice, which was appointed after the release of the Birmingham
Six in March 1991 to inquire into miscarriages of justice.
The government promised a consultation paper on changes in the practice and
procedure of fraud trials; in the meantime it was left to the judges and
other lawyers to carry the torch for reform.
Mr Justice Henry, in various speeches, called for a time limit of four
months for fraud trials save in exceptional circumstances; for the trial
judge to open proceedings by giving an impartial summary of both the
prosecution and defence cases; earlier disclosure of the defence case to
allow the issues for trial to be narrowed down; and tougher powers for
judges to impose sanctions on both prosecution and defence for
non-co-operation in pre-trial hearings.
Mrs Mills, who by April had been appointed director of public prosecutions,
supported Mr Justice Henry's proposals and called for a simple all-embracing
fraud offence and formal plea-bargaining so as to recover more of the
proceeds of fraud. These suggestions were supported by Mr George Staple, her
successor at the SFO.
The government consultation paper, which was eventually published earlier
this month, contained few ideas which had not already been well-canvassed
other than heavy fines for defendants and their barristers for failure to
disclose their defence in detail at an early stage.
With the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice not due to report until July,
prospects for concrete reforms in 1993 look slim. This is bad news for those
involved in the more than 24 serious fraud prosecutions awaiting trial or
making their way through the courts.
As Mr Justice Henry says: 'Without legislative changes, I do not believe
that things will get better, in fact I am certain that they will get worse.'
Business and the Law will next be published on January 12.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Five years of Sunday trading -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, five years after it was first asked to rule on the the
compatibility of UK Sunday trading laws with European Community law, the
European Court of Justice finally gave an unequivocal ruling. The Rome
Treaty's prohibition of national legislation restricting the free movement
of goods between Community countries does not apply to the 1950 Shops Act
which bans retailers in England and Wales (though not in Scotland) from
Sunday opening.
HISTORY
In the mid-1980s retailers in England and Wales began opening on Sundays,
arguing that the ban on Sunday trading in the 1950 Shops Act reduced imports
from other EC countries and thus infringed Article 30 of the Rome Treaty.
In the 1989 Torfaen case the ECJ ruled that Article 30 'does not apply to
national rules prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sunday
where the restrictive effects on EC trade which may result therefrom do not
exceed the effects intrinsic to rules of that kind'.
That ruling left it to the national courts to determine as a question of
fact whether the effects of those rules actually exceeded such intrinsic
effects (a proportionality test). Following that judgment, however,
different UK courts reached different conclusions on how to apply these
principles to the Shops Act.
In 1991 the ECJ held, without any qualification, that Article 30 did not
apply to national rules prohibiting the employment of staff on Sundays
(Conforama case) or on Sundays after 12pm (Marchandise case), as the
restrictive effects of such rules 'did not appear to be excessive in
relation to the aim pursued'.
Three English courts referred further questions to the ECJ seeking further
guidance on how to reconcile and apply the three rulings.
CLARIFICATION
The ECJ has now clarified the position by extending its rulings in the the
two 1991 cases to all national legislation prohibiting retailers from Sunday
opening and by answering itself the question which in the Torfaen case it
had left to the UK courts to decide.
The first two parts of the Court's reasoning followed its earlier rulings.
First, Sunday trading rules were 'measures of equivalent effect to
quantitative restrictions' that could be caught by Article 30. While
legislation enforcing Sunday closing was not intended to regulate the flow
of goods, it may still have an adverse effect on the sales volume of certain
shops which affect the sale of both domestic and imported products. But the
Court said the marketing of imported products was not made more difficult
than the marketing of domestic goods.
Second, the Court confirmed that national rules restricting the opening of
shops on Sundays pursue an aim justified under EC law if they reflect
'certain choices relating to particular national or regional socio-cultural
characteristics'.
However, EC states must make those choices in compliance with EC law and, in
particular, the principle of proportionality. Provided therefore the
restrictive effects of EC trade did not exceed the effects intrinsic to such
rules, the prohibition in Article 30 would not apply.
The Court stressed that assessments as to proportionality 'cannot be allowed
to vary according to the findings of fact made by individual courts in
particular cases'. Appraising the proportionality of national rules which
pursue a legitimate aim under EC law involved 'weighing the national
interest in attaining that aim against the Community interest in ensuring
the free movement of goods'. To verify that the restrictive effects do not
exceed what is necessary to achieve that aim, it must be considered whether
those effects are direct, indirect or purely speculative and whether those
effects do not impede the marketing of imported products more than domestic
products.
In the Conforama and Marchandise cases the Court had applied those
considerations in holding that the restrictive effects on trade of national
rules prohibiting the employment of workers on Sundays in certain retailing
activities were not excessive in relation to the aim pursued. It followed,
the Court said, that the same finding must be made with regard to national
rules prohibiting Sunday opening.

Small businesses are under increasing pressure to conform to quality and
environmental standards which have often been devised with larger companies
in mind.
Barclays Bank and Sandwell Training and Enterprise Council have combined to
help five small- and medium-sized companies based in the West Midlands
qualify for BS7750, a new British Standard which sets a framework for the
development of good environmental practices. Companies have been chosen from
'dirty' industries, including steel-making, chemicals and paint.
A further 300 companies are taking part in a BSI assessment of BS7750. They
have been split into 35 working groups covering industry sectors such as
fishing, construction, wood products and hotels and restaurants.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to become leader of
the pack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Persuading small business owners to make use of written sources of
information to improve their management techniques is difficult enough.
Expecting them to make use of the complex work packs beloved of academics
and some professional advisers is even more of a challenge.
Nevertheless, for the highly self-disciplined entrepreneur or the person
following a training course, these packs can prove useful. Starting Up: A
Step by Step Guide to Establishing and Running Your Own Business by etc*, a
consultancy firm, provides a 40-minute video, textbook and workbook to help
in the preparation of a business plan.
Users should expect to spend 100 hours but at the end will have gained an
insight into planning, filled in knowledge gaps and made their mistakes on
paper rather than in business, the pack promises. There are much cheaper
handbooks available though they do not take readers so rigorously through
the preparatory stages.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Enterprise looks for a
way out - Small firms should not rule out a public flotation of stock
despite the difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years after buying control of Orthofix, an Italian manufacturer of
devices for treating fractures, Edgar Wallner began making plans for a
public flotation. He ruled out the Italian stock market as being too small
and London because he felt it had a prejudiced view of Italian companies.
Acting on the advice of one of the venture capitalists who had backed him,
Wallner, an Englishman, decided to list his company on Nasdaq, the US
electronic market.
Orthofix duly went public last April listing 3m of its 10m shares at Dollars
12 a share. 'London investors would not have paid 21 times earnings for an
Italian company,' says Wallner. Orthofix, with projected 1992 sales of
Dollars 27m, (Pounds 17.7m) now has funds available to make acquisitions.
Wallner's decision to go for a US listing highlights a problem facing
growing businesses throughout Europe. The revelation last month that the
London Stock Exchange was thinking of closing the Unlisted Securities Market
reflects a wider malaise affecting secondary stock markets throughout
Europe.
According to one estimate 17,000 companies in Europe have received equity
funding over the past decade. Most will not be suitable for a public listing
but the managements of these businesses, and the venture funds which have
backed them, will all be looking for a way to realise their investment.
Flourishing stock markets are essential for putting a price on these
businesses and allowing them to raise new capital.
The secondary markets launched in Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and several
other European centres in the 1980s have been struggling to maintain, and in
some cases even establish, viable trading volumes. London scrapped its Third
Market in 1987, is likely to shut down the USM and is incapable of creating
liquidity for many of the 1,500 companies (out of a total of 2,100 on the
main exchange) with a market value of less than Pounds 50m.
'Unless a young company can have access to the public market at an earlier
stage than is now possible there will be a brake put upon enterprise,'
comments Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners, a venture capital company.
One reason for the decline of Europe's secondary markets was that they
failed to reach a critical mass and so were unable to provide profits for
the promoters, stockbrokers and market makers, says Dick Onians, managing
partner of Baring Venture Partners.
This lack of expertise meant they attracted ephemeral businesses selected
because they could be easily understood by the investors, he told a
conference on 'Realising Enterprise Value' organised by the European
Foundation for Entrepreneurship Research in London.
The high-tech businesses which have sought an early market listing in the US
have not been a feature of the European secondary markets.
Indivers, a Dutch-based company providing services to turbine manufacturers,
airlines and the semi-conductor industry is illustrative of companies which
decided against a European flotation. It twice looked at a listing in
Amsterdam in the 1980s but rejected it because knowledge of its industry on
the Dutch market was low.
Bert Twaalfhoven, founder of Indivers, calculates that Amsterdam would have
valued his company on a price earnings ratio of six while Singapore and
London would have rated the company on p/es of 25 and 10 respectively.
Finally Twaalfhoven decided to keep his company private.
Keeping the company in the family is attractive to many entrepreneurs but it
can act as a brake on growth. And unless the venture capitalists who back
fast-growth companies can find profitable 'exits' they will have difficulty
raising further money from their investors to back the next generation of
new businesses.
The most common alternative to a stock market listing is a trade sale where
a business sells out to another company. Howard Rose, founder of
Runcorn-based Waverley Pharmaceutical, sold his company to Ivax Corporation
of the US for Dollars 50m earlier this year. Rose, who built his business
with the backing of a wealthy 'business angel', says he rejected a London
listing because the USM was 'a waste of space'.
There is a widespread feeling among venture capitalists and entrepreneurs
that many European exchanges make it too difficult for the young company to
obtain a listing. 'The stock exchange seems to see its role as protecting
investors against business risk and not just against fraud,' comments Cohen.
Entrepreneurs have mixed feelings about the attractions of a flotation,
according to a study of nearly 300 European venture-backed businesses by
William Bygrave, professor of enterprise studies at Babson College in the
US.
Business owners were attracted to the idea of a listing by the prestige of
running a public company and the relative ease of subsequently raising
finance. But they were concerned at the cost and worried that sponsors and
investors would lose interest after the float, leading to a fall in the
share price.
The most successful market at attracting fast-growing businesses has been
Nasdaq, which trades 181 foreign stocks out of 4,400 listed on its two main
markets. On average Nasdaq stocks are dealt in by 12 market makers while 98
per cent of the top 2,200 companies are the subject of regular analysts'
reports.
European companies are already using Nasdaq to obtain a listing and it has
tried to establish links with European exchanges. 'But we have not found a
local partner who did not see us as a threat,' says John Wall, executive
vice president.
Modern technology makes it irrelevant where an electronic market is based
but European companies would welcome a market which attracted European
investors, if only to cut the amount of time spent travelling. Wallner says
he has made three trips to the US since April and given 110 presentations
about Orthofix to US investors.
One suggestion from Baring Venture Partners is for an Europe-wide exchange,
to be owned and operated by the European venture capital industry. The
exchange would be self-regulating and would recommend valuations, provide a
quotation service and complete transactions, says Onians.
However, investors and entrepreneurs might have their reservations about a
market run by venture capitalists, whose own valuation procedures have come
in for criticism. But some new mechanism for floating young companies is
needed. 'We have to put on pressure to re-establish a market,' says Cohen.
'In three to four years everyone will be wanting small company stocks.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventor pieces together
the elements of a public offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Mott, a successful British inventor of carbon fibre sports equipment
and the device which lights up high-tech training shoes, plans to take on
Lego in the marketplace for modular construction toys.
To finance his ambitions he hopes to raise Pounds 600,000 - Pounds 490,000
after costs - from investors.
Unusually for a business at such an early stage in its development - it only
registered as a public limited company in July - Mottik International Group
is attempting to raise money by a public offer for sale.
It is even seeking to be listed under the London Stock Exchange's Rule 535,
which permits trading on a matched bargain basis.
Mottik approached venture capitalists to raise the money but says they
decided against backing the proposal because it was too risky and involved
too small an amount of finance.
John Hallworth, a partner in Birmingham stockbrokers Griffiths and Lamb
which is sponsoring the issue, says this is the first time he has tried to
obtain Rule 535 status for so young a company.
The issue of 40 per cent of Mottik's shares will go ahead even if the stock
exchange refuses approval but Rule 535 status would give the company a
higher profile and allow investors to buy and sell their shares more easily.
Hallworth is critical of the lack of openings for new businesses in the UK.
'Everyone would back the inventions they see on the Tomorrow's World
television programme if they could,' he says.
'But the stock exchange rules prevent companies listing without a three-year
record. Investors cannot get in on the period of really rapid growth.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / Ian Maxwell told to pay Pounds 500,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN MAXWELL was yesterday ordered by a High Court judge to pay Pounds
500,000 to the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former
manager of the Mirror Group pension funds.
The action brought against Mr Maxwell was similar to that brought against
his brother, Mr Kevin Maxwell, which ultimately left him as Britain's
biggest bankrupt.
The judge ruled that Mr Ian Maxwell had been in breach of his duty as a BIM
director by signing forms to transfer shares from BIM to Credit Suisse
without questioning the transaction. The Pounds 500,000 interim payment was
ordered until an assessment of the value of the shares is made. The judge
rejected an application by BIM's lawyers for Mr Maxwell to be summarily
liable for more than Pounds 400m of losses, arising from other transfers,
because he had played no active part in those transactions.
Lawyers for Mr Maxwell indicated in court that he might not be able to pay
the Pounds 500,000. If that were so, enforcement proceedings against Mr
Maxwell might lead to his being made bankrupt, too. His lawyers said they
were considering an appeal.
In an earlier affidavit, Mr Ian Maxwell said he only had limited knowledge
of BIM's operations and signed the stock transfer form for Credit Suisse
because he had relied on his brother having already signed it.
The judge said that was no answer. 'It is clear from his own evidence that
he neither sought nor obtained any explanation from Kevin Maxwell. In
particular, he neither sought nor obtained any assurance that the transfers
had been approved by the board.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / GDP edges 0.1% ahead in real terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK economy performed marginally better than thought in the third
quarter, although government figures released yesterday indicated that most
areas of activity were flat.
The Central Statistical Office reported that gross domestic product grew by
a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in real, inflation-adjusted terms between
the second and third quarters. That contrasted with a provisional
announcement a month ago that GDP had not changed in the third quarter.
Excluding oil and gas production, GDP fell 0.2 per cent compared with 0.3
per cent reported earlier.
Both GDP measures were 0.7 per cent lower than in the third quarter of 1991,
bringing the cumulative decline in output since the recession started in the
second quarter of 1990 to about 4 per cent.
Although this recession has lasted longer than that of 1979-81 it is still
less deep. GDP fell then by 5.4 per cent and the non-oil economy contracted
by 6.2 per cent.
Third-quarter GDP details underlined the UK's growing dependence on imports
and financial flows from abroad.
Consumers' expenditure was stronger than the overall economy, growing a real
0.4 per cent between the second and third quarters and 0.3 per cent compared
with the third quarter of 1991.
One consequence of that was higher net imports of goods and services worth
Pounds 4.3bn (at 1985 prices) in the third quarter, against Pounds 4.1bn in
the previous three months and Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter of last
year.
The UK's real national disposable income also grew more than GDP. It rose
1.1 per cent between the second and third quarters of this year and fell by
only 0.2 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1991, largely because
of a steep increase in third-quarter net property income from abroad to
Pounds 1.73bn.
Other GDP highlights were:
Faster growth of profits than wages. Income from employment rose 3.2 per
cent in current prices compared with the third quarter of 1991, while
companies' gross trading profits were up 7.7 per cent. Increases between the
second and third quarters were 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively.
Less destocking. Stocks fell by Pounds 201m (at 1985 prices) in the quarter,
the lowest quarterly drop since de-stocking began at the end of 1990.
Broadly unchanged fixed investment. It dropped 0.1 per cent in real terms
compared with both the second quarter of 1992 and the third quarter of last
year.
Spending on vehicles, ships and aircraft rose 10.6 per cent compared with
last year, partly reflecting a recent revival in fleet demand for new cars.
Investment in new dwellings rose strongly, by 10.7 per cent, compared with
the second quarter - probably reflecting increased demand ahead of the
expiry in August of the temporary suspension of stamp duty on most house
purchases.
The CSO also disclosed that unit labour costs for the whole economy rose 3
per cent compared with the third quarter of 1991, the lowest rate of growth
since the end of 1968.
Productivity across the economy grew by 2.4 per cent, its highest rate for
five years.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Disparity in school results to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to investigate 'unacceptable' differences in the
performance of local education authorities in this year's tests for
seven-year-olds in England.
The results, published yesterday, show that three quarters of
seven-year-olds achieved level 2 or above, the grade expected of their age
group in English, maths and science.
Results of the first pilot tests for 14-year-olds, also published yesterday,
showed barely a third at or above the standard expected of them, with the
proportion far lower in science.
Seven-year-olds achieved better results than last year across the
curriculum. In all, 76 per cent reached level 2 in reading, up 5 per cent.
That leaves nearly a quarter of seven-year-olds falling short of the reading
targets, and the proportion making the grade in writing fell 12 percentage
points to 66 per cent.
As last year, the differences between local education authorities are stark.
More than 20 percentage points separate the best-performing authorities from
the worst at level 2 in English, reading and technology.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said: 'There continue to be
unacceptable variations in attainments between different local education
authorities. I will be investigating the reasons why some inner-city LEAs -
for example North Tyneside, Doncaster and Haringey - achieved results at or
above the national average while others in similar circumstances failed
badly.'
The Department for Education published average spending figures for
seven-year-olds in each LEA. Spending ranged from Pounds 2,110 a child a
year in Westminster to Pounds 1,120 in Kent. The top spenders were
inner-London authorities, which say social handicaps force them to spend
more.
Mr Patten said his inquiry would embrace spending. 'I will consider all the
factors, including the level of surplus places - which can often point to
poor management - in the LEAs to see what conclusions can be drawn,' he
said.
The results of the pilot tests for 14-year-olds held last summer showed that
only 34 per cent reached or surpassed the targets in mathematics, with 15
per cent doing so in science.
Four fifths of schools took part, but the Education Department played down
the significance of the results.
Mr Keith Legg, education chairman at Cleveland, the worst-performing LEA in
the tests of seven-year-olds, pointed to the effects of 14 per cent
unemployment and a 50 per cent rise in pupils qualifying for free school
meals in the area. He cited the authority's high standards at A-level in an
attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of the results.
The Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association condemned the results as a
'misleading exercise'. More than 13,000 applications have been received by
the Office for Standards in Education from people wishing to become
independent inspectors of schools. Ofsted, which succeeds Her Majesty's
Inspectorate, aims to have several hundred schools inspectors approved by
summer 1993.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Chambers to merge national lobbies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS of commerce and chambers of trade will end nearly a century of
rivalry when they merge on January 1 to form an organisation with 230,000
members.
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, with 80,000 members, will
absorb the National Chamber of Trade, with 150,000 members. The NCT will
form a retailing division.
The merger will create an organisation with a similar number of members to
that of the Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Ron Taylor, director-general of the association, said preliminary talks
had been held with organisations representing local enterprise agencies and
business clubs about the possibility of forming links.
One of the first actions of the combined organisation will be to launch
plans for the chambers to become 'trading formality centres' providing
information to businesses on any licences they require to start up or stay
in business.
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy, said business owners frequently do not
know what official permissions they need to operate. The centres might
forward applications to government departments to speed up registration.
The association estimated costs at about Pounds 3.65m to set up a network of
50 centres, and Pounds 2.6m a year to run them.
Mr Brown said the scheme could probably cover its costs by charging
companies between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100 for its services.
A survey of about 450 businesses had shown that 92 per cent would not object
to registering through such centres.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Vocational awards body to be sold off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is drawing up plans to transfer the Business and Technology
Education Council, the largest provider of vocational qualifications, to the
private sector.
Btec, which is a charity and a company limited by guarantee, operates in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland and was set up by the Department of
Education. Its chairman and most members are appointed by the education
secretary.
The body has often been critical of government policy on training and
particularly of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the
quango responsible for promoting new qualifications.
Btec, which is one of the three main vocational awarding bodies, receives no
government grant and is funded by fees for the award of qualifications. Its
status will be changed next year after recommendations from Btec itself as
to how it can best preserve its integrity.
The government said it would look to Btec's council to address 'how to
secure future arrangements best suited to enabling Btec to continue to offer
high-quality vocational qualifications and to respond effectively to the
needs of students and their parents, employers, higher education, teachers
and other interests.'
Mr John Spillers, Btec's chief executive, said: 'We will have to suggest how
we can replace the secretary of state's guarantee with a plausible system of
governance.' He hoped Btec would remain a charity that invested its
surpluses in its activities rather than become 'a money spinner for
distribution to shareholders'.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Rising premium for terrorism protection: The government's
scheme for last-resort cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement yesterday of a new insurance scheme to cover damage caused
by terrorists represents a compromise after weeks of wrangling between
insurers and the government.
It may be an expensive solution for those businesses most exposed to
terrorist attack - they are likely to face a steep increase in insurance
premiums.
Last month, insurers announced that they intended to withdraw cover for
terrorism after their own reinsurers, such as Germany's Munich Re, backed
away from the market.
Reinsurers, which help insurers to offset the impact of losses, paid up to
75 per cent of the Pounds 800m claims arising from the IRA bomb attacks in
April in the City and at Staples Corner in north London.
Yesterday's deal, widely welcomed by insurance and business organisations,
involves the government in filling the gap created by the evaporation of
commercial reinsurance, becoming reinsurer of last resort.
Insurers will now offer insurance cover against terrorism, because they can
now limit the losses that might have damaged balance sheets and jeopardised
the security of other policyholders.
The main features of the new arrangements, details of which will be fleshed
out over the coming few days, are: Insurers will continue to offer terrorism
cover on all domestic and motor policies. A limited amount of cover under
five separate headings - buildings, contents, computers, engineering and
business interruption - will be available on commercial policies.
Insurers will exclude full terrorism cover from commercial policies, but
make cover available as a 'buy back' in return for substantial additional
premiums. Those will be channelled into a mutual pool managed by a specially
authorised insurance company and staffed by insurance company
representatives.
The government will meet 90 per cent of claims not covered by the pool -
insurance companies will collectively provide reinsurance for the remaining
10 per cent.
Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, may be involved in insuring or
reinsuring the pool. Underwriters from six syndicates will discuss possible
participation today.
Any surplus on the pool will either be carried forward to increase the size
of the available funds or distributed to insurance companies as a 'dividend'
to recompense them for the cost of administering the system.
Mr Tony Baker, head of public relations at the Association of British
Insurers, said it was impossible to estimate the size of the pool until
insurers had calculated the size of the 'buy back' premiums.
Insurers are expected to aim to build a pool of between Pounds 300m and
Pounds 800m compared with Pounds 2.7bn paid this year by policyholders to
protect commercial property.
Premium rates will vary according to the location and value of property, but
are likely to be expensive. For the foreseeable future, businesses will bear
the brunt.
Companies in less vulnerable areas might expect to pay about 10 per cent of
their commercial property premiums for the pool, but in areas such as
London, 'buy back' premiums may be equal to the cost of existing property
premiums, doubling insurance costs.
The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, whose policy
will expire this month, says it will have to pay nearly 100 per cent of its
existing premiums to buy back cover against terrorism. Mr Baker accepted
that rate increases would be high but insisted that, in absolute terms,
premiums were still 'modest in view of the size of the risk'.
Mr Baker said the new scheme would cover all business interruption losses in
the same way as standard commercial insurance policies.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Police criticised over cell costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEEPING prisoners in police cells when there is no prison accommodation
available is costing an average of Pounds 234 a prisoner a day, according to
the National Audit Office.
The NAO is concerned at the failure of police authorities to provide enough
information to justify charges. Claims from 12 authorities, totalling Pounds
30.8m, failed to give more than the overall charge.
The public expenditure watchdog says payments to police authorities for
holding prisoners reached Pounds 94m in 1991-92, up from Pounds 54m the year
before. The NAO has qualified the Home Office prisons accounts for the year
because of 'material uncertainty' over the accuracy and completeness of
claims from police authorities for holding prisoners.
There were large variations in charges for looking after prisoners. The
lowest claim, for Pounds 30 a prisoner day, was from Surrey police for
holding 633 prisoners in June 1991; the largest, from Dyfed-Powys, was
Pounds 2,008 for holding one prisoner for one night.
The police authority charging the most overall was Hertfordshire, at Pounds
561 a prisoner day. Surrey police were the lowest-charging authority at
Pounds 89 a prisoner day.
After concern over the mounting level of claims for holding prisoners, the
Home Office has set up a new system to monitor and check claims.
The number of government accounts qualified because of poor accounting
procedures has doubled in the past three years, according to Sir John Bourn,
the head of the the National Audit Office. In his annual review of the
accounts of government departments, Sir John says government reforms have
exposed weaknesses in management, financial and accounting controls.
Many of the difficulties have arisen when government bodies change their
status (for example become agencies) or when functions are delegated.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Miners had right to talks, judge declares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD JUSTICE Glidewell said in yesterday's High Court ruling against the
proposed pit closures that it was a 'classic' case where the miners had a
legitimate expectation of consultation.
In the judgment, which took three hours to read out in court, Mr Justice
Hidden, the other judge conducting the judicial review, said he appreciated
British Coal's difficulties. But their resolution had to be within the law.
Both the decision of October 13 to close all 31 pits without consultation
and the decision, announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, on October 19, to close 10 pits and put the other 21 into a
review, were unlawful, the judges ruled. The second decision, which rendered
the first ineffective, was therefore quashed.
Explaining their decision, Mr Justice Glidewell said the Modified Colliery
Review Procedure, established in 1985 after the year-long miners' strike and
which includes an independent review body, remained the agreed procedure to
be used over such pit closure proposals.
British Coal had not indicated any change of attitude over the procedure
before the closure announcement of October 13. The mineworkers' unions were
therefore legitimately entitled to expect the MCRP to be used.
'The MCRP is an agreement which is not legally binding - ie is not
enforceable as a contract - but it gave the unions and their members a
legitimate expectation that the procedure would be followed unless and until
British Coal announced that it would be withdrawn and consulted with the
unions about a new machinery to put in its place,' said Mr Justice
Glidewell.
The decision to close all 31 pits without consultation was also in breach of
the Employment Protection Act 1975, he added. It might also have breached EC
directive No 75, which provides for consultation to avoid redundancies.
The two judges declared that appropriate consultation over the 10 pits due
for early closure could be provided by enhancing the statutory consultation
now being carried out by including some form of independent scrutiny.
Boyds, the US engineering consultants involved in the review of the other 21
pits, could provide that independent element, they suggested.
'British Coal shall not reach a final decision on the closure of the 10
collieries, nor shall . . . (Mr Heseltine) make available funds which would
enable British Coal to make such a decision, until a procedure substantially
the same as MCRP, including some form of independent scrutiny, has been
followed in relation to each of the 10 collieries,' they said.
Lawyers for British Coal said that it would appeal. If successful, this
would not be the first time a decision by Mr Justice Glidewell had been
overturned. He ruled that the government had acted illegally by banning
trade unions at GCHQ, only to have the decision reversed later.

FT  22 DEC 92 / TV executive to head prison service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's deter-mination to maintain the momentum of change in the
prison service was signalled yesterday with the surprise appointment of Mr
Derek Lewis, a television executive, to run it.
Mr Lewis, 46, chairman of UK Gold Television, the satellite station, and
former chief executive of Granada Group, takes over as director-general next
month. He will become chief executive in April, when the service is
relaunched as a Next Steps agency at arm's length from the government.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said he believed Mr Lewis, with his
business background, was 'best equipped to manage the process of change'
needed in the service. In spite of his lack of Civil Service experience, Mr
Lewis will become the home secretary's chief adviser on prisons.
Union leaders and prison reform organisations last night expressed concern
about Mr Lewis's selection. The Association of First Division Civil Servants
said it 'looked like a political appointment by the home secretary'.
Shadow Home secretary Mr Tony Blair last night attacked Mr Lewis's salary of
Pounds 125,000 a year, plus 35 per cent performance-related supplements.
He said the salary with bonuses could amount to Pounds 167,000 a year,
almost three times the amount paid to the Director General of Prisons, who
earns Pounds 63,000 a year.
The prison service has traditionally been run as a highly centralised Civil
Service department and dominated locally by the Prison Officers'
Association, its trade union.
Mr Lewis's appointment is the latest government move to shake up these
arrangements. Britain now has two privately managed prisons, and the public
and private sectors are preparing bids to manage Strangeways prison,
Manchester.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Channel Five Holdings to pursue bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHAREHOLDERS of Channel Five Holdings plan to continue toraise the money
to launch Channel 5 in spite of the Independent Television Commission's
rejection of its bid last week.
Thames Television and other smaller shareholders such as Mr Moses Znaimer,
the channel's programming consultant, have not ruled out seeking a judicial
review of the ITC's decision but are exploring ways of saving the project.
The central aim is to see whether the companies supporting the venture, such
as Time Warner, the world's largest media group, can be persuaded to come up
with firm commitments for Pounds 175m in the next 12 weeks. That would have
been the period between the award and the granting of the licence had the
ITC approved the bid.
The ITC rejected Channel Five Holdings mainly because of insufficient
shareholder support. Only 45 per cent of the financing was firmly secured:
35 per cent from Thames and 10 per cent from Time Warner.
There was further interest, however, from Time Warner and other companies
including Capital Cities/ABC, Cox, Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
and Associated Newspapers.
If the financing had been secured, the ITC's worries about the business plan
and the channel's revenues would probably have been overcome.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, Thames Television's majority
shareholder, said yesterday: 'We will support Thames in whatever they decide
to do.'
He described the ITC decision as unnecessary in that without the money the
consortium could not get the licence and without the licence it could not
get the money.
The ITC was unsure yesterday whether it could reopen the issue if the
financing for the project became available.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Major intends to shake up public-service honours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTERNATIVE public-service medals are being considered as part of Mr John
Major's review of how the official honours system can better reflect merit
rather than rank.
Downing Street said yesterday that the first results of the prime minister's
rethink of the system will be seen in the Queen's birthday honours next
summer.
Mr Major wants a move away from automatic awards for senior civil servants,
members of the diplomatic service and the military. He is drawing up
proposals in consultation with the monarch and with Sir Robin Butler, head
of the Home Civil Service.
Officials are playing down the prospects of sweeping changes, saying only
'modest' proposals for changes will be announced early next year as part of
a 'rolling review'. Downing Street said new honours might be introduced.
The new year honours list, to be announced next week, will not be affected.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Major said: 'I don't propose whole-scale dramatic
changes in the honours system. I think the honours system is a proper
reflection of merit within our society and I support it as such. What I
wish. . . is to make sure that it is brought up to date.'
In Whitehall, many awards for senior public servants are regarded as coming
with the job. A grade one civil servant - head of a government department -
can expect to become a Knight Commander of the Bath, a grade two or three
would expect a Companion of the Bath. A senior ambassador, meanwhile, might
expect to become a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St
George.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Same election system for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will retain the 'first past the post' system for the 1994 European
elections, Mr John Major has decided.
The prime minister said yesterday he would not imitate other European
Community countries, which all use some form of proportional representation
for electing members of the European parliament.
His comments ended speculation that the decision at the European summit in
Edinburgh to give Britain six more MEPs, bringing the total to 87, would
lead to electoral reform. Northern Ireland's three MEPs are already elected
by proportional representation.
Confusion remains over the allocation of the seats. The 1978 European
Parliamentary Elections Act did not provide for a review and any changes
would require legislation.
The prime minister said he could see the 'superficial equity' of making the
electoral systems used by EC countries conform.
But he added: 'Our tradition in this country is to maintain a direct
relationship between the elected member and an individual constituency and
that tends to argue for the 'first past the post' system. I don't myself
imagine that we are likely to change that.'

Bear Stearns claimed that it was entitled to rescind its Canary Wharf lease

Mr Justice Morritt concluded in the High Court that there had been no

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, yesterday survived a
parliamentary no-confidence vote called over his handling of the Ayodhya
mosque crisis.
The militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition party which
organised the rally at which the mosque was destroyed, failed to persuade
other political groupings to support its call for the prime minister's
resignation. MPs of the ruling Congress (I) party and its left-wing allies
rallied around Mr Rao.
The no-confidence motion against the government, put to the vote after a
noisy four-day debate, was defeated 334-106, with 47 members of the National
Front abstaining.
Congress MPs were generally unimpressed by the prime minister's performance
in the debate, in which he denied the government had failed to do enough to
protect the mosque from destruction by Hindu militants. Mr Inderjit Gupta, a
Congress party member, publicly criticised Mr Rao during the debate over the
arrest of Mr LK Advani, the BJP leader and leader of the opposition, who is
being held in police custody on charges of fomenting inter-racial hatred.
Some Congress members voiced their doubts privately, saying the prime
minister had said nothing about one central issue  - the proposed rebuilding
of the mosque and the future of the makeshift Hindu temple which the
militants erected on the disputed site.
MPs felt Mr Rao had done enough to quell any immediate attempts to unseat
his government but had failed to reimpose his authority on the party. Such
lukewarm support for the prime minister could hamper his efforts to
implement firm policies to cope with the aftermath of the Ayodhya crisis and
with other challenges, including the future of the country's economic

Mr Rao described the demolition of the Ayodhya mosque as a tragedy, an act
of betrayal and vandalism. The destruction had been pre-planned, he claimed.
Mr Rao announced increased financial compensation for the families of the
1,200 people killed in the nationwide riots following the mosque's
destruction. He urged restraint on the use of religion in parties' electoral
platforms, a clear reference to the BJP's espousal of Hinduism, though he
did not name the party.
Failure of the no-confidence motion had been expected. Shares rose sharply
yesterday after two weeks' sharp decline. The Bombay Stock Exchange's

Mr C. Rangarajan yesterday took over as governor of the Reserve Bank of
India from Mr S. Venkitaraman, whose two-year term was clouded by the Bombay
securities market scandal. The bank was widely criticised over its
supervision of the market. Mr Rangarajan was deputy governor of the bank for
10 years before leaving for a spell at the government's planning commission.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Japan drafts budget to lift economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Finance Ministry yesterday published a draft budget for fiscal 1993
that attempts to balance an expected fall in tax revenues with the need to
increase public spending and stimulate an ailing economy.
The draft, which provides for an austere 0.2 per cent increase in total
outlays but a 4.8 per cent rise in public works spending, was approved at a
cabinet meeting yesterday and will be debated by the government until the
end of the week.
Some estimates will change because of the negotiations, but the draft,
hailed as 'stimulatory' by the ministry, is the basic guide to Japanese
government spending for the fiscal year beginning in April.
Outlays in several areas, including pensions and agricultural subsidies, are
to fall, while defence spending is set to rise by 1.7 per cent, the smallest
increase since 1960. Overseas aid spending is scheduled to rise by 4.7 per
cent and social welfare outlays by 2.9 per cent, the smallest increases in
both sectors since 1987.
The ministry said that while outlays in most areas were restrained to a
degree unprecedented in recent years, public works spending was increased.
Business organisations generally welcomed the emphasis on public works
spending, but Mr Masaru Hayami, head of the Association of Corporate
Executives, said the ministry's calculations might be flawed because they
are based on an 'overly optimistic' forecast of 3.3 per cent economic growth
next year.
Meanwhile, the second budget, the annual estimates of the Fiscal Investment
and Loan Programme (Filp), which taps funds in government-affiliated
financial institutions, provides for a 12.4 per cent rise in public
works-related spending, compared to a 10.8 per cent rise in the current
year.
Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said the budget
was 'definitely expansionary' and almost certain to be supplemented by a
special budget package in fiscal 1993. 'This budget is really a sign of the
economic times. The ministry is doing everything it can, particularly with
the Filp,' Mr Feldman said.
Ms Chiharu Shima, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the budget was
'enough to keep the engine running, but not enough to accelerate the
economy'.
Finance Ministry officials said that the budget was not drafted with
Washington in mind, but that US officials should conclude Japan was doing
everything possible to revive the domestic economy and contribute to
international growth.
The ministry expects the slowing of the economy will lead to a 1.9 per cent
fall in tax revenues. As a result, construction bond issues are scheduled to
rise by 11.7 per cent to cover the deficit, and debt paper as a percentage
of the general account revenue will rise from 10.1 to 11.2 per cent.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Beirut refuses to give way over deportees: Lebanon will not
be a dumping ground for Israeli problems says prime minister

<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S expulsion of 415 Palestinians has inspired widespread sympathy for
them in the Lebanon, but the government in Beirut is none the less
determined that it will no longer be an unwilling accomplice in such
actions.
Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, said that Lebanon 'will not be
a dumping ground for Israeli problems'. Sixty-six Palestinians have been
deported to Lebanon in the past five years, and Lebanon has never before
refused to receive them.
However, the government yesterday issued a communique saying the Lebanese
army had instructed the 415 deportees to 'go back where they came from'. It
noted that humanitarian organisations had been ordered 'to stop all
assistance to the area where the deportees are located'.
The deportees had set up a makeshift camp in no-man's land in south-eastern
Lebanon. Reporters at the scene said the South Lebanon Army fired around the
deportees and over their heads as they attempted to return to Israel and
came within several hundred yards of the SLA positions at Zemraya on the
edge of Israel's Lebanese 'security zone'. Two Palestinians were wounded and
taken to hospital in the Lebanese government-controlled village of Rashaya.
Israeli prime minister Yitzak Rabin claims the 415 men are now Lebanon's
responsibility, but Mr Hariri firmly rejected liability for their
well-being.
'I feel sorry for the difficult and inhuman conditions under which the
deported Palestinians are living,' Mr Hariri said. 'But the position of the
Lebanese government has not changed. The Israeli government continues to
bear the responsibility for this decision which is contrary to the
principles of international laws, especially the Geneva Convention.'
Asked whether Lebanon intended to participate in Middle East peace talks
when they resume after US President-elect Bill Clinton is inaugurated on
January 20, even if the 415 Palestinians were still trapped in their camp,
Mr Hariri indicated it would.
'We have to discuss this matter in the council of ministers, but as a
principle we don't see why we will not continue the peace talks,' he said.
The Lebanese government was in some disarray over the order yesterday that
the deportees should move south.
An official told Reuters news agency: 'The orders by a (Lebanese) army unit
to the deportees to return to the Israeli-held area is not an official stand
by Lebanon.'
But Mr Mohsen Dalloul, defence minister, said Lebanon would 'use pressure'
if necessary to stop the deportees from entering government-controlled areas
 -and it would send them back to Israeli-held areas if it could.
Mr Michel Samaha, information minister, said Lebanon was not responsible for
the deportees because they were in an area not controlled by the Beirut
government.
'The Lebanese government is not responsible in any way for the deported
brothers as their present location is outside the geographic context in
which the Lebanese state practises its sovereignty,' he said after a meeting
with the prime minister, defence minister and and Gen Emile Lahoud, army
chief.
What has helped the government, however, is the support of the deportees
themselves. The Lebanese army officer commanding some 60 troops just north
of the deportee's encampment, Maj Omar Halaby, was applauded by the
Palestinians when he told them to return to the Israeli-occupied zone of
southern Lebanon yesterday.
The Lebanese foreign minister, Mr Fares Bweiz, criticised UN Security
Council resolution 799 for failing to include sanctions against Israel.
'The international community must realise that its credibility is at stake
if it remains silent in this affair, which resembles Nazi practices during
the second world war, Mr Bweiz said.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday added two more members to his
cabinet with the nomination of Mr Richard Riley to be secretary of education
and Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary.
Mr Riley is a former governor of South Carolina who worked with Mr Clinton
on a number of education initiatives and has been in charge of the personnel
selection process for the president-elect's transition team.
Mr Clinton said Mr Riley was 'a nationally recognised leader in education'
whose reforms in South Carolina had been the first in the nation to provide
clear ways of measuring progress in meeting educational goals.
The Education Department is one of the least effective branches of the
federal government, because education in the US is overwhelmingly controlled
and funded at local level, but Mr Clinton said the department could set
benchmarks for national education.
Ms O'Leary, an executive vice-president of Northern States Power, a utility
company based in Minnesota, was a relatively surprising choice for the
Energy Department, which had been expected to go to former Senator Tim
Wirth.
But Mr Clinton said Ms O'Leary had the best mix of experience in the Energy
Department under President Jimmy Carter and in the private sector.
Ms O'Leary said she felt as though she had been in training for the job for
about 20 years, creating regulations in government and experiencing them in
the private sector.
'I know about command and control regulations and I know they don't work,'
she said.
Mr Clinton is lagging on his self-imposed schedule for completing his
cabinet by Christmas. Besides the State Department, expected to be headed by
Mr Warren Christopher, and Defence, where Congressman Les Aspin is favoured,
he has yet to name an attorney-general or interior, transportation and
agriculture secretaries.

POLAND, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic yesterday established a
regional trading zone designed gradually to eliminate tariff barriers by the
end of the century and ensure compatibility with the European Community and
countries of the European Free Trade Area.
Tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods are to be reduced between 1995
and 1997 while barriers to trade in other more sensitive categories such as
cars, textiles and steel are to be scrapped by 2001.
The signing in Krakow yesterday was greeted with relief, given the tension
between Hungary and Slovakia over the Danube dam and the 'divorce' of
Slovaks and Czechs at the beginning of 1993.
At one point, the Hungarians had wanted a bilateral free trade pact with the
Poles. The Czechs stressed their free trade credentials and their
differences with the Slovaks by pressing for a shortening to four years of
the period in which tariffs are to be reduced.
The Slovaks wanted to lengthen the time frame to eight years. In the end,
the agreement which scraps tariffs on raw materials and goods where exports
do not compete directly with locally-produced items on March 31 1993, is
accompanied by a declaration committing the signatories to start new talks
on eliminating tariff barriers within five years.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Flawed Kenya poll is set to resolve little: Michael Holman
and Julian Ozanne warn of grave consequences if election is not judged
'free'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE carload of government supporters careered down Nyeri's main street,
loudspeaker blaring election slogans, occupants waving posters adorned with
a cockerel, symbol of Kenya's ruling party, Kanu.
It was a forlorn gesture of defiance. Nyeri, centre of a rich agricultural
region and home to the disgruntled Kikuyu tribe, will declare for the
opposition in elections next Tuesday, the first multi-party poll for 26
years.
But when overall results are declared, Kanu and its leader, President Daniel
arap Moi, may well have cause to crow.
The combination of an efficient party machine, a core of support based on an
alliance of ethnic minorities and what are politely termed election
'irregularities' make it possible now that Kanu will slide home with the
most seats in the 188-member parliament and Mr Moi may win the presidential
poll, largely by default.
A year ago this prospect would have been almost inconceivable. Since then
the opposition forces have fragmented and Kanu has been able to exploit this
division. But this alone might not have been enough to return Kanu to power
after the past decade of autocracy and corruption, and the ruling party has
taken no chances.
Election observers already concede privately that government manipulation
has seriously flawed the election process. They say the government and the
ruling party - a distinction without a difference - have influenced the
outcome in four main ways. Voters' rolls in at least 20 constituencies were
given a Kanu bias through the registering of party supporters bussed in from
elsewhere.
Opposition parliamentary candidates, some planted by Kanu, have been offered
bribes to stand down. At least 22 have withdrawn so far.
Opposition candidates were prevented from submitting nomination papers in 17
constituencies, leaving Kanu candidates unopposed.
State resources - ranging from government funds to vehicles and civil
servants, radio and television - have been deployed in Kanu's cause.
The consequences of failure to meet the criteria of 'free and fair' are
grave. Aid flows, suspended a year ago, will stay frozen, and the stability
of what would be an unrepresentative government will be fragile.
Without the government weighting the deck in its favour, political observers
say, the election would have been a closer-run affair. Disillusionment with
Kanu under Mr Moi among the three largest tribes - the Kikuyu, the Luo and
the Luhya - paved the way for a possible opposition victory.
Leading the challenge is the Democratic Party of Mr Mwai Kibaki, former
finance minister and vice president. Running second is Ford Kenya, under Mr
Oginga Odinga, the 85-year-old veteran politician; and in third place is
Ford Asili, headed by former minister and businessman Mr Ken Matiba.
At least three of Kenya's eight provinces have largely deserted Mr Moi and
Kanu - Central, Nyanza and Nairobi. The stronghold of opposition is in the
densely populated Central province, home of the large and wealthy Kikuyu
tribe, which forms about 21 per cent of Kenya's 25m population.
All-powerful under the late President Jomo Kenyatta, they today feel
alienated and marginalised by President Moi's 14-year rule. All 25
constituencies are likely to fall to opposition parties, mainly to the DP,
whose leadership is predominantly Kikuyu. The rest will be split between
Ford Kenya and Ford Asili - most going to the latter, thanks to Mr Matiba's
strong presence in his home district of Murang'a.
Most of the 29 seats in Nyanza province are expected to fall to Ford Kenya;
Kanu's best chances are in Kisii district, where Mr Simon Nyachae, the
influential former cabinet secretary, is leading the party's campaign.
Nyanza, a fertile sugar cotton and rice province bordering Lake Victoria, is
home to Mr Odinga's Luo tribe, 13 per cent of the population. They are
deeply embittered by the murder two years ago of their kinsman, Mr Robert
Ouko, the former foreign minister. There are suspicions of high-level
government involvement in his death.
In Nairobi, where Luos and Kikuyus make up a majority of the capital's
population, most if not all the eight seats are expected to fall to the
opposition.
Mr Moi and Kanu are strongest in the Rift Valley province, home to about 30
per cent of the electorate and with 44 seats at stake. The province is home
to Mr Moi's Kalenejin tribe (11 per cent) and other minority ethnic groups
such as the nomadic Turkana, Samburu, Maasai and Pokot, who will turn out
solidly for Kanu.
In Eastern Province the DP is a strong contender for the 32 seats at stake.
Kanu's best chances lie in the arid northern districts of Isiolo and
Marsabit, containing six seats.
In the 20 constituencies in Coastal province at least half the seats are
expected to fall to the opposition, mainly to Ford Kenya, benefiting from an
informal alliance with the banned Islamic Party of Kenya. The IPK represents
the disgruntled local Moslem population, who accuse the government of being
dominated by inland tribes.
Western Province's 20 seats are likely to be split between Kanu and the main
opposition parties. A key figure is Mr Martin Shikuku of Ford Asili,
expected to win support of his Luhya tribe (14 per cent.)
The wild and virtually sealed off North Eastern province, with 10 seats, is
a mystery. Its population, Somali in origin, are resentful about a
government ethnic screening exercise last year, but Kanu is the only party
with a presence.
Opposition parties have already warned about the prospect of serious unrest,
even civil war, if Kanu clings to power unfairly. In the slums of Nairobi,
Nakuru and Kisumu hundreds of thousands of urban poor with nothing to lose
are a powder keg waiting to be lit.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Bank lending curbs hit money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S money supply in November contracted 0.5 per cent from the same month
last year, reflecting the impact of curbs on new lending by the country's
banks, which are burdened by non-performing loans.
The contraction of M2 plus certificates of deposit followed a fall of 0.6
per cent in October and marked the third straight month of year-on-year
decline, prompting Japanese business organisations to call for an easing of
lending restrictions.
However, the Bank of Japan argues that the contraction is due more to weak
demand for new lending than to the banks' inability to lend. The bank said
money supply growth was likely to return soon, as the October contraction
appeared to have been the turning point.
The bank prefers to judge trends from the broadest measure of liquidity,
which includes postal savings funds, and which grew by 2.6 per cent in
November, compared to a year earlier, down from 2.7 per cent growth in
October.
Money supply growth has slowed sharply over the past two years.
In October 1990, broad money expanded 11.8 per cent on a year earlier, but
the growth fell in virtually every month until September, when it contracted
0.4 per cent.

FRENCH troops wounded at least three gunmen when they came under attack in
southern Somalia, a French military spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Mogadishu.
Ten gunmen in a 'technical' battlewagon charged towards the French soldiers'
observation post near the town of Baidoa on Sunday night, Col Jean-Paul
Perruche said. The troops opened fire.
The three Somalis, found with automatic rifles, were taken to hospital, one
with severe stomach wounds. No French soldiers were hurt and the other
gunmen fled.
The clash highlighted continued insecurity in Somalia, where US-led forces
have intervened to keep pillaging gunmen and feuding clan militias away from
food for victims of Africa's worst famine this century.
Relief agencies put pressure on the US military yesterday to extend their
security umbrella to north Mogadishu, nominally controlled by warlord Ali
Mahdi Mohamed.
'It's teeming with AK-47s and with technicals,' Mr Mark Thomas, spokesman
for the UN Children's Fund, said. 'Any military presence at all would help,
as long as it is a show of force. They said it would happen soon but would
give us no definite date.'
US troops who secured Mogadishu port and airport at the start of Operation
Restore Hope on December 9 have escorted food convoys across the Green Line
dividing the capital, but do not operate patrols in the north. Relief
agencies have withdrawn almost all foreign staff from the enclave because of
the insecurity.
US Marines and their coalition allies have set up bridgeheads for the relief
operation in Baidoa and at a military airfield in Bali Dogle. On Sunday they
entered the southern port of Kismayu.

backtracking at trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday cast a new shadow over prospects for an early Gatt accord,
accusing the US of across-the-board backtracking in the multilateral Geneva
trade talks on market access and services.
Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, told his EC counterparts at a
meeting in Brussels that the US had shifted position on industrial tariffs,
anti-dumping, intellectual property, and standards. He also issued what has
become a ritual denunciation of the US-EC accord on reducing farm export
subsidies.
The French warning that the trade talks could be heading for a stormy period
was echoed by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, who chaired yesterday's meeting,
conceded there was 'some stiffening on the US side'. But provided the US
showed flexibility and the EC showed solidarity, the goal of an agreement by
mid-January was still possible.
In Geneva, trade negotiators said yesterday that the commitment by the US
and the EC to complete a Gatt deal had failed to take note of the time
needed to win agreement from the other 106 countries negotiating in the
round.
At yesterday's meeting, EC foreign ministers agreed to open formal
enlargement negotiations with Sweden, Austria and Finland in Brussels on
Feburary 1 1993. Denmark, which takes over the six-monthly rotating EC
presidency from the UK on January 1, will handle the talks.
The ministers failed to agree, however, on European Commission proposals to
strengthen its arsenal of trade weapons, including anti-dumping measures and
quotas, in time for the launch of the single market in the new year.
Britain and Germany led a free trade bloc against a Commission plan to
reverse long-standing policy by requiring that new duties should be blocked
by a qualified majority. At present, a blocking minority suffices.
The impasse on anti-dumping measures killed hopes of progress on proposals
to scrap or 'harmonise' national quotas on non-EC goods, once the single
market comes into effect on January 1. The Commission would like to
introduce EC-wide quotas in sensitive areas such as textiles, footwear and
toys to replace national quotas.
Failure to reach a deal means the Commission will probably have to introduce
provisional rules to cover imports in these sensitive areas for large
third-country exporters such as China.

EUROPEAN Community peace negotiator Lord Owen has hammered out a plan for
demilitarising the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo after four days of
shuttle diplomacy among warring factions around the city, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
'I think we've laid a framework for demilitarising Sarajevo. . . no doubt
there will be many upsets and difficulties along the way, but we have agreed
now on a structure,' he said after nearly three hours of talks with Bosnian
Serbs in Lukavica, near Sarajevo.
Lord Owen has persuaded Moslem, Serb and Croat factions to create four
problem-solving working committees.
Among the issues to be addressed are demilitarising an area around Sarajevo
airport, restoring utilities, creating joint police patrols in divided
neighbourhoods and giving humanitarian aid
Each committee would co-ordinate its activities with an existing body known
as the mixed military working group, Dr Owen said.
Local military commanders have often scuttled ceasefire agreements and
blocked UN efforts to repair utilities and humanitarian aid convoys.
UN relief workers restarted their airlift of emergency aid to Sarajevo
yesterday after a three-week break caused by fighting.

RUSSIA was said yesterday to be on the verge of introducing its own
currency, a move which would force all other republics to introduce their
own and deprive them of direct influence over Moscow's monetary policy.
At the same time, however, Mr Valerian Kulikov, central bank deputy
chairman, outlined, in an interview with Izvestia newspaper, a shift in
credit and finance policies which would weaken whatever currency replaces
the old Soviet rouble.
'We will correct the policy of the central bank in accordance with the
government line announced by the new prime minister,' he said, referring to
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's promise to stem a fall in industrial output and
wipe out the debts accumulated by state-owned enterprises.
New measures included negative annual interest rates of 3-10 per cent for
central bank loans for investment in industry and, apart from introducing
new tax benefits, even waiving reserve requirements for commercial banks
which lend to priority sectors, such as consumer goods.
Social security minister Ella Pamfilova has offered to quit the Russian
government, the first member of former acting prime minister Yegor Gaidar's
cabinet to do so, Interfax news agency said yesterday.

Former East German leader Erich Honecker was ordered by a court yesterday to
remain in jail on manslaughter charges linked to the border shooting of
would-be defectors, Reuter reports from Berlin. A Berlin court rejected a
motion by Mr Honecker's lawyers to have the case dropped on the grounds that
the 80-year-old communist was too ill with liver cancer to survive a trial.

EC transport ministers failed yesterday to agree measures which would have
given road haulage companies the right from next year to ply for trade in EC
countries other than their own, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
The measure is a basic building block of the internal market, which starts
on January 1, and hauliers facing cross-border barriers may now seek redress
through the European Court of Justice.
Germany was the main stumbling block to agreement. Bonn has linked a deal on
road cabotage to satisfactory agreements on road user charges, the fiscal
harmonisation of vehicle excise duties, and even travellers' duty-free
allowances.
EC diplomats were meeting last night to try to decouple from the cabotage
imbroglio those linked issues, such as travel allowances, on which a deal in
principle has been reached.

FT  22 DEC 92 / EC flight of fancy over reindeer aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REFLECTING the spirit of 'openness' and subsidiarity at the Edinburgh summit
of EC leaders earlier this month, the European Commission is expected this
week to turn a blind eye to illegal Danish state aid to a Scandinavian
co-operative supplying reindeer.
At the Commission meeting this week, its last before a new Brussels
executive takes office in January, the regional aid scheme, known by the
acronym Yule, is almost certain to get through, even though it has never
been notified to the Commission as required under EC law.
The aid is an annual grant to S. Claus Ltd, headquartered in Lapland,
Finland, and is worth DKr167 (Pounds 17.7) per reindeer, subject to a limit
of 25 animals per individual producer. The Commission was concerned that the
aid reinforced the company's downstream activities, bolstering a potentially
dominant position in the Christmas gift market.
According to documents on the case, prepared by staff of the controversial
outgoing farm commissioner Ray MacSharry, the reindeer aid has sparked the
now familiar dispute between the Brussels competition and industry
directorates about what constitutes the relevant market in which to judge a
dominant position.
The free marketeers, headed by Sir Leon Brittan, UK competition
commissioner, say S. Claus has 64.7 per cent of the EC gift market.
The interventionists, led by Mr Martin Bangemann, German industry
commissioner, say, in a replay of their arguments over the De Havilland
case, that 'the relevant market should be defined in terms which include
also the birthday gift market, as well as the Father's Day, Mother's Day,
secretary's day, Easter egg and tooth fairy segments of the market.'
The salient points in opinion to be laid before the Commission, however,
suggest most commissioners will endorse the aid. This is because:
'Operators throughout the Community are among (S. Claus Ltd's) downstream
beneficiaries';
The European Court of Justice ruling 72/79 (Commission vs the Gift Horse)
found that 'in assessing the real value of non-repayable aid it is the
thought that counts';
The court 'endorsed the application of the private-market investor principle
to cases of non-repayable handouts in its judgment in Case 140/1867 (Scrooge
vs Tiny Tim)';
The Commission has taken note of assurances from the Danish authorities that
there is no intra-Community trade in reindeer, and that 'the downstream
effect of the aid will be available on a non-discriminatory basis throughout
the Community'.
But a satisfactory outcome may yet fall foul of the Brussels legal service,
whose submission raises doubts about the status of S. Claus Ltd. Their
opinion submits that there may be 'no precedent for opening the Article
93(2) procedure in respect of a company which is no more than a figment of
people's imagination. They consider, however, that this point can be
overcome by careful drafting of the letter to the Danish authorities'.
A further problem is grudging and conditional support from the external
affairs directorate, where Sir Leon wants to establish a dominant position
for himself in the next Commission. In a separate memo, they say: 'The
proposal should be made by Sir Leon Brittan, whose impartiality is beyond
any doubt. . . and who is known not to give free gifts'.

FT  22 DEC 92 / HDTV funds blocked again

<TEXT>
BRITAIN has again blocked European Community funding for the development of
cinema-quality television, postponing an EC strategy on the new technology
until next year.
Foreign ministers, meeting for the last time under the UK's EC presidency,
were unable to resolve differences between Britain and its 11 EC partners,
which exploded into a row after the recent Edinburgh summit.
Yesterday, Britain refused to commit itself to a European Commission
compromise first discussed by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president,
and Mr John Major, British prime minister, on their way to talks in the US
at the weekend. The issue will now be taken up during the Danish presidency
of the EC which begins in January.
The Commission has been pressing for a five-year 'action plan' to promote
wide-screen high-definition TV (HDTV) services in the EC. But the UK does
not believe proposed funding of Ecu500m (Pounds 404.5m) over five years is
justified; it says new technologies, such as digital television, are being
developed which could supersede HDTV standards promoted by the EC.
According to yesterday's Commission proposals, the EC would allocate Ecu80m
to the development of wide-screen HDTV services in 1993. The EC would also
consider a report on the prospects for digital HDTV and a possible review of
its strategy early next year. Britain supported elements of the compromise,
but refused to commit itself in principle to a five-year plan.
The events of the past fortnight have revealed the amount of political and
industrial capital invested in HDTV, with Mr Major accused of reneging on an
agreement made at Edinburgh to lift the British veto on HDTV.
Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, Dutch telecommunications minister, a critic of the UK
position, said yesterday she was disappointed by Britain's attitude. 'Maybe
next year the sky will be a little bluer.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / Pit closure plan ruled illegal by High Court: Calls for
Heseltine to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court dealt the government's coal programme a severe blow yesterday
by ruling that its decision to close 31 pits with the loss of 30,000 jobs
last October had been conducted unlawfully.
The ruling caused jubilation among mineworkers, and provoked an opposition
call for the resignation of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary. However, it seemed unlikely to lead to an early resumption of
mining at 10 pits where work is being stopped.
Last night, Mr Heseltine admitted the government had 'got it wrong' over the
pit closure programme but rejected calls for his resignation. He said he
would help set up an independent assessment of prospects for the 10 pits as
requested by the court and suggested John T Boyd, the mining consultancy,
might be used for the purpose.
In their ruling, Lord Justice Glidewell and Mr Justice Hidden found that the
government and British Coal 'unlawfully and irrationally' ignored the right
of mineworkers and trade unions to be consulted over pit closures.
The judges also quashed Mr Heseltine's decision six days later, as a result
of the public outcry, to close 10 pits after a 90-day consultation and to
subject the remaining 21 to a review.
The judges, who were ruling on an appeal against the closures by the mining
unions, found that the lack of consultation broke the Employment Protection
Act 1975 and possibly also breached EC law. Miners' rights are contained in
the modified colliery review procedure (MCRP) which was set up in 1985 after
the last coal strike. But it was suspended by British Coal in October in
order to speed up the closures.
The judges said: 'British Coal shall not reach a final decision on the
closure of the 10 collieries, nor shall the president make available funds
which would enable British Coal to make such a decision, until a procedure
substantially the same as MCRP, including some form of independent scrutiny,
has been followed in relation to each of the 10 collieries.' The
consultations being used for the 21 pits might be incorporated into the
procedure.
British Coal said it was considering an appeal. It also indicated that it
would study the ruling, which took three hours to read out in the court,
before deciding the future of threatened pits. The ruling was about the
process for shutting down mines, not about the legalities of mine closures
themselves.
The ruling was welcomed by some Tory MPs, and deepened the government's
embarrassment over the closures. Many Conservatives, including ministers,
believe a reprieve for several of the 31 pits is inevitable. Mr John Major
hinted at a retreat during a BBC Radio interview, saying the government had
an open mind.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment spokesmen, called for the resignations of
Mr Heseltine and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary. 'Lawmakers
should not be lawbreakers,' he said. Union leaders hailed the decision as
the most significant legal victory for organised labour since the 1970s. Mr
Arthur Scargill, NUM leader, called for Mr Heseltine's resignation and
insisted work should be resumed immediately in the 10 pits not reprieved by
the government energy review.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, stopped short of calling for resignations,
but wrote to the prime minister asking for the 10 pits to be included
immediately in the review.
Union strategists believe that at least 17 of the 31 pits will remain open
as part of British Coal, and that up to six more will survive in deals with
electricity generators or large coal users.
Speaking on Channel 4 News, Mr Heseltine said: 'We got it wrong because in
taking the decision that it was necessary to reduce the capacity of British
Coal, the consultation was not considered by British Coal at that time to be
necessarily along the lines the courts have now indicated. I have accepted
that advice - that the court takes a different view.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / Palestinian deportees come under militia fire
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Palestinians were wounded yesterday when Israeli-backed militiamen fired
warning shots to stop about 415 deportees stranded in a Middle East no-man's
land from re-entering Israeli-held territory.
As the deadlock between Lebanon and Israel over the fate of the deportees
continued, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, told parliament in
Jerusalem his government was firm in its resolve not to let them return. 'I
confess there is no pity for them in my heart,' he said.
In Beirut, the Lebanese government repeated that it was not responsible for
the expelled Palestinians. And Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri told
humanitarian organisations they could no longer provide emergency aid.
The Israeli High Court adjourned until today its consideration of a petition
by civil rights lawyers to force the government to rescind the deportations.
In the US, General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
added his voice to the US administration's criticism of the expulsions.
'Counterviolence and deportations are not the answer we need to Israel's
legitimate security needs,' General Powell told a Jewish audience at Yeshiva
University in New York.
Earlier, the deportees, expelled last week for their alleged links to
Islamic fundamentalist groups which had shot dead six Israeli soldiers, were
ordered by Lebanese troops to leave their makeshift camp in no-man's land in
south-eastern Lebanon and return southwards to Israeli-controlled territory.
Reporters at the scene said the South Lebanon Army, which is armed and
controlled by Israel, twice opened fire around the deportees and over their
heads with tank shells, mortars and heavy machineguns when they came within
several hundred yards of SLA positions at Zemraya on the edge of Israel's
Lebanese 'security zone'.
At nightfall, the deportees were said to have moved back towards their tent
encampment in the area between the Israeli and Lebanese armies to spend a
fifth successive night. The SLA planted mines to prevent another attempted
crossing and received water cannon and teargas.
Mr Rabin told the Knesset he would not be swayed by what he said was an
attempt to prove 'that these terrorists are unprotected and should be
pitied.' He said the expulsions were part of a fight against Islamic
extremists pledged to destroy the Middle East peace process.
Mr Rabin said he was convinced the peace negotiations would resume, despite
a suspension of the talks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. But the
head of the Palestinian delegation to the talks, Mr Faisal Husseini, said
the immediate issue was securing the return of the deportees, not setting a
date for renewed talks.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Major pledges industry aid and rules out early reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR gave a clear signal yesterday that a package of measures to
underpin industrial investment will be at the centre of the next Budget in
March. He confirmed also that Mr Norman Lamont was not about to be moved
from his post as chancellor.
In an effort to end the speculation about Mr Lamont's future, the prime
minister ruled out an early cabinet reshuffle.
Returning from a trip to Washington he told BBC Radio that he was ready to
make ministerial changes 'as and when' it was necessary. But he added: 'I am
not anticipating a January reshuffle.'
His comments were interpreted in Whitehall as signalling that despite the
prospect of a critical House of Commons report on his handling of his
personal finances, Mr Lamont's position at the Treasury is secure until the
summer.
But the prime minister accompanied his support for the chancellor with a
clear signal that he intends to take an active role in shaping the contents
of the March Budget.
He said that his first priority in 1993 was 'to ensure that companies have
the confidence to invest'.
Capital investment was the key both to medium-term growth and prosperity and
to short-term job creation.
Voicing hopes that the international environment would allow him to focus
much more of his attention on his domestic agenda in 1993, Mr Major added:
'I do see it as a year in which we begin to recreate the confidence, the
growth and the prosperity of British industry and commerce.'
Mr Major wants the next Budget to build on the investment incentives in last
month's Autumn Statement, which temporarily raised capital allowances for
spending on industrial plant, machinery and buildings.
He will also press the Treasury to increase further the scope for private
and public sector partnerships in large-scale infrastructure projects.
Whitehall officials acknowledge there will be no scope for net reductions in
taxation in March. Ministers have not ruled out the possibility of an
overall increase in taxation.
But Mr Major is determined that the government should follow through on its
recent commitment to a revival of manufacturing industry by extending tax
incentives.
He wants Mr Lamont to consider also special help for small businesses, the
worst affected victims of the recession, and for exporters having to compete
in increasingly tough world markets.
Mr Major has given his full backing to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, in his efforts to change the 'culture' in Whitehall in
support of industry.
Mr Lamont and his fellow Treasury ministers will not map out their strategy
for the Budget until their traditional weekend meeting at Chevening on
January 9.
Because of the introduction at the end of 1993 of a unified budget embracing
spending as well as taxation, there has been speculation in Whitehall that
the March package might be a 'holding operation'.
But with his longer-term future at the Treasury still uncertain Mr Lamont is
keen to make a significant impact in March.
He is expected to canvass the possibility of an extension of value added tax
to zero-rated items like domestic fuel, transport, new housebuilding and
newspapers to pay for wide-ranging tax reform elsewhere.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Government to help insurers meet cost of terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday bowed to pressure from the insurance industry and
agreed to meet part of the costs of bomb and other damage caused by
terrorists in mainland Britain.
Business will also be required to make a substantial contribution under new
arrangements, in a move which could sharply increase insurance costs for
policyholders who opt to take out cover against terrorism.
The Corporation of London, for example, will see premiums on its Pounds 5bn
portfolio of property in the City and Westminster double from its estimated
present level of about Pounds 2m by the end of the year. Premiums in areas
of the country deemed to be of lower risk may rise by as little as 10 per
cent.
The government agreed to back the new scheme after resisting pressure to
provide direct compensation to victims of bomb damage as it has done since
1969 in Northern Ireland.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the government had
'decided in principle to act as reinsurer of last resort'. He said the
government's involvement would be of limited duration and cost and 'should
cause minimum interference necessary with the working of the market.'
The announcement was widely welcomed. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the
Association of British Insurers, said: 'I know from the support we have
received that many people will be sleeping easier tonight'.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chief executive at the Corporation of London, said he
was 'delighted' but there was 'obviously concern about the impact (of the
cost) on City businesses'.
Insurers announced last month that they would be unable to continue to offer
cover against terrorism after their own reinsurers withdrew support in the
wake of claims of Pounds 800m after bomb attacks in London in April.
Under the new arrangements, details of which are still being worked on,
policyholders will be able to 'buy back' cover for terrorism. These
additional premiums will be channelled into a mutual pool to be reinsured by
the government. The cost of the 'buy back' will vary according to the sum
insured and the location of the property.
The Treasury and Mr John Major, the prime minister, were cautious about any
signal it might send to terrorists. But Mr Heseltine appears to have
persuaded them that the market alone could not deal with the problem.
Downing Street described the result as 'predominantly commercial'.
There was little suggestion in Whitehall that Mr Heseltine's description of
the measures as 'temporary' should be interpreted as involving a time limit.
Officials said only that the government did not want to help companies 'for
ever and a day'.
Mr Tony Baker of the ABI said there was no possibility of policyholders
being left 'high and dry' by any sudden suspension of the new arrangements.

<TEXT>
K MART, the US retailer, and El Puerto de Liverpool, the Mexican discount
retailer, are to form a joint retailing venture in Mexico, agencies report
from Mexico City.
The Troy, Michigan-based retailer declined to specify how much money it will
invest in the project but it is believed the companies plan an investment of
about Dollars 250m each.
The ultimate goal is to open 100 discount stores, according Mr Enrique
Bremond, El Puerto de Liverpool's board chairman.
Initially, the companies hope to open two or three pilot stores in Mexico
City sometime next year. The venture will create 36,000 jobs in Mexico, said
Mr Bremond.
El Puerto de Liverpool operates 17 full-line department stores in Mexico. K
mart operates 2,400 stores in the US and Canada and has equity interests in
Coles Meyer, 15 stores in Puerto Rico and 13 stores in Czechoslovakia.
The move is K mart's first foray into Latin America. Mexico promises to be a
lucrative discount retailing market and follows other recent ventures in the
sector.
Wal-Mart Stores of the US - one of K mart's rivals - has a similar venture
with Cifra SA, the Mexican retailing giant, while Price Club has teamed up
with Comercial Mexicana. Gigiante of Mexico also announced a venture last
month with the Fleming Cos.

<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Cariplo, the country's biggest savings bank, was locked in
talks on whether to buy into the Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial
services group.
The board meeting followed a late-night cabinet session on Sunday at which
Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, set out the government's final
terms for the sale of its 50 per cent stake in IMI.
The government has set a L3,800bn (Dollars 2.7bn) price on its holding,
based on the lower end of a valuation made by SG Warburg, the UK merchant
bank. A 42 per cent stake has been offered to Cariplo and Iccri, the
organisation linking Italy's savings banks, with the remaining 8 per cent to
be floated.
Rejection of the terms by Cariplo and Iccri would be a severe embarrassment
for the government. The IMI sale was a first step in a wide-ranging
privatisation plan, and the expected receipts form a major part of L7,000bn
expected from privatisation this year.
Bankers widely expected the proposal, which is the latest twist in tortuous
negotiations lasting two years, to be rejected by Cariplo and by Iccri,
whose managing board meets today.
Cariplo and the savings banks have expressed reservations about the price,
although somewhat lower than expected, and the payment terms.

The clothing manufacturer, demerged from the Courtaulds fibres and chemicals
group in 1990, will increase benefits and withdraw Pounds 32m (Dollars 48m)
in cash for the company's benefit, although more than Pounds 12m of this
will go in tax. These moves will cost Pounds 38m.

<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, France's leading chemicals group, has reached a co-operation
agreement with the Chinese government to build and operate two plants with
local partners, and to license technology there.
This is Rhone-Poulenc's first industrial investment in China, where it plans
to supply the fast-growing textiles industry with artifical fibres.
The largest plant, requiring an investment of up to FFr1bn (Pounds 120m) in
north-east China, is expected to start producing nylon salt (granulates
which turn into nylon when heated) in about three years, in partnership with
Sinopec, a Chinese state-owned group.
A smaller plant, to produce high-performance plastics, is scheduled to open
in two years near Shanghai, according to Mr Michel Maupu, Rhone-Poulenc's
vice-president in charge of fibres and polymers.
The licensing deal covers technology for producing nylon salt, to a
Chinese-owned company being set up in the central province of Henan for that
purpose.
The French group has been selling nylon salt to China for 18 years and now
exports FFr700m-worth annually there. It expects Chinese production of
synthetic fibres to grow from 1.65m tonnes in 1990 to 2.8m tonnes a year by
the end of the decade, as more textile and tyre production shifts to
low-labour-cost countries.

FT  22 DEC 92 / End of US embargo 'would revive Cuba': Position in Caribbean
holds great promise for export earnings, says Washington think tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA'S exports could recover quickly and strongly as soon as a market
economy was introduced and the US trade embargo lifted, according to a study
under way by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a leading
Washington think tank.
Mr Ernest Preeg, former chief economist of the US Agency for International
Development and author of the CSIS study, says Cuba has suffered terribly
from the cut-off in Soviet aid, which has reduced the island state's imports
from Dollars 8bn in 1989 to Dollars 2.2bn in 1992.
This has caused food and fuel shortages, but Mr Preeg says the most damaging
effect may be the strangling of machinery imports, which is causing a
cumulative crumbling of the Cuban industrial base.
Market reforms and a lifting of the US embargo could lead to a sharp revival
in export earnings, with little of the disruption that has accompanied such
reforms in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Tourism receipts and remittances from Cuban exiles, in particular, could
start to flow very quickly, Mr Preeg says, but Cuba's position in the
Caribbean basin holds great promise for earnings from other agricultural
exports as well as from assembly-type manufacturing.
Citrus exports, for example, could take off because Cuba has good trees, and
needs just one year's pesticides to upgrade its fruit from the lowest
concentrate quality to juice or even fresh fruit quality.
Mr Preeg warns that the US should not lift its embargo without human rights
and democratic reforms, since the end of the embargo alone would give the
Castro government between Dollars 800m and Dollars 1.1bn a year of
additional foreign exchange inflows, mostly from tourism and remittances.
However, he argues for a more active American diplomatic approach towards
Cuba, with the development of both carrots and sticks.
Critics of the US's Cuban policy complain that severe damage could be done
to Cuba's economic and social structures while Washington waits for the
Castro government to collapse.
Neither the Clinton administration nor the new Congress, however, is likely
to favour loosening the embargo. State television in Havana claimed a high
turnout in local government elections held on Sunday, news agencies report.
By mid-afternoon, nearly 94 per cent of the island's 7.5m registered voters
were said to have voted.
In the week leading up to the poll, the authorities launched a crackdown
against dissidents who said the elections left no room for opponents of
one-party Communist rule.
Voters in 13,865 constituencies in the election chose one municipal assembly
representative. The elections were the first stage of a new electoral
process which culminate in direct, parliamentary elections on February 24
within Cuba's one-party system.

No casualty figures were immediately available but APS reported 'deaths and

important armed group had reportedly been neutralised.'
The authorities have recently stepped up their battle to crush Islamic

Last week, troops killed 13 fundamentalists in a sweep of mountains near
Algiers and in two eastern suburbs.

COMMITMENTS by the US and EC to conclude a Uruguay Round trade deal by
mid-January will require endorsement from US President-elect Bill Clinton,
trade negotiators said in Geneva yesterday.
They said President George Bush and British prime minister Mr John Major,
while making an honest attempt to achieve a conclusion, had failed to take
note of the time needed to win agreement from the other 106 countries
negotiating the round.
One senior US official insisted that while negotiators remained ready to
settle the Uruguay Round, which has made faltering progress for the past six
years, the obstacles remained at a political level back in national
capitals: 'I don't see any change in circumstances between last week and
Christmas that are likely to make a mid-January conclusion possible.'
Another official argued that Gatt negotiators 'could not see the outgoing
Bush administration being able to make the sort of concessions that would
make an agreement possible.'
Mr Clinton has still to name his senior trade negotiator, though it is
assumed he will this week.
A senior EC official, who argued that with the right political impetus from
Washington and Brussels the EC and the US could settle outstanding
differences, insisted that neither President Bush nor Mr Major had taken
proper account at the weekend of the views of other countries negotiating
the Uruguay Round: 'We are not living in a world where the US and the EC can
assume a deal can be rubber-stamped by others. At the very least, they will
have to do some work on the issues back in their own capitals.
'President Bush and Mr Major have made an honest attempt to achieve a
conclusion, but have underestimated the resistance of the multilateral
system.'
The comments follow a rather gloomy top-level stock-taking meeting at the
end of last week, at which Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, brought talks to an inconclusive halt ahead
of Christmas, commenting that 'now, more than ever, we are engaged in a race
against time.' He called for a further 'stock-taking' meeting on January 15,
which would keep pressure on negotiators, and test the authority of this
weekend's commitments from Washington.
Many countries represented at the meeting voiced frustration at slow
progress in recent weeks. Others criticised the US for demanding that a
number of issues - including anti-dumping rules and proposals for protection
of intellectual property - be reopened.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Old Brazil also faces impeachment: The political old guard
being shaken out with Collor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE impeachment process of Brazil's suspended President Fernando Collor
reaches its climax today with a trial in the senate, many politicians
present will be reflecting on their own futures.
The scandal, in which Mr Collor is implicated in a multi-million-dollar
corruption network, has led to a more radical political shake-up than the
end of military rule in 1985, and few of the old guard have been spared in
the fallout.
Not only is there uncertainty over what will emerge from a referendum on the
political system next April, but almost all leading contenders for the 1994
elections and traditional power brokers are on the wane, discredited by
association with Mr Collor or personal entanglements with corruption.
Mr Collor's fate will be determined today by the country's 81 senators in a
marathon 16-hour session presided over by the head of the supreme court. A
two-thirds vote - 54 senators - is needed to impeach him. Mr Collor spent
yesterday closeted with lawyers deciding whether to appear personally to
defend himself.
The suspense gripping the capital on the eve of the judgment was heightened
by claims of senators that they had received anonymous death threats warning
them against voting for impeachment. Added to that was the news that Mr
Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's alleged front-man, had fled the country with
his family in his private jet to Seville. Mr Mauricio Correa, the justice
minister, has ordered a police investigation.
While the Collor scandal has not stopped corruption it has made it harder
for corrupt politicians to be elected and has devalued the old Brazilian
adage rouba mas faz - he steals but he gets things done. Congress now has
access to bank records and impunity is no longer guaranteed.
Mr Bolivar Lamounier, a political scientist from the Sao Paulo Institute of
Socio-Economic Studies, says: 'This is a historic moment in Brazilian
politics. We have a chance that comes perhaps once a century to completely
reform the system and to allow a new generation of politicians to emerge,
less wedded to the old ways.'
A citizens' action group has been formed to call for the impeachment of all
senators and congressmen on the basis that all Brazil's politicians are
corrupt.
Leading presidential hopeful Mr Orestes Quercia, 54-year-old leader of the
centrist Democratic Movement, Brazil's largest party, was the obvious next
target. A man of humble beginnings, he now has a bulging campaign chest and
a personal fortune estimated by investigative magazine Veja at Dollars 52m.
His increases in wealth coincided with spells in office, particularly as
governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest state, from 1986 to 1990.
For the past two months, Mr Quercia has been embroiled in a damaging
controversy surrounding his authorisation of a Dollars 330m purchase of
Israeli equipment at inflated prices and the privatisation of Vasp, the Sao
Paulo state airline.
His protege, Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, the current governor of Sao Paulo, is
also in disgrace for the mishandling of a recent prison riot in which 111
inmates were massacred by state police.
All those linked to the Collor camp have paid dearly for their loyalty. Mr
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, 65-year-old governor of Bahia and long-time
'godfather' of the Brazilian political scene, has lost his influence since
failing to support impeachment.
Mr Leonel Brizola, 70-year-old firebrand populist and governor of Rio, has
seen his grip over Rio slip so much that his candidate in the recent
elections for mayor failed even to make it to the run-off. He faces open
mutiny from his own state police, who last week arrested his daughter for
alleged cocaine possession.
Tragedy has also played a part. Within days of the impeachment vote, Mr
Ulysses Guimaraes, the grand old man of Brazilian politics, died in a
helicopter accident after 44 years as a congressman.
One of the younger generation to move to the forefront with the fall of the
old guard is 43-year-old Tasso Jereissati, leader of the Social Democrats.
Widely respected for his work as governor of the poverty-stricken state of
Ceara, Mr Jereissati says: 'I hope as a result of the Collor experience we
will now have a more rational succession of power based not on charismatic
leaders or messianic speeches but on programmes and administrative
capability.'
Municipal elections last month showed that the main beneficiary has been the
left, the Workers' Party taking four state capitals. Mr Lus Inacio da Silva,
its leader and near winner in the last presidential elections, is the only
leading political figure untainted by corruption and events of this year,
and many businessmen are now ordering assessments of the likely actions of a
left-wing government.
On the other side of the spectrum the elections also saw the spectacular
re-emergence of Mr Paulo Maluf, the authoritarian former governor of Sao
Paulo and leader of the right-wing Democratic Social Party. Easily elected
mayor of Sao Paulo, he has become the main focus of conservative forces.
Much now rests on the referendum in April. The Collor scandal is thought to
have discredited presidentialism, particularly as only one civilian
president has completed his mandate in the last 67 years, and shifted the
focus of political aspiration to more parliamentary politics.

China's economic boom this year has forced officials to come up with a new
definition for 'well-off', reflecting climbing living standards across the
country, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The official Xinhua news agency said yesterday the new state standard for
well-off urban residents set annual per capita income at Yn2,380 (Dollars
410) and the average life span at 70 years.
The average well-off urban resident would have at least nine years of
schooling and a paid two-week vacation every year.
In rural areas, the average well-off person would make a per capita income
of Yn1,100, spend Yn70 a year on clothes, own a television and live in a
village with at least one telephone.
Xinhua said that some 57 per cent of Chinese people already qualified as
well off.

Prices this month have risen 0.1 per cent, forcing the annual average down

Environmental groups reacted with dismay yesterday at the decision of the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm, to
finance a Dollars 500m hydroelectric dam on the upper reaches of Chile's
biggest river, the Bio Bio, writes Leslie Crawford in Santiago.
The 450MW Pangue dam is scheduled to come on stream in 1997, when it will
supply 12 per cent of Chile's total energy needs. It is being built by
Endesa, a privatised utility.
The Bio Bio Action Group, a coalition of US and Chilean ecologists, said the
IFC loan 'violated all the World Bank's environmental guidelines'.
It was particularly critical of the IFC's decision to back the project while
studies on the downstream impact of the dam were pending.
In Washington, an IFC spokesman said the corporation was confident further
work would mitigate the power station's effect on the water levels of the
Bio Bio.

accused them of operating their computer system in a way that unreasonably

The department said it reached settlements with United Air Lines and USAir,

The other airlines are American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, Trans World

PLACER Dome, the Canadian resources group, Minorco, the Luxembourg-based
investment company, and its parent, the Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa, have bought stakes in two leading copper projects in Chile.
Minorco yesterday said Minera Mantos Minorco had completed the acquisition
of a third of a big Chilean copper project, Collahuasi. Minera Mantos
Minorco, a new company 50.1 per cent owned by Minorco with the rest owned by
Empresa Minera de Mantos Blacos, in turn controlled by Anglo American, is to
pay about Dollars 190m to acquire the stake from Chevron, the US oil group.
Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge, share equally the other two thirds of
Collahuasi deposit.
Minorco believes Collahuasi's start-up date will be 1996-97.
In a separate deal, Placer Dome has paid Dollars 100m to Outokumpu Copper
Resources of Finland for a 50 per cent interest in the Zaldivar copper
deposit in the Atacama desert. Placer Dome has also agreed to provide loan
financing of up to Dollars 400m towards the estimated Dollars 500m cost of
constructing a mine and treatment facility.
The partners expect to complete Zaldivar's feasibility studies by the middle
of next year. If they decide to proceed with the project, the mine is
scheduled to begin production in 1995.
The acquisitions underscore Chile's leading position as a Mecca for mining
multinationals. The Chilean Copper Commission, Cochilco, estimates mining
companies will invest almost Dollars 5bn before the end of the decade to tap
the country's vast mineral wealth. Nowhere else in the world are there so
many projects close to fruition.

<TEXT>
CIGA, the heavily-indebted international hotels group controlled by the Aga
Khan, is selling majority control of its Italian hotel-owning arm in an
eleventh hour attempt to reduce borrowings in time for a year-end deadline
with its bankers.
However, the L301bn (Dollars 214m) sale of 51 per cent of Ciga Immobiliare,
the subsidiary owning the group's Italian hotels, is still subject to
agreement from creditor banks before taking effect.
Ciga is selling the stake to Situr, a fast-growing private-sector Italian
property development and entertainment group, which already has a variety of
travel and tourism interests. Situr will buy into Ciga Immobiliare via a
capital increase.
Separately, Ciga will purchase the 49 per cent share in Ciga Immobiliare
Sardegna, its Sardinian real estate subsidiary, currently owned by Fimpar,
the Aga Khan's listed holding company. CIS will then be sold on to the Aga
Khan and Situr.
The Aga Khan, who was the main force behind the tourist development of
Sardinia's Costa Smeralda where the CIS assets are based, will buy 80 per
cent of the company, with the remainder going to Situr. Fimpar will make
L95bn from the sale, while the remaining proceeds will go to Ciga
Immobiliare, by then majority-owned by Situr.
The complex transactions should reduce Ciga's group debt from almost
L1,000bn to L330bn. The reduction will come through the cash injection from
Situr and by the removal from Ciga's balance sheet of borrowings by Ciga
Immobiliare. A further slice of debt will be lifted following the Aga Khan's
agreement to convert into equity L61bn of Ciga convertible bonds by the end
of this year.
However, the deal with Situr hinges on agreement by Ciga's bankers to
restructure its remaining debts from short to longer-term maturities.

FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo cuts N Sea holdings - Shares rally as
rationalisation programme continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent oil and gas exploration company, announced the sale
of Dollars 145.5m of assets in the North Sea and Indonesia yesterday, taking
the value of disposals this year to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 980m).
The company agreed to sell its 8.52 per cent interest in the T-block fields
in the North Sea to a subsidiary of Murphy Oil Corporation in the US for
Dollars 100m.
It also sold other smaller interests in the North Sea and Indonesia as part
of a programme of rationalising its asset portfolio and selling off many of
the peripheral developments it acquired with the takeover of Ultramar a year
ago.
The company indicated yesterday that it will continue its disposal plans
next year when it expects to achieve sales of more than Dollars 150m.
Lasmo sold off Ultramar's downstream refining interests in North America
earlier this year for Dollars 1.13bn.
Mr Chris Greentree, Lasmo's chairman, said the latest asset disposals will
reduce the company's debt to equity ratio by some 10 per cent. Analysts
estimate Lasmo's gearing level to be about 85 per cent.
The company's shares were stronger yesterday as the City renewed its hopes
that Lasmo would not cut its dividend in spite of weak oil prices and high
capital expenditure. The shares rose 9p to 151p.
Mr Greentree said the company will cut its capital expenditure by 35 per
cent next year from Pounds 132m to Pounds 90m against a background of weak
oil prices. Lasmo will also slash its development spending from Pounds 326m
to Pounds 240m.
'The oil price is at its lowest for 20 years and all our exploration and
production and development projects have to meet low oil price criteria or
we just won't do them,' Mr Greentree said.
Lasmo has built in a price of Dollars 19.50 per barrel for an average oil
price on which to base its plans next year.
Lasmo shares have been extremely weak in recent months as the City became
concerned about this year's uncovered dividend and persistent rumours about
problems the company had uncovered at Ultramar.
But Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court expects oil production at the company
to grow by 40 per cent up to 1996: 'which means the company can grow out of
its financial difficulties,' he said.
Lasmo says its oil output will increase from 185,000 barrels a day (b/d) to
190,000 b/d next year.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Life house hit by record Lautro fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUTRO, the life assurance regulator, yesterday imposed its highest-ever
fine - Pounds 120,000 plus costs - on Scottish Widows, the life company.
The fine concerns Scottish Widows' failure to monitor the advice given by
its appointed representatives to about 20,000 policyholders since February
1989. Lautro found that proper 'factfinds' detailing clients' needs had not
been kept, making it impossible to tell whether the products sold had been
appropriate.
The company has been ordered to contact all the clients affected and to pay
full compensation if inappropriate advice is disclosed. No cases of wrong
advice have yet been discovered and no compensation has been paid.
Lautro's previous highest fine, Pounds 100,000, was levied last month on
Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, after two of its tied
agencies went out of business. Fines of Pounds 50,000 or more have also been
levied this year on Commercial Union, General Accident, Norwich Union and
London &amp; Manchester Assurance.
Lautro denied that the fine suggested any 'toughening' of its stance, but
reflected the severity of Scottish Widows' offence and the number of
policyholders affected.
Mr Newton Scott, general manager of marketing and sales for Scottish Widows,
said: 'The effective management of appointed representatives is an
industry-wide issue and we believe that our policyholders and our business
will benefit from the comprehensive review of procedures we have
undertaken.'
The company had already cut its tied agents from 180 to about 100 as a
commercial decision before the Lautro move, but remains committed to
distribution through that channel, which accounts for about 6 per cent of
its business.
Mr Scott added that Scottish Widows remained the UK's fifth-largest life
assurance company, with a weekly net income of about Pounds 25m. Its size
and strength would maintain its position with independent advisers, which
provide most of its business.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of the Consumers' Association's money group, said:
'It's welcome that Lautro is imposing fines of this magnitude, because it
should encourage providers to take compliance much more seriously.'

FT  22 DEC 92 / Ofgas threatens British Gas with legal action over 'silence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS and its regulator, Ofgas, were heading for another row yesterday
when the regulator threatened to take legal action to extract information
from the company if it is not forthcoming by the middle of January.
British Gas and Ofgas were due to publish a joint report this week on the
implications of hiving off British Gas's pipelines business into a separate
subsidiary. Ofgas has raised several issues with the company but has been
awaiting a response for at least six weeks.
Mr John Dorkin, deputy director-general of Ofgas, said: 'If the situation is
not resolved before mid January, we will start having to issue legal
directives - which we don't want to do.'
Last week, Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, called for British
Gas's pipelines to be divested to introduce true competition to the UK gas
market. British Gas called his suggestions 'inappropriate'.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is reviewing the structure of British
Gas and the UK gas market. But as part of an earlier commitment to the
Office of Fair Trading, British Gas is to place its pipelines and storage
arm - more than 85 per cent of its assets - into a subsidiary within the
company by next October.
'Whatever the MMC decides, we still have to work together with the company
to achieve a new transportation regime by October,' said Mr Dorkin. 'We've
agreed a timetable, but now that's been knocked off course and I'm not sure
if they're still co-operating.'
Ofgas fears that because of British Gas's irritation over Ofgas's public
statements on the future shape of the company, it might refuse to co-operate
altogether.
'I would have thought they'd be bending over backwards to show the MMC
they're co-operating with us,' Mr Dorkin said, 'instead we've met with blank
silence for five to six weeks.'
The joint document to be issued by the company and its regulator should lay
out how British Gas intends to operate its pipelines at arm's length from
the rest of its business.
Ofgas also said yesterday that British Gas should appoint an organisation to
conduct a six-month review of its procedures for handling complaints from
its 18m customers. The regulator said British Gas must appoint an
organisation to undertake a six-month review of its complaints handling
operation.
British Gas was unavail-able for comment last night. North Sea contractors
warned yesterday that Pounds 5bn in investment and more than 30,000 jobs
might be at risk if the government imposed any restriction on gas as part of
its energy review. The group said uncertainty over the future of gas was
beginning to affect investment decisions.

FT  22 DEC 92 / Ice-cream makers' tied trade likely to be suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is expected tomorrow to order Langnese-Iglo and
Scholler Lebensmittel, Germany's two largest ice-cream makers, to suspend
for five years arrangements which oblige many German retail outlets to sell
only the two companies' products, writes Guy de Jonquieres, Consumer
Industries Editor.
The Commission's competition directorate, which has been investigating the
arrangements for nine months, has concluded that they violate Article 85 of
the Rome Treaty, which outlaws restrictive trade practices.
The expected decision would be a victory for Mars, the US food group which
has for more than two years waged a legal campaign to open more European
distribution channels for its ice-cream bars.
It also emerged yesterday that the British Office of Fair Trading is
inquiring into the legality of arrangements whereby ice-cream manufacturers
supply freezer cabinets to retailers on condition they are not used to stock
competing products.
The OFT began its inquiry in September, following complaints from Mars and
other companies. These were directed principally against Wall's, part of the
Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, which is Europe's biggest ice-cream maker and
owner of Langnese.
The OFT has sought information from all the main suppliers of ice-cream in
Britain, but has yet to decide whether to open a formal investigation.
In March the Commission ordered Langnese and Scholler to lift until the end
of the year their exclusive outlet arrangements in Germany, pending an
inquiry.
The Commission said the arrangements would cause Mars 'serious and
irreparable damage' by excluding it from the German market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina and stability in the Balkans
darkened yesterday as Serbian nationalists under President Slobodan
Milosevic led presidential and parliamentary elections.
Despite scanty and conflicting reports of election returns, opposition
leaders privately conceded that Serbian President Milosevic appeared to have
a commanding lead in his bid for re-election. He looked set to surpass the
50.01 per cent required to avoid a run-off against Yugoslav Prime Minister
Milan Panic, the wealthy Belgrade-born Californian.
The massive surge of electoral support for ultranationalism threatens
Serbia's ethnic minorities, who make up one-third of the population of 9.8m.
Ethnic Albanians, Hungarians and Moslems face even greater risk that 'ethnic
cleasing' will spread to Serbia.
If the trend of the preliminary and unofficial results continues, the
Socialists (renamed Communists) with their ultranationalist allies, the
Serbian Radical Party, will have a comfortable majority in the Serbian
parliament. 'Their lead makes remote the possibility of Milosevic leaving
office without violence,' said a diplomat.
Chosen by Mr Milosevic as his favourite 'opposition politician', Mr Vojislav
Seselj, president of the Radicals, also commands a party militia.
He has called for ethnic minorities and politically suspect Serbs to be
expelled from Serbia. International human rights organisations have cited Mr
Seselj for brutal crimes committed by his paramilitaries in Croatia and
Bosnia. Early results project his party will gain 25-30 per cent of the 250
seats.
He is almost certain to be joined in parliament by Mr Zeljko Raznatovic,
alias Arkan, a notorious Belgrade crime boss who commands a fierce
paramilitary unit known as the Tigers. He was standing in the Serbian
province of Kosovo, where Albanians who make up 93 per cent of the 2.1m
population boycotted the poll. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of
state, recently said that Mr Raznatovic and Mr Seselj should be tried before
a proposed war crimes tribunal.
The apparent edge of the nationalists came amid mounting charges of election
fraud and manipulation.
Mr Panic's office yesterday said it would demand a fresh election. Foreign
observers have lambasted the campaign as grossly unfair, citing the role
played by Television Serbia, which Mr Milosevic controls and Mr Seselj
reportedly visits every day.
Mr Milosevic has whipped up fears that the west is conspiring against
Serbia. His message of defiance, in conservative and increasingly isolated
Serbia, has found fertile ground.
Independent observers met yesterday to decide if complaints of election
irregularities constituted systematic fraud at the hands of Mr Milosevic's
minions in local electoral commissions.
If the international community deems the election results legitimate, it has
warned it will step up pressure on Serbia. US President George Bush and
Britain's Prime Minister John Major agreed in Washington at the weekend to
press for tougher sanctions to stop the war in Bosnia. But the mechanisms
are limited.
In Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital seen as an opposition
stronghold, many feared their future in a Serbia controlled by nationalists,
certain to provoke a tougher response from the west.
This is likely to heighten xenophobia in Serbia, even among Serbs who oppose
the Socialists.

AT LEAST 54 people were killed when a DC-10 carrying 327 Dutch holidaymakers
and 13 crew to Portugal crashed while trying to land in heavy rain and winds
at the Algarve town of Faro.
The aircraft, operated by Martinair, a charter airline partly owned by KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines and the Dutch transport group Nedlloyd, burst into
flames and broke in two on impact.
Airport officials in Faro, the main city of Portugal's Algarve coastal
region, said 54 people were known to have died, while 124 were injured.
Most of the people on board were Dutch nationals.
In Amsterdam, airline officials said the cause of the crash was not known.
First reports suggested the aircraft had been hit by lightning. The pilot is
reported to have survived.
The 'black box' containing flight data has been located and will be examined
by Portuguese and Dutch investigators. Passengers interviewed by Dutch
television said the pilot had made two attempts to land before the fatal
approach.

A TERRORIST attack on a deputy from Greece's ruling New Democracy party has
left the government awkwardly placed for today's parliamentary vote on the
1993 budget, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
New Democracy in effect lost its one-seat majority in the 300-member chamber
yesterday after Mr Eleftherios Papadimitriou, a backbencher who sat on the
parliamentary budget committee, was shot in the leg by a gunman who stopped
the politician's car in an Athens suburb. Mr Papadimitriou was reported to
be in a stable condition after surgery, but it was not clear whether he
would be able to take part in the vote.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, is already under pressure
from prominent deputies who object to his efforts to introduce structural
reform. He has tried to rally New Democracy by claiming the budget debate
amounts to a vote of confidence in his government.

The vote in the republic, the last official ally of Serbia, was considered a

But Radio Montenegro said that in the capital, Podgorica, which has a

TOTAL, the French oil and gas group, has won control of more than 20 per
cent of the Hungarian gas distribution market.
The group won a sealed bid auction against other western oil companies for
two of Hungary's five state-owned gas distributors, Egaz and Kogaz, which
supply the west of the country.
The price is confidential, but the deal gives Total control of deliveries of
70,000 tonnes of liquefied gas a year. The other five distributors have been
sold to the Dutch group Pamgaz, which operates as Primagaz.
Hachette, the French publishing group, and CEP Communication, a publisher of
business journals, yesterday sold Le Nouvel Economiste, a loss-making
business magazine for FFr60m (Dollars 11.22m) in the latest change of
ownership in the French press industry.
The buyer is Capital Media, a privately owned publisher of specialist
magazines which will invest another FFr60m into the venture. Le Nouvel
Economiste was 65 per cent owned by Hachette and 35 per cent by CEP
Communication, a subsidiary of the Havas media group.

SPAIN has secured commitments from Kuwait to ensure the emirate's
disinvestment from Spain does not cause the collapse of companies there,
Reuter reports from Kuwait.
Secretary of state for economy Mr Pedro Perez held talks in Kuwait with top
government officials after Kuwait's Spanish holding company Grupo Torras
went into receivership last week citing losses of over Dollars 4bn.
He said Kuwait had agreed to secure loans made to companies in which Torras
held shares and to set up a committee to co-ordinate activities of the
various firms.
The official Kuna news agency said the two sides had signed an agreement
aimed at supporting Torras companies.
Spain was anxious that an abrupt withdrawal of Kuwaiti investment could
cripple a number of Torras firms, three of which are already in
receivership.
Mr Perez did not specify how long the Kuwait Investment Authority, parent of
the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, had pledged to secure bank loans
to the companies, or the sums involved.
He added that agreement had been reached to manage for the time being
Torras's 39 per cent owned chemicals group Ercros which suspended payments
in July.

FT  21 DEC 92 / OECD sees Italy's growth rate rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN economic growth will begin to accelerate towards the end of next
year if the government succeeds in bringing Italy's fiscal deficit under
control while keeping the lid on wage inflation, the OECD said yesterday.
Restoring confidence in the lira, by ensuring that the government's fiscal
austerity measures are fully implemented, is the route to economic growth,
the Paris-based organisation says in a cautiously optimistic report.
The OECD expects Italy's economic growth rate to slip to 0.8 per cent next
year. But an export- and investment-led recovery should deliver a 1.7 per
cent growth rate in 1994.
The forecast depends on the government overcoming domestic resistance to
budget cuts in order to reduce the fiscal deficit to 10.2 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1993.
A successful budget consolidation should boost confidence, enable the lira
to re-enter the ERM and reduce Italian interest rates over the coming year
in line with expected cuts in German interest rates, the report says.
Tight monetary conditions, tax increases, the abolition of wage indexation
and a freeze on public sector pay until the end of 1993, should all dampen
the impact of the lira's recent devaluation on inflation, the OECD says.
Exports are expected to grow by 6.1 per cent next year and 5.9 per cent in
1994, outstripping the growth in imports and pushing the trade account into
a modest surplus in 1994.

THE US and Russia have made 'real progress' in talks on additional cuts in
long-range nuclear weapons but are not yet ready to sign a Start-2 treaty,
President George Bush said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin surprised officials in Washington last week
when he said a Start-2 agreement was in hand and would be signed before Mr
Bush handed over power to President-elect Bill Clinton next month.
'I can tell you it's not agreed totally. We've made some real progress,' Mr
Bush said after holding a telephone conversation with Mr Yeltsin.
He did not elaborate on what progress had been made in negotiations, but US
officials sought to dampen speculation that Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin might
meet in Alaska to sign an accord early next month.
Start-2 would eliminate all land-based multiple warhead missiles, the most
dangerous in either country's nuclear arsenal, and slash both sides' total
stockpiles of warheads by up to two-thirds.

MOST OF Latin America experienced strong growth and greater price stability
during 1992, with the main exception of Brazil, which continues to buck the
regional trend towards recovery, the United Nation's Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean said yesterday.
Six countries - Argentina, Chile, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay
and Venezuela - achieved real growth rates of 6 per cent or more. Brazil,
Barbados, Peru and Haiti suffered downturns.
The depth of the Brazilian recession acted as a drag on the performance of
the region as a whole. ECLAC estimated regional GDP to have grown by 2.4 per
cent in 1992, compared with 3.5 per cent last year. Without Brazil, 1992
growth was 4.3 per cent.
Six countries reduced inflation to single digits; another 16 countries kept
consumer price rises below 20 per cent. Only Brazil continued to struggle
with triple-digit inflation.
Mr Gert Rosenthal, ECLAC's secretary general, said the region's economic
progress was 'no mean feat' considering the recession and uncertainty
gripping Latin America's trading partners in the industrialised world. He
noted that regional exports - totalling Dollars 126bn (Pounds 82.8bn) in
1992 - continued to grow despite declining terms of trade for Latin
America's main commodities.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Risk and reward in foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ground rules of US foreign policy were once readily grasped. In military
terms, the constant Soviet threat made the world bipolar and dangerous. The
Pentagon could never relax. Economically, however, the world was unipolar.
The US felt secure because no nation came anywhere near challenging its
industrial or financial muscle.
As Mr Bill Clinton prepares to assume the presidency, these polarities have
reversed. With the collapse of Soviet communism, the US is unchallenged as
the world's sole military superpower. Yet the growing industrial strength of
Europe and Japan (and soon, perhaps, China) has created a tense, multipolar
economic world in which the main players seem unable to conclude even the
relatively unambitious Uruguay Round trade talks. This radical reshaping of
the foreign policy landscape creates great opportunities for Mr Clinton, but
also serious risks.
The heartwarming presence of US troops in Somalia is the most potent
illustration of the opportunities lying ahead. For the first time in recent
US history (perhaps ever), a sizeable military intervention overseas was
justified on purely moral grounds; troops were committed not in defence of
US national interests, or to influence the strategic balance of power in
Africa, but simply to help combat starvation.
This kind of intervention has always been favoured by a small cadre of
foreign policy idealists, sometimes dubbed 'neo-Wilsonians' after Woodrow
Wilson, the president who tried but failed to persuade the US to underpin an
ethical world order after the 1914-18 war. But in recent decades, the cold
war played into the hands of the opposing school of 'balance of power'
realists. In the fight to contain communism, the argument went, the US had
to put its strategic interests first. It thus propped up a stream of despots
from the Shah of Iran to Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines.
However, with the cold war over and US military strength unchallenged, there
is no good reason why idealism should not play a larger role in foreign
policy. There is no longer any excuse for coddling tyrants or making deals
with foreign powers that are inconsistent with US domestic values.
Indeed, the domestic enthusiasm for the intervention in Somalia suggests
that, in the absence of the communist threat, the most reliable way to
sustain public support for large military expenditures may be to base
foreign policy on values the public holds dear. In today's changed world, Mr
Clinton is thus being a realist, as much as an idealist, in pledging to make
the promotion of democracy and human rights the guiding principles for
overseas interventions.
The risks ahead mainly reflect the tensions resulting from the US's relative
economic decline. This has led a vociferous band of 'economic nationalists'
to argue that the US should abandon the broadly laissez-faire doctrines of
the last four decades and 'put the interests of its own industries first'.
The general idea is that the US public sector should join the battle for
global commercial supremacy by heavily subsidising strategic industries,
pouring huge sums into commercial research and development and retaliating
unilaterally against nations that Washington deems guilty of unfair trading
practices.
The degree to which Mr Clinton buys these arguments is uncertain. During the
campaign he talked ominously of 'mobilising' the nation for global economic
competition. He has since fulfilled his promise to create a new White House
economic security council (although the word security was wisely dropped
from its title.) And he has nominated Ms Laura Tyson of the University of
California as chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. Ms Tyson is
sceptical of free market economics and advocates an aggressive industrial
policy, involving subsidies for high-technology sectors.
The economic nationalists believe the US is in relative economic decline
because it has lacked a national strategy. This is mostly a misreading of
history. The whole point of the liberal international economic order created
after the second world war was to create conditions in which Japan and
Europe could stage a lasting industrial recovery. That recovery was
inevitably going to mean relative decline for the US. But had the US tried
to keep other countries poor, it would also be much poorer in absolute terms
today.
The liberal capitalist vision is of economic competition between individuals
and companies, not of competition between nations per se. Small countries
can flout the rules and become economic nationalists without endangering the
larger liberal order. But if the US took this route, the results could be
catastrophic. If the US started to subsidise strategic industries heavily
and play God in trade disputes, Europe and Japan would feel obliged to
follow suit. There is no obvious point at which such overt economic warfare
would stop.
It is easy to find flaws in free market policies. On any given occasion,
interventions favouring US industries are likely to look superior. Over
time, however, a global descent into economic nationalism would cause
economic relations between nations to deteriorate, ultimately increasing the
risk of military conflict. If Mr Clinton were to get his economics wrong, he
could ruin any chance of creating a new world order based on democracy and
respect for human rights.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Monday Interview: Rocket man flies new path - Leonid Kuchma,
Ukrainian prime minister, speaks to Chrystia Freeland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no road back,' says Mr Leonid Kuchma, the recently appointed
Ukrainian prime minister, late one evening in his dark, wood-panelled
office. 'There are no alternatives to the market and even if someone were to
try to recreate the old system it would lead to a complete catastrophe.'
Mr Kuchma is the first Ukrainian prime minster to stress the virtues of the
free market, and is steering a package of radical decrees through the
government which could finally begin the painful process of building a new
economic system.
Yet the driving force behind Ukraine's reforms is not a smooth graduate of
western universities. Instead, as the former director of Iuzhmash, the
world's largest rocket factory, Mr Kuchma is a product of the powerful,
tightly controlled Soviet weapons industry.
One clue to Mr Kuchma's remarkable transformation from missile maker to
market builder may lie in his rural roots. As a peasant's son growing up in
central Ukraine, he was surrounded by the dispossessed kulaks, the
once-prosperous peasants who made their nation the bread basket of Europe.
Sixty years ago Joseph Stalin starved 6m of these stubborn and independent
farmers before he succeeded in his drive to impose agricultural
collectivisation in Ukraine. But in the person of Mr Kuchma, the kulaks may
have the last laugh.
Does he want to rebuild the Ukrainian kulak class?
'Yes, absolutely. They were the people who wanted to work and knew how to
work. We must create conditions so that a man can earn money honestly and
now not be afraid of earning money,' Mr Kuchma says. 'Above all, we must
rely on a new class of small property owners.'
In many ways, Mr Kuchma thinks like his frugal, hard-working forefathers.
His conversion to the market does not stem from any theory of capitalism but
rather from a blunt assessment of the bottom line. In Mr Kuchma's view,
Ukraine simply cannot afford not to reform.
'Soon we will become cannibals and begin to eat ourselves,' he says of
Ukraine's disastrous public finances. 'Our national income is falling, yet
public expenditure is rising catastrophically. Everyone must understand that
we have no way out of this crisis other than to reform.'
This realisation was singularly lost on Mr Vitold Fokin, the former head of
central planning in Ukraine whom Mr Kuchma replaced as prime minister in
October. Under Mr Fokin's stewardship the government issued more than
Rbs900bn in cheap credits to the state sector, driving the budget deficit to
more than 40 per cent of gross national product and pushing inflation to a
monthly rate of more than 30 per cent in 1992.
Mr Kuchma's goal is to bring inflation down to an annual 5 to 6 per cent by
the end of 1993.
To do that he and Mr Viktor Pinzenyk, the minister of the economy and
architect of Ukraine's reforms, are piecing together a programme which aims
to combine stabilisation with economic restructuring.
To stabilise the economy Mr Kuchma is pushing through several government
decrees. He intends to liberalise most prices and to stop the practice of
financing the budget deficit by printing money, and thus bring the deficit
down to 9 per cent of GNP in 1993. He wants to restrict credit to the state
sector and bring interest rates closer in line with inflation. A decree
would also curb welfare payments by targeting the country's most needy
groups.
'We understand perfectly well that you can do anything you like with
financial policies alone,' Mr Kuchma says. 'But if the economy does not
begin to work from below, if the enterprises do not begin to work, then that
will not ever yield any real results.'
Mr Kuchma is pushing for rapid privatisation at all levels, including a
decree which, for the first time in Ukraine, will introduce full private
ownership over a portion of agricultural land. The government is calling for
'forced' privatisation of the retail and service sector and is backing an
International Finance Corporation pilot privatisation programme in the
western Ukrainian city of Lviv.
At a slower pace, Mr Kuchma also wants to privatise Ukraine's state
enterprises and plans to convert them into joint stock companies as an
initial step. The cabinet has already revoked a leasing scheme - through
which workers could lease their enterprises for a token fee - which allowed
industrial collectives, often in co-operation with managers, to block
privatisation.
In the past, Ukraine's nascent private sector has been smothered by an
onerous taxation system under which taxes could exceed 100 per cent of
profits. Government decrees bringing the tax on profits down to 30 per cent
and value-added tax down to 20 per cent are currently before the cabinet.
Will the departure of Russia's leading reformer, Mr Yegor Gaidar, put the
brakes on Ukrainian plans? Not in Mr Kuchma's view.
He has made it a priority to seek an economic rapprochement with Russia, his
main concern being to restore trade links with Ukraine's most important
partner and to negotiate favourable prices for the Russian oil on which
Ukraine is dependent.
But despite Russia's importance for Ukrainian trade, Mr Kuchma is confident
that Ukraine can pursue an independent economic course. He is also convinced
that Ukraine must launch its reforms before receiving significant aid from
the west.
'We must hope that when our economy begins to stabilise, the west will then
believe that Ukraine is serious about reform,' Mr Kuchma says. He believes
that before wooing the west he must first win over his own people.
He has launched a campaign to convince Ukrainians 'that what we want for
them is good and not bad, and that there is no other way out of the crisis'.
He says he will seek a social contract with all Ukrainian political parties
and trade unions which would place a moratorium on demonstrations and
strikes in the inevitably contentious first months of reform.
Yet Mr Kuchma is also aware that the strongest opposition to reform is
likely to be not on the streets of Kiev but in the intimidating, granite
buildings which house the government.
In the short term, parliament, which has restricted its own right to pass
economic legislation and granted Mr Kuchma sweeping economic powers for the
next six months, seems to be prepared to back the government, although Mr
Kuchma fears this honeymoon will be short-lived.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president, could pose a more immediate threat and
one which Mr Kuchma has delicately sought to neutralise. Mr Kravchuk fought
Mr Kuchma's candidacy and appears to resent his growing power. Mr Kuchma has
held out a co-operative hand in response.
At the moment, the prime minister's fiercest opposition comes from a third
force, potentially more dangerous than the president or parliament. Known
colloquially as the mafia, this powerful group straddles the government and
private sectors. Mr Kuchma describes it as 'a social class which is
parasitic on the very sick economic body of Ukraine'.
Having launched his premiership with a tough anti-corruption campaign, Mr
Kuchma shrugs off Kiev rumours that the mafia poses a direct threat to his
life. The round-faced, diminutive man who made his career building missiles
seems undaunted both by warnings about the mafia and the prospect of
populist opposition to his reforms.
'This is an elementary battle for power, that is clear and understandable.
But the reform process has already begun and I think that it cannot be
reversed,' Mr Kuchma says. 'After all, today, in the Ukrainian budget we
have nothing apart from a gaping hole.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Common thread of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The separation of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, we are told, will have
no constitutional consequences for the UK. Some people have found it
difficult to believe these assurances, even though they have been pronounced
with the greatest solemnity in the House of Commons by the prime minister.
Indeed, it is difficult to believe something which is impossible, especially
if (like Alice in Wonderland) one is out of practice in believing impossible
things. We should just recall the first rule of British official doxology,
that no part of the constitution (whatever that may be) can ever be changed,
for fear that the whole of it should have to be changed immediately.
In other European countries people are less rigid about these things. As a
matter of fact, constitutional reform is in the air in several European
countries this Christmas, most notably in France, Germany and Italy. In each
of these three countries the changes adopted or under discussion should
improve the effectiveness of their parliamentary democracies.
It is not a coincidence that constitutional reform is now under way in these
countries. Directly or indirectly, the common thread is Europe. France and
Germany have reformed or are reforming their constitutions to adapt to the
requirements of the Maastricht treaty, including achieving the objective of
economic and monetary union (Emu). But in the process, they are also
introducing extra changes which will strengthen the role of their national
parliaments.
In addition, President Francois Mitterrand has also called for discussion of
a second and quite separate set of constitutional reform proposals, along
lines he first elaborated a year ago. Critics say that his main objective is
to embarrass the opposition in the run-up to the March elections; yet his
proposals should strengthen the role of the parliament and might reduce the
overweening role of the French president.
The Italian context appears quite different. The heart of its problem is a
system of political parties through which patronage and corruption have
brought public finances to the verge of bankruptcy and the state to the edge
of the abyss. The longstanding parliamentary monopoly of the dominant
Christian Democrats and their revolving coalition partners on the
centre-left was deeply shaken in the April general elections. Soon
afterwards, the feudal powers of the parties were severely weakened by
judicial revelations of wholesale corruption. The power of the Lombard
League party, which denounces the decadence of the traditional political
establishment and challenges the integrity of the Italian state, is growing
fast.
It may be thought that Italy's political bosses had it coming to them,
sooner or later. Yet the European nexus has also played its part. The most
consistent consensus in Italy is on the central importance of the EC. If
Prime Minister Giuliano Amato is managing to make heroic cuts in the budget
deficit, it is partly because failure to do so would keep Italy out of Emu.
When the constitutional reform plan is finally hammered out, it will
probably include limits on proportional representation in an effort to stem
political fragmentation, as well as reform of parliamentary rules to
strengthen government decision-making. But the most interesting idea under
discussion would be a move towards a more federal system, in which the
competences of the national state would be explicitly defined, and the
regions would be given taxation powers to run everything else.
In France and Germany, the national parliaments have used the pressure to
ratify the Maastricht treaty as a lever to seize more powers for themselves.
The French government will be required to table proposals for EC
legislation, on which the National Assembly and the Senate would be able to
pass resolutions. The Senate has also secured a veto over the granting of
votes to EC citizens in French local elections.
The German parliament has laid down that any move towards European union
must secure a two-thirds majority in both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.
The European committee of the Bundestag will have to be consulted on all
proposals for Community legislation; and the Bundesrat has gone even further
than the French Senate, by securing the right to be consulted whenever the
provincial responsibilities of the lander are affected. Finally, the
Bundestag can stop any move to a single European currency if the house is
not satisfied that the treaty conditions have been met.
In France, public comment (and private mockery) have focused on President
Mitterrand's proposals to shorten the presidential term, which is currently
seven years. In the event, however, he has timidly suggested a six-year
term, which will change little. More interesting is a proposal to spell out
explicitly the respective policy responsibilities of the president and the
government, which should limit the temptations for the president to behave
like an absolute monarch.
The European thread in all these reforms is clear. The Maastricht model for
the next phase of European integration would require unprecedented assent
from Europe's voters. The French and Danish referenda, and polls in other
countries, show that popular support is either lacking or ambivalent. Most
parliaments have manifestly fallen short, or have not been allowed to act,
as the interface between the Community and the electorate. If there is a
democratic deficit, it cannot be filled by the European Parliament.
Therefore the national parliaments must play a bigger role in providing
political legitimacy. And about time too.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Positions to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH little but the Christmas holidays to focus on this week most traders
will be busily closing their positions. They will be looking forward to
taking their profits following a turbulent fourth quarter, writes Peter
John.
Pressure on the French franc is expected to abate for the remainder of the
year although many economists believe that recent selling merely reflected a
phoney war and the heavyweight strategic assaults will return in January.
There has been some criticism that the Bank of France has allowed the franc
to slide when, in a thin market, it could have supported it easily. However,
lessons have been learned from the UK's failure to support sterling and the
French central bank is determined not to throw good money after bad.
Instead, it has been conducting, along with the Bundesbank, a strong public
relations campaign combined with slight but consistent intervention and is
believed to be ready to use its muscle when the time is right. 'The debacle
of Black Wednesday showed the French that timing is everything,' said one
economist.
In the UK, analysts are preparing to pick over the November trade figures
tomorrow. Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank expects the seasonally adjusted
visible trade gap to have widened to Pounds 1.3bn from Pounds 1.2bn in
October.
Elsewhere in Europe, pressure on the Irish punt and the Danish krone
continues. There is a feeling that, as Gordon Gekko would have said in the
film Wall Street, the punt is 'wreckable' while the krone will receive more
support.
The dollar has performed badly in spite of positive US economic news but
only because dealers have had long positions and NatWest Capital Markets
advises clients to look for buying opportunities against the D-Mark and Yen.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (12): A decade of
changes - Food industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STROLL around any of Tokyo's supermarkets for a taste of the changes which
have reshaped the Japanese food industry during the past decade. On display
along the wide aisles are the product, packaging and marketing styles that
reflect the need for less complicated foods in a nation of busy urban
dwellers.
The key social change which has altered the country's food-buying habits is
the growth of the female workforce. Its members find less time to look after
the house and children as well as prepare the family dinner which, 10 years
ago, would have typically consisted of four or five dishes.
In their pursuit of time-saving convenience food, Japanese shoppers have
not, however, forsaken traditional delicacies. But they have become more
flexible in their eating habits, with western and Asian cuisines finding
increasing favour - albeit often in the frozen or pre-prepared form.
McDonald's hamburgers and Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets proliferate.
However, as several international food companies which have tried to muscle
in with a distinctive European or US brand have learned to their cost, there
can be strong resistance to foreign tastes.
The Seiyu group's FamilyMart branch in the bustling Ikebukuro district is a
prime example of how traditional Japanese eating habits can be wed with the
need for pre-prepared, easy-to-carry and easy-to-prepare food.
To the side of the store's main shopping floor are three rooms separately
preparing raw fish, meats and vegetables. These can be bought individually
in cellophane-covered plastic trays or in a pre-prepared lunch box which
brings together all three elements.
It is this kind of merchandising which has sponsored a sharp decline in the
importance of small food retailers. Supermarkets take more than 50 per cent
of food and beverage sales - almost double the figure of a decade ago -
while small retailers have registered a corresponding decline.
The rise of the supermarket concept is contributing to an expected
rationalisation in the highly-fragmented food industry in Japan. The
supermarkets' concentrated buying power is forcing many small food
manufacturers to cut prices which in turn is reducing already tight profit
margins. The recession is also making the going tougher.
Although there are several notable exceptions, the Japanese food company
typically relies heavily on one area of the market and perhaps even one
product. Such examples are Kikkoman in the soy sauce area, Snow Brand in the
milk products sector, and Nipponham and Taiyo Fisheries.
Many people in the industry expect to see a progressive move towards the
creation of food conglomerates possessing broader product ranges and a
stronger emphasis on brands.
'I would expect to see a gradual consolidation of the industry over the next
10 years,' says Anne Wall-Smith, an analyst at Schroders Securities in
Tokyo. 'Many companies are just too small to survive, especially if times
become tougher.'
Ajinomoto has, during its 82-year history, plotted a different course to
most and today it is very similar to a European or US brand-orientated
processed and frozen foods company. Its structure has been built on joint
ventures with several leading US foods groups including CPC, Kraft General
Foods and Kellogg.
Ajinomoto and Calpis Food Industry, another Japanese group, earlier this
month announced the formation of a joint venture with BSN, the big French
food company, to make and sell cheese yoghurt and desserts - an expanding
area of the market. The joint venture, capitalised at Y1.4bn, aims for
annual sales of Y15bn next year.
Most leading foreign food companies have found that the only way to break
into the Japanese market is through joint ventures such as this. An
exception is Nestle, which is rated by most analysts as the second-biggest
foods group in Japan, in terms of sales. Its breakthrough came with the
launch several decades ago of the instant coffee. Nestle still controls 80
per cent of this market but has branched out into a wide range of products.
In recent years the local companies have altered their product mix with
consistent regularity to keep pace with swings in consumer preferences.
Although they are a long way from adopting a western diet, the Japanese will
happily eat bread rather than rice for breakfast. Another important change
is the rise in the importance of meat which has accompanied greater
affluence and tighter pricing. This development has kept the rate of fish
consumption flat.
Meat consumption has been on a steep incline for the past 30 years. The
average annual per capita consumption of meat in 1990 was 28.6kg. This was
up 6kg from the same figure a decade ago and compares with 9.2kg in 1965.
According to 1990 figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), US consumption was 120kg, followed by France
(109.4kg) and Germany (104kg).
To cope with this growing demand for meat, imports have risen sharply under
incessant pressure from the US and Australia for greater access to the
market. Tariffs are set to fall by a further 10 percentage points to 50 per
cent in April next year which could help to restrain prices.
It may come too late, however, for many of the 40 companies involved in raw
meat packaging and distribution. A Tokyo food analyst forecasts that only 10
groups will survive, with the small groups which jumped in as the process of
deregulation of the industry began, the main casualties.
As well as flat demand for fish, Japan is having increasing difficulty
roaming the world's main fishing areas as concern mounts about over-fishing.
In 1990, per capita consumption stood at 37.1kg; up only 1.3kg over the
decade.
A more telling example of how eating habits have changed comes from figures
on rice consumption. After a steady decline over the past 30 years, the
Japanese in 1990 ate an average 70kg of rice a head against 78.9kg in 1980.
A growing fondness for bread - and meals less based around a bowl of rice -
account for this change.
Frozen foods have met strong acceptance from Japanese consumers despite some
mild concern, within a nation that for a long time has placed great store in
the importance of natural food, that they may not not carry the same
nutritional value.
Much of the frozen food advertising stresses its high quality food values.
Housewives, according to two female Tokyo food company analysts, initially
felt 'guilty' about giving their family frozen foods because they felt they
were falling down on their responsibility of cooking for the family.
These concerns have subsided and this is reflected in the sales growth of
frozen foods. During the 1980s, the frozen foods market had a compound
growth rate of 6.2 per cent and judging by indications in the past 18
months, this rate will accelerate. In the 10 years to the end of 1990, total
consumption of frozen foods increased by 71 per cent to slightly over 1bn
tonnes.
Nichirei Corporation, a leading frozen and processed foods group, is
encouraged by international comparisons. France, which has one of the lower
European rates, consumed an average of 23.7kg a head in 1990, compared with
10.8kg in Japan. The company forecasts that local consumption will reach the
1990 French level in five to six years.
The sector is dominated by four groups; Nichirei (19 per cent of the
market), Nippon Fishery (11 per cent), Katokichi (10.6 per cent) and
Ajinomoto (9.6 per cent).
The Japanese beverages market has also undergone a period of rapid change as
new products enter the market to meet changing consumer tastes and
purchasing strengths.
The soft drinks market has had a compound growth rate of almost 7 per cent
over the past decade with fruit and coffee drinks leading the way.
Reflecting growing health awareness, mineral waters have become an
outstanding segment of the beverages market. In 1990, sales rose 48.5 per
cent and in 1991 by 62.7 per cent as local brands battled with the arrival
of French imports for shares in what is potentially a huge market.
Beer sales show a steady rise while sake sales in the four years to the end
of 1990 were marginally down. Whisky consumption has been cut by the
generally tighter economic situation and international imports have been
especially hit by the narrowing in the difference between their product and
the local equivalent.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (10): A tougher year
than expected - Small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's dense industrial undergrowth of small businesses knew that 1992
would be a tough year. But they did not know quite how tough it would be.
A survey of 12,615 small companies by the Japan Finance Corporation in the
spring found that the number expecting sales to fall this autumn compared
with a year before outweighed those expecting an increase by a balance of
17.6 percentage points. When they were surveyed again in the summer, a
balance of 33 per cent were expecting sales to fall in the third quarter of
the year.
Having underestimated the scale and spread of the downturn, there is little
doubt how severe it has become. Small business confidence about the outlook
for their sales and profits is close to the all-time low it reached in the
depths of the 1975 recession prompted by the rise in oil prices.
Everything is turning down. Prices are softening, sales are falling,
employment is being cut while it is becoming increasingly difficult for
small companies to raise long-term capital.
The downturn started to affect automobile parts manufacturers first in the
middle of 1991. It then spread rapidly through rubber producers, chemicals,
ceramics and iron and steel in the following six months before hitting
virtually every industrial sector by the start of this year.
The gathering slowdown has been fairly evenly spread across the country.
Only small companies in one region, the southern island of Kyushu, were able
to stave off the downturn this year.
The rate of bankruptcies among small companies is rising; by 38 per cent in
the first 10 months of the year, compared with a 4 per cent growth among
large companies.
Employment in small companies is already contracting, while large companies
are attempting to keep it stable. In August the number of workers in small
family enterprises fell by 8.7 per cent while the number of salaried
employees at large companies rose by 2.5 per cent.
Small companies in Japan - generally defined as companies which employ less
than 300 people with the exception of retailing where the threshold is 50
and wholesaling where it is 150 - were not the engines of employment growth
that they were in the UK and the US during the 1980s. However they still
account for about 79 per cent of employment outside the primary sector of
mining and agriculture.
Over the next year they will bear an increasing share of the burden as Japan
adjusts to slower growth. Small companies are coming under particular
pressure from several factors which do not hurt large companies as much.
There are mounting concerns that small companies may be facing a credit
crunch because they are finding it more difficult to borrow from banks.
Small companies get about 60 per cent of their finance from bank lending.
They are far more dependent upon the banks for finance than large companies.
Small business pressure has led the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry to talk to the commercial banks about their lending policies.
The decline in real estate values has made it more difficult for family
businesses to offer collateral for loans, while the banks are imposing much
tighter restrictions on credit after the easy money of the bubble economy.
However, small businesses borrowed heavily in the late 1980s to finance
investment programmes. The burden of paying off those loans has become
increasingly heavy as the economy has become depressed.
The government is attempting to help prevent such a credit crunch
developing. The budgets for publicly-funded small business finance
corporations has been expanded in the hope that the sharp fall in commercial
bank lending will be offset by the public sector.
An emergency Y10,700bn economic package unveiled in August was partly
targeted at the small business sector by increasing the budgets for the
Japan Finance Corporation and the People's Finance corporation.
Small and medium-sized businesses have largely escaped the direct
consequences of the collapse in stock and real estate prices following the
collapse of the bubble economy. However they are now being hit by the slump
in domestic demand which has followed in its wake.
But it is not simply the slump in final domestic consumer demand which is
hitting small businesses. Small companies which are sub-contractors to large
manufacturers such as the automotive manufacturers are being hit by moves by
their customers to further cut costs by reducing the number of their
suppliers. Throughout Japanese manufacturing there is a move to extend
product cycles, simplify products and reduce the range of products. This in
turn is reducing the number of suppliers which large manufacturers need.
The decline in employment in small businesses reflects the severity of their
position because small companies are loath to lay off workers. Small
companies find it extremely difficult to compete against the wages, terms
and conditions offered by larger groups. For example, about 90 per cent of
small businesses still work a six-day week.
Despite slower economic growth, Japan still faces the prospect of a labour
shortage over the course of the decade. So small businesses are reluctant to
lay off workers now, only to face a fierce competition to recruit them again
once the economy recovers. This means they are covering heavy fixed costs at
a time of declining demand.
Finally, Japan's small companies are the most exposed to international
competition from low-wage economies in the rest of Asia such as Taiwan and
Singapore supplying commodity components to large Japanese groups. Japan's
small companies find it much more difficult to compete with foreign
competition through upgrading their production systems or their design to
create higher value-added products.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (9): Experiments for
the future / Profile of Tsukuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a sprawling complex of government buildings about an hour's drive from
Tokyo lie what the Japanese government hopes will be the seeds of Japan's
next industrial revolution.
Tsukuba is the main campus for the government's science programme. In 1991,
the government spent Y117.3bn to employ 2,526 researchers and 1,093
administrators in an effort to put Japanese science on the international
map.
Tsukuba, and indeed the government's entire programme, is still more of an
experiment than it is the engine room of Japanese technological advance.
What Japan has rightly become famous for has been making a commercial
success out of scientific and technical developments, many of which
originated elsewhere. Whether the government's role in bringing this about
was central or peripheral is still subject to debate. Yet whatever the
outcome of debate among academics, Europe and the US have begun to imitate
the Japanese formula in order to try to bring their own industries up to
international running speed.
What the Japanese government did was to bring private companies together in
government-sponsored programmes in order to develop 'pre-competitive'
technology, for example in semiconductors. Private companies were then able
to take advantage of the basic technology to design products and compete in
the market, in theory giving them a collective head start.
At Tsukuba, supported by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology
(AIST) under the administrative control of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti), the aim is to develop technology that is
somewhere between pure, basic science, and the 'pre-competitive' stage where
private industry is likely to show strong interest.
Miti officials consult industry and the scientific community and then select
research topics and allocate money to areas where they believe basic
scientific research will eventually lead - perhaps in the distant future -
to some technical breakthrough that will be useful to industry.
Increasingly, the process is becoming more open to foreign participation,
with hundreds of foreign scientists visiting each year for stays of varying
durations.
The subjects for research are broad, with institutes for mechanical
engineering, fermentation (including biotechnology), electrotechnology, and
geology. Some of the more interesting projects presently moving forward at
Tsukuba include:
Mr Gen Matsumoto, at the Electrotechnical Institute has developed a
super-high-speed video camera that can actually capture visually the
activity of the brain. With a better understanding of how the human brain
functions, scientists are hoping to build computers that can think, instead
of just compute and process data.
Mr Matsumoto spent five years on research and initially produced nothing,
but he has now perfected a camera, actually a charge-coupled device, that
operates at 0.5 milliseconds per frame.
In the past, brain researchers were forced to develop models of how the
brain functioned by attaching electrodes to animal brains and measuring the
electrical response to stimuli. Yet for practical purposes, very few
electrodes could be attached, forcing scientists to measure a highly complex
process in overly simplified form.
Mr Matsumoto's camera, however, is capable of measuring 16,000 points
simultaneously. A rat's brain is opened and treated with an
electro-sensitive dye and a brilliant picture of how information is spread
through the brain can be watched on a video tape that is slowed by a factor
of 100. Already, Mr Matsumoto says, widely accepted models of how the brain
functions have been put into doubt.
Mr Matsumoto claims that his success in developing the camera was only
possible because he had the freedom to fail for five years, without
producing anything. He doesn't believe this would have been possible in, for
example, the US.
Mr Susumu Takada has developed a super-high-speed Josephine computer that he
says is nearly ready for practical development. A Josephine computer is one
in which high speed is achieved by using circuits supercooled by liquid
helium to achieve superconductivity. Ordinary, silicon chips are limited in
speed because they produce heat - a problem that is intensified as chips
become smaller and smaller yet pack more computing power.
IBM, which had been working on the computer, gave up the project in the
early 1980s as unworkable. Rather than use lead, as IBM did, however, Mr
Takada used the rare metallic element niobiuim and was able to produce a
processor of high reliability.
'In principle, the scientific problems are nearly solved,' he says. The main
obstacle to commercial development, he believes, is the current business
environment. Other projects at the laboratories include programming for
computers to enable them to recognise human faces; hydrogen production from
light-sensitive bacteria; development of powerful robot manipulator arms
using six parallel links; and the development of robot arms with a sense of
touch and the ability to manipulate objects flexibly like the fingers of a
hand.
The main difference with government programmes in Europe and the US is that
Miti takes a more direct approach to deciding on its own what to support and
what to axe. Whether the programmes will counter an often-heard criticism
that Japanese are better at commercialising basic technology than developing
it remains to be seen.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (7): Facing up to
deregulation - Oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese oil industry, which has survived under the umbrella of
stringent government control during the past 30 years, is attempting to face
up to the realities of a deregulated environment.
Several companies have made tentative steps towards creating more
competitive financial bases but the sector as a whole is waiting cautiously,
braced for a period of restructuring in the wake of reduced direct
government interference.
'This industry has been regulated for so long the companies know what is
expected of them,' says Mr Martin Roth, analyst at Kleinwort Benson's Tokyo
office. 'They are like birds that have been freed but just do not want to
leave home.'
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) strategy to
establish a less fragmented, more profitable industry is the subject of
intense speculation.
Miti's tight grip on the industry was justified on the grounds of national
security. Since the 1960s, the government was free to dictate which
companies could sell and refine, how much oil could be refined and how much
of each product could be produced. It set pricing levels and determined how
many service stations could be built and where.
From January 1986, in a series of measures - the last of which was taken in
April - the government repealed most of these restrictions although the
guiding hand of Miti is still present. Miti says its rules are now 'more
transparent.' Only oil refiners can import oil products and an oil refinery
must run at more than 80 per cent capacity for three years before agreement
will be granted to raise capacity.
Because Japan is almost totally dependent on crude oil imports - which
service 58 per cent of its energy requirements - the government felt it was
vital to control the industry and thus ensure stable supplies of an
essential ingredient to industrial and economic stability. To ensure
supplies, the government allowed oil companies to proliferate. The oil
crises of the 1970s and the Gulf war reinforced concern about the country's
vulnerability to an interruption to supplies.
Today, in a country of 120m people, some 26 companies refine oil; seven
companies refine and wholesale, four companies wholesale only and a further
19 refine only. There are 20,000 petrol retail companies and 10,000 petrol
dealer companies. No companies control supply from the well-head to the
petrol pump as is the case in the west.
By allowing this highly protective environment to continue for so long, the
government encouraged the development of an inefficient oil industry which
survives on thinly-sliced profit margins.
The industry's net profits-to-sales rate last year was 1.83 per cent
compared with an average in the manufacturing sector of 5.4 per cent,
according to a Tokyo oil analyst who says the sector has a
'most-favoured-baby status.' This is a fraction of the figure achieved by
international groups, although their upstream activities distort comparison.
The low profitability was justified and tolerated on the grounds that oil
companies were essential to economic well-being and a steep rise in return
would have created a political backlash. Illustrating the splintered nature
of the business, Nippon Oil, the largest petroleum refiner, has only 16.2
per cent of primary refining capacity. The top three companies control 43
per cent.
The need for large-scale capital expenditure to raise environmental
standards, renew equipment and boost output will put a severe strain on many
companies. This problem has been compounded by the tightening of borrowing
conditions in Japan in the aftermath of the property market's slump.
It is argued that only larger, financially more sound oil companies can be
assured of meeting these capital renewal plans into the next century.
Japan has a petroleum refining capacity of 4.7m barrels a day and production
is running at 75-80 per cent at the moment, which after allowing for
down-time and anticipated demand growth, leaves the way open for expansion
of the industry into the next century.
Miti has regularly expressed its desire to see rationalisation through
mergers. Several Tokyo analysts believe that Miti expected the first
liberalisation moves to force the weakest groups into mergers as their
profit bases weakened without government protection. However, the general
economic growth of the past decade ensured their survival and underpinned
relative strength across the industry.
There has been only one merger in the industry this year. Nippon Mining
bought out the 53 per cent it did not own in Kyodo Oil but this scarely
altered the face of the industry.
The most likely course of rationalisation is through the merger of groups
with either large refining or oil product distribution operations. For this
reason, Cosmo Oil and Mitsubishi Oil are often linked as possible merger
partners.
Mr Akihiko Nomiyama, managing director of Nippon Mining, believes that
mergers will be slow to occur. 'Mergers may be difficult. They will only
occur when a company fails. It would be rare for strong companies to merge.'
Mr Hitoshi Itoh, deputy director of Miti's oil refining division, is aware
of possible mergers. 'The government can do nothing about mergers. But the
government is willing to support and help mergers. We could act as a match
maker,' he says. By deregulating, Miti was also attempting to encourage the
establishment of companies financially capable of going upstream, through
joint ventures, to secure oil supplies.
Discussions are underway about the biggest joint venture with a foreign oil
producer, which could act as a catalyst for other ties-ups. Nippon Mining,
Nippon Oil and Caltex are talking with the Saudi Arabian government about
the creation of a joint venture which would give the country access to the
Japanese market and Japan a more secure grip on supplies. The intention is
for Nippon Oil and Nippon Mining to push two of their existing refineries
into the venture as well as establish a third in southern Honshu. Combined,
they would have a capacity of 450,000 b/d.
Existing ties between Japanese companies and Middle Eastern producers,
through similar links, are expected to strengthen. Although deals such as
these hold the promise of change in the industry it may mean Miti has to
become more actively involved if the industry is going to seize the
opportunities offered by self-regulation.
A senior executive at a leading company said: 'At the moment we are all in a
warm Japanese bath. We are all worried that if one of us moves we may all
get cold.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (6): Focus is on
multi-media - Consumer electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS to the Information and Communications System Centre built by
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, are greeted in
the atrium by bowing clerks at an information booth, a waterfall and an
entrance to a high-tech 'vision presentation auditorium' shaped like the
mouth of a cave.
The building, located in south Tokyo, is like a huge glass and stone pyramid
and is a great monument of the late eighties when Japanese companies raised
easy cash during the height of the bull market. But it is also a symbol of
Matsushita's ambitions to embrace multi-media and 'systems integration', a
key theme for all Japanese electronics and computer companies.
Sharp, the consumer electronics and office equipment maker, and Fujitsu,
Japan's largest computer maker which owns ICL, also recently announced
completion of their multi-media research and development centres, which
stand side by side in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo. Sharp's Y40bn
Multimedia Systems Research and Development Centre has 21 floors,
symbolising the company's focus on the 21st century.
In its Y32bn centre, Matsushita displays personal computers and work
stations which combine telephones, cameras and screens. Television
conferences conducted at an individual's own desk are also possible using
the futuristic technology. Matsushita's ultimate goal is to provide
'environment integration' which allows office workers to work and
communicate when and wherever they please.
Yet, despite their great investments, the electronics makers only have vague
concepts of integrating various technologies. The companies realise the vast
possibilities of combining computer hardware with speech, music, graphics
and still pictures, but they admit difficulties with real applications.
Mr Atsushi Asada, vice-president of Sharp, says: 'We know the multi-media
industry will grow as large as Y60,000bn in the next century, but nothing
concrete has come out yet.'
The main problem Japanese companies face is the lack of technology to
develop software. Thus Japanese computer makers are sitting on the sidelines
watching out for software development by US computer makers. 'We are waiting
for standardisation,' says Mr Asada.
Last month, American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the US
telecommunications company, announced it would develop personal
communicators based on its new 32-bit microprocessor chip. The pen-point
personal communicators will allow users to talk and exchange facsimile and
electronic mail messages via land-line and wireless telecommunications
media.
The product will rival the Newton palm-top, a pen-point terminal under
development by Apple Computer of the US. International Business Machines and
Apple have joined forces to develop standards for multi-media products
ranging from personal computers to consumer electronics and communications
technology.
Meanwhile Intel and Microsoft, two leading US software concerns, have also
announced plans to co-operate on multi-media development. Microsoft's Video
for Windows, which enables users to combine and edit digitalised pictures,
is a rival product to Apple's software for the Macintosh computer.
While Toshiba and NEC have decided to team up with AT&amp;T, and Sharp with
Apple, important software development is led by US software houses.
'Japanese companies won't be able to do much with their hardware until the
software is ready,' says Mr Steve Myers, electronics analyst at Jardine
Fleming Securities.
The venture into the multi-media industry comes at a time when Japanese
electronics manufacturers are desperate for a new hit product. However, at
the same time, the companies are seeing a sharp decline in the domestic
economy and are facing heavy falls in profits.
Matsushita saw its consolidated pre-tax profits for the interim term to
September fall 65 per cent, while that of Sony declined 61 per cent.
Japanese companies are uncertain if a recovery in domestic demand is on the
near horizon. Heavy depreciation costs of capital investments made in the
eighties are squeezing profits. 'Things were different when we were at the
planning stage,' says Sharp.
Mr Tsuzo Murase, vice-president at Matsushita, says that the investments
were made for the customer. 'We're not spending money for ourselves,' he
says. Matsushita claims that its new centre has everything a customer
seeking information and communications applications needs.
The companies try to justify heavy expenditure on the buildings, as they
claim the high-tech appliances and systems in their 'intelligent buildings'
are marketable. Sharp's building, for example, offers a range of
applications from a toilet which switches on automatically when a person
walks in, to a global teleconference network and to liquid crystal displays
in elevators. 'It's a place where we can test out new ideas,' it says.
Matsushita's building offers its workers a cashless cafeteria, where
personal identification cards are used to pay, and 'intelligent' air
conditioning which can be controlled by the same identification cards, to
suit individual needs. 'The whole building and its operations will start
yielding a profit in 10 years,' says Mr Murase.
While not all industry observers are sceptical, most wonder if Japanese
companies sitting on the sidelines will have the creative edge. Mr Jeremy
Marks, analyst at Barings Securities in Tokyo, says that considering the
successes of Nintendo and Sega Enterprises, the video game makers,
multi-media is definitely a high-growth area. 'But to succeed it has to be
very high quality and lots of fun.'
As to what lies beyond video games and television telephones, Mr Asada of
Sharp says: 'This is a long-term project. We are trying to anticipate and
prepare for the lifestyles in the next century.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (8): Nippondenso in
profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Masaru Yanaka's morning has been dominated by a brain-storming session.
As the assistant general manager of the engine electrical manufacturing
division, he and his colleagues at Nippondenso's alternator production plant
at Kariya, 20 miles from Nagoya, have been thrashing out ways of coping with
and learning from the steepest sales decline ever experienced by the
Japanese car industry.
All manner of cost-cutting measures aimed at reversing the profits slide at
Japan's biggest car components manufacturer have been discussed, ranging
from reducing overtime to curbing basic raw materials waste.
At this plant alone, production is running at 25 per cent below capacity,
while profits from the plant last month were two-thirds of the level
achieved in the corresponding term last year.
'It's like baseball,' Mr Yanaka says. 'For years we just kept hitting the
ball and now we are missing it. We have to learn from this.'
Five miles away, at the head office, the message of austerity and caution is
the same. Mr Tsuneo Ishimaru, the president, speaks gravely about the
problems ahead and the measures which will have to be taken if the company
is to return to the sort of growth pattern which saw profits more than
double during the 1980s.
This pattern came to an abrupt halt last year and the tone for an even
sharper fall this year was set at the interim stage when Nippondenso's
parent company saw pre-tax profits fall 25 per cent to Y30.42bn despite a
slight rise in sales.
'What is clear is that we have to keep costs down,' the president says. 'I
have told every department that they must cut costs by 15 per cent this year
and I am very confident that this can be achieved. At the same time we have
reduced capital expenditure by 20 per cent for the year.'
The financial stringency package does not include wage cuts and Mr Ishimaru
fiercely rejects any possibility of redundancies. In the words of an
industry observer: 'The senior management would take a 50 per cent cut in
pay before making one person redundant.'
Nippondenso has been insulated from the worst of the slump in the Japanese
car industry through its historic link with Toyota - which is also in the
middle of a period of steep profits decline but has fared better than many
of its rivals, particularly Nissan.
Nippondenso grew out of Toyota when it was spun off in 1951 as a separately
listed group. Today, Toyota controls 23.6 per cent of the capital directly
and a further 7.3 per cent through a subsidiary while the board is sprinkled
with Toyota's senior management.
Nippondenso, which does business with eight other domestic car
manufacturers, will not give details about the proportion of its sales which
go to Toyota. Mr Ishimaru says only that it is slightly in excess of 50 per
cent. But in key areas such as air conditioners, car heaters, radiators and
fuel injection units it is believed to be greatly in excess of this figure.
Car heaters and air conditioners last year accounted for 35.3 per cent of
consolidated group sales of Y1,511bn.
One change in the relationship could occur in the automotive electronics
area which, in the age of computer gadgetry, holds the prospect for high
value-added returns in a growth market.
According to one analyst, Nippondenso has been getting 'a bit of a free
ride' from Toyota in this area which has been making increasing use of
electronic equipment, particularly in its prestige Crown and Lexus ranges.
For Toyota, expansion into the area could cut costs and thrust it further
into the electronics industry.
'Because Toyota sees that the Japanese car market is a mature market, it
feels the need to move into areas which offer the prospect for growth and
high value added,' says Mr Peter Boardman, the Tokyo-based automotive
analyst for UBS Phillips and Drew.
The realisation that the Japanese car market is reaching maturity has been
the spur for Nippondenso's increasing belief that international operations
are essential to maintain its growth rate into the next century.
The group set a 10-year strategy which called for an annual growth rate in
consolidated net sales of 8 per cent until 1995 which would boost the total
to Y2,000bn.
The company has been blown off course from achieving this target by the ills
within the global market during the past 18 months but Mr Ishimaru remains
confident that the international aims can be achieved.
Expansion into the US, Europe and Asia has lifted the element of
international sales within the group to 23 per cent and the president feels
that this will rise to the targeted 25 per cent by 1996.
During the 1980s the company, building upon an overseas sales network,
followed Toyota offshore into areas where the car producer had established
production sites. Nippondenso injected an estimated Y100bn into the
establishment of eight manufacturing sites. The showpiece was the Y41bn
Tennessee plant.
Nippondenso's US sales to the big three car manufacturers reached an
estimated Dollars 500m last year, with Ford and Chrysler each taking Dollars
200m and the rest going to GM. In addition to these, the company has
substantial sales to Japanese transplant operations in the US. Mr Ishimaru
would like to establish closer ties with GM and there are those within the
industry who believe that the US group's new management may be more open to
discussion of purchasing accords.
Japanese car component makers have been more cautious about following the
nation's car makers into Europe than they were about moving into the US
market. Nippondenso, however, has established a substantial presence in
Europe during the past four years.
Last July, the company began production of air conditioners and heaters at
its Pounds 65m plant at Telford in Shropshire which forms a cornerstone of
the move into Europe that began in 1989. The English plant has a projected
output of 400,000 air conditioners and the same number of heaters by 1995.
Toyota and Honda will be the two biggest customers.
Nippondenso has formed a joint venture with Magneti Marelli, Fiat's 66.5 per
cent-owned automotive components subsidiary. The Italian company has taken a
25 per cent stake in the Shropshire plant and in ND Marston, previously the
IMI Radiators business, acquired by Nippondenso in 1989 while the Japanese
group has taken a 25 per cent holding in an air conditioning subsidiary of
the Italian company. By the end of 1995, when Toyota and Honda have reached
forecast capacity in Europe, Nippondenso's turnover is expected to have
tripled to Pounds 450m a year, with local production constituting 50 per
cent.
The company has also had a long relationship with Robert Bosch, the large
German automotive parts manufacturer, and although the association has not
been without its problems there is potential for closer ties.
The German company is a 5.6 per cent shareholder in Nippondenso, making it
one of the biggest investors in a share capital structure so tightly
controlled by large banks and insurance groups that there is only an
estimated 7.7 per cent freely traded.
The company's balance sheet is a model of conservative industrial management
in these times when some Japanese companies have low cash reserves and big
loans. But the erosion of the group's profit margins is a cause of concern.
The profit margin peaked in the last decade in 1985 at 8.5 per cent. Since
then there has been a downward trend towards 4.2 per cent last year, with
worse expected in 1993.
The share price has stagnated at about Y1,300 for most of this year - which
can be interpreted as a testament to its underlying strength in the face of
the industry's problems.
'In the next two years,' says Mr Boardman, 'it is hard to see a recovery in
profits unless there is a steep upswing in the Japanese and US economies.
Even though this is a well-managed, great company it is hard to see how the
stock price is going to improve in the short-term.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (4): Vital source of
growth - Exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Japanese domestic demand severely depressed, the strength of the
country's exports has been a vital source of growth for the economy as a
whole.
The Japanese trade surplus with the rest of the world is set to rise to
unprecedented highs this year. The Japan Foreign Trade Council, which
represents the country's leading trading houses, forecasts that the trade
surplus will reach Dollars 115bn this year. The Bank of Japan expects it
will reach Dollars 120bn. In 1993 it could go even higher if recovery in the
US sucks in imports while the Japanese economy remains depressed.
However, as yet there is little evidence that Japanese manufacturers are
exporting in much higher volumes to offset the decline in the domestic
market. Although the trade surplus this year is likely to surpass the peak
it reached in the mid 1980s, it is fundamentally quite different in
character.
The growth in the trade surplus in the mid-1980s was fuelled by very strong
growth of export volumes combined with stagnant imports. The volume of
exports rose rapidly in the mid-1980s but in the past few years it has grown
much more modestly.
However the growth in the surplus in the past year has not been due to a
surge in export volumes. Since 1989, the ratio of exports to imports has
remained virtually stable. Export volumes are growing only at a rate of
about 2.6 per cent a year. In October, export volumes rose by only 0.7 per
cent from a year before - even though the value of the trade surplus rose by
more than 50 per cent.
The explanation for the surge in the trade surplus is that the prices of
Japanese exports have risen steeply. Measured in dollar terms, exports are
growing at a rate of about 9 per cent a year.
This largely reflects the recent strengthening of the yen, which has made
exports more expensive, without yet choking off the growth in export demand.
When the yen appreciates, the US dollar price of exports rises if those
goods were originally priced in yen. This may partly reflect the importance
of exports from Japan to manufacturing plants abroad owned by Japanese
companies.
It is also due to the increasing technological and design sophistication of
Japanese products which has allowed them to claim higher prices in export
markets.
Meanwhile, the opposite fate has befallen imports.
Imports into Japan rose markedly in the late 1980s but have fallen off
lately because of the downturn in the domestic economy. Import volumes were
down by about 4 per cent in August compared with the same month the year
before.
However, import prices have fallen as well, particularly oil and other
commodities which Japan relies upon.
So the rise in the trade surplus is much more a reflection of price changes
rather than a large quantitative expansion in Japan's exports. However, the
fact that exports are still rising, albeit it slowly, in the face of the
higher US dollar export prices, is a sign of the continued competitiveness
of Japanese manufacturing.
The other main change in the character of the surplus is the destination.
Asia is becoming increasingly important for Japanese exports.
Exports to Asia rose by 14.6 per cent in the year to October, led by sharp
increase in transport machinery with car exports up 56 per cent, truck up 54
per cent and motorcycle exports to Asia 107 per cent higher. Asia has
replaced Europe as Japan's second-largest market for exports of transport
equipment.
Japanese exports to Asia are being pulled by the region's strong economy
growth fuelled both by corporate investment and consumer goods.
The prospects of revival in the US economy may be lifting Japanese exports
of machinery and capital equipment to the US. Exports of general machinery
to the US rose by 20 per cent in October from the year before.
Meanwhile export growth to Europe is slowing as growth in Germany slows.
Exports to Europe were 5.5 per cent up in October at Dollars 5.3bn, while
imports were 9.8 per cent down at Dollars 2.5bn.
The rate of growth of the value of machinery exports has risen from about
7.3 per cent in 1990 to more than 15 per cent this year, with electrical
machinery exports up 11 per cent. However the automotive industry has
delivered the strongest increase in exports despite only minimal growth in
car exports to the US, where the Japanese car companies have extensive
manufacturing operations.
Vehicle exports to the EC were 25 per cent up in the year to October, with
automotive parts up 43 per cent. Automotive exports to Asia were 50 per cent
higher. In contrast, car exports to the US rose by only 1.8 per cent over
the same period.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (5): New discipline
imposed - Foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wave of Japanese direct investment that swept over the US and Europe
during the late 1980s is receding. The collapse of the country's financial
markets and the international recession have imposed new discipline on
companies which appeared to have bottomless budgets and borderless
ambitions.
Japanese companies are still investing in foreign manufacturing operations,
but they are more selective.
They are also reviewing foreign investments made during the 'bubble era' of
the late 1980s and concluding that these projects cannot survive in the
harsher environment of the 1990s.
From fiscal 1987 to 1989, Japanese foreign direct investment doubled to
Dollars 67.5bn, including an increase from Dollars 6.6bn to Dollars 14.8bn
in Europe, and from Dollars 15.3bn to Dollars 33.9bn in the US.
Since then the figure has been in decline and direct investment in the
fiscal first half was 12 per cent lower than a year earlier.
Behind the fall is a shift in investment priorities that will produce a
better-targeted flow of money out of Japan.
Car parts manufacturers will still establish US factories and European
machinery makers will be acquired, but the emphasis will be on profits, not
politics or public relations.
And there will be increased investment in China, Vietnam and other centres
offering lower-priced production facilities for manufacturers whose core
profitability has declined for more than a decade.
Mr Yuji Hosoya, a deputy director of the industrial policy bureau at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), said that investment in
China had increased against the trend because it was 'survival investment'
for labour-intensive Japanese industries.
'Japan's main target must be Asia,' Mr Hosoya said. The financial reasons
for this focus are obvious to those Japanese companies burdened by purchases
of ailing US steel makers or investments in unprofitable US components
plants.
Miti has found that the Japanese manufacturing investment in the US is
showing a negative profit to sales ratio of 0.9 per cent, while European
investments are yielding 3.2 per cent and those in Asia 5 per cent.
But even within Asia, Japanese companies have become more selective having
learned from experience over the past decade.
One trading house representative said his company had invested heavily in
Thailand, particularly in textile and other processing ventures, but the
productivity of some of those ventures had not met expectations.
A decision by the Japanese government in November to restore official
development assistance (ODA) to Vietnam has encouraged the leading trading
houses, all of whom have representative offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City.
However, the short-term viability of Vietnamese projects is still limited by
inadequate infrastructure and concerns on the rule of corporate law.
Japanese companies are also convinced that China's time has finally come, as
the country is now an important base for components out-sourcing and an
increasingly lively market.
Over the past decade, Japanese companies have tentatively invested in China,
believing that the quality of product was not high enough for the
international marketplace and that the domestic market was limited by
consumers' modest means and by strict government regulation.
All three of those limits have changed over the past three years, while the
stability of economic and foreign investment policy during the political
upheaval of June 1989, when the pro-democracy movement was crushed, have
convinced Japanese executives that reform will endure long beyond the
lifetime of Deng Xiaoping, the paramount Chinese leader.
The result is that Japanese investment in China, which rose from Dollars
349m in 1990 to Dollars 579m last year, is likely to double this year.
Each day the Japanese press carries news of new ventures and, apart from the
'Gold Coast' of southern China, there has been a rush of money to the
northern port of Dalian, familiar to many Japanese because of its past role
as a manufacturing base in occupied China during the 1930s.
In the textile industry, about 30 projects have been established around
Shanghai by a Japanese sewing companies' association, although the results
of this investment are reducing these makers' domestic operations.
Mr Mitsunobu Nonaka, president of KM Clothing, based in the southern island
of Kyushu, said the quality of Chinese garments had improved rapidly over
the past three years, and Japanese garment makers were unable to match the
Chinese prices.
Mr Kaizo Hashimoto, director of investment promotion at the Japan External
Trade Organisation, said Japanese companies remain interested in European
investment, even though the flow of funds had slowed over the past two
years.
The UK retained an advantage, he explained, because many Japanese executives
could speak some English, while relatively few spoke French or German.
'In continental Europe, Germany is the number one spot for Japanese
investors. There is a lot of interest in the former East Germany because
there are not so many competitors in that area, compared to other parts of
Europe, and companies can see the potential for development,' Mr Hashimoto
said.
East European markets may offer Japanese companies long-term profits, but
executives are more concerned about their companies' present lack of
profitability.
One cause of the profits problem is the increased cost of capital for
Japanese companies, which could raise funds at virtually zero cost during
the financial frenzy of the late 1980s, but which must now pay between 4 and
5 per cent for their money.
The prospect of long years of unprofitability for a new manufacturing plant
in eastern Europe has become particularly unpalatable for manufacturers.
Japanese companies, like the country's consumers, have become more modest in
their spending habits and more determined to get value for money.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (2): Harsh environment
prevails - Corporate finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE executives have been hoping against hope that the Tokyo stock
market will return to its former state, and that raising funds will again be
as easy as it was in the late 1980s when equity issues and equity-linked
bonds were quickly consumed.
The focus on the Nikkei stock market average has been particularly intense
for companies which issued warrant bonds in the late 1980s, because low
stock prices have ensured that most of these issues have remain uncoverted,
creating a hefty refinancing burden.
An overhang of about Dollars 75bn in warrants due to mature next year is
only one of several changes to the financial environment in Japan, where
capital was raised at almost zero cost during much of the 1980s and
companies bolstered core profits through a flurry of zaiteku, or financial
engineering.
For the past two months, the Nikkei stock average has struggled to stay
above 17,000, widely regarded as the turning point beyond which prices could
again fall sharply.
Meanwhile, Japanese banks have a growing burden of non-performing loans,
forcing them to be far more selective about lending, and limiting their role
in refinancing exercises.
In this harsh environment, Mr Yutaka Tanaka, managing director of finance at
NKK, the steel maker, is remarkably buoyant. He explains that the company's
conservative habits in the past have provided reassurance for its banks,
which are now reluctant to lend to companies thought to have over-indulged
in stock or property speculation.
NKK issued Dollars 700m in warrant bonds in December 1988, and another
Y130bn in convertible bonds in July 1989. The company's share price peaked
at Y1,040 in February 1989, and has since slid with the Nikkei index,
hovering around Y260 at the end of November.
About 1 per cent of the bonds were converted, forcing Mr Tanaka to find
Y220bn to refinance the debt this fiscal year. He has chosen bond issues in
the Euromarket, two of which have already raised Y120bn, with another two
issues scheduled in coming months to complete the refinancing.
'I really didn't think there would be a serious problem and we have not had
any problems. With the issues maturing, people have to find some new
investment. They have to put their money somewhere, and we have had no
trouble attracting investors,' Mr Tanaka said.
He is still interested in the equity warrants market, but says the amounts
now being raised are too small to attract a company with the needs of NKK:
'With requirements of our size (total debt Y1,200bn), we are really only
interested in issues of a minimum Dollars 500m or Dollars 1bn. Smaller
issues are costly and troublesome.'
While NKK appears to be easily weathering the warrants storm, smaller
Japanese companies are likely to have more difficulty in the coming year.
The difficulty will be compounded because Japanese banks, very willing to
lend to the likes of NKK, are wary of commiting funds to smaller, more
vulnerable companies.
Mr Mutsuo Shinoyama, senior economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research,
said a persistent problem was that companies had yet to get accustomed to
operating in an environment where funds would cost from 4 to 5 per cent:
'They were getting their money at almost zero cost or 1 per cent. That is
not normal. They will have to think very carefully about their investments.'
The higher cost of funds is forcing companies to review capital spending
plans and intensify their cost-cutting. The core profitability of Japanese
manufacturers has been in decline for the past decade, although the poor
returns were not as pressing during the late 1980s when companies were
easily able to supplement their income with zaiteku.
Apart from a public offering in Tokyo, the range of funding options remains
much the same as in 1988, although more expensive. Companies needing to
refinance issues could turn to equity warrants, convertible bonds, Euroyen
bonds, bank loans, or a straight bond issue in the domestic market, strictly
regulated but increasingly active.
Mr Kazuyoshi Hashimoto, finance director at Asahi Breweries, which had a
Dollars 1bn warrant bond issue in August 1989, says 'equity finance is
difficult' given the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock market, and
straight bonds in the domestic market are a possibility, but 'the interest
rates are not very attractive'.
'When you add up the costs of issuing bonds, it is much cheaper to be
financed by institutions such as life insurance companies, city banks and
long-term credit banks.
'The short-term prime rate is about 4.75 per cent, but our rate may be
around 4.25 per cent.'
He said Asahi was still able to add to its income by issuing commercial
paper and depositing the funds, earning between 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per
cent on the deal. Mr Tanaka at NKK said his company could do the same, but
doesn't because zaiteku is frowned upon at the steel maker.
Asahi has not been tempted to offload any of its low-yielding bank shares to
increase financial income. Some Japanese industrial companies sold the
shares of their less important banks earlier this year, loosening the
traditional relationship, but Mr Hashimoto says the low yields on Asahi's
banks stocks do not bother him.
'We have their shares and they have our shares. If you look at it, the yield
appears low, but the relationship is important. If we had trouble, they
would assist us, and that is reassuring. It's impossible to calculate the
real benefits of the relationship.'
As for when Asahi expects to be able to issue equity again on the Tokyo
market, Mr Hashimoto is as uncertain as other as Japanese executives: 'It
all depends on when the stock market recovers, but it is likely to be about
two years from now. Investors are not willing to buy stocks at the moment.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (3):  Key factor to
success - Market trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has been a bad year for Japanese companies. The interim profit season
during the past weeks has reflected the sharp downturn in the Japanese
economy as companies have turned in the steepest earnings declines in 17
years.
Amidst the gloom, however, some companies have posted strong growth in sales
and earnings. The key factor to success has been the 'back to basics' trend,
as consumers shunned the luxury market to turn to cheaper products offering
good quality.
Japanese consumers are tightening their belts and have started to embrace
frugality. Such changes have bolstered business at Yoshinoya, the 'beef
bowl' fast food chain, which saw a 34.4 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits on an 18.6 per cent increase in sales.
Yoshinoya, helped by the liberalisation of beef imports, offers customers a
'gyudon' - a bowl of rice topped with stewed beef - at Y400. Many companies
targeted the higher end of the market by raising prices in the eighties as
some consumers equated higher prices with higher quality. But Yoshinoya has
maintained the same prices on its menu for the past eight years.
Other food outlets are seeing a sharp fall in clientele but Yoshinoya has
managed to increase business by keeping prices low and constantly looking
for ways to cut costs.
During the boom years of the late eighties, when stock and land prices
surged, the average Japanese felt rich, bought expensive cars, jewellery and
art. However, the bubble economy's demise has prompted consumers to tighten
their belts. Department stores' sales are declining along with sales of
luxury items.
For the year ended last February, Japanese department stores saw the first
decline in sales of foreign brand products for eight years. Sales of foreign
goods declined 11.3 per cent, following an 11 per cent rise the previous
year. Direct imports by department stores fell 38.4 per cent, including a
69.2 per cent plunge in sales of arts, crafts and paintings.
The age when consumers were willing to pay high prices for almost any
product is over. Now some top retailers are losing business to discounters.
Aoyama Trading, a retailer of cheap blue suits for office workers, recently
opened a store in the Ginza, the ritzy shopping area in central Tokyo.
Japanese men have forsaken expensive Italian designer suits - a fad in the
late eighties - for jackets at Y2,500, an eighth of department store prices,
and Y30,000 suits, a third of the usual price.
Aoyama, listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, posted a 34
per cent rise in sales for the six months to September, while pre-tax
profits rose 3.7 per cent. Aoki International, also a roadside bulk retailer
of men's clothing, saw firm increases in sales and profits.
Meanwhile, high-technology toy makers also proved to be winners. Sega
Enterprises saw pre-tax profits surging 83 per cent while Nintendo improved
its earnings by 5.5 per cent. An increase in sales of lucrative software
supported profits.
As companies try to adjust to slow growth, most are finding the need to
resume streamlining efforts by Japanese companies in the eighties - which
were cut off by the economic bubble when companies rushed to increase
capacity in order to fulfil the surge in demand.
Kao, the toiletries maker, enjoyed brisk sales of its household detergents,
cosmetics and sanitary products. It says cost reduction efforts during the
eighties, and in-house campaigns to enhance consumer awareness by offering
easier-to-use containers for its shampoos and detergents, are now paying
off. 'We're not benefiting from the economic downturn, we just weren't
bloated like other companies,' says Kao.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (1):  Screeching halt
to expansion - Japanese companies are gasping for breath, searching for
direction, and looking fruitlessly for signs of recovery. But this time the
roots of recession are far more complex, and the solution that much more
elusive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPANESE industry is in recession. The long expansion of the late 1980s,
fueled by a passion among Japanese consumers for lavish spending, has come
to a screeching halt.
Inventories have risen high, capital spending is being cut. Production in
factories has slowed to a crawl. Overtime has been slashed and disposable
income is dropping. Corporate profits fell by an average of about 30 per
cent in the half year to September. Profits will be down for the second year
in a row this year, and could easily fall again next year.
The speed and extent of the turn-about has hit Japanese companies like a
powerful electric shock. They are gasping for breath, searching for
direction, and looking fruitlessly for signs of recovery.
The downturn is certainly the worst since the first oil shock in 1973, when
the sudden increase in oil prices sent industry into a tailspin. Yet, in
many ways, the experience this time around is far more frightening. In
earlier economic downturns it was at least possible to identify a clear
external cause, such as higher fuel costs or a sudden rise in the yen in
1985, and therefore easier to devise a well-focused solution.
This time the roots of recession are far more complex, and the solution that
much more elusive. Most fundamentally, the industrial recession is the
result of cyclical swings in investment and inventories. Yet, prospects for
recovery have been deeply clouded by the unknown, and unknowable, impact of
the precipitous decline in share and property prices that have undermined
consumer confidence and eroded the capital of Japan's banks. The banks are
unlikely to be able to support a vigorous recovery, even when recovery
eventually gets underway.
It is hard to imagine a more drastic shift of mood from the late 1980s. When
the Japanese government lowered interest rates in 1985 as part of a policy
co-ordinating effort with other industrial countries, a powerful economic
expansion was kindled. The stock market boom that was touched off made
millionaires overnight and reduced to nearly zero the real cost of raising
capital for many companies. With interest rates low and property and
financial assets soaring in value, Japanese consumers began to spend money
on everything from French impressionist paintings to Lexus luxury cars.
Yet, the result was a massive deception of most corporate planning
officials. Japanese companies were fooled by the cheap cost of capital in
the late 1980s and by the buoyancy of consumer demand. They assumed that the
good times would continue, and they put their cheap funds into building new
production capacity, some of which is only coming onstream today.
It was a year ago that inventories began to build up to dangerous levels,
yet - in part fooled by confident government predictions of a short, shallow
slowdown, based on assumptions that Japanese consumers with job security
would keep on spending money - companies failed to respond quickly enough by
cutting production.
Today, the results of accumulated mistakes in both the government and
private sector have come home to roost. Industrial production in October was
off 6 per cent compared to a year ago, roughly the average rate of decline
in the second and third quarters of the year. Yet shipments from producers
have fallen by less: 4.5 per cent in October and about 5 per cent in most
months. As a result, inventories have continued to rise from the elevated
levels of last year, delaying the day when production can be brought back to
normal levels and, in effect, prolonging the industrial recession.
The impact on industry has been severe. Many of Japan's most successful
companies are geared to a high growth strategy, in which expanding market
share and economies of scale achieved through rising production volumes were
the foundation of profitability. Now companies are paying high depreciation
charges after a surge of capital investment, and they are forced to maintain
idle workers because of permanent employment policies. By August, average
productivity in manufacturing had declined by 8 per cent since the start of
the year, according to the Japan Productivity Centre. In consumer
electronics the decline was 11.6 per cent, while productivity in the car
industry was off by 10.5 per cent.
Some companies have been badly hit. Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest
vehicle maker, has fallen into the red, as has Fujitsu, the world's
second-largest computer company. NEC, Japan's biggest semiconductor maker
which dominates the domestic personal computer market, expects to post a
consolidated loss for the year. Throughout the key industrial sectors of
electronics and cars - the pillars of Japan's post-war growth miracle -
profits are typically down by between 50 and 80 per cent.
The response to this decline has on occasions been sharp. In one of the most
extreme cases, Shintom, a mid-sized electronics company, permanently halted
production at its Kofu plant west of Tokyo, with the loss of 94 jobs.
Shintom's main business has been manufacturing video recorders that are sold
under other brand names overseas. However, with the video equipment market
in decline, and with the yen rising in value, Shintom found itself squeezed
out of the market and unable to continue. The company has shed 242 jobs in
the past year, bringing employment down to 540, and it is looking to shed
150 more job jobs through 'voluntary' retirement.
Shintom's actions stand out, however, precisely because they are so
exceptional. Mainstream Japanese companies under severe pressure have so far
stuck firmly to the most fundamental maxim of Japanese management: no
lay-offs. Permanent employment, promotion by seniority, relative equality of
income, little lateral job-hopping between companies - these are part of an
integrated set of employment practices now widely labelled as Japanese-style
management. For the most part, the response of Japanese companies has stayed
within this framework.
One common response has been to cut directors' pay and the pay of ordinary
employees will be next. Mr James Abegglan, chairman of Gemini Consulting and
a widely-recognised expert on Japanese management, says: 'If you want to ask
employees to take a cut in pay, you ask top management first.'
Mr Abegglan argues that because of the lack of hostile takeovers in Japan,
and the relative weakness of shareholders, Japanese companies can withstand
many years of low or no profits while they make a painful adaptation to
changing market conditions.
Mr Abegglan also dismisses widely-discussed suggestions that Japanese
companies have switched their focus away from growth and towards
profitability.
'This is nothing more than a reflection of a downturn. People forget that
the economy has gone through a crisis every four or five years for about as
long as anyone can remember.'
Over the years, Japan has proved adept at reshaping industry - at remaking
itself, rather than hanging on and subsidising outmoded and inefficient
businesses.
This is not to argue that Japanese industry will just sail through the
recession. Japan simply has too much capacity in electronics and cars, to
name but two industries. The inevitable cuts in capacity that lie ahead will
be neither pretty nor painless for the companies involved, as they slowly
shrink or seek new businesses.
Even this, however, must be regarded as the optimist's view of Japan's
near-term future. The pessimist's view is that sources of growth for Japan
have been deeply undermined. No one yet knows how far land prices will
continue to fall, or what the ultimate impact on the financial system will
be. Why should Japanese consumers return to the stores when their garages
already shelter relatively new cars, and they have two or three televisions
in the house?
Increased government spending will help, but only so far. And with
manufacturing capacity already in excess, there is little reason for
Japanese companies to go on a spending spree for new equipment any time
soon. Exports, particularly to other Asian countries, will help keep demand
steady but are unlikely to provide a strong enough stimulus to turn the
economy around.
Eventually, Japan's strengths - its well educated and highly motivated
workforce, its high savings rate - will emerge to support a strong
industrial economy again. The question is how long Japanese industry will
have to wait until it can perform up to potential.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Complaints about poor liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE investor who inherited his mother's investment portfolio, decided
to sell some of the assets. He was unable to find a buyer for his mother's
triple-A rated yankee bonds. The lead manager for the issue refused to quote
him a price.
Eventually, he rang up the treasurer at the company which had issued the
bond and complained - the issuer contacted the lead manager and told him to
do his job.
There are plenty of institutional investors who complain - usually
off-the-record - about the poor liquidity in the secondary market for
Eurobonds.
Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and currency, at Rothschild Asset
Management, says: 'In general with Eurobonds the bigger issues are preferred
to the smaller ones because of their greater after-market liquidity.'
A fund manager at one of the leading UK asset management groups, says:
'There are so many problems with liquidity. We usually set a minimum size of
issue which we are prepared to own.
'Often the problem is that when you want to buy a new issue, there are 20
market makers, but after six months the number of market-makers drops and
it's difficult to find anyone willing to quote a price for the issue.'
According to one fund manager's analysis, if you break down the fixed coupon
dollar Eurobond market into the number of market makers per issue, you find
that only 7 per cent of issues have 21 or more dealers, while 8 per cent
have between 11 and 20 dealers, and 59 per cent of the issues have fewer
than three dealers.
In addition, bid-offer spreads may widen considerably with time. For
example, Isveimer, the Italian state borrower, launched a USDollars 125m
floating-rate note in July which was recently quoted at a spread of
97.80-98.85 with one market maker. The wide spread indicates there is very
little trading in the bond.
Market makers tend to play down investors' complaints. Mr Jerry Goldstein,
chairman of the ISMA Council of Reporting Dealers and a director of Sanwa
International, claims 'institutional investors will always be able to get
immediate bids and offers in any trade from major market makers except maybe
in cases where you have very old bonds or bonds which don't trade very often
 -or when bond markets are very volatile'.
Investors eager to dump Ecu bonds this summer experienced such a problem.
When the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty on June 2, they sowed
confusion over European economic and monetary union. Investors were
desperate to sell their Ecu bonds, but at one stage found the market makers
were not prepared to quote prices.
Mr Goldstein points out anyone who is a lead manager or co-lead should be
prepared to make markets in an issue for at least a year. 'If they don't, it
is regrettable but I can't see any way of improving this situation,' he
says, although he is in favour of continued discussions with the
International Primary Market Association (Ipma) to try to improve these
guidelines.
Mr Peter Luthy of Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick, which advises on bond
investments but is not a market maker, points out it does not make sense -
economically - for market makers to continue making markets in each of the
stocks in which they were involved.
'There is no point (for the market maker) wasting time on issues which trade
only seldom. It would be very costly for the trader to stay aware of the
prices, to do all the research on the issue and constantly assess it.'
He maintains fund managers often make the mistake of buying paper without
considering its future liquidity. 'Investors should only buy something
illiquid if the yield is sufficient to justify the risk that they might have
to sell it later.'
Mr Goldstein recommends improving liquidity by encouraging borrowers to make
a regular appearance in the Eurobond market, going for large issues and, if
practical, fungible bonds (in other words, bonds with the exactly same terms
which count as one issue).
In practice, borrowers may be unwilling to use fungible issues, particularly
if bond yields are falling and they want to save costs by offering a smaller
coupon. And they are certainly unlikely to want to borrow more than they
actually need. However, investors acknowledge that issuers are making an
effort to launch bigger issues in order to improve liquidity in the
secondary market.
One fund manager at a UK insurance group says: 'Over the past few years,
average issue size has increased. Eurosterling bonds are normally about
Pounds 100m and that is considered a fairly good size. However, there are
very few Eurosterling issues of around Pounds 500m. The point is that in the
gilt market, a Pounds 500m issue would be considered an illiquid bond.'
Figures provided by Euroclear show that new issues - rather than existing
bonds - tend to be the most actively traded Eurobonds.
There's no doubt that investors generally find it easier to buy large
amounts of stock in the new issue market. But one fund manager says his
strategy is to ignore the new issue market and concentrate on the much older
issues which have been sold off cheaply.
'We feel that people are paying too high a price for liquidity,' he says.
Other investors who need to be able to sell their holdings at short notice
and at as high a price as possible, admit that they prefer to concentrate on
the more liquid government bond markets instead.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Risk and Reward: UK insurance groups see a brighter future
in derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME UK insurance companies are becoming big users of equity futures and
options. Protecting their solvency margins and making their investment
operations more efficient are things which derivatives should make easier.
Also, some of their latest investment products are derivatives-based.
Expected changes in regulations and a changing attitude on the part of the
insurers themselves, are likely to speed the process.
The insurers have a high proportion of their shareholders funds invested in
equities. This reflects the long-run out-performance of equities, and a
desire by insurers to protect their capital bases during periods of high
inflation.
Many use equity options to protect themselves against the devastation to
their solvency margin that a market collapse would cause.
'We do it from time to time to lock in a healthy level in the UK equity
market,' said Mr Mike Payne, investment director at Legal &amp; General. Royal
Insurance - whose solvency margin is under greater pressure than many other
insurers - and Commercial Union are others which follow this policy.
As the general level of share prices moves up, L&amp;G buys options to keep
raising the floor under its shareholders funds.
'There is a ratchet effect here,' says Mr Payne. Buying out-of-the-money
options (where the exercise price is well below market levels when the
option is bought) helps to keep down the cost of hedging. 'It's when you
protect at the money that you really have to pay. You have to self-insure
the first 100-point drop.'
Such prudence is not now rewarded under solvency regulations issued by the
Department of Trade and Industry, the insurers' regulator. The DTI specifies
which assets insurance companies can count towards their solvency margins,
and in what proportion. Last produced in 1981, these regulations have not
kept pace with the sort of financial instruments insurance companies now
use, and futures and options are not included in the list of recognised
assets.
So long as the stock market goes up, this does not present a significant
problem. If an insurer holds options that are considerably out of the money,
the market value of these assets is likely to be small in relation to the
equity holdings they are designed to protect.
Perhaps for that reason, insurers appear relatively unconcerned by the
outmoded regulations. However, if share prices fall, the value of the
options would quickly rise, making them a more significant part of the
insurers' capital base (this is why they are bought in the first place).
This anomaly is now the subject of discussion between the DTI and the
Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association. Amended
regulations are expected to recognise the use of derivatives to protect
solvency margins, so encouraging insurance companies to make greater use of
such instruments.
Insurers have become big users of equity derivatives to help them manage
their portfolios more effectively.
The Prudential is widely recognised as the company to have used derivatives
most extensively and for longest, though its approach is highly
conservative.
It uses stock index futures for two purposes, says Mr Rodney Dennis, of
Prudential Portfolio Managers: to make a change in asset allocation, and to
take a position in the equity market in advance of expected cash receipts.
The costs of shifting an exposure through futures is far smaller than
through an investment in the underlying stocks.
Taking into account commissions, stamp duty and the spread paid to market
makers, the Prudential reckons the cost of moving into and out of stocks at
1.9 per cent. A similar round trip in futures, it says, costs 0.054 per cent
(though futures contracts need to be rolled over every three months).
Futures are only used to make short-term shifts in asset allocation, though.
Nor does the Pru - or any other insurer - use futures or options to generate
better investment returns. It invests on fundamental views about particular
stocks or asset classes, looking to derivatives only as tools to help make
those selections.
Trying to enhance returns through derivative-based trading strategies 'is an
activity which doesn't appear to be a natural part of our business', Mr
Dennis says.
In spite of this, the investment products offered by insurers are likely to
become increasingly dependent on futures and options.
Retail futures funds may not have taken off, in spite of new regulations a
year ago; but many insurers have launched guaranteed equity products this
year, which give investors a proportion of any gains in the equity market,
plus their money back.
This is tantamount to selling investors an equity call option, with the rest
of their money placed on deposit.
Some insurers, such as Legal &amp; General, hedge their exposure under such
products internally through their investment funds. Others, if market talk
is to be believed, don't hedge at all. As such products become more common,
insurance companies' ability to price options, and to use the markets to
hedge, will become an important part of their investment skills.

banking

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTY-TWO banks have applied to set up offshore banking units in Thailand,
the central bank said. The applicants include 37 foreign institutions and
all 15 Thai commercial banks.
Thai officials are establishing the so-called Bangkok International Banking
Facility in an attempt to make Thailand a financial centre for Indochina and
Burma. However, some commercial bankers believe confusion over tax benefits
for the OBUs is to blame for a lukewarm international response.
All foreign banks which have applied for OBU licences hope to take advantage
of tax concessions, while those banks without branches in Thailand see the
move as a way of entering a restricted banking market.
'I look on this as a stepping stone for full branch status in two to three
years' time,' said Mr Anders Lundquist, chief of Skandinaviska-Enskilda
Banken's representative office in Bangkok.
Other commercial bankers believe the central bank is disappointed by the
number of applications and point to doubts about tax concessions.

FT  21 DEC 92 / US Money and Credit: Spotlight on Little Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the week before Christmas and all through the Treasury bond market
trading was light and lacklustre, with prices fluctuating in a narrow band
and much investor attention focused on Little Rock, site of an extraordinary
two-day economic talkathon.
President-elect Bill Clinton spent the first two days of last week as the
master of ceremonies in a televised confab that was originally billed as an
economic summit, then restyled for the American media as a retreat and which
ended up being a quintessentially CNN sort of media event.
Mr Clinton proved himself, once again, an able communicator, and even more
importantly he displayed a grasp of detail on economic and social policy
issues that dazzled much of the American media.
The Little Rock conference broke little new ground, but it was probably a
politically astute move for the coalition-building populist from Arkansas.
Mr Robert Brusca, the acerbic chief economist at Nikko Securities, called it
the 1990s economic counterpart to Woodstock.
The most important message to emerge from Little Rock, consistent with the
previous week's appointments of the Clinton economic team, was that the US
deficit matters.
And while that may seem self-evident to denizens of the money market,
getting the deficit issue on to CNN during 19 hours of live television is a
useful educational exercise for the American public.
The real issue now to be pondered is to what extent signs of a strengthening
recovery will allow the Clinton Administration to reduce the size of any
planned fiscal stimulus package. Or, in other words, will the Keynesians win
out in the short-term or not?
The bond market, while less than enthusiastic about Little Rock, is taking a
rather relaxed view on this matter, not least of all because interest rates
are low and the past week saw improving figures for housing starts and
industrial production in November.
On Friday there was little price movement in the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond, which was down by a mere  1/16 of a point, with a yield of 7.42 per
cent, compared to 7.43 per cent a week before.
Analysts at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette seemed unusually impressed that Mr
Clinton's cabinet appointments and the Little Rock summit showed the
incoming Clinton administration to be 'deeply committed to budget deficit
reduction'.
As a result DLJ predicted that bond yields would remain in a narrow range of
variation over the next few weeks, but could drop significantly in the next
three to six months.
This week sees two big Treasury auctions coming up. On Tuesday, the Treasury
is expected to auction Dollars 15.5bn of two-year notes and a day later it
will offer Dollars 11.25bn of five-year paper.
Also on the pre-Christmas agenda is a meeting of the Fed's Open Markets
Committee, which is likely to leave monetary policy on hold for the time
being.
Tomorrow's final third-quarter gross domestic product number is expected to
remain at the previously revised level of 3.9 per cent.
On Wednesday, comes the durable orders data for November, a volatile measure
in recent months that was up by 4.1% in October and which is likely to be
down by 1 to 2 per cent for November.
On the same day the leading economic indicators are expected to show a rise
of 0.3 per cent for November, against a 0.4 per cent increase in the
previous month.
So the debate on deficit reduction, fiscal stimuli and the path of the US
recovery is now shifting to a post-Christmas view of whether Mr Bill Clinton
will prove himself to be more of a Santa or a Scrooge on the macro-economic
front.
For the next instalment we will have to wait until after the holidays.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Australian Bonds: Question mark hangs over the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian credit markets moved into the traditional Christmas slowdown
last week with few economic indicators to chew on, but with a question mark
hanging over them: has the long rally in bond yields ended, or is the market
simply drawing breath?
Trading has been subdued since the last easing of monetary policy in June,
when a 75 basis point cut in official interest rates to 5.75 per cent marked
the 12th successive reduction since rates peaked at 18 per cent in January
1990.
The move triggered a rally which reduced the 10-year bond yield to 9.3 per
cent, a cut of nearly five percentage points since the rally began in 1989.
At the short end, the 90-day bond dipped briefly below 5.5 per cent before
slipping back in August to just below 6 per cent. Since then, rates have
hardly moved, and the only excitement has been the fortnightly instalment of
the federal government's ADollars 18bn bond tender programme.
One reason for the apparent plateau is that the domestic economy continues
to perform sluggishly, and most analysts say traders are increasingly
worried that growth may fizzle out next year. There appeared to be few
supporters for the upbeat view expressed on Friday by Mr Bernie Fraser, the
Reserve Bank governor, that growth in gross domestic product was likely to
reach 4 per cent by the end of 1993.
By contrast, Mr Ralph Willis, the finance minister, admitted on the same day
that the government may have to reduce its own tentative forecast of 3 per
cent growth for 1992-93
Some private forecasters are even more pessimistic. Ms Ivana Bottini, a
Citibank economist, points out that Australia needs 4 per cent growth in GDP
to cut unemployment, currently at a post-war record of 11.4 per cent.
In the face of slow overseas growth and the depressing effect of high
unemployment on domestic demand, Australia faces a danger of moving back
into recession in the middle of next year, says Ms Bottini.
Even the good news does not look as good as it did. The long rally was
underpinned by a steady fall in the rate of inflation from more than 8 per
cent in 1989 to 0.8 per cent in June.
However, the authorities have been unable to reduce interest rates further
because of the weakness of the Australian dollar, which has depreciated by
more than 13 per cent on a trade weighted basis over the past 12 months.
That may change over the next three months if the Labor government decides
to cut interest rates further in a last ditch attempt to stimulate economic
growth before the next federal election, due by June.
For that reason, the bond curve may steepen in 1993 as short yields fall in
anticipation of an easing of monetary policy. But uncertainty is likely to
cause the yield curve to move up and flatten once the election campaign gets
under way.
In the longer term, investors will be watching for signs of sustained
economic recovery, continued low inflation and political stability. Traders
say a resumption of the rally is possible if all those factors emerge,
especially if the currency stabilises and foreign investors return to the
market.

FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Gilts: Hopes on inflation soften yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YIELDS moved slightly downwards as gilt practitioners weighed the
contrasting signs about future inflation trends with the implications of the
large volume of funding expected over the next 12 months.
The welter of economic statistics published last week gave few further clues
about the degree to which Britain is emerging from recession. Though many
believe that a recovery will become established in the next six months,
there are few unambiguous signs about whether an upturn has started.
On balance, last week's data probably further encouraged the belief among
some UK investors that the next few months will be a good time for bond
purchases.
There were few indications that - once Christmas is over - people would
return to the shops in droves to push up consumer spending significantly.
Nor did the latest survey of manufacturing trends by the Confederation of
British Industry do much to encourage any thoughts that UK factories were
about to see a spurt in activity.
Lending by Britain's banks and building societies to the private sector fell
by Pounds 600m last month, reversing a strong Pounds 5.1bn increase in
October and adding to the general uncertainty about an upturn. November also
saw a bigger than expected increase of 41,000 in unemployment, bringing the
total to 2.91m.
The run of figures encouraged the view that inflationary pressures are
extremely fragile, and was probably behind the small drop in yields of about
10 basis points shown by most classes of gilts during the week in generally
thin trading.
Even though many believe inflationary pressures will exert themselves once a
recovery gets under way, on the basis of the recent evidence gilt yields
will continue to fall gradually over the next few weeks, with a
corresponding small increase in prices.
One factor expected to place a floor under yields is the Pounds 1bn or so of
gilts that the Bank of England will probably issue every month in the
1993-94 financial year, due to the need to finance increasing state
borrowing.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburgh Securities, wants the Bank to
re-examine its system of gilt auctions to enable this large amount of stock
to be sold as efficiently as possible, without leading to large drops in
gilt prices.
A reminder that demand for gilts in recent months has fallen among overseas
investors - even while UK investors have remained reasonably enthusiastic
about the instruments - came with news from the Central Statistical Office
that investment in UK stocks and securities by non-UK organisations in the
third quarter came to just Pounds 1.3bn.
This lowest quarterly figure since late 1990 was due largely to the big
fall-off in overseas purchases of gilts.
Meanwhile the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in
comments last week about the UK economy, illustrated the uncertainties of
predicting the inflation pattern over the next year.
The 24-nation group said that 'inflation is projected to rise in the near
term' due to the effects of higher import prices arising from sterling's
devaluation. However, it is 'expected to recede again' given the large slack
in the economy.
Accordingly, the organisation expects inflation, as measured by the deflator
in growth of nominal gross domestic product, to climb from a low 3.9 per
cent in the second half of this year to a somewhat high 5.7 per cent in the
first half of next year.
On the OECD's projections, inflation would then fall by the end of 1994 to
roughly the current figure, with the numbers for the six-month periods
starting in the second half of 1993 being forecast at 4.6 per cent, 4 per
cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.

FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Maverick Minebea bears down on profits
recovery - Policy changes at a group that was one of Japan's post-war
industrial success stories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Minebea, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings and one of Japan's
post-war industrial success stories, appeared to be an endearing maverick
for which nothing could go wrong, not its sud den move into selling
cosmetics door-to-door nor even an excursion into Canadian pig farming.
However, 'Minebea calling' never quite became a household phrase and the
Canadian pig farmers found themselves knee-deep in losses, which contributed
to the company's consolidated loss of Y13.6bn (Dollars 109.3m) in the year
ended September, the first since its founding in 1951.
Minebea accepts these ventures may not have provided much synergy with
bearings, but the company does take exception to suggestions that another
cause of its troubles was an over-reliance on zaiteku, the financial
engineering particularly popular during the late 1980s.
The company provided against securities appraisal losses of Y2.9bn in the
first half, but Mr Ryusuke Mizukami, general manager of corporate planning,
said conclusions drawn in the Japanese press about Minebea's fondness for
financial engineering were unfair.
'They put us in the same category as companies which were very heavily
involved in zaiteku. We do have a big stock appraisal loss, but we had made
a decision not to buy shares for the purposes of making money during the
bubble period. We bought Tokyo Power shares, but at that time, the price was
much higher than the present price,' Mr Mizukami said.
Falling Tokyo stock prices certainly dented the parent company's current
stock assets, which have a book value of Y43.8bn, and a market value at the
end of September of only Y27.4bn. Meanwhile, Japanese banks, now painfully
aware of lending risk, are wary of zaiteku companies and of those struggling
to stay out of the red.
'We certainly didn't want to report a shameful big loss, and our president
has been touring the country explaining the situation,' Mr Mizukami said.
'Our banks will be more cautious if we report more losses, so we are
concentrating on profit recovery.'
Sales of core industrial products have risen in the first few weeks of the
present year, Mr Mizukami says, and the loss-making hog farm and cosmetics
business have been closed. But Minebea insists it is not restructuring or
going back to basics, and will maintain its diverse interests in kimonos and
consumer credit.
In sifting through the diversifications, Minebea is undergoing a painful
re-evaluation of investment decisions made by its late head, Mr Takami
Takahashi, who fostered the remarkable growth of the bearing business, but
also indulged himself in a boyhood ambition to raise pigs.
When establishing a bearings mother factory outside Tokyo, the company
bought an adjoining tract of land with the intention of creating a pig farm,
a plan shelved after opposition from the local council.
After more frustration in Thailand, Mr Takahashi's ambition was ultimately
fulfilled in 1989, the year of his death, when Northern Manitoba Breeders
was founded in Canada.
Minebea owes much to Mr Takahashi for taking the bearing production to
Thailand in 1982, before it became fashionable to establish offshore bases.
Of a monthly output of just over 80m bearings, 60m are produced in Thailand
and 20m in Singapore, plus smaller quantities in Japan and the UK, where it
bought Rose Bearings in 1988.
The acquisition and diversification drive by Mr Takahashi, who bought 22
companies in 15 years, was done in the belief that size itself is an
important asset in Japan.
He explained that 'big industries generally enjoy advantages or profits from
their superior positions', though he, perhaps, did not fully recognise the
danger of low-yielding assets weighing heavily on the balance sheet.
'Bearings are still our key product. Electronics-related products are very
important,' Mr Mizukami said. Last year, sales of bearings, electronic
devices, and machinery components accounted for 80 per cent of the total,
while those of others fell by 72 per cent.
Total sales were down by 2.4 per cent to Y278.7bn, far below the company's
long-cherished target of Y1,000bn.
Much of Minebea's future profitability will depend on the fate of NMB
Semiconductor, an increasing burden on the group since its founding in 1984.
NMB was focused on the memory chip market, weak for much of the past two
years, but stronger recently, thanks to a recovery in US personal computer
demand and a US dumping action against South Korean producers.
The Japanese electronics industry, generally, has suffered because of
over-capacity and over-ambitiousness in semiconductor production, leading to
unexpectedly weak prices for the present generation of 4Mbit memory chips.
'Semiconductors were a very bad area for us last year. No company did well
out of semiconductors,' Mr Mizukami said. 'We are able to make 16Mbit chips,
but we are not going to compete with people like Fujitsu, NEC and Toshiba to
make a 256Mbit chip.'
Mr Goro Ogino, Minebea's president, has taken personal responsibility for
turning NMB around, but the company is still a regular source of M&amp;A rumours
in Japan, with persistent suggestions that Intel of the US, its partner in a
project to make flash memory chips, may be a buyer.
The rumours are denied by Minebea, which is hopeful the growing variety of
NMB products will ensure its profitability, as will an eventual recovery in
the international economy.
Similar hopes are held for Minebea Credit, a financial subsidiary bruised by
the collapse of property prices and an increase in personal bankruptcies.
'We see no fundamental problems at Minebea Credit. Consumer credit is about
two thirds of the business, and this doesn't involve such big amounts.
'We are not like the non-banks who lent for speculative activity. About a
third was real estate-related, and while there are some small problems,
there are no serious problems,' Mr Mizukami explained.

FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Israel bank share sale heavily
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Shk150m (Dollars 58m) public share issue by the First International Bank
of Israel was some 400 times oversubscribed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange,
testifying to pent-up demand for stock in the country's banks, most of which
are majority-held by the government.
Initial counts showed applications for the issue totalled about Shk60bn.
Taken with a Shk100m offering placed with institutions, the issue amounts to
a 20 per cent share in Fibi, Israel's fifth largest bank which is controlled
by the Safra family of New York.
The issue underlined the market's impatience for the government to sell its
majority holdings in the four senior banks - Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi,
Israel Discount Bank and Bank Mizrahi - on the stock exchange.
Last month, the state's 42 per cent share in IDB Holding, the investment arm
of Israeli Discount Bank, was successfully floated on the exchange, raising
Dollars 350m in another heavily oversubscribed issue.
However, the government's strategy of selling by private tender controlling
shares in the core banks has come unstuck. Last week, the Bank of Israel
refused to issue a banking permit to Mr Gad Ze'evi who had an agreement with
the government to buy a controlling stake in Bank Mizrahi. First
International Bank , traditionally the most profitable of the five main
banks, aims to use the funds raised in the issue in its bid to buy Bank
Igud, an offshoot of Bank Leumi being sold separately by the government.

MEMBERS of the Chicago Board of Trade have defeated a plan to build a
trading facility on property adjacent to the LaSalle Street futures
exchange.
Exchange members have said the Dollars 150m proposal was too costly,
considering the declining profitability of small member firms. But exchange
officials said the rapid growth of CBOT financial futures products would be
stifled if the trading floor was not expanded.
Mr William O'Connor, CBOT chairman said: 'This vote means that our members
want the leadership of this exchange to explore other means of developing a
new trading facility, and that is what we will do.'
Mr O'Connor will leave his post as chairman in January.
Air Canada would post a loss of about CDollars 300m (USDollars 234.3m) for
1992 after restructuring charges, and 1993 will again be turbulent, Mr
Hollis Harris, president, predicted, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
In 1992 Air Canada lost CDollars 218m, as it began a fare war with its rival
Canadian Airlines, owned by PWA in Calgary. Both airlines have been ordered
by the federal government to reduce capacity and cease the damaging fare
war.
Air Canada is trying to complete a joint venture takeover of Continental
Airlines in the US and marketing agreements with United Airlines and Air
France, while PWA is negotiating a marketing and financial deal with
American Airlines.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: RJB plans flotation for greater
flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the open-cast coal mining group, plans a flotation next year
with a value at over Pounds 100m. It has appointed Barclays de Zoete Wedd as
financial advisers, and BZW's broking arm de Zoete &amp; Bevan as broker to the
issue.
The aim of the float is greater financial flexibility, enabling, for
example, a bid for parts of British Coal. A bid could be made for some of
the 31 collieries whose future is currently being reviewed by a Commons
select committee.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said it 'will provide us with additional
funding flexibility as we look for further expansion opportunities'. These
could stem from the coming liberalisation in the coal industry. In the past
Mr Budge said he could run British Coal's pits more cheaply, cutting 20 per
cent from costs.
In 1991 RJB made turnover of Pounds 76m and operating profits of Pounds 15m.
Its operations, which began in 1974, are entirely in the UK. It runs 11
opencast and one deep mine. It is also involved in private mining under
licence and in all has interests in about 2m tonnes of coal reserves. Its
other operations include coal washing and land reclamation.
RJB was the subject of a Pounds 106.5m management buy-out in February from
AF Budge, the private construction company headed by Mr Tony Budge, the
brother of Richard. AF Budge went into receivership earlier this month.
The mbo was financed with Pounds 45m of equity from a consortium including
Schroder Ventures, Midland Montagu Ventures, Charterhouse Development
Capital and Prudential Venture Managers. Some of the equity investors are
expected to stay with RJB after the float. Mr Richard Budge and the senior
management are also shareholders.
Trading starts today in the shares of International Food Machinery which has
joined the official list through a Pounds 3.9m placing at 51p a share. IFM
trades in used food processing machinery mainly for the meat and bakery
trades. The money is to purchase JH Food Machinery, which specialises in
fish processing machinery, and to restructure working capital. IFM's market
value is Pounds 8m.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Baldwin makes offer for the
balance of Simpsons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALDWIN, the group whose activities cover holidays, printing and property,
has announced an unconditional offer to buy any remaining shares in Simpsons
of Cornhill, owner of the City chop house in which it recently acquired
majority control.
The paper offer of one Baldwin share for every two Simpsons values the
restaurant company at Pounds 1.68m, or 37p per share. When the company was
floated on the USM last year investors paid 50p per share.
Since the bid was first announced last month holders of 62.8 per cent of the
ordinary and 450,000 of the 'A' shares, or 75 per cent, have accepted.
The latest move could signal the end of any remaining resistance to the
offer from the rebel group which earlier this year tried to oust the
Simpsons board.
The directors expect, through the enlarged group, to be allowed to expand
the restaurants business in London and the south east.
In addition to Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn in the City, the company also
owns two central London bistros and has management contracts to operate
other eateries such as the Gay Hussar.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thai Airways bond issue to
purchase new aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAI Airways International intends to issue Y20bn (Pounds 105.8m) of Samurai
bonds in 1993 or early 1994 and to seek Dollars 144m (Pounds 94.7m) in loan
guarantees from the US Eximbank to finance the purchase of new aircraft, the
company said.
According to Thai's firm order delivery plan, four new aircraft are due to
be delivered in calendar 1993 - two Airbus A300-600R, one Boeing 747-400 and
one Boeing 737-400.
A total of 25 new aircraft with firm orders are scheduled for delivery
before the end of 1997.
Thai said its investment budget for the current fiscal year, ending
September 30 1993 was Bt10bn, only a third of last year's figure.
Since the civilian government wrested control of Thai from the air force in
September, the new management has begun to rationalise the fleet, retiring
its DC-10 and BAe146 aircraft and cutting seat-kilometres flown by four per
cent.
The state sold 7 per cent of Thai to the public earlier this year, and hopes
to sell another 14 per cent when stock market conditions are favourable. The
shares are currently languishing below the 60-baht initial public offering
price.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: City welcomes electricity sale -
Welsh Water can now change its direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's sale by Welsh Water of its 14.9 per cent stake in South Wales
Electricity is a mark of how serious the company has become about putting
its house in order ahead of the 1994-95 review by Ofwat, the regulatory
authority, which will decide pricing levels until the end of the decade.
The move should blunt criticism of Welsh's ambitious diversification policy.
It follows a decision in June to voluntarily give up some price increases,
ahead of other water companies, and silence critics of its profit levels.
The electricity stake was always controversial, even though Welsh made more
than Pounds 17m profit on the investment. Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman,
claimed the two utilities could make savings by combining functions like
billing and information technology. Unfortunately, in the narrow world of
Welsh business, the aggressive style in which the stake was taken led South
Wales to treat it as hostile and reject all advances on co-operation.
Welsh's decision to sell was welcomed in the City, which feared the
company's expansion plans could lead to conflict with Ofwat. 'It shows it is
possible to admit you've got something wrong and get out with credit,'
according to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, analyst at County NatWest.
The sale clears the way for Welsh to change direction on its unregulated
business. Mr Jones steps down as chairman in April and strategy will be led
by his successor, Mr Iain Evans, and group managing director Mr Graham
Hawker.
Welsh's unregulated business, which includes engineering consultant Wallace
Evans, hotel and leisure group Hamdden and an 'enterprise' company with
pipeline and waste contracting, will probably become lower key. Plans to
develop Hamdden are likely to remain on hold. Some analysts believe Welsh
would sell the division if hotel prices had not fallen so much.
This will leave Welsh to concentrate on its core, regulated business ahead
of Ofwat's review and gradually develop its enterprise businesses, most of
which were spun out of the core following privatisation and are lower risk.
According to Mr Hawker: 'We intend to give our non-regulated businesses more
focus, and only in areas where our core skills are relevant'.
Most analysts agree that because Welsh's capital investment targets were
less onerous than others, its price rises agreed at privatisation were
generous. Its post-1995 price increases, initially set at 5 per cent above
inflation, look vulnerable to regulatory review.
The electricity sale, and the voluntary abatement of some price increases
earlier this year, will go some way towards improving Welsh's regulatory
image. 'This reduces the chances of them being harshly treated at the
review, although they are not totally out of the woods,' one analyst said.
The sale may also mark a watershed for the water sector generally. Because
the regulated environment is expected to become tougher following Ofwat's
review, companies argue that unregulated businesses will become more
important as a source of profits to maintain dividend growth.
Welsh's expansion outside water-related fields was the most high profile,
but few other water companies have been successful developing non-core
businesses.
Some, such as Southern Water, are making profits from businesses like
pipe-laying which have been transferred out of the core. But others, Severn
Trent among them, which expanded more aggressively have yet to make money.
Severn Trent last year paid Pounds 212m for Biffa, involved in waste
management, and which is expected to make operating profits of about Pounds
12m this year, compared to interest costs of Pounds 25m.
Main problem with Biffa, and engineering ventures made by other companies,
is the recession. Welsh regularly complained that some of its enterprise
businesses were at the start up stage and during recession should not be
expected to make money.
Because of the pressure to maintain dividend growth, water companies will
continue to try and develop unregulated businesses, even moving into
unrelated fields. However, following Welsh's tactical withdrawal, companies
are unlikely to make high-profile acquisitions to diversify ahead of the
1994 review.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Driving force behind mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY restructuring remains an important driving force behind many
international mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen.
British Airways furthered its ambitions to be a truly global airline by
winning with its bid for a 25 per cent stake in Australia's Qantas.
Italian flag carrier Italia is joining in the trend for airlines to strike
alliances by taking a 30 per cent stake in Malev, Hungary's national
carrier.
In the financial services sector, Arthur Andersen, the international
accountancy firm, announced an affiliation agreement with Asahi Shinwa of
Japan, paving the way for a full merger.
Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurance company, started its planned series of
disposals with the sale of Prolific, its UK life insurance subsidiary, to
Scottish Provident.
Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals and scientific group, continued with its
restructuring by selling its UK consumer healthcare business to Hoffman-La
Roche of Switzerland. The demand for a stake in the over-the-counter market
was reflected in the generous price paid.
Tesco's acquisition of the Catteau supermarket chain in France, giving it a
toe-hold in Europe, is being taken as an indication that the major UK
retailers will expand into Europe as their home market becomes saturated.
Tesco said Catteau represented an excellent opportunity to acquire a French
retailer in the same sector as its own core business, and that the
combination of existing management's local experience and Tesco's expertise
will further enhance Catteau's growth prospects.
The third round of bidding in the privatisation of Argentina's gas industry
saw British Gas double the size of its global gas division as the consortium
it led won the auction for Distribuidora de Gas Metropolitana, the country's
largest gas distributor.

FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: CU decides to cut pay-outs on
with-profit life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, the composite insurer, is to cut pay-outs on with-profit
life policies.
However, it will maintain annual bonuses on the policies, in a move which
goes against the declared intentions of many of its rivals.
Actuaries for several large life insurers, including Standard Life and
Norwich Union, had made it clear that cuts in annual or reversionary
bonuses, which are declared each year and then cannot be taken away, could
be necessary this year.
This follows several years of indifferent investment returns compared to
those achieved in the mid-1980s.
But CU, the first life office to announce its bonuses for 1993, may have
damaged what appeared to be a comfortable industry consensus. This should
allow it to maintain a high position in competitive league tables of
with-profits performance, which is vital for distributing through
independent brokers.
However, CU has also cut the amount it pays in 'terminal bonus' which is
added at the end of a policy. This means that total pay-outs on a typical
policy will drop by around 4 per cent - still less than some observers have
predicted.
It is also cutting the interim reversionary bonus, appliable for those who
die during the next year, from 5 per cent of the underlying sum assured to
4.5 per cent.
The company admits that this indicates that bonuses can be expected to fall
next year.
CU says that it may be drawing slightly on the reserves of its life fund to
pay the bonus.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Lucas engineers a defence against short-term views: How the
group has allowed itself to become a takeover prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS, one of the UK's biggest and most technologically-successful
engineering companies, is on full bid alert.
The Midlands-based group is the City's favourite candidate for takeover, now
recession has slashed its profits and a long-planned succession of senior
management has collapsed.
Lucas shares touched a five-year low of 78p in September, valuing the group
at a mere Pounds 550m - less than half its pre-recession peak in 1989. They
have since recovered to 132p, fuelled mainly by speculation that the group
is vulnerable to predators such as BTR, the acquisitive industrial
conglomerate which last year snapped up the recession-struck Hawker
Siddeley, another famous name in British engineering.
Sir Anthony Gill, Lucas's 62-year-old chairman and chief executive, is
philosophical about the prospect of a bid, but unapologetic about the
group's record: 'People who own us have that decision to make, if it is
presented to them. I hope that they will decide to keep us independent.' To
retain that independence, Lucas, already advised by Schroders, recently
added the US investment bank Goldman Sachs to its team. The core of its
strategy will be a defence of the group's long-term record of investment,
which it says has put it in the world's top three suppliers for its chosen
sectors of automotive and aerospace components, such as braking and diesel
fuel injection systems.
Sir Anthony says: 'There isn't another company quite like us in the UK - our
competitors are in Japan and Germany. Getting the long-term things right
makes the difference between whether the company does well or not. We do
have the problem - which I'm not trying to whinge about - that we are judged
by short-term standards. One year's pre-tax profits figure - that's at the
margin of what we are doing.'
The chairman points to Lucas's consistent record of growth in profits,
earnings, and dividends until the present recession started: 'There's no
reason why we can't get back to the sort of margins we were making then.'
He adds: 'In the first and second years of the recession our sales went up,
when other people's went down, and our profits were lower than other
people's.
'The main reason was that we went on with engineering expenditure to take
market share and win new contracts, some of which we haven't got income from
yet. We could easily have battened down the hatches, not gone for new
business, sacked our engineers - we didn't do that. We don't regret not
doing that.'
Sir Anthony was determined not to repeat the mistake which Lucas made during
the last recession at the beginning of the 1980s, when it cut research and
development spending - and lost market share to Bosch in two crucial product
areas, anti-lock braking systems and petrol fuel injection systems, in which
the German group is now world leader.
He says: 'Although we are now at least the equal to Bosch in technology, we
have a smaller market share. We see the present recession within that
context: it is a challenge to continue to manage our resources of people and
cash for the future, but resist cutting back where that would mortgage our
future.'
Lucas has been reducing costs. In October the group said it had started a
three-year restructuring programme to shed 4,000 jobs, half of them in the
UK, to bring the workforce below 50,000, compared with more than 57,000 two
years ago. Although Sir Anthony says this is strategic reshaping, analysts
disagree, and accuse him of being slower to respond to the downturn than
rivals such as GKN, BBA and T&amp;N.
In curious contrast to Sir Anthony's emphasis on the company's investment
record, Lucas also says recent high levels of R&amp;D - about Pounds 100m
annually over the last three years - and capital spending at twice the rate
of depreciation, are both set to fall, as programmes are completed.
The group's main area of vulnerability, though, is its failure to manage the
succession to Sir Anthony. He had been due to retire this year, but has now
agreed to remain as chief executive for another year and as chairman until
1994.
In February, Mr Tony Edwards, head of the aerospace division, was made chief
executive designate. In March Mr David Hankinson, then finance director who
had been considered for the top job, left with compensation of Pounds
352,000 to give Mr Edwards a clear run in his new role. In August Mr Edwards
was told the board did not consider him to be suitable for the top post as
chairman. In October he moved to rival TI Group.
Lucas last month appointed Mr Frank Turner, from Rolls-Royce, to head its
aerospace group - but it has gone back to the drawing board in the search
for both chief executive and chairman.
Sir Anthony denies any reluctance to hand over the reins of the group he has
dominated for years. 'Just ask my wife about that,' he says grimly,
explaining that he had promised her he would retire this year.
While he remains in his job, he is haunted by the example of Hawker
Siddeley, which last autumn depressed the market with a gloomy trading
statement. The next day BTR pounced.
With that example in mind, Lucas was careful to accentuate the positive when
announcing its annual results in October. It dipped into reserves to keep a
7p total dividend, and expects to generate enough profits in the year to
July 31 to cover a maintained pay-out of Pounds 50m. Analysts are sceptical,
given that the group has said the first half is likely to be flat. However,
the group is confident that it will achieve its target of Pounds 100m from
disposals in the current year.
Sir Anthony had a personal interest in the fate of Hawker, in the shape of
Mr Alan Watkins, who joined it as chief executive from Lucas two years
before BTR's bid. He said: 'Poor Alan Watkins took a bit of the Lucas
culture with him. The market is very, very impatient and when they did not
see enough happening, they persecuted him and did not give him the benefit
of the doubt. I hope they would give us the benefit of the doubt, because
what we are doing is consistent with what we said we would do.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Honda and Isuzu to sell each other's vehicles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HONDA Motor and Isuzu Motor, the Japanese carmakers, have agreed to sell
each other's vehicles following Isuzu's decision last week to halt
production of passenger cars.
The agreement marks another step in the consolidation of the Japanese car
industry, which is struggling under a burden of vast excess production
capacity.
Under the agreement, dealers of each company will be able to offer a broader
range of vehicles to their customers, while providing expanded sales outlets
for each company.
The agreement also remedies an important strategic weakness of Honda, which
had nothing to offer in the area of recreational vehicles, one of the few
growing areas of the car market in North America.
Honda is to sell the Isuzu Rodeo, a recreational vehicle, under its own
label in North America. Honda has long talked about offering recreational
vehicles to its customers, but balked at the cost and time needed to develop
a suitable product in an area where it had no experience.
The vehicles are produced in Indiana, in the US.
Isuzu, for its part, will begin to market Honda's small passenger cars under
its own label in Japan as it phases out production of its own cars. Isuzu
will also halt the supply of small cars to General Motors, which owns a 37
per cent stake in the company.
Isuzu has operated in the red for the past two years.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Nedlloyd board tells Hagen to resign

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Netherlands' largest transport group, and its dissident
shareholder Mr Thorsten Hagen, appear poised for another protracted battle.
The company's supervisory board has called for Mr Hagen to vacate his seat
on it immediately.
The highly unusual demand was a direct and swift response to the Norwegian
investor's public request last week for an extraordinary shareholder meeting
to consider radical changes in the way the supervisory board is elected.
Mr Hagen was reluctantly admitted to the supervisory board earlier this year
after a long and celebrated dispute.
Nedlloyd said Mr Hagen's call for the extraordinary shareholder meeting
violated promises he made to support the board and to uphold its strategy
for turning around the loss-making company.
Mr Hagen, who controls 25 per cent of Nedlloyd through shares and options,
was unavailable for comment on his next move.
Under Dutch law, his fellow board members can suspend him from his duties,
but any dismissal will have to be sought through the courts, a procedure
that would take months and would help to fan the animosity between the two
sides.
Ironically, the supervisory board had been forced to go to court earlier
this year to get Mr Hagen admitted to the board in the first place after the
company's works council tried to block his appointment.
Nedlloyd and Mr Hagen have clashed repeatedly over his arguments that the
company should pursue a policy of rapid and heavy divestments.
The latest dispute between Nedlloyd and Mr Hagen was sparked by the
Norwegian investor's surprise call last week for an extraordinary
shareholder meeting to discuss far-reaching changes in the company's
articles of association and the dismantling of various anti-takeover
defences.
His main target was the supervisory board itself, which he describes as an
entrenched body and which he argues should be elected by shareholders.
The board said it will respond to Mr Hagen's request for an extraordinary
shareholders meeting in the first half of January.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Economics Notebook: Exchanges spurn much-vaunted Maastricht
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE days ago in Edinburgh, European Community leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to the Maastricht economic convergence criteria as part of the
EC's drive towards economic and monetary union.
The intervening days have shown just how irrelevant these criteria are to
the foreign exchange markets which act as the judges of one nation's
economic standing against another.
For if the Maastricht criteria, with their insistence on low inflation and
sound budgetary policies were any guide, the D-Mark would have been under
pressure to devalue in the European exchange rate mechanism last week and
not the French franc.
Developments in the ERM since September have gone a long way to justify the
criticism of Sir Alan Walters, Mrs Thatcher's economic adviser when she was
prime minister, that the European Monetary System is 'half baked' and doomed
to instability.
The system has certainly been inhospitable to France, which fulfils the
Maastricht criteria more fully than any other big EC nation.
France has pushed its annual inflation rate a good percentage point below
that of Germany to well below 3 per cent.
It meets the Maastricht requirement of having a budget deficit of less than
3 per cent of gross domestic product.
It has been categorised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development as a 'low debt country'.
France's reward has been to suffer repeated speculative selling of the franc
over the past three months that has forced it to have higher short- and
long-term interest rates than Germany.
It might be argued that this is not the fault of the ERM, but of financial
markets.
The markets see, rightly, that France may be heading into a period of
political uncertainty ahead of the March national assembly elections.
They believe, probably wrongly, that the D-Mark is a more credible currency
than the franc because it has never devalued.
But the French franc's problems should also be telling the EC's policy
makers that the Maastricht convergence criteria are too crude a yardstick if
the ERM is to continue to act as a glide path to Emu.
Because of events since September, some EC monetary experts believe
convergence should be considered over a far wider spectrum of economic
activity than laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.
Largely ignored so far, is the very wide gulf that exists between economic
interests and aspirations of the low-inflation countries grouped around
Germany and the EC's poorer peripheral nations such as Spain, Portugal,
Greece, Ireland and, it must be said, Britain.
The former group increasingly are 'rentier' societies with financial assets
spread widely through the population and an interest in preserving the value
of those assets through price stability.
For the other group, a main attraction of EC membership should be the
opportunity of faster growth: an opportunity that has been frustrated by
high German interest rates over the past year.
At the micro-economic end of the spectrum are the different national
techniques of monetary policy and monetary policy instruments, where the
recent experiences of France and the UK point to future problems on the way
to Emu.
One reason France has been able to fend off the speculators has been the
ability of the Bank of France to defend the franc with high interest rates
while sheltering its domestic economy from the effects of such measures.
In September, when the franc was under its heaviest selling pressure, the
Bank of France made sure it supplied sufficient liquidity in its money
market operations for normal domestic needs at the intervention rate of 9.60
per cent. But it pushed up its emergency rate at which it lends against
collateral for five to 10 days to 13 per cent from 10.5 per cent.
This move to make speculation against the franc more expensive was
reinforced by a particularly fastidious choice of the securities that banks
could offer for francs in the repurchase arrangements. Many speculators
wanting francs to sell were therefore forced on to the domestic money
market, where rates rose to more than 30 per cent. During this period the
banks were able to hold their rates stable for their domestic clients.
Such an approach was impossible for the UK authorities in September. The
government floated the pound on Black Wednesday when it became clear that
the announcement of 15 per cent base rates had failed to stop the selling of
sterling. It knew that the high interest rate would have been passed on
almost immediately by banks and building societies to their customers.
The UK has a banking system that is far more market-oriented than some on
the continent. UK banks pay market or near market rates on the great bulk of
their liabilities. They no longer have a significant income endowment from
non-interest bearing current accounts. As a result, Bank of England actions
in the money market are almost immediately reflected in the UK banks'
interest rate structure.
France's recent experience has shown that fulfilling the Maastricht criteria
is no safeguard against speculative attack. If Britain were to rejoin the
ERM with the Maastricht criteria fulfilled, it would, in conditions such as
the past three months, presumably have a difficult struggle to maintain
sterling's parity. The UK's money market structure and system of interest
rate determination would make it less likely that the UK could win that
battle than France so far this year.
So long as the ERM retains its present characteristics, eventual UK re-entry
would therefore seem to involve an unpalatable choice. Either Britain would
have to accept that sterling was more vulnerable than other currencies
because of its financial system. Or it would have to change that system,
even though it has evolved to suit best the needs of the UK economy.
These are big issues and they throw yet another question mark against the
EC's goal of moving rapidly to Emu by 1999 at the latest.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Isosceles recruits Storehouse director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain,
will announce the appointment of Mr David Simons, finance director of
Storehouse, as group chief executive this week.
The news should coincide with a standstill agreement with its 38 banks,
expected on Tuesday. The standstill will defer interest payments running at
Pounds 9m a month, and principal repayments due in the spring. The group has
loans of Pounds 1bn from banks and Pounds 375m from mezzanine lenders.
Unusually under the standstill banks will give up their 'on demand' rights,
which should reassure Gateway's suppliers to continue extending trade
credit. At any time Gateway can have more than Pounds 300m of stock on
credit. Without the standstill Gateway could go into receivership, risking
40,000 jobs.
If agreed, the standstill would give Isosceles, its banks and shareholders
six months to arrange a financial restructuring tied to a strategy for the
group, which is being advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the management
consultants.
A business plan should be finalised by the end of January. The banks have
already been persuaded that Gateway's performance can be rapidly improved
through relatively low-cost actions such as tightening control of stock,
shrinkage and wages. Despite its problems, Gateway's operating profits are
still running at more than Pounds 100m a year.
Mr Simons, who is 45, is likely to receive a contract with a substantial
success-related element, perhaps tied to any exit given to banks and
shareholders such as an eventual flotation.
Storehouse, the retail group where Mr Simons has been finance director since
May last year, will release him from a commitment to stay with the group
until March next year. He will join Isosceles, with effect from January 1,
replacing Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes. Mr Mitchell-Innes may stay on the
Isosceles board until March, having already announced his intention to
leave.
Mr Simons is expected to spend the bulk of his time at Gateway's Bristol
headquarters, and to move the Isosceles head office to Bristol as well.
Isosceles also owns the Herman's chain of sporting goods shops in the US,
which has been up for sale since the Pounds 2.1bn buy-out of Gateway in
1989.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Losses at Lloyd's expected to weaken capital base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAPITAL base of Lloyd's is expected to shrink by at least 15 per cent
next year to Pounds 8.5bn because of heavy underwriting losses at the
insurance market.
Leading agents at the market are also predicting losses of more than Pounds
1.5bn for 1990 - which Lloyd's will report in June - about 50 per cent worse
than expected earlier this year.
The figures indicate that recent losses appear to be taking a heavy toll on
Lloyd's and could prevent it taking full advantage of recent increases in
insurance rates. 'The trough is deeper and longer than we would have thought
12 months ago,' said the finance director of a large agency.
Lloyd's had expected the market's capacity - the amount of premium it can
underwrite - to fall from the present Pounds 10.1bn to Pounds 9bn in 1993,
after losses of Pounds 2.5bn in 1988 and 1989. The fall in capacity is now
expected to be greater because many Names - individuals who provide the
market's capital - have had difficulties meeting solvency requirements,
which govern how much money they can commit to the market.
Mr John Moir, of London Wall Members Agency, said the market had
'underestimated the extent to which solvency would be a problem for many
Names', a number of whom 'had been forced to reduce their participations to
a lower level'.
Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of Wellington Underwriting Agencies, says
capacity could fall to Pounds 8.3bn, while senior executives at five other
agencies interviewed late last week all expect a fall in capacity to below
Pounds 8.5bn, with one even predicting a decline to Pounds 7bn.
Next year, Lloyd's syndicates are likely to make maximum use of available
capacity, while new rules giving them more flexibility to buy reinsurance
from outside the market will also cushion the impact of the decline.
But agents fear capacity will fall further in 1994 because of the effect of
the 1990 losses on Names, and that capital shortages could begin to
undermine the market's overall viability, putting more pressure on Lloyd's
to attract corporate capital to the market.
Lloyd's agreed to examine ways in which corporate investors could be
attracted to the market following the publication of the Rowland task force
report earlier this year.
The report's author, Mr David Rowland, takes over as chairman of Lloyd's
next month, and is expected to give more impetus to these efforts. Mr Cooper
says 1990 losses could reach Pounds 1.8bn from storm damage and, in the US,
continuing asbestosis and pollution-related claims.
Losses for syndicates specialising in errors and omissions insurance,
covering agencies and brokers against potential legal awards, are also
likely to be greater than expected as Lloyd's moves to settle legal actions
brought by loss-making Names.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Israel ignores UN call to reverse deportations: Army kills
seven Palestinians in occupied territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL rejected international demands to reverse the deportation of 415
Palestinians trapped in south Lebanon yesterday and issued a sharp warning
to the government in Beirut not to attempt to push them back into
Israeli-held territory.
As the deportees pledged to remain in their makeshift camp in no-man's land
between the Israeli and Lebanese armies until they could return home,
Israeli forces shot dead seven Palestinians, including a nine-year old girl,
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip over the weekend. The toll of six
dead in Gaza on Saturday was the highest in one day for more than two years.
The Israeli cabinet yesterday reaffirmed the decision to deport the alleged
Islamic fundamentalist militants, taken after six soldiers had been killed
in a spate of armed attacks by the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement.
Ministers rejected a unanimous resolution passed by the United Nations
Security Council on Friday condemning the action.
The government also strongly contested a High Court petition by civil rights
lawyers seeking a reversal of the expulsions on the grounds that Israel was
responsible for their fate in the absence of a jurisdiction willing to
accept them. The court, which last Wednesday gave the go-ahead for the
expulsions, is expected to rule today.
An angry stand-off has developed between Israel and Lebanon over the
deportees. Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, reiterated his
government's insistence that they should return to Israel. 'There is
absolutely no way we will change our position. Never. Ever. Lebanon is not a
dumping ground,' he said.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, his Israeli counterpart, replied by saying the deportees
were now the responsibility of Beirut. 'It will be a mistake to try to push
them back into our area. It will be a major mistake.'
The government has won strong public backing in Israel for the expulsions,
which covered many academics and professionals said by the security forces
to be the 'brains' behind Hamas. But government officials acknowledged that
the plight of the deportees, huddled in tents in freezing conditions, had
caused serious damage to what had previously been strong international
support for Mr Rabin.
Fears that the deportations could halt Middle East peace talks were
underscored by moves by the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which backs
the talks, to reconcile its differences with Hamas, which opposes them.
Israel says its action against Hamas is meant to strengthen those
Palestinians backing the peace talks, but the PLO says it will not return to
the talks unless Israel reverses the deportations.
Last night the PLO appealed for international protection for Arabs in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
Israeli forces kept up a rigid security regime in the occupied territories
over the weekend. The killings in Gaza occurred when a week-long curfew was
lifted in Khan Younis refugee camp.
Mr Rabin will today meet the leader of Tsomet, a small far-right party, to
discuss its entry into the Labour-led coalition.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson's poll of institutions attending its investment seminar
last week revealed a curious optimism about the prospects for Japanese
equities next year. The average expectation was that the Nikkei would rise
to nearly 19,400 for a return of some 12 per cent, well above the poll's
anticipated result for the FT-SE, Dow or the German DAX. That seems
inconsistent with the bleak economic outlook. The Economic Planning Agency
last week reduced its growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 1.6 per
cent from 3.5 per cent. It hopes for growth of 3.3 per cent in fiscal
1993-94, but admits this is more of a target than a forecast. The OECD
expects 2.3 per cent for calendar 1993, but says informally that even this
figure may be too high.
As Kleinwort itself points out, asset deflation will continue to restrain
growth for some time, while the corporate sector still has to come to terms
with the excesses of the 1980s. Since redundancies are hard to impose,
Companies will have to engage in savage cost reduction. Weak private
consumption may then compound Japan's economic problems.
One palliative would be aggressive cuts in interest rates. Foreigners have a
poor record at calling the Nikkei, but that prospect might justify the
survey's optimism. Indeed, a similar argument could apply to some
continental European markets. The US last year and the UK this year both
provide examples of markets which have risen primarily on the back of
interest cuts. The more difficult question comes later when the cuts have
been absorbed. Then further advance depends on earnings growth in a weak
recovery.

FT  21 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK Accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all its success this year, the UK Accounting Standards Board has avoided
tackling the vexed topics of goodwill and intangible assets. Since the old
Accounting Standards Committee's failure to carry the day on amortising
goodwill was the final nail in its coffin, Professor Tweedie might be
forgiven for biding his time. The challenge is to find a treatment which
satisfies the demands of business without leaving UK accounts out of step
with international practice.
Professor Tweedie has made no secret of his desire to move towards a system
which values assets on a more consistent basis. That implies tougher rules
on when and how physical assets are revalued. This might also help square
the circle on goodwill. If all assets which can be reasonably valued are
held at current cost on the balance sheet, sceptics may find it easier to
swallow a similar treatment for acquired goodwill. Assuming, of course, that
a convincing method of valuing goodwill can be found.
The ASB is doubtless hoping that whatever compromise it suggests on acquired
goodwill will head off demands from areas of business that internally
generated intangible assets, such as brands, should have a place on the
balance sheet. Even so, the ASB would risk taking UK accounting standards
into an area beyond the international pale. In an era of cross-border
investment, international comparability of accounts has a value of its own.
The sight of Phillips - a pioneer of current cost accounting - abandoning
the system last week in favour of more internationally accepted practice
gives cause for thought.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power and PowerGen may view last week's report from the regulator
on electricity pool prices as something of a victory. But after a torrid few
weeks at the hands of both the regulator and the market, they have reason to
be grateful for small mercies. That Professor Littlechild stopped short of
suggesting collusion to achieve higher prices is a relief. The conclusion
that pool prices are still below the level required to cover the generators'
costs should equally take the wind out of complaints from big energy users.
Yet the generators can hardly welcome the regulator's pointed reminder that
they have too much market power. Although National Power and PowerGen have
been cleared of actual misdemeanour, the jury is still out on the wider
issue of whether enough competition can be introduced into the generation
market to make the current structure acceptable. The decision turns on the
impact of independent power producers in limiting the power of the duopoly.
That extends beyond the electricity pool. The terms of five-year contracts
offered to the regional electricity companies and backed by deals with
British Coal are already under Professor Littlechild's microscope. Given the
public and political interest, one can hardly believe National Power and
PowerGen will allow themselves to be found guilty of abusing market power in
this area either. But with the Professor talking of imposing regulation on
the generators as an alternative to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
reference, the scope for interference has barely diminished.

FT  21 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Paper thin profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The devaluation domino that has swept across the Nordic region has had at
least one strikingly beneficial effect: it has eased the pressures on the
forestry industry, which constitutes much of its manufacturing base.
Shares of leading Swedish pulp and paper companies in particular have
bounced strongly since the krona's devaluation. Profits prospects have
improved markedly as relative costs have shrunk. Last week, the SCA group
cited the benign effect of devaluation in lifting its annual profits
forecast from break-even to SKr300m-Skr400m. MoDo, too, should benefit from
having many of its manufacturing plants in weak currency countries. But
Europe's biggest paper group, Stora, may do less well: its exposure to
Germany will muffle any uplift.
Having bid the shares up so quickly, the market is now scratching its head
about the longer term prospects. Investors are still keen to move into
capital intensive sectors which have historically been at recovery's leading
edge. But the cyclical scenario may not be as simple as it seems. Severe
overcapacity in most paper grades continues to plague the industry.
Ironically, devaluation may have delayed rationalisation by baling out the
weakest players. The glut of recycled pulp in Europe will also undermine
price rises. But the biggest worry remains the deteriorating German market,
which accounts for about a quarter of European paper consumption. The
industry is not yet out of the woods.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Japanese growth forecast for 1992 halved to 1.6%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yest-erday belatedly revised down its growth
forecast for the current fiscal year from 3.5 per cent to 1.6 per cent, but
announced a target of 3.3 per cent growth in gross national product next
year.
A cabinet meeting approved the official estimates, prepared by Japan's
Economic Planning Agency, which also revised upwards the trade surplus
estimate from Dollars 96.5bn to Dollars 136bn for the current year to the
end of March.
For next year, the trade account surplus was forecast at Dollars 135bn,
giving the US and the European Community scope to complain that the Japanese
market remains partly closed to their products and that Tokyo has not done
enough to stimulate domestic demand.
The EPA has been attacked by business organisations for 'over-optimistic'
forecasts which slowed the government response to the decline in the
economy, but the agency is confident that a recovery will gather strength
next year. It does, however, decline to predict exactly when the recovery
will begin.
Mr Haruhito Arai, senior assistant to the EPA's director, conceded that the
forecast for next year 'is, in a sense, optimistic', but said it was
justified because capital spending would rise by an estimated 2.4 per cent,
after a fall of 3.8 per cent this year.
The importance of export growth in this year's expansion of GNP is an
embarrassment for the government, which has a formal policy of encouraging
domestic demand to reduce the trade surplus. For the first time since 1980,
growth this year in external demand (0.8 per cent) is expected to exceed
that of internal demand (0.7 per cent) as a contributor to the growth of
GNP.
Japan's current account surplus this fiscal year is estimated at Dollars
116.5bn, up from a previously modest estimate of Dollars 71bn, while the
surplus next year is forecast to be a still imposing Dollars 115.5bn, under
the influence of the large trade surplus.
'The issue at hand is how to shift smoothly to a sustainable
non-inflationary growth path centred on domestic demand,' the EPA said in
its annual report to the cabinet, reflecting the government's concern about
the expansion of the trade surplus.
Most of the agency's estimates for the current year were wide of the mark.
It had forecast a 3.7 per cent increase in private consumption, but that was
cut to 1.5 per cent. Corporate fixed investment had been forecast to rise
4.5 per cent, but this is now expected to decline by 3.8 per cent.
In defending the forecasts for next year, the agency admits that private
consumption and business fixed investment, which account for about 80 per
cent of domestic demand, will be relatively sluggish. It is certain only
about strong growth in public spending, which comprises about 7 per cent of
the total.
Government ministers approved the EPA's forecasts, but hinted that the
figures appeared to be over-optimistic. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of a
powerful faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, was sceptical: 'It
sounds like you are talking about another country, not our own.'
Most private estimates for GNP growth next year range between 2.3 per cent
and 2.8 per cent. Yasuda Trust and Banking forecast 2.3 per cent growth for
the 1993 fiscal year and 1.5 per cent for the current year, and called for a
cut in official interest rates and a public spending package to ensure that
those modest targets were met.
The emphasis on 'non-inflationary growth' reflects the EPA's concerns that
unusually low food and commodity prices this year have distorted pricing
patterns. The agency expects a fall of 1.3 per cent in wholesale prices this
year, and a 0.3 per cent increase next year, while consumer prices are
expected to rise 1.8 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent next year.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Letter: Drafting of multilateral trade organisation is
unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MYRIAM VANDER STICHELE and MICHAEL WINDFUHR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You rightly draw attention to the problems arising from the creation of
a new multilateral trade body - MTO - in the Uruguay Round ('US poses new
Gatt quandary', December 15). An article of December 16 ('Round and round go
the Uruguay trade reform negotiators') mentions in contradictory way the US
worries about the status of the MTO and its rules, which should curtail US
unilateral actions.
You do not mention, however, concerns recently expressed by more than 150
organisations from more than 30 developing and industrialised countries
dealing not only with the environment but also with development.
They fear that the MTO, which would be outside the United Nations system,
and would collaborate with the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank, would further concentrate international economic decision making in
the economically powerful industrialised countries. Developing countries and
their populations would be excluded.
The MTO would be the forum for future negotiations with no equitable
decision-making process. It would be an end to any attempt to create an
international trade organisation which takes a more integrated approach to
trade policy and rules. An MTO as currently drafted is unacceptable.

<TEXT>
This Christmas why not splurge Dollars 3,800 on the dog that has everything
and buy Rover its very own copy of 'The European market for pet food and pet
care products'.
The good news in the Frost and Sullivan report is that pets should get more
to eat - the market is set to grow from Dollars 10.5bn to Dollars 11.6bn by
1996. The bad news is that the number of doggies is forecast to decline.
That's not what they want to hear at the kennels. Perhaps it would be better
to save this type of negative talk till after Christmas.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Observer: Polish vote trick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Poland's parliamentarians start smuggling bricks into their sessions, it
won't necessarily be to throw them at opponents. The reason will more
probably be a mini-scandal aroused when national television showed deputies
voting for absent neighbours in a critical budget-debate.
It was apparently far from the first such occurrence. Bored members find it
easy to slip away. All they need do is leave their voting card with a more
diligent colleague, who sticks it into the slot in the absentee's seat at
the right moment, and presses the appropriate button.
Since a spate of 'two-handed voting' saw the government lose by three on its
proposals for pensions cuts, it has sought to restage the vote. In the
meantime, parliament's chairman, Wieslaw Chrzanowski, has been criticising
the TV cameras for giving the wrong impression, while President Lech Walesa
has been praising them for exposing what was afoot.
Short of going back to counting each vote manually, preventing the practice
is a problem. One proposal - to fix the computer to register a vote only if
the relevant seat was occupied - seemed promising until someone objected
that deputies could bring in bricks to weigh down neighbours' seats. The
ultimate solution, perhaps, would be voting buttons that identified and
responded solely to the correct fingerprints.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Ashcroft, former Guardian young businessman of the year and ex-boss of
the over-acquisitive Coloroll which collapsed in 1990, is again trying to
grow a business at breakneck speed.
Rapid growth imposes its own strains: some suppliers to the new venture, an
outdoor clothing company, appropriately called Survival Aids, have been
grumbling about being kept waiting for their money. Ashcroft bought the
company in early 1991, installed himself as managing director, and planned
to double or treble the company's annual turnover - then Pounds 4.5m -
within five years.
It sounds like Survival Aids' expansion has been going according to plan.
Since Ashcroft arrived its retail branch network - it also has a sizeable
mail order trade - has grown from three shops, plus a kiosk at Aldershot, to
14 stores spread from Glasgow to Bristol. It has opened three new shops this
autumn alone.
Ebullient as ever, Ashcroft says that his business is 'going pretty well
really'. He declines to talk publicly about the mutterings of discontent
from some suppliers. But he indicated that Survival Aids is now entering a
period of consolidation. 'We'll catch up with ourselves now, in the next 12
months', he promises.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Observer: Return of the Lynch mob
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember Gerry Tsai? In his hey-day as a go-go stock picker for Fidelity,
America's biggest mutual fund manager, Tsai's reputation was just as big as
that of Peter Lynch, the legendary Fidelity fund manager who has just
announced a comeback.
But whereas Tsai went on to the real business world, running American Can
and its successor Primerica, Lynch is sticking to what he knows best. Less
than three years after he gave up, Lynch is returning to his old firm on a
part-time basis.
Lynch's recall is bound to raise eyebrows on Wall Street. Since he quit
managing Fidelity's Dollars 21bn flagship Magellan fund, it has failed to
match the spectacular performance it recorded during his 13-year
stewardship. The job of running the biggest US mutual fund has already burnt
out one of Lynch's successors. Has Lynch been recalled to keep an eye on
Magellan and prevent its small investors from deserting?
Not so, says Fidelity, which insists that Lynch is not returning to active
stock-picking. He has been acting as a 'mentor and educator' at Fidelity on
an informal basis for some time and now will get paid for 'Peter Lynching
the next generation of Fidelity fund managers,' says Fidelity rather
inelegantly.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Competing answers to university challenge: Means-testing to
control the cost of further education may be an alternative to ceilings on
enrolment growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For students and universities, the party is over and the hangover about to
begin.
After seven years of uninterrupted growth in student numbers, the government
is applying the brakes. Courses for 16 to 19-year-olds are now top priority
for extra education spending, with further education colleges due to pass
from local government to Whitehall control in April.
To contain higher education spending, Mr John Patten, education secretary,
looks set to announce cuts in fees paid by the government for university
courses. He has also imposed a 13 per cent ceiling on the growth in student
numbers over the next three years.
Polytechnics achieved an increase in enrolments of that size last year
alone, and few believe the government will be able to constrain growth for
long. The question is not whether higher education will expand further, but
what form the expansion will take and how it will be funded.
The form of expansion is now settled. Polytechnics have been permitted to
call themselves universities, but the bottom four-fifths of the new
'university' sector will comprise teaching colleges in all but name. The
Universities Funding Council's research assessment ratings, published last
week, indicated that a majority of top-graded departments are in just 12
institutions. Research funding is to be concentrated on those, with teaching
centred on the rest.
The question of funding is more problematic. A year or two from now, it will
be one of the toughest education policy issues facing the politicians.
For a glimpse of the debate to come, a little noticed speech earlier this
month by Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour's new higher education spokesman, is
essential reading.
In an address to the Socialist Education Association, Mr Rooker raised the
issue of means-testing the fees currently paid to universities by the
government for all first- degree students, irrespective of parental income.
He argued that it would be 'totally unacceptable' for school leavers and
mature students of entry standard to be denied the chance to continue their
studies because of government-imposed ceilings on numbers. Then came the
punch line: 'Social equity demands that we look to all possible sources of
revenue from those who can afford to pay . . . The issue of a contribution
from the wealthy (must) be considered.'
For all politicians, Labour as much as Tory, the public spending
implications of the explosion in numbers are beginning to sink in. The
figures are stark. In the early 1960s, the UK had barely 100,000 full-time
students in higher education. By 1987 the number was 549,000; now it is
about 775,000. Vice-chancellors believe that Mr Patten's 13 per cent
increase may be illusory, being largely absorbed as the current intake of
students passes through the system.
Given the numbers, the government's fees bill would have rocketed in any
event. But it has been artificially increased by a decision in the late
1980s to shift higher education funding from grants paid to institutions to
fees following students. The aim was to encourage institutions to take more
students at marginal cost, and to create a market environment in which
universities would sell themselves better. It succeeded beyond almost
everyone's - particularly the government's - expectations. The cost was
enormous. In 1979 the government's annual fees bill was Pounds 238.7m; by
1986 it had risen to Pounds 290.7m; last year it was Pounds 680m.
Since almost everyone - particularly the government - agrees that the bill
cannot go on rising at that rate, there are only two options: capping
student numbers or means-testing fees. (Universities could be more
efficient, of course. But lecturer-to-student ratios are already at 1:20 or
worse in many institutions.)
For the moment, Mr Patten is taking the first option and capping numbers.
Labour is hovering at the entrance to the second.
Mr Rooker insists that his speech was no more than the design for a kite.
But should the kite fly, the impact on the middle classes would be profound.
Annual fees for undergraduate courses currently range from Pounds 1,855 to
nearly Pounds 5,000, depending on the subject. Living costs come on top,
allowances for which are being progressively shifted from grants to loans.
The maintenance grant is fixed at a maximum of Pounds 2,265, but even that
is means-tested. Withdrawal starts if combined parental income reaches a
mere Pounds 13,630.
Fewer than a third of students now receive the full grant. If the regime for
maintenance grants were extended to tuition fees, a typical university would
become as expensive as Eton for students from better-off families.
Ironically, the means-testing option has impeccable Tory credentials. Sir
Keith (now Lord) Joseph toyed with it when he was education secretary in the
mid-1980s, but drew back amid protests from the Tory shires. As a next best,
Mr Robert Jackson, higher education minister in the late 1980s, urged
vice-chancellors to consider additional fees to be paid directly by
students. They declined to do so, though many were attracted to the idea.
Mindful of the electoral consequences, the government finally gave up the
quest last year. Its 1991 Higher Education White Paper stated: 'Public funds
will remain the main source of income for funding the projected expansion of
student numbers.'
It might seem odd, then, that Labour is picking up the means-testing baton.
In fact, the Tories' decision to drop it gives them a golden opportunity.
After its bloody nose at the last election, Labour's leadership is more
concerned than ever at the tax implications of massive public spending
commitments, and higher education is prominent among them.
Labour can also point to the rest of Europe and the US, where the charging
of fees is standard practice. A Mori poll conducted earlier this year showed
a majority of those with incomes over Pounds 15,000 a year were prepared to
pay tuition fees, to the average tune of Pounds 1,000 a year.
Moreover, the Tories abandoned attempts to make students and their parents
pay fees for the very reason that makes the idea potentially tolerable to
Labour: it means taxing the Tories' natural constituency. Mr Rooker is
impressed by a research paper published recently by the National Commission
on Education, showing that in relative terms, over the past 20 years the
proportions entering higher education from manual working class families has
scarcely shifted by comparison with those from professional and managerial
families.
'This is cold comfort for those who seek the 'classless society' ',
concluded the paper. Maybe. But it might enable Labour to turn the tables on
a government reneging on commitments to open higher education to all able to
make the grade.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Letter: Holding companies likely to be penalised by VAT
ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD WATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your readers are already aware of the new value added tax burdens on
large companies which will begin on January 1. They will also know that
monthly payments of VAT for large companies began in October. I wonder,
however, if they have yet realised that every holding company is due to be
further penalised from March 1. Customs and Excise has achieved this hat
trick by taking a European Court of Justice ruling on a Dutch holding
company (Polysar Investments Netherlands BV) and developing the thinking to
justify an approach it last tried in 1987.
Polysar was a Dutch intermediate holding company, of a type often used,
quite legitimately, in direct tax planning. The Court held that the basic
activities of such a holding company did not constitute an economic activity
and, therefore, it was not entitled to a refund of VAT on costs.
Customs has ended this doctrine to all holding companies and has ruled that,
from March 1, VAT on costs incurred by holding companies on basic
activities, such as acquiring subsidiaries and mounting or defending
takeover bids, will cease to be deductible.
By applying this judgment to British holding companies of a quite different
type, Customs seems to be extending the Court's judgment far beyond its
limits.
For example, the Court commented that its ruling would have been different
had Polysar been involved in managing its subsidiaries. This could be taken
to imply that input tax recovery on Polysar's basic functions would have
been allowed under these circumstances.
Above all, however, the differences between the activities of a Dutch
investment holding company and a typical UK holding company are so great
that the judgment cannot simply be transferred intact.
VAT is a tax on consumption - not a tax on business costs. By taking this
action, Customs is placing a new and very real burden on business at a time
when so many other burdens are being introduced.
To add insult to injury, the change was announced by press notice and
apparently requires no change in the law.
Price Waterhouse will continue to add its weight to the representations
against this charge. This is a further unnecessary setback to UK business
recovery and yet another example of an increasingly alarming trend to
legislate by press release.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Letter: Positive outcomes suggested by record of new Russian
premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN P STERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial of December 15 ('Departure of a reformer'), contains an
important omission about the new Russian prime minister. As minister for the
gas industry, Mr Chernomyrdin may be 'associated with the failures of the
last Soviet regime', but he was one of that regime's few industrial success
stories. That is arguably why Mr Chernomyrdin has been singled out for this
very difficult position.
It is somewhat unfair of Leyla Boulton ('New man at top sweeps into office
with an old broom', December 15) to say that Mr Chernomyrdin has failed to
turn around the fortunes of the oil industry since he was made deputy prime
minister responsible for fuels and energy last April. Macroeconomic and
political confusion would have made this a difficult task for anybody in his
position to achieve within one year.
You may be right that Mr. Chernomyrdin does not know 'how to transform
Russia into a working, let alone a successful, market economy', but then who
does? The immediate issue is whether the new prime minister will set his
face against market-oriented reforms or whether he will continue them at a
slower pace.
Meanwhile we should be aware of two politically positive outcomes of his
appointment. First, Russia has a prime minister who has a track record of
some economic and political success (albeit within the framework of a
centrally planned economy). Second, the new prime minister has a detailed
knowledge of the oil and gas sectors, which are likely to be extremely
important for both the domestic economy and for foreign trade. Indeed, these
sectors could be the key to Russia's economic recovery.
A prime minister who could turn oil production (and exports) around and
guarantee the continued flow of Russian gas to Europe would help boost
western business confidence, even if he proves to be a less politically and
intellectually attractive than Mr Yedor Gaidar, his predecessor.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Secrets of the heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite decades of brain-washing, I have never been able to persuade myself
that discussing the advice given by officials to ministers is like revealing
the secrets of the confessional. An unusual light on the issue is shed by
the humorous writer Michael Frayn who has, among his other accomplishments,
intimate knowledge of Whitehall, including the lay-out of its buildings,
corridors and, above all, skyline.
I have been reading three of the books he has written since he resumed novel
writing in 1985. The first, The Trick of It (Penguin), is on a different
topic - an academic critic who lures the subject of his life work, a female
novelist 'JL', to his rather shabby university to give a talk; the
relationship ends (in every sense) in marriage. There are many delicious
paradoxes. The critic has intimate knowledge of every word JL has written.
JL, on the other hand, has never read a single bit of her companion's work,
which he composes downstairs while she is writing upstairs.
The book which deals most directly with official secrecy is the latest,
called Now You Know (Viking). Its central character, Terry, who runs an
anti-secrecy campaign, is described on the dust-jacket as something of a
wide boy. 'OK, maybe he does come across as a headline-grabbing charlatan
sometimes but he is a bit of a charmer all right - ask anyone.' In a seedy
office behind the Strand, Terry has accumulated quite a large staff with a
telephonist, librarian, secretary and so on - all of whom respond to callers
with the word 'open' and who have as many secrets from each other as any
group of establishment politicians and officials.
One secret, revealed at the end, is who is financing the whole show. Rather
more intriguing is why a straight-laced Whitehall high flyer, Hillary Wood,
who initially despises Terry and everything he stands for, leaves the Home
Office to join his organisation. The obvious answer is that Terry may be her
father but I'm not sure this is correct. There are moments of high farce,
for instance when she takes part in a demonstration outside her old
permanent secretary's house in Chorley Wood - now there's an idea. Despite
all the high jinks at the expense of the anti-establishment, the reader
cannot forget that there has been a cover-up over the death of a man in
police custody, a cover-up supported by the sensible, educated Home Office
types which many readers will know from their own acquaintances.
I suppose the moral is that we all carry an Official Secrets Act in our own
heads. Frayn is, however, at his most successful in the second of the three
novels, A Landing in the Sun (Penguin), which is the funniest yet also the
most realistic and serious. A civil servant, Stephen Summerchild, is
appointed secretary of a committee set up by Harold Wilson in 1974 to
examine the quality of life. Its chairman is Dr Serafin, a female Oxford
philosopher of Russian extraction. Wilson is preoccupied with the economic
crisis of the time, and when Serafin tries to see him she bumps into the
governor of the Bank of England on a more urgent visit. She decides to go
ahead just with Summerchild, not bothering to appoint any more committee
members (another good idea). At first, the meetings proceed like a tutorial
designed to elucidate the concept of 'quality of life' - for example, 'you
notice the central heating if it is turned off. You notice it if it is not
there to be noticed,' an analysis interrupted when Serafin has to get away
to prepare her boy's dinner or some other domestic chore.
She gradually becomes less analytical and more Russian. She and Summerchild
eventually establish a love-nest in their attic office, outside which there
is a protected ledge useful for sun-bathing. The idyll comes to an end when
the permanent secretary, on a goodwill tour, finds the office locked against
him. Much more happens which the reader must explore for himself.
Before anyone dismisses Frayn's world as fanciful entertainment, I must
mention my own experience at the Foreign Office a few days ago, where the
uniformed guardian disclaimed all knowledge of a party to which I had been
invited. While this was being sorted out, a senior flunkey announced he was
going to Bosnia the next day - whether this was meant as a joke I do not
know. But a departing mandarin off for his weekend in an open-necked shirt
responded: 'I hear the skiing in Bosnia is rather good at this time of
year.' Maybe if I had not been reading Frayn I would concentrated on the
more highbrow conversation at the policy analysts' party. At the very least,
his books are an antidote to end-year depression.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Bonn's example
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REUNITED GERMANY'S foreign affairs aim is to follow 'a policy of good
example', according to the well-intentioned though somewhat sanctimonious
slogan coined by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Bonn's former foreign minister.
In its approach to dispatching Bundeswehr soldiers to help the US-led army
in Somalia, Germany is making heavy weather of meeting that objective.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to send 1,500 troops to east Africa, probably
in February or March, to distribute aid to starving Somalis. This is a
welcome proposal. It illustrates Germany's efforts to play a more active
role in international peace-keeping, and in world affairs in general, by
throwing off some post-war shackles.
The German contingent's duties would be humanitarian: to organise supplies,
transport and communications. The soldiers would be lightly armed, for
self-defence. The plan is relatively modest. Yet it has been attacked by the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who say it breaches constitutional limits
on using military force abroad.
The chancellor has been talking for two years about changing the
constitution to allow German armed forces to take part in international
peace operations. There has been intense debate about Bundeswehr deployment
outside Nato since the Gulf war, when Bonn sent Nato-assigned aircraft to
Turkey to help protect it against Iraq. The conflict in former Yugoslavia
has added to the need for clarity about Germany's potential peace-keeping
role - even though memories of German troops' Yugoslav presence in the
second world war would preclude deployment in Bosnia.
The German constitution can be amended only with a two-thirds parliamentary
majority. So Mr Kohl needs the support of the SPD, which wants to restrict
Bundeswehr operations to UN 'blue-helmet' duties. During the summer, the SPD
raised doubts over the legality of the decision to send a destroyer to help
monitor the UN embargo of Serbia and Montenegro.
The question mark over that decision appeared incongruous, given Germany's
interest in peace in the Balkans; obstructing the Somali plan would be still
more difficult to justify. In a region unburdened by Wehrmacht legacies,
dispatch of German solders to feed starving Africans could do nothing but
good.
If, as the SPD intends, the German constitutional court is summoned to give
its verdict on the Somali case, it should do so with all possible speed.
Ultimately, however, decisions such as this hinge not on constitutional
probity, but on political will. Germany, as the pivotal nation in Europe,
must give itself the means to put its defence resources to the service of
the international community. The country is being severely tested by the
domestic challenges of reunification, but it also has wider
responsibilities. Using German soldiers to help alleviate the suffering in
Somalia would show the world that it is living up to them.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Television's market failure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF EVER there were any doubt that the regulation of British broadcasting has
fallen into a muddle, the decision to block the establishment of a fifth
television channel removes it.
The Independent Television Commission was faced with a single bid for the
10-year Channel Five franchise from Channel Five Holdings. That bid was
rejected because the commission feared the consortium was being too
optimistic about its revenue and cost projections and because it was not
satisfied about the financial commitment of the proposed members of the
consortium.
As a result, British television viewers and advertisers may well be denied
the development of the last part of the terrestrial TV broadcasting
spectrum, which Channel Five Holdings had intended to use for a
regionalised, big city-based alternative to existing services.
Whether the commission has acted properly within the terms of the 1990
Broadcasting Act will probably be tested by judicial review. The chances are
that it has; it would be unlike the commission's lawyers to make a mistake
of that kind, as it demonstrated by successfully seeing off legal challenges
to its decisions in awarding the ITV Channel Three franchises which come
into effect next week.
That does not necessarily mean the commission is right. Ten-year revenue
projections are no easier in broadcasting than in any other business, and
the bottom of the worst recession since television was invented may not be
the most reliable vantage point for making a judgment.
As for the depth of commitment by members of the consortium, that is also
something about which lawyers can quibble, but the names on the application
 -Thames Television, until January 1 holder of the weekday London ITV
franchise, Associated Newspapers, Time Warner, Cox and Pearson (owner of the
Financial Times) - are scarcely lightweight.
But the crucial point is this: the ITC is failing to do what the
Broadcasting Act intended it to do, namely to adopt a lighter touch than its
predecessor, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, and to steer the ITV
system towards a more open market, in which performance and takeover bids -
rather than questionable franchise rounds - determine who comes out on top.
This point applies with particular force to Channel Five, an experimental,
even marginal service, which can only succeed if it wins sufficient viewers
to build advertising support. If a group of investors think it worth risking
their money to test the viability of the new channel, it is not clear what
public gain there is in the ITC thinking it knows better.
If a Channel Five consortium were to go bust after, say, four years, it
would hurt no-one but its shareholders. The government needs to watch the
ITC's step.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Signs of maturity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS ago, South Korea's first presidential elections for 16 years were
scarred by violence. The opposition vote was split, allowing a former
general to win in an atmosphere of recrimination. The electorate was fed up
with politicians even as democracy was born. Contrast the vote for the next
president, held last Friday. Riot police were not called into action during
the campaign. Allegations of misbehaviour were relatively tame and have not
included ballot-rigging. The losers conceded gracefully.
If the elections are a victory for democracy, they are also a remarkable
achievement for Mr Kim Young-sam. The veteran opposition campaigner's 41 per
cent share of the vote was far larger than he might have hoped. He will need
this mandate to confront the challenges left by Mr Roh Tae-woo, widely seen
as an ineffective president who has allowed the economy to slip.
It is not clear that Mr Kim has the skills for the job - though the same
could be said of his opponents. He is a wheeler-dealer party boss, an
effective politician, but in the transition from anti-military campaigner to
candidate of the ruling party, he has built up political debts which might
limit his freedom of action. He inherits an establishment machine which has
proved sluggish in introducing vital reforms and often has a vested interest
in slowing them.
There is little dispute about needed economic reforms, though Mr Kim's
advisers advocated a slower pace than those of other candidates. Democracy
brought a rise in wages which reduced Korea's competitiveness. Economic
growth has slowed. High-technology industry must be developed and
bureaucratic control loosened. The economy needs further opening to
international competition.
Most delicate will be the attitude Mr Kim adopts towards the chaebol, the
family-owned conglomerates. Many in the ruling party may feel unforgiving
after the candidacy of Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of Hyundai, the largest
chaebol, and political flirtations of other industrialists. Any attempts to
curb the chaebol, though necessary, should be tempered by recognition of
their role in Korea's future development.
The political challenges are no less great. With a new president in the US,
South Korea's main ally, Mr Kim's handling of foreign policy will be
particularly sensitive. There is the ever-present possibility that collapse
of the dictatorship in Pyongyang could suddenly present him with the
greatest challenge of all - re-unification with North Korea. Domestically,
decisive leadership is needed to restore the confidence of voters, 16 per
cent of whom opted for Mr Chung, a man without a political background. As
former campaigners for democracy, the victor and the runner-up, Mr Kim
Dae-jung, are both remnants of a former age. To fight tomorrow's battles, a
new generation of politicians - and probably, political parties - must be
fostered. Only then will democracy have matured in Korea.

FT  21 DEC 92 / The dinosaurs arise again: IBM is no longer a symbol of US
industry, which is becoming more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There could not be a more startling contrast between two US high-technology
companies: on Tuesday, International Business Machines, the world's largest
computer company, announced plans for sharp cuts in jobs, manufacturing
capacity and development spending because of dreadful fourth quarter sales.
IBM shares plunged.
Just 24 hours later, Intel, the largest US computer chip manufacturer, sent
its stock soaring when it said its fourth-quarter results would be well
above Wall Street expectations.
IBM is such a large company, and was a bell-wether of the US stock market
for so many years, that it is easy to see the crisis wracking the business
as a symbol of America's supposed industrial decline.
Easy, but wrong. For IBM's core problem - and it is one which is about to
hit the large Japanese computer manufacturers which for years have emulated
Big Blue - stems from its failure to adapt fast enough to the revolution
which has moved computing power from large mainframes to the desktop. Yet
the companies which dominate the expanding personal computer market are also
American, not Japanese. And an important reason for Intel's success is that
these US PC manufacturers are the prime customers for its chips.
So, while IBM is struggling, the US high-technology sector in general is
quietly prospering, and in some sectors winning back market share from
international rivals.
For example, the US semiconductor industry, which a few years ago seemed
about to be bludgeoned to extinction by Japanese competition, has revived so
strongly that 1992 sales figures are expected to show America regaining
world market leadership by a narrow margin, thanks to the success of the US
PC companies, technical innovation and the opening up of the Japanese
market. Mr Craig Barrett, senior vice-president of Intel, calls it the
'revenge of the dinosaurs'.
There are also signs, albeit much more tentative, of greater American
competitiveness in other areas, from consumer durables such as automobiles
to basic industries such as steel.
In short, the fashionable pessimism which for years has tarred the US with
'the British disease', condemned to irreversible industrial decline, is
beginning to look grossly exaggerated.
It is giving ground to a cautious optimism that, while the US will never
again dominate world industry as it did in the three decades after the
second world war, it may at least hold its own against Asian and European
rivals in many sectors and excel in some of the most important.
This shift in perception is still in its early stages - pessimism was well
represented at President-elect Bill Clinton's economic summit last week -
but is being reinforced by two developments: America is gradually recovering
from the 1991 recession; and Japanese industry is facing structural problems
as it battles with domestic economic downturn, severe asset value deflation,
and a shift of emphasis from market-share growth to profits growth.
Yet the US cannot afford to be complacent. For one thing, past economic
shocks - such as the sharp rise in energy prices in the 1970s - have shown
Japan to be remarkably resilient and creative in bouncing back from
adversity.
Second, a smattering of market share gains cannot disguise the fact that
many US companies remain uncompetitive. Look no further than the world's
largest manufacturing business, General Motors, which faces a formidable
struggle to return its loss-making North American operations to profit after
years of arrogant, complacent drifting.
That said, GM's Detroit rivals, Ford and Chrysler, have greatly narrowed the
quality and productivity gap with Japanese rivals, which control about 30
per cent of the US car market but for now seem to have stopped increasing
their market share.
Third, the US still faces some severe, long-term structural problems which
threaten industrial competitiveness, including rising healthcare costs (with
business picking up most of the insurance costs), lagging investment in
plant and equipment and one of the western world's least impressive school
and vocational training systems.
Action in all these areas ranks high among Mr Clinton's priorities, although
none can be solved simply by the wave of a federal government wand.
Many factors are contributing to increasing US competitiveness, but four
ingredients stand out: an improving financial backdrop; wholesale
restructuring of manufacturing industries over the past decade, coupled with
investment in information systems which quicken decision-making; the
adoption by many large companies of new quality control techniques, largely
learnt from Japan; and selective government assistance.
In the financial field, exporting industries have been greatly aided by the
sharp decline from 1985 in the value of the dollar, which most economists
argue remains undervalued relative to other currencies.
Corporate America has also benefited over the past two years from a
restructuring of its balance sheet. Many companies - ranging from food and
tobacco group RJR Nabisco to paper company Georgia Pacific - were loaded
down with debt in the 1980s, either because this was fashionable, or to help
or hinder takeover bids, or to allow managers to acquire the business in a
leveraged buy-out.
A reasonably high level of debt relative to equity does not inevitably
impede competitiveness. Indeed, for much of the past 20 years German and
Japanese companies have shown their heels to American and British rivals,
despite being more highly leveraged. Academic research suggests that the
cost of equity to a company - which is far from easy to measure - is
substantially higher than the cost of debt.
However, there is no doubt that, in the prolonged economic expansion of the
1980s, many US companies leveraged themselves far beyond the point of
commercial prudence, so that cash flow was inadequate to service their debts
when the 1991 recession struck.
Over the past two years, though, corporate America has been redressing the
balance with a wave of new share issues, ending a seven-year drought, and
the ratio of debt to balance sheet equity has dropped sharply (see chart).
At the same time, a drop in long-term interest rates to 8 3/8 per cent, the
lowest level for 15 years, has allowed companies to call in relatively
high-priced debt and take on fresh borrowings at lower costs.
This, coupled with a gradual improvement in corporate profits, is improving
business's ability to service its debt. Corporate interest payments as a
percentage of income have dropped to about 21 per cent, compared with a peak
of almost 25 per cent at the end of 1989.
However, this remains high by historic standards and analysts at Salomon
Bros, the New York investment bank, warn that 'much more restructuring and
income growth will be required to restore debt-to-income ratios in the
non-financial sector to levels that typically have accompanied sustained
economic expansions'.
US companies are also benefiting from a narrowing over the past two years of
their cost of funds (both equity and debt) relative to Japanese and German
rivals.
The beneficial effects of these financial trends have been reinforced by a
widespread restructuring of American industry, which has been going on for
roughly a decade, prompted both by global competition and, during the bid
boom of the 1980s, by the threat of being taken over.
The restructuring - which began in capital-intensive manufacturing companies
most exposed to international trade, but is now spreading through service
sectors such as banking and retailing - includes job and plant cuts, mergers
and the adoption of new production and quality-control methods.
Many large US companies have begun adopting the Total Quality Management
methods pioneered by Japanese industry, which involve a minute attention to
quality and just-in-time manufacturing throughout the production process, a
devolution of responsibility to workers, and an overriding concern for the
needs of customers.
While such techniques can have a profound impact on performance - Xerox, the
copier company, and Motorola, the chip and electronics business, are
outstanding examples - they have yet to be be adopted by most American
companies and are no guarantee of success. IBM is one of the foremost
advocates of TQM.
The US government has thrown its weight behind the quality movement with
sponsorship of annual awards, and in a few cases has intervened more
actively to help industry: Intel's Mr Barrett says the semiconductor trade
pacts of 1986 and 1991, which forced the Japanese to open their market to US
products, have allowed chip manufacturers to boost sales to Japan by Dollars
1bn a year. Federal government sponsorship also helped set up Sematech, a
research consortium which has helped US manufacturers pool information on
chip production techniques.
The net effect of these initiatives is better labour productivity, which
grew at a healthy 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to mid-1992. Says Mr Stephen
Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley: 'Once the global economy begins
to move ahead, US companies will be the beneficiaries of a tremendous amount
of corporate restructuring. The only glitch could be a dollar surge.'
However, Mr Kent Hughes, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a
study group backed by big business and labour, warns that 'while we did a
lot of fat-shedding in the 1980s, it's not clear we added as much muscle as
we should have', investing in new plant and equipment.
The US has one of the lowest ratios of business investment to GDP among
countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. Non-military spending on research and development has also
lagged behind some of its rivals.
Such findings have generated an intense argument as to whether the US system
of capital allocation is inferior to that of Japan and Germany, with stock
market pressures forcing American companies to concentrate on excessively
short-term goals.
But the current high-technology fight-back suggests US self-criticism may be
overdone. Mr Barrett, for example, reckons that capital spending by the US
semiconductor industry will rise 12.5 per cent next year, compared with a
12.7 per cent drop in Japan. Intel plans to boost spending 33 per cent to
Dollars 1.6bn.
The only dinosaur-like element of that is its sheer size.

Watch Television's Greatest Christmas Hits (8.00 BBC1) and you will be able
to pretend that you have done Christmas and can let the whole mawkish mess
(so far as television is concerned) pass you by. We are told that Philip
Schofield, heart throb of little girls all over Britain, will be showing
that familiar skit where Morecambe and Wise sang 'There Is Nothing Like A
Dame' with a chorus line of news readers, Stanley Baxter's drag version of
the Queen's speech, and much more. BBC2 has replaced its scheduled
'Bookmark' repeat with a 40 Minutes Special on famine relief in Somalia
(9.30) The night's best piece of work by a mile will be October,
Eisenstein's astounding 1928 film about the 1917 revolution. It is the
source of many of the pictures which today are fixed in our heads as
authentic images. Imagine the scene where the workers stormed the gates of
the Winter Palace and, though you may think you remember newsreel pictures,
what you probably remember is Eisenstein's staged footage. It has been
plundered repeatedly for 'documentary' films. This is still one of the
greatest virtuoso works of cinema (10.00 C4).

FT  21 DEC 92 / Arts: Bruckner Eighth Symphony - Barbican Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a busy night at the Barbican. No sooner had the theatre audience for
the new Hamlet (see above) vacated the foyer than it was filled again by a
capacity crowd gathering to go into the concert hall for Georg Solti's 80th
birthday concert with the London Symphony Orchestra.
In fact, the evening marked a double anniversary. Although it had not been
heralded in advance with much of a fanfare, the single item on the programme
was a centennial performance of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony, first heard on
18 December 1892. Quite probably by chance, the event came as the
culmination of an unusually high number of performances recently of this
symphony: Andrew Davis precise and ordered, Franz Welser-Most at Edinburgh
noisily impassioned, above all Gunter Wand creating a marvel of deeply-felt
symphonic radiance at the Proms.
Like Wand, Solti has a lifetime's experience on which to draw. But his life
in music has followed a very different path, leading him along cosmopolitan
routes largely away from Austro-German territory, through the opera-houses
of the world, taking in music from most national traditions, all of which
has left a mark on the way he conducts in his years of seniority.
He also set out from a different starting-point. The fiery young Hungarian
has never entirely been exstinguished. This performance of the Bruckner was
not hard-driven in the way that so often brought Solti criticism earlier in
his career, but it was strongly, even momentously dramatised. Those grand
climaxes which in Wand's performance had risen as glowing affirmations of
what had gone before here became combative and triumphal: a battle had been
fought and won.
Still in fine form after its recent Sibelius cycle, the LSO supported Solti
with well-judged playing, which ensured that louder passages did not blare
or get congested, even in this hall, which might be thought inimical to
Bruckner. In the end the very determination to conquer the symphony's
majestic heights made the evening rise to the occasion.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Arts: Saint Francois d'Assise - Opera in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine years after a tentative first production at the Palais Garnier,
Messiaen's only opera returns to Paris. Not to the old home but to the Opera
Bastille, in a new and radically different staging by Peter Sellars, first
seen at this year's Salzburg Festival. The cast, headed by Jose van Dam in
the title-role, is the same except for Robin Leggate who now sings Brother
Elie. The Paris Opera chorus and orchestra are conducted by Sylvain
Cambreling.
Sellars, who was able to discuss his ideas with Messiaen before he died, has
modified the staging given at Salzburg in the picturesquely problematic
Rocky Riding School to suit the Baalsoe stage, still large but normal in
shape and fully equipped. The set by George Trypin, with a great chapel-like
structure of skeletal wood and a slanting panel of neon tubing flashing on
and off with (though you might not immediately guess so) Fra Angelico
colours, looks very fine. The by now notorious TV sets described by David
Murray after Salzburg are very much in evidence, flickering and blinking,
eclipsing a shy little board with French and English surtitles. Sellars has
said that the flickering motion relates to mystical experience - a daunting
prospect.
Sometimes the screens distract because one cannot see what is on them,
sometimes because one can. In the Sermon to the Birds anyone who likes
feathered friends is sorely tempted to stop listening and go bird-spotting.
Most of the screens are arranged in a double frame round the proscenium
arch. Those on stage, disposed in various ways, too often make it hard to
distinguish principals standing in front of them. With too much light
directed at the audience the singers' facial expression is at a discount. In
spite of various aggravations, when the magnitude of the problem is taken
into account, this is an impressive staging of a major but extremely
demanding work.
It is futile to engage in discussion as to whether or not Saint Francois is
'really an opera'. It is not, and was not meant to be one in the sense of
Don Giovanni or Lohengrin or Otello. Surely what matters is, on Messiaen's
chosen ground, does it work in the theatre? After hearing the live recording
of the original production I felt that although he had little inborn theatre
instinct, in certain scenes (the Leper, the Angel as musician and the
Stigmata) Messiaen reveals himself as a musical dramatist of considerable
power. Having now seen his opera on the stage I am tempted to modify that to
'musical dramatist of an in every way exceptional kind.'
In the theatre the four hours of music seemed even longer than on record.
The principal reason for that is the static nature and almost uniformly
slow, hieratic pace and metrical sameness of the declamation. Here something
unexpected happens. Messiaen is careful with the vocal lines, many vocal
phrases, especially in the Saint's part, being unaccompanied, between
instrumental outbursts. But increasingly, as the evening went on I found the
words difficult to catch. Not the fault, surely, of this expert cast, nor I
think in this case of the Bastille acoustics, but because the general pace
is so far from the rise and fall of normal speech. Also because there was a
miscalculation about the ability of soft singing and half-voice to carry in
this theatre. They do not carry, and Jose van Dam, sensitively suggesting
Francois' growing physical weakness in the later scenes, suffered with the
rest.
The exception was Dawn Upshaw, singing the Angel, the only solo woman's
voice in the opera and as a result marvellously effective when done with
such shining, secure tone and such gentle humour. The role is now split into
two, with a 'dancing angel' to mime such episodes as the stigmatisation.
She, unlike her androgynously clothed alter ego, is allowed a real angel's
costume, with wings.
One good point for the Bastille acoustics: the multiple bird song, the
clanking, clicking tuned percussion and the gurgling, swooping Ondes
Martenot sound notably well. The Opera chorus was magnificent; the whole
array was finely controlled by Cambreling. One longs now to hear more 20th
century French opera at the Bastille - including the announced and then
cancelled Padmavat of Roussel. Any hope? On the first night of Saint
Francois quite a few people in the stalls drifted away, to be swiftly
replaced in the next interval by enthusiasts from higher up (London please
note: top prices for this production were about Pounds 62). Everyone
listened devotedly - how things have changed in Paris in this respect] The
applause at the end easily drowned a few boos for the production team.
Five more performances until 29 December. Production shared with the
Salzburg Festival and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Arts: Martyred to concrete - Colin Amery samples the
architecture of Jean Nouvel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELPHIC utterances about the future of the world ring out in the darkened
galleries of London's Institute of Contemporary Arts, as 12 flickering
videos and a multi-screen of giant slides evokes the world of the current
darling of French architecture Jean Nouvel.
M. Nouvel, although he was only born in 1945, is an architectural agent
provocateur of the old school. He is pleased to be described as ruthless and
is one of those architects who tells the residents in his buildings exactly
what colour their walls and blinds are to be.
One of the video presentations shows the bare concrete walls of some public
housing that Nouvel designed and the subsequent treatment of the same walls
by the tenants . . . I am sure the ICA hopes we will all side with the
artistic purity of the architect, but I was entirely on the side of the
bullied tenants who did not want to live in monastic cells, martyrs to the
cause of varnished concrete.
Jean Nouvel's best known building is L'Institut du Monde Arabe on the left
bank of the Seine in Paris, the first of President Mitterrand's Grands
Projets. It is a beautiful and ingenious creation. The element of the
building that has become famous is the south wall which is a modern version
of an Arabian screen. This is not built of stone, but of steel and glass,
controlling the light entering the building by means of elaborate moving
parts.
Opening and closing diaphragms that work like the eyes of a camera also
compose themselves into traditional geometric patterns.
A great hypostyle room in the building is reminiscent of the great mosques
of the Islamic world. Nouvel's success in this building is to have linked
two cultures, both visually and technologically, in an apparently simple
way. A panel from the facade of the institute is on show in the ICA which
looks both beautiful, complex and expensive.
Eight key buildings are displayed in the exhibition, all shown in slide and
video form with little comprehensible commentary. This perverse way of
exhibiting has been devised by the architect himself. He designed a similar
exhibition in Paris a few years ago, in an attempt to convey his belief that
architecture and cinema are closely related.
Architecture does indeed exist as part of a dimension of time and movement
and I am inclined to agree that much of the architectural experience is to
be enjoyed as part of a movement through a succession of spaces. However,
Nouvel tells us this as though Baroque, Mannerist and indeed Gothic
architecture had never existed.
The eight buildings show the range of Nouvel's work. His public housing,
Nemausus in Nimes, resembles a boat with staircases and balconies running
around the outside of the 'hull'. The architect explains the appearance as
'drama and narrative of voyage where space and light contributes to the
dignity of each dwelling'. Of course . . .
It is possible to enjoy the full Nouvel cuisine by staying at one of the
hotels he has designed. The Hotel les Thermes at Dax in France is a simple
glass box covered in wooden shutters, 'the narrative of light and shade . .
.'
More interesting is the Hotel Saint-James on a hillside site overlooking the
Garonne in Bordeaux. Here the modern sets of rooms are clad in rusting metal
duckboards so that the whole complex resembles the tobacco drying sheds of
the area. The hotel rooms are simple with waxed concrete walls and plaster.
The sensual gratification comes from the food of the brilliant young chef,
Jean-Marie Amat, who commissioned this hotel at Bouliac.
One room at the ICA is furnished with chairs and tables by Jean Nouvel where
you can immerse yourself in the Nouvel experience by reading every known
article and book about him. It is important not to miss two projects. The
giant Tour Sans Fins the tallest and most slim tower in Europe. It will soar
transparently against the skies of Paris, alongside the arch at La Defense,
to a height of over 420 metres. The renovations of the Lyons Opera House
will open next spring, and they show a sensitivity to the old house as well
as some exciting additions.
Apart from the pretentiousness of this exhibition it demonstrates that Jean
Nouvel is an interesting architectural figure. His work is beautifully
executed and sometimes original and he draws upon a rich range of
contemporary cultural experiences. The work has a confidence and pragmatism
that is admirable.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Arts: Hamlet - Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adrian Noble's new production of Hamlet at the Barbican must be among the
best you are likely to see. One of the main reasons why is that Noble plays
the text in full - the performance lasts 4 1/2 hours. As a result, not only
do you learn more about Hamlet the man, but also about the society in which
he lives.
It is only possible to mount a production like this if you have supreme
self-confidence. Noble has confidence in every word of the text, in the
actors, in the designer and above all in his own ability to see the play as
a whole.
He directs Hamlet as if it were a symphony with some startling changes of
pace and an eye for detail down to the smallest player.
It is a very moving play, to be sure, but this is the first Hamlet where you
might be tempted to weep at the death of Gertrude.
Noble works by symmetries. One of the most notable is Polonius and his
family. Although there is no mention of a mother, it is obviously a happy
one which knows its place in the court: below the royals, but above much of
the rest - hence Ophelia's Christian burial.
David Bradley's wonderful Polonius is not a buffoon, but a well-educated
civil servant plainly regarded as efficient by the king. When Hamlet says of
him in front of the players 'He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps', we know that the prince is being unfair. Polonius also has genuine
fears that his daughter is getting out of her depth by being wooed so close
to the throne.
The first time we see Ophelia (Joanne Pearce) she is in a nursery bedroom,
with an upright piano, painted in nursery colours, in the background. She is
a young girl growing up and only beginning to use powder and paint. Only a
few signs, but there are enough, give a hint of future turbulence. Ms Pearce
knows how to conserve her energy: the mad scene when it comes is
devastating.
Hamlet refers to the symmetries himself when he says of Laertes 'For by the
image of my cause I see the portraiture of his' - another family broken up.
And even Claudius, in lines that are sometimes cut, acknowledges that the
Queen has removed herself from him, 'But that I know love is begun by time
 .' The remarkable fact about this court is that everybody thinks and
broods.
The symmetries come out in the language as well. Horatio's 'Good night,
sweet prince' echoes Ophelia's earlier 'Good night, ladies.' Every word
counts, every word fits. The sets by Bob Crowley never intrude too much.
Only once does Crowley go for the spectacular when the court of Denmark
turns out to have its own red and gilt theatre for private performances. At
the front of the stage is a slightly overgrown miniature cemetery. It serves
for Ophelia to pick her flowers.
There are innovations as well as fidelities. In the play scene, Kenneth
Branagh's Hamlet takes the word 'merry', which is how Ophelia describes him,
literally. He appears to be drunk. And when the play within the play reaches
a climax, Hamlet commits the crime himself. When he declines to kill
Claudius while the king is at his prayers, he leaves his sword behind for
Claudius to see. He plays the early part of the nunnery scene with Ophelia
as if he genuinely wants her to be looked after; only when he senses the
presence of Polonius does he become rough.
There are some magnificent details. One incident requires no words, but
speaks volumes about Horatio (Rob Edwards). He may be a learned man and a
good friend of Hamlet, but he is not at home in evening dress. Look at the
way he wears the waistcoat and tails which have clearly been hired for the
court dinner.
Then there is Osric, played by Guy Henry who will be remembered for his
Ananias in the RSC's splendid production of The Alchemist. This is not the
customary fop, but a courtier of some dignity capable of standing up to
Hamlet's insults and discharging his duties.
In almost any other production, one would have discussed Hamlet first, and
indeed Branagh's performance is faultless. He looks young, has short hair,
but I suppose Hamlets are getting younger. There is no doubt of his love for
Ophelia, but he is also capable of being cruel and arrogant. He is perhaps
not quite as different from the rest of the court as is sometimes supposed.
The principal triumph, however, is not to steal the show.
Only two quibbles. It is surprising that in the line 'Madness in greatness
must not unwatched go' Noble allows the word 'unwatched' to be pronounced as
if it had only two syllables. And judging by the sound effects, Hamlet
appears to set off for England by train. The production is financially
supported by Unilever.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Restoring infrastructure in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As part of the Kuwait reconstruction programme following the Gulf War,
UNITED GULF CONSTRUCTION (UGC) has been awarded what is believed to be the
largest ever microtunnelling project in the Middle East, and probably the
world.
The UGC contract, worth in excess of Pounds 1m, comprises more than 70km of
sewer pipe and pipe refurbishment of which about 4.5km will be constructed
with the aid of Iseki microtunnelling systems.
The works, designed by Associated Consulting Engineers of Athens, Greece,
mark the start of the rebuilding of Kuwait's underground infrastructure.
The company is purchasing three Unclemole slurry-shield microtunnelling
systems from Euro Iseki of Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Approximately 40
per cent of the microtunnelling work will be to install 250mm id sewers.
Specially designed clayware jacking pipes for the sewer are being
manufactured and supplied by Naylor Bros. (Clayware) from the Denlok range.
Work has commenced on the project, and will be subject to a continuous
programme of method assessment. The Iseki packages and Naylor Denlok pipes
will be delivered next January.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Passenger Transport Authority has accepted tenders totalling Pounds 14m
to carry out civil engineering work on a new cross city rail link.
TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has been awarded a contract worth Pounds 7.7m
to carry out bridgework and prepare the track formation for the four mile
rail route from Birmingham Snow Hill to Smethwick. KIER CONSTRUCTION, MOWLEM
(MIDLANDS) and AMEC CIVIL ENGINEERING have won the contracts to build new
stations at the Jewelley Quarter (Pounds 2m), the Hawthorns (Pounds 1.5m)
and Smethwick Galton Bridge station (Pounds 2.9m) respectively.
Contracts to carry out track, signalling and associated works will be let at
a later date.
The Pounds 23m project will create a Stourbridge/Worcester to Stratford
/Leamington cross city link via Snow Hill and Moor Street. The Transport
Authority is using Pounds 15m of its own capital receipts, backed by a
Pounds 5m European Community grant and Pounds 3m from Regional Railways to
finance the project.
With an extra 40,000 passengers a week expected to be attracted by the link,
extra passenger income means that the scheme will pay for itself within 15
years. The project will link the Jewellery Quarter and West Bromwich to the
rail network and improve reliability for Stourbridge commuters.
It will also ease capacity problems on the Wolverhampton/New Street line, so
that plans for a new station to serve the National Indoor Arena and ICC can
be developed. The link is expected to be open by summer 1995.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Robb, who has just resigned as chairman of Aberdeen Trust, is taking
over the chairmanship of oil and gas producer Aberdeen Petroleum, a
USM-quoted company he helped found in 1981. He succeeds Calum MacLeod, who
has been the company's only chairman to date.
Robb, who remains on the board of Aberdeen Trust, says that Aberdeen
Petroleum 'suffers the problem shared by many small oil companies, namely
that they are perfectly healthy but are just not big enough to generate any
interest among the institutions. One of the challenges for me is to raise
our profile.'
Like Robb, MacLeod, 57, worked at a (different) firm of Aberdeen solicitors
on the investment management side. He has since become a free-lance company
director, among other things chairing Britannia Life as well as being deputy
chairman of Grampian TV. He is stepping down from the oil company, having
been made chairman of the Grampian Health Board.
The company, which is headquartered in London and whose interests are
presently entirely in the US, has recently made an approach to - and been
initially rebuffed by - fellow-USM company Brabant, which is focused in the
UK.

FT  21 DEC 92 / People: Wambold spearheads Lazard's international corporate
finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ali Wambold, a partner of New York's Lazard Freres &amp; Co, has been given the
task of spearheading the international corporate finance business of its
London relation, Lazard Brothers &amp; Co.
Wambold, 38, who is responsible for UK and European investment banking for
Lazard Freres, has been based in the London headquarters of Lazard Brothers
for several years, and will continue as chief executive of the New York
firm's London business.
However, his appointment as a managing director of Lazard Brothers, with
'particular responsibility to lead the firm's international corporate
finance business', is a further sign that the three Lazard banking houses -
in New York, London and Paris - are working increasingly closely together.
Although all three firms have been successful in their home markets, the
growing amount of international corporate finance work has resulted in a
need for better co-ordination.
David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers which is 50 per cent owned by the
Financial Times' parent Pearson, says that Wambold's job is new, but adds
that it was the 'message rather than the title' which was important. He said
that Wambold, who is descended from the old Persian royal family, had become
'very much part of the firm' and had 'great energy, guts and go'.
Wambold started his investment banking career on Wall Street, first with
Lehman Brothers and then Lazard Freres where he helped found Corporate
Partners, a Dollars 1.6bn investment partnership which takes friendly
long-term stakes in major companies. Included among his outside
directorships is a seat on the board of Albert Fisher.
Lazard Brothers has also announced the appointment of the following
executive directors: John Collins, Anthony Coveney, Federico de Giorgis,
Keith Jones and Nicholas Shott.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Improving Brighton's sewerage system
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When you're lying on Brighton beach next summer put your ear to the shingle
and listen carefully: 30 metres below you sophisticated tunnelling equipment
and dozens of construction workers will be carving a cathedral-like cavern
out of the chalk.
When completed, you will be able to drive a double-decker bus through the
six metre diameter and five kilometre long tunnel, which will stretch from
one end of the beach to the other - from Brighton marina to Hove.
Technology similar to that used in the Channel Tunnel will be employed to
excavate the Pounds 30m tunnel, which is designed as an overflow for
Brighton's wastewater system, to be used in heavy storms.
Although the primarily Victorian sewerage system serving Brighton and Hove
is still in excellent condition, there is a risk of overflow into the sea
during particularly heavy rain.
The tunnel will eliminate this risk by collecting and storing the excess
wastewater, which after the storm will be pumped to the treatment works for
normal treatment.
The tunnel's storage capacity will be 123,000 cu metres or about 26m
gallons. The main entry point for tunnelling will be at Black Rock to the
east of Brighton and will be extended westward to Hove. Four dropshafts will
be constructed on the foreshore to interecept storm overflow discharges.
Contracts are expected to go out to tender this week and work is expected to
take three years to complete.
The tunnelling project is part of a programme which will see Southern Water
investing more than Pounds 3m each week for the next 10 years on a large
number of projects throughout its supply area.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO JAPANESE AIRPORT CONSORTIUM has been awarded the Pounds 25m contract
for the design and engineering development of the new international airport
for Kuala Lumpur at Sepang by the Malaysian Government.
The consortium comprises Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of the BICC
Group, GEC-Marconi, Trafalgar House Construction together with Gammon of
Hong Kong, and Marubeni Corporation of Japan. It will shortly complete the
masterplan study for the new airport, which was awarded in February this
year, for which BAA in conjunction with JAC of Japan were lead consultants.
Construction of the permanent works is expected to start on site in July
1993.
The Malaysian Government has identified and safeguarded a 10,000 hectare
site for the airport near Sepang, some 50km to the south of Kuala Lumpur.
The airport is scheduled to open in 1997.
The detailed engineering and first stage construction of the airport will
include two runways, terminal buildings and associated infrastructure.
The masterplan for the airport includes proposals for a road and a dedicated
rail line to Kuala Lumpur. It is intended that the project should be funded
by a mixture of private and public finance.
AJAC are employing Sir William Halcrow &amp; Partners together with Malaysian
engineering companies - HSSI, SSP and Ranhill to carry out the design work.
Architectural design will be carried out by Akitek Jururancang together with
Kisho Kurokawa of Japan. Kleinwort Benson are the financial advisers.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Management: A bumper year in store for books about business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging the most internationally influential business books of any
particular year is always a hazardous exercise.
But in 1990 they were probably George Stalk and Tom Hout's Competing Against
Time, plus Richard Pascale's Managing on the Edge, which dealt with the
challenging task of revitalising companies by making them 'engines of
inquiry'.
In 1991 Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline almost certainly took the prize;
this focused on the formidable topic of systems thinking, as part of the
broader concept of how to turn one's company into a learning organisation
capable of adapting to - and even anticipating - all the changes in its
competitive environment.
Ripples from Senge's work have continued to spread this year, especially in
Europe, where it was published only last winter. A similar delayed impact
has occurred in the US over the past 18 months with Charles Handy's The Age
of Unreason, which first appeared in Europe in 1989.
Apart from the latest works of Drucker, Peters and Moss Kanter (with The
Challenge of Organisational Change), one of the most internationally
influential books published in 1992 was Corporate Culture and Performance,
by Kotter and Heskett of Harvard, which shows how companies can be made more
adaptive.
The new year promises to be a real cracker. Apart from the continuing impact
of Peters (with his Liberation Management), and the new Drucker and Porter,
the 1993 schedule includes Handy's The Age of Paradox, a new Stalk &amp; Hout on
Gaining Time, and a Henry Mintzberg attack on strategic planning.
One book awaited with special eagerness in the trade is Competing for the
Future, by C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel. This will be the first book
co-authored by these two professors, but as authors of a string of
influential articles in the Harvard Business Review over the past few years,
they have built an exciting reputation, which sparked an energetic
publishers' auction for their signatures. It was won by Harvard.
With Mintzberg in support, the book will bring strategy back to centre stage
after almost a decade. It will set the cat among the pigeons in two senses:
by attacking the west's allegedly unimaginative strategic thinking over the
past 20 years; and by challenging the current American obsession with
're-engineering' and operational improvement. It could also catapult the duo
towards popular guru status.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Management: Go to work on some calcium - Health check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do such diverse things as teeth, bones, oyster shells, chalk,
limestone, marble and pearls have in common? Calcium. This mineral is
essential in maintaining bone density, nerve transmission, heart beat
regulation, muscle contraction and blood clotting.
Moreover, researchers are finding increasingly important roles for calcium,
notably with regard to heart disease. More than 95 per cent of the body's
calcium is in the bones.
One's need for calcium increases steadily through adolesence. Between the
ages of 20 and 40, calcium increases bone density and thickness.
Osteoporosis, or 'porous bones', is a gradual loss of structural minerals
(decalcification) which begins in adulthood and progresses with age.
If you are worried about osteoporosis, consider these measures:
Take regular exercise. A 20-30 minute walk three times a week will help to
keep your bones strong and healthy.
Don't smoke.
Have only moderate alcohol and coffee consumption.
If you are a woman, discuss estrogen hormonal replacement with your doctor.
Increase daily calcium intake. Calcium-rich foods include low-fat skimmed
milk, yoghurt, cheeses, leafy greens, canned salmon, sardines with bones,
kale, broccoli and tofu.
Avoid aluminium-containing antacids.
Avoid eating excessive protein.
If you feel that you are unable to get enough calcium, either because of
insufficient intake or excessive loss - through drinking of alcohol and
coffee - you could consider calcium supplements. However, as extra calcium
intake can be associated with kidney stones, check with your doctor before
beginning such a regime.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Management: Warhorses on parade - What does it take to be a
business guru? Christopher Lorenz finds the nature of the job is changing as
the experts listen to their own advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST glance, it seems quite like old times. Almost all the well-worn
international warhorses have just reappeared on parade, or will do so during
the next 12 months. In the front rank, as for the past decade, stand one
Canadian, Henry Mintzberg, and four Americans: Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Tom
Peters, Michael Porter, plus the captain of them all, Peter Drucker. They
are now accompanied by an old British hand, Charles Handy, who has been
accepted as an international leader only in the last 18 months.
But behind them, things are stirring in the lesser ranks.
Struggling to be noticed, and succeeding handsomely from time to time, is a
fresh breed of warriors with a more focused approach to business warfare.
Most of them are also Americans, such as David Nadler, Peter Senge and
George Stalk. But they also represent a rather broader smattering of
nationalities, including - appropriately for the guru business - several
Indians.
Military metaphors are more appropriate than one might think for the world
of business gurus. True, the rivalry between them for fame and fortune is
decidedly cerebral, and most go to great lengths to be polite about each
other - in public, anyway.
Many of their ideas also overlap. Most agree on the changes being wrought by
the growth of 'knowledge-based organisations' (in Drucker's phrase) and by
the accelerating pace of change in every aspect of business, including the
need for managers and other employees to be 'liberated' (a Peters-ism) from
the bureaucracy which often stifles companies.
But some clashes of approach will emerge with a vengeance in 1993, to a
degree which could create a real battleground around one particular book
next autumn (see right).
Battle is certainly the right word for the commercial jostling going on
between publishers to promote their younger authors as tomorrow's Moss
Kanters, Handys, Porters - even perhaps Druckers.
The redoubtable Drucker, who at the age of 83 is still producing a new book
a year, has already sold 80,000 copies in the US of this year's Managing For
The Future, 90,000 in Japan and more than 40,000 in its UK edition. Tom
Peters, whose fatter blockbusters now tend to appear about every five years,
is thought to have chalked up over 750,000 copies just in the US of his last
book, Thriving on Chaos (1987). His new one, Liberation Management, hit the
ground running on its publication a few weeks ago.
These days, book sales are only the base of the guru business. Way above
them, in terms of dollars per hour of expended effort, soar videos (selling
at Dollars 2,000 or more per cassette), speeches and consulting. With speech
fees of Dollars 25,000 a session (or up to Dollars 50,000 for Peters), plus
US consulting fees which can reach several times a senior business
professor's salary of up to about Dollars 140,000, even a minor guru is
minting it.
In Europe such fees are lower, but they can still propel a professor-guru to
several times his (rarely her) academic salary. The Brussels-based
Management Centre Europe runs an especially broad range of conferences for
top executives which star old warhorses as well as younger specialists in
strategy, marketing, technology, leadership, human resources and so on. Many
are continental Europeans.
Such activities can put even European academics on a similar level of
overall earning power as the businessmen-gurus (there are few women as yet).
The appeal of most such people tends to be domestic. But, as John Sculley
has found in the US, Sir John Harvey-Jones in Britain and Alain Minc in
France, that does not make them paupers.
Meanwhile several of the best known US and European academic names are
thought to have almost trebled their earning power as speakers in recent
years by signing up with an agency which made its name by acting for the
original Star Trek crew and Vincent Price, the horror actor. Which is
entirely appropriate given the entertainment value offered by the best of
the mega-gurus.
But what of the research and ideas behind all this mammon? The way things
are shifting is evident from the events of the past decade.
When business books first exploded into mass-market products in 1982, most
business gurus were generalists. Their doyen, Peter Drucker, exemplifies the
genre by his very stretching of its boundaries. Alone among the business
gurus, he can range comfortably from advising on individual management
styles and organisational culture right into macro economics, politics and
society. He does so again with his latest book, Post-Capitalist Society,
which will appear in a few weeks' time.
From the 'soft', organisational end of the spectrum, Charles Handy comes
closest to him, but would not pretend to Drucker's economic expertise. At
the 'hard' end of the spectrum, Harvard economist Michael Porter plunged
into the world of business strategy and transformed it before broadening his
field still further by turning to the competitive advantage of nations. His
latest foray has been into the US capital investment system, the subject of
a big book next autumn.
Like Handy, Moss Kanter and Peters use society as a backdrop to investigate
the shifting nature of business organisations.
Apart from Japan's Kenichi Ohmae, the list of today's mega-guru generalists
stops there. By contrast, most recent books have plunged into detail about
only one or at most two of these areas.
Whereas much of the focus in the mid-1980s was on business strategy -
including globalisation, product differentiation and alliances - almost the
only outstanding strategy book of the last few years, other than Ohmae's,
has been Pankaj Ghemawat's Commitment - The Dynamic of Strategy (1991).
Instead, the main focus of most business books since the late 1980s has been
on organisational issues. They have ranged from a spate of works on quality
to a rush on the management of change. Since 1991 there has been a veritable
flood on 'organisational architecture', 'business process redesign', and
various aspects of so-called 'organisational re-engineering'.
This shift of emphasis by so many writers is no coincidence. It reflects two
trends. The first is the growing preoccupation of business people with the
difficulties of implementing strategies, and with the urgent need to make
their organisations more cost-effective and responsive to customers.
The second reason is what one might call the coming-of-age of the business
books business. As industries from cars to fast food have matured, business
academics have advised them to 'segment' (specialise) their markets more.
The academics are now applying the same formula to themselves, partly to
create more demand, and partly in response to the growing sophistication of
the customer. Thanks to all the generalist literature of the early and
mid-1980s - from In Search of Excellence to the One Minute Manager series -
most managers have learned basic concepts, and want to focus on the
complexities of how really to make things happen.
That, with the exception of the mega-gurus, is why most books now tend to be
relatively specialised. But it will also make it harder for the new
generation of authors to ring the changes often enough to be able to return
to the battleground with a string of best sellers. To be a true guru, you
have to do that.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Economics: Fall tipped in British GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE final figures for UK gross domestic product in the third quarter are
published today, with details on expenditure and the components of output.
GDP, including oil and gas extraction, is forecast to have fallen a further
0.7 per cent, compared with the third quarter last year - although some
economists are expecting a small increase.
Later in the week, figures for real personal disposable income may show a
small drop in the savings ratio from 10.3 per cent in the second quarter to
10 per cent in the third. However, the latest figure is unlikely to reflect
any change in spending habits after the reduction in base rates to 7 per
cent after Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism on September
16.
If lower interest rates have enticed people to save less and spend more, the
effect will probably show up in the fourth quarter figures, not due until
early next year. All markets will be closed on Friday, except in Japan,
where trading continues and a string of economic statistics is due.
Other economic events and figures published this week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, a
financial information company.
Today: UK GDP for third quarter (flat on quarter, down 0.7 per cent on
year); Germany, November Ifo business climate; US, November Treasury budget
(-Dollars 38.8bn); Canada, October retail sales (up 0.2 per cent); Japan,

FT  21 DEC 92 / Bucking The Trend: A good living depending on tube bending /
A look at how a northern engineering company makes the most out of a niche
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS Friday afternoon and raining hard in Preston. While hundreds of
British engineering companies close early for the weekend in time-honoured
tradition, an overtime shift is cutting metal at Addison Tube Forming.
About half the direct labour force of 52 people are making machines that
bend tubes and pipes, and closely related measuring equipment. In the middle
of the machine shop is an automatic Pounds 500,000 machining centre from
which Addison is getting 30 hours of unmanned work a week.
'It's a nice feeling switching the lights off at night and letting the
machine get on with it,' says Mr John Brown, managing director. 'We could
not have managed without it.'
The company still has to subcontract some of its machining. In contrast to
the gloomy news from much of the UK machinery sector over the past two
years, Addison's sales are rising - by about 13 per cent to Pounds 9.5m this
year - and employment has risen by about 30 per cent since 1986 to 142,
excluding temporary workers taken on to help meet demand.
According to Mr Harry Addison, vice-chairman, the performance promises to
continue. 'The prospects are excellent, and certainly as far as next year is
concerned we've upped our forecasts again.'
All that might sound surprising for a company that depends on the automotive
industry for about 70 per cent of sales - its tube bending machinery is used
heavily by the exhaust industry - and serves depressed UK sectors such as
aerospace and furniture.
Addison is part of B. Elliott, a struggling engineering concern that this
month announced a big financial restructuring after the collapse of the
mainstream UK and Continental machine tool trade. Addison's tube bending and
forming equipment has emerged from the restructuring as the linchpin of B.
Elliott's machinery division.
'They've divested themselves of the parts that were pulling the group down,'
says Mr Addison. 'We still are, and hope to continue to be, ones that are
making money.'
Addison's performance through the recession shows that there are no magic
recipes for bucking the trend. Rather, it is a combination of planning ahead
and taking advantage of opportunities as they come up.
The company has a head start over many machine tool producers of a similar
size by operating in a specialist niche. Worldwide, it is among the top five
or six of about 35 producers of tube bending equipment, and clear market
leader in the UK.
Having a niche is no use unless it is exploited. Mr Addison has heard
reports that some of the company's competitors are on two-day or three-day
weeks. 'It's not necessarily the case that we've taken orders from them, but
we've gone out to find new markets and develop new products.'
In contrast to most machine tool companies, Addison was founded in 1956 as a
sales company - by Mr Addison's elder brother Eddie - and did not make its
first tube bending machine until 1981.
'It's still basically like a sales company,' says Mr Brown, the only senior
executive at Addison with a machine tool background. 'It's very much a
question of making what we sell, not selling what we make.'
The roots of Addison's current performance were laid down in 1985, when Mr
Brown joined the company. Addison was then virtually entirely dependent on
the automotive sector, and mapped out its future with a set of targets
including expanding its market sectors and product range, increasing exports
and widening its export markets, and improving quality and reliability. That
policy is bearing fruit. As the UK market has contracted, exports have risen
from about 50 per cent of sales in 1989 to 70 per cent, but have also risen
sharply in absolute terms.
The product range for tube bending machines has been extended to 16
machines, including smaller equipment that can bend pipe as narrow as 4mm
diameter to leviathans that can handle tube as wide as 275mm. The result is
that, even if some sectors in some countries are quiet, others are buoyant.
In particular, Addison has been helped through the recession by 'specials'
made in response to individual customers' needs. In the assembly shop,
workers are putting the final touches to a complex machine to produce petrol
pump filling pipes. 'Specials have ensured that we keep growing,' Mr Addison
says.
Prompted by the parent company, which bought the formerly family-owned
company in 1989, a quality programme is now 'digging itself in', Mr Brown
says. The parent company has also provided capital for important investment
in manufacturing technology to reduce delivery times and increase
flexibility.
Mr Addison is convinced the growth will continue, barring a collapse in the
world economy. 'There are still markets to go to, and still products that we
don't yet make,' he says.
The company has four months of orders in hand, with machines to be delivered
at home and abroad. But, helped by the devaluation of sterling, Addison will
be continuing to emphasise exports. Mr Addison does not see the UK coming
out of the recession yet.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Cabbies try to give taxman a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has found in the form of London taxi drivers new and
unexpected allies in its battle against tax evaders.
Drivers of black cabs - in a retaliation effort at a time of intense
competition for fares - are contacting the Revenue, the Department of Social
Security and the police in growing numbers with information on minicab
drivers.
Several drivers' associations are acting as collecting points for details of
minicabs which they gather on forms and from telephone calls from black cabs
in the City and the suburbs.
The authorities are then able to follow up those leads through their
investigators in local offices to see whether the drivers are declaring
their income.
'Minicab drivers have no insurance and half of them are claiming dole,' one
taxi driver alleged yesterday. 'I wouldn't trust my daughter or wife in one
of those.'
Behind the public spirit is a sense of hatred and frustration as the
capital's roads have become increasingly patrolled by minicabs, which the
black cabs claim are unlicensed and unscrupulous.
Mr Harry Feigen, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association,
said all of his 5,500 black-cab members were submitting thousands of number
plate details by calling its 24-hour 'tout line' and sending in 'tout cards'
giving details of minicab sightings.
'Minicabs are easy to spot if you know how,' he said. 'They all carry this
metallic aerial. A great section of them are operating illegally. We think
we're helping by reporting them.'
He said he hoped much of the matter could be reduced when the government
announces the details of new legislation on minicabs early next year.
In the meantime, he said the recession had boosted enthusiasm for the level
of informing in the past few months - although drivers have little reason to
love the Inland Revenue.
The Revenue won a court case as far back as 1947 ruling that tips are
assessable for tax, and its officials are believed to periodically pose as
drivers so they can discover the average amount that customers tip.
The Revenue insisted that it did not ask the drivers for their help, and it
would not say how useful the information was.
'We are not asking the drivers to shop people,' an official said. 'They came
to us. If that's what they want to do, we are always interested. I don't
think there's an ethical issue.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Corporate 'bullying' case sent to DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS that a large company has engaged in 'corporate bullying' have
been passed to the Department of Trade and Industry, giving ministers a rare
opportunity to take up a case where a small company feels unfairly treated.
The DTI believes that the fact that a copy of the material was sent to it
represents a step forward in its efforts to go into battle on behalf of
small businesses. In many cases, small companies are reluctant to complain
about their dealings with large companies, for fear that they will lose
business.
The letter given to the DTI is from a large company to one of its suppliers.
The large company asks its supplier for help in dealing with the difficulty
that prices for goods delivered for Christmas were set in the summer and so
were unable to take account of the impact on import prices of sterling's
devaluation after leaving the European exchange rate mechanism.
Explaining that it cannot absorb the sudden cost increase alone, the large
company seeks a 'contribution' to 'ensure a continued place for you as a
supplier'. A deduction would be made from the next payment to the supplier
company.
The DTI is conscious that some small businesses are unable to reject such
pressure. It believes, however, that legislation is not the answer because
companies might shrink from pursuing through the courts a matter so critical
to a commercial relationship.
Baroness Denton, minister responsible for small businesses, yesterday urged
small companies to present examples of when they had been badly treated by
larger companies, and promised to raise them with the other parties.
'This is more evidence that small firms are under the greatest pressure,'
she said. 'The future of this country's economy depends on the relationship
between small firms and large firms. Small and medium-sized firms are the
answer for employment.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Fears over EC trade law go unresolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED simplifications to EC trade regulations due to start next month
remain in doubt in spite of a directive approved last week.
Mr Mike Arnold, a value added tax partner at accountants Price Waterhouse,
warned that a clause in the directive delaying its introduction for another
year might cause chaos.
The directive came in response to 'triangulation', in which a company in one
country uses a sub-contractor in a second country to supply to a customer in
a third EC state.
The directive reduces the red tape required to administer VAT. A company's
intermediary will be able to submit a single customer to account for the
VAT. Under the directive, EC member states will not have to adopt the
necessary laws and procedures to introduce the agreement until January 1994.
Mr Arnold said that, as a result, customers in countries that had not
introduced the legislation during the next year might refuse to account for
the VAT themselves.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Field urges shift on welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL SHIFT in Labour's approach to the welfare state, including the
transfer of ownership of pension assets, is urged today by Mr Frank Field,
Labour chairman of the cross-party Commons social security committee.
In a move that highlights the divergence within the Labour party about the
future of universal benefits, Mr Field, in a paper for a Fabian Society
conference next month, questions whether all pensions, or just those of the
poorest, should benefit from annual uprating.
The paper is published just three days after Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, launched the Commission on Social Justice, a semi-independent body,
to carry out a thorough review of taxation and benefits.
Mr Smith opposes moving away from universal social security benefits. Mr
Field, however, emphasises the need for change in order to alter voters'
view of Labour. 'Sticking-plaster policies won't do . . . If the CSJ is
successful, a new dawn will have broken and the voters will see Labour as
the party of the future for the first time in 13 years.'
Mr Field argues that pension reform should aim to abolish 'pension serfdom'
by giving people control over their pension assets, even if that means
forfeiting the principle of basing pensions on final salary.
Any move to money-purchase schemes would have to ensure that employers still
contribute, as some already do, he adds.
'We need to scrap the 200-year traditional approach to welfare policy . . .
The task facing Labour now is nothing less than designing policies which
lock an ever-increasing proportion of the population into an income from
work and welfare,' he says.
He sees the transfer of pension assets leading to a new form of collectivism
that gives unions the opportunity to develop a role in managing pension fund
assets.
Comparing big pension fund managers with 'medieval barons', Mr Field says
their control of funds leads to short-termism, and argues that the effective
ownership of companies by pensioners and the workforce would help to reverse
that trend.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Hidden perils of an office romance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICE PARTY romances can carry a greater risk than mere hangovers,
according to the Labour Research Depart-ment.
An analysis of industrial tribunal cases in the department's magazine shows
that sexual relationships that affect people's jobs are fraught with
pitfalls.
Employers can dismiss employees for their personal conduct if it:
Disrupts other workplace relationships or activ-ities.
Threatens to harm the business.
Affects job performance or employees' work ability.
Employees cannot always avoid difficulties by getting married. Some
workplaces have rules saying that married couples should not work in the
same office.
A council housing officer, for example, who refused to move when he married
somebody from the same office, was dismissed. An industrial tribunal upheld
the sacking, saying the man had not been dismissed because he had married.
If his wife had not been a housing officer he would not have lost his job.
In general, difficulties that affect married couples working together are
more likely to surface when one partner left for another job, Labour
Research says. Employers may, for instance, fear leaks of information.
In one case, a marketing assistant was told that, although her salary would
be maintained, she would be moved to a much lower-graded post after her
husband left to work for a rival company. She refused and was dismissed. A
tribunal said the company had acted reasonably in dismissing her.

FT  21 DEC 92 / BR chief criticises sell-off plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BOB REID, the chairman of British Rail, yesterday gave his strongest
warning so far about plans for privatising BR. He urged ministers to build
on BR's achievements instead of breaking it up.
While Sir Bob has been known for some time to be anxious about aspects of
the plans to split the railway into a track authority and privately owned
companies running competing services, his call yesterday for privatisation
to 'evolve' rather than be introduced with disruption is his most open
attack yet on the proposals.
'If you start to break it up and you disrupt it you will break the momentum,
you will give yourself major safety validation problems . . . and you will
not get a better service for some long time to come,' he said on BBC radio's
The World This Weekend.
He was particularly concerned about the effect of privatisation plans on
rolling-stock manufacturers. BR had no new orders at present, and people
would start being made redundant within 12-18 months at the latest.
Apart from the difficulties that would be caused in re-assembling expertise
when there were fresh orders, he said, an opportunity to build up an export
industry was being lost.
Sir Bob believed that the railway should meet the social needs of the
country as well as the economic needs, and expressed doubts about whether
the best way to involve the private sector was 'in a total structure which
covers the whole country and divides the railway up and radically breaks it
up'.
Sir Bob said that the critical issue for the government was to decide what
mix of commercial and social railway it wanted. He also forecast that BR's
service next year would be poorer as difficulties from the tightness of the
public-spending settlement and the fall in revenues worked their way through
into the railway's performance. He renewed his call for annual investment of
Pounds 1.2bn-Pounds 4bn in BR.
His remarks stung the Department of Transport to emphasise that it had
detailed and regular meetings with BR on privatisation, and prompted Labour
to call on ministers to abandon their 'unworkable' privatisation plans.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Broadcasting newcomer promises cost-effective TV: How
Westcountry's approach will differ from its predecessor's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Stephen Redfarn could not be more proud of his converted factory on the
Langage Science Park on the outskirts of Plymouth.
In 10 months the factory has been turned into the headquarters of
Westcountry Television, the new ITV broadcaster that will take over the
licence from Television South West just after midnight on new year's day.
Westcountry will be one of the smallest ITV companies, concentrating, at
least in the beginning, on making programmes for the region rather than the
ITV network.
Yet what is happening on the outskirts of Plymouth provides an indication of
how ITV is changing.
Mr Redfarn, chief executive of Westcountry, who spent most of his working
life as a merchant banker, says: 'This is cost-effective television. It is
not a ticky-tacky television station.'
Contrasts between Westcountry and TSW, creations of two different eras in
television, go far beyond differences in location - TSW worked from city
centre studios in Ply-mouth.
At its peak TSW had 350 staff, although it now has a skeleton staff of about
140. Mr Redfarn thought he needed 167, but has decided 112 will do - partly
through cost savings in the depths of an advertising recession; partly from
farming out most programmes, apart from news and politics, to independent
producers.
In place of TSW's single transmission point in Ply-mouth, Westcountry plans
seven studios - three capable of broadcasting specially tailored news for
their areas, the rest capable of injecting breaking news stories.
Transmission was put out to tender and HTV, Westcountry's larger neighbour,
won the contract. Sale of advertising has been contracted out to the TSMS
sales house.
Rather than pay BT for links between studios, Westcountry will be the first
ITV company to have its own digital communications network. 'We get
telephones and data thrown in,' Mr Redfarn says enthusiastically.
There were months of uncertainty for Westcountry after it won its franchise
with a bid of Pounds 7.82m - TSW sought judicial review of the Independent
Television Commission's ruling that its bid of Pounds 16.2m was
unsustainable and the case went all the way to the House of Lords.
All that time, Mr Redfarn was unable to sign contracts. When the company
finally got its licence in April it was too late to build a studio.
After fact-finding in the US, Westcountry has come up with another British
first - using Videssence fluorescent studio lights, which are cool and
reduce the cost of air conditioning.
Westcountry's programmes will be under the control of Mr John Prescott
Thomas, former head of BBC Bristol's Network Production Centre.
The flagship programme will be Westcountry Live, an hour-long news and
magazine programme every weekday. There will be live political and sports
programmes, series on The West At Work and a regional quiz called Westwise.
Plans include a children's drama about children who set up a pirate
television station on Drake's Island on Plymouth Sound.
Westcountry has cost about Pounds 12m to set up and running costs, excluding
programme costs, will be about Pounds 12m a year.
Mr Redfarn, who has three main shareholders - Associated Newspapers,
Brittany Ferries and South West Water - has no doubt that the franchise will
be profitable.
Just how profitable will be influenced by how long smaller companies such as
Westcountry continue to receive the national ITV network at a subsidised
price.
The subsidy will be reviewed in two years and some large ITV companies feel
that in the new harsher world everyone should pay their own way.
It has been assumed until now that when takeovers of ITV companies become
possible in 1994 the big companies will swallow up the small ones. But what
if small companies such as Westcountry with its weighty shareholders were to
move against larger ITV companies?
Mr Redfarn simply smiles at the suggestion.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Role of independent directors 'growing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT directors are playing an increasingly important role in
regulating companies' activities in the UK, a survey published today by 3i,
a venture capital group, says.
Independent directors are well represented on public and private company
boards and form a majority in the largest companies. Most private companies
have at least one independent director.
They have increased their influence over remuneration and audit committees.
Virtually all are now chaired by an independent director and 44 per cent are
composed solely of independent directors. Two years ago, most such
committees had equal numbers of executive and non-executive directors.
Two thirds of independent directors spent between five and 30 days a year on
the task, and a quarter gave more time. Fifty-five per cent were paid
between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year for their services; a quarter
received between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 30,000, and just under one in 10
received more than Pounds 30,000.
Most companies reviewed fees annually, compared with the two-to-three-year
reviews common in 1990.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Belgian troops seize southern Somali port
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Belgian paratrooper talks to representatives of the warlord Col Omar Jess
in Kismayu after US and Belgian troops seized the southern Somali port
yesterday, prising control from the gunmen who have pillaged food relief for
the starving. Meanwhile a UN official said 30 trucks laden with food north
of Mogadishu were lost in an apparent case of looting. The vehicles were
believed to have been loaded with rice donated by French schoolchildren.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Why recovery may depend on higher bank margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMBINATION of accumulating bad debts, vocal complaints from small
businesses and a chancellor who is determined to ensure that all interest
rate cuts are passed directly to borrowers has made this a trying year for
Britain's banks. But, however justified it may be to criticise the
competence of UK bankers, their willingness and ability to lend will be a
central determinant of the pace of economic recovery next year. Whether
Britain's banks are able to start lending again soon may depend on whether
they are able to ignore Mr Norman Lamont's strictures.
Two items of economic news in the UK last week confirm the banks'
difficulties. On Thursday, Barclays bank announced a record Pounds 240m
write-off to cover property-related losses on loans made at the height of
the late 1980s boom. On Friday, the Bank of England announced that
commercial bank lending in November fell, unexpectedly, by Pounds 600m.
Nor are these problems peculiar to Britain, as the OECD acknowledged in its
latest gloomy economic outlook. Commercial banks in the US and Japan, as
well as in the UK, lent too much too cheap in the late 1980s to risky
property-related ventures, many of which have subsequently collapsed along
with the land and property prices upon which their financial health
depended. The banks are still trying to repair the damage to their balance
sheets.
This asset price collapse has bitten deep into the profits of the commercial
banks. The average rate of return on total assets of US banks was 0.73 per
cent in 1990-91 compared to 0.83 per cent in 1981-89. The average return
earned by UK banks was also 0.83 per cent in 1981-89 but has since fallen to
0.56 per cent in 1990-91, while the average return earned by Japanese banks
has slipped from 0.62 per cent to 0.40 per cent over the same period.
Commercial banks in all three countries have responded to this fall in
profitability by contracting credit growth. The charts, taken from the OECD
outlook, show the collapse in the growth of bank lending in all three
countries since 1989, particularly in the US and UK where credit has been
contracting this year.
Yet it is the rise in UK bank margins on existing loans, not the
unwillingness of the banks to make new loans, that has aroused the
chancellor's ire. Barclays and National Westminster have both raised the
average margin over the base lending rate that they charge to small business
from 3.1 percentage points 18 months ago to 3.5 percentage points today.
Are the UK banks behaving unfairly? The mark-up over the base lending rate
of UK banks is certainly bigger than that of US banks, and has risen
further. Mr Christopher Snyder, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, a
New York-based financial information company, says that the average mark-up
over the prime lending rate for middle market loans is 1.35 percentage
points, while smaller and less credit worthy borrowers might face a 2
percentage point mark-up. He estimates that this mark-up has risen by about
0.3 percentage points over the past two years.
Yet this comparison between mark-ups is puzzling because UK bank profits are
both smaller and have fallen further than in the US. It is also misleading.
For the US banks have been encouraged by the Federal Reserve to rebuild
their balance sheets through a more direct means. While the Fed has reduced
US short-term interest rates to half UK levels by cutting the rate at which
it lends to commercial banks, the gap between the prime rate and the Fed
Funds rate has risen by 1.5 percentage points over the last two years, as
the chart shows. In the UK, by contrast, the gap between the base overdraft
rate and the money market rate is both much smaller - 0.5 percentage points
compared to over 2.5 percentage points in the US - and has been falling
recently.
So while the average US bank mark-up over prime is smaller than the mark-up
over the base lending rate in the UK, US banks margins over market interest
rates are both larger and have risen more than in Britain. And the US has a
recovery.

FT  21 DEC 92 / S Korea's election results put opposition in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE comfortable victory of Mr Kim Young-sam's in Friday's South Korean
presidential election has given him a secure mandate to govern while leaving
the opposition in disarray.
As the candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), Mr Kim
received 42 per cent of the vote against 34 per cent for Mr Kim Dae-jung of
the main opposition Democratic Party and 16 per cent for Mr Chung Ju-yung,
the founder of the Hyundai business group. His margin of victory was wider
than expected.
Mr Kim, who will take office late in February, is hoping to improve the
DLP's slim majority in the legislature as a result of his victory. The DLP
has 161 seats out of 299.
The poor performance of the opposition parties in the election is expected
to encourage some MPs to defect to the DLP. The switching of party
affiliation is normal practice in South Korean politics, with more than 30
MPs having done so this year.
The resignation of Mr Kim Dae-jung as opposition leader and MP following his
defeat is likely to cause factional in-fighting within the Democratic Party,
which was formed only a year ago from a merger of two parties.
There are doubts about the survival of Mr Chung's United People's Party,
which was established earlier this year to support his failed bid for the
presidency. Most of the UPP's 37 MPs would join the DLP if the conservative
party collapsed.
Mr Chung also has to worry about possible government reprisals against his
Hyundai industrial conglomerate as his political strength wanes.
The group has already been subject to government harassment this year,
including tax penalties and credit squeezes, because of Mr Chung's political
ambitions.
One factor that may protect Hyundai from a crackdown is its status as the
nation's largest business group.

EC ministers yesterday agreed to overhaul their common fisheries programme

Although the Twelve did not accept all proposals of the EC's Commission to
guarantee sufficient stocks over the next decade, the deal still went well
beyond the current programme by introducing fishing licences by 1995 and
tougher fishing controls.

THE French parliament voted at the weekend to send Mr Laurent Fabius, leader

which more than 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected by blood tainted with the
HIV virus, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
The complex and rarely used process could take years to reach a conclusion.
The national assembly voted overwhelmingly on Saturday followed by the
Senate yesterday to send Mr Fabius, prime minister when the national blood
transfusion service supplied the infected blood in 1985, before a
parliamentary high court, along with Mrs Georgina Dufoix, former social
affairs minister and Mr Edmond Herve, former health minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE purge by President F W de Klerk of South African Defence Force members
involved in efforts to undermine the reform process has been welcomed by
other political parties, who believe further revelations are likely to
follow.
Mr de Klerk's announcement on Saturday that 23 SADF members, including two
generals and four brigadiers, had either been compulsorily retired or
suspended, is the largest reshuffle in defence force ranks since the first
world war.
The two generals sacked have been named by the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper
Rapport as Gen Hennie Roux, army chief of staff, and Gen Chris Thirion,
deputy chief of staff intelligence. Also alleged to have been sacked are
Brig Tolletjies Botha, head of the Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC),
and Brigadier Ferdi van Wyk, the mastermind behind a campaign to discredit
the African National Congress.
The ANC welcomed Mr de Klerk's announcement, but said 'It has been a very
slow recognition of what is happening.' Gen Bob Rogers, Democratic Party
spokesman on defence commended Mr de Klerk for his prompt action.
The recent upsurge in attacks on whites continued over the weekend when a
14-year-old girl was killed in a grenade attack on a farm near the Lesotho
border.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Poll blow for Taipei rulers: Results herald era of
compromise after corruption backlash
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN dealt a blow to President Lee Teng-hui's ruling Kuomintang party in
parliamentary elections on Saturday, heralding an era of compromise and
accountability for the party which has governed the island virtually
unchallenged for 43 years.
The official KMT candidates, primarily Taiwanese-born liberal supporters of
Mr Lee, took only 53 per cent of the vote, compared with 71 per cent in
elections last year for the National Assembly, a separate body whose sole
tasks are to select the president and amend the constitution.
The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the once-outlawed
organisation many of whose members have been jailed, was a prime beneficiary
of anti-Lee sentiment. It picked up 31 per cent of the vote, compared with
24 per cent in the National Assembly election last year.
But the biggest swing was towards President Lee's conservative opposition
within his own party: the descendants of Chiang Kai-shek's Mainland army who
took control of the island in 1949 and have only recently relinquished their
authoritarian rule.
The largest number of votes went to Mr Wang Chien-shien and Mr Jaw Shao-kan,
two former KMT cabinet ministers who stood without the support of the party
and who campaigned strongly against KMT corruption.
Taiwan's multi-seat constituency system makes it possible for more than one
KMT candidate to stand in any one constituency.
The conservative faction, known as the Non-Mainstream, is seen as less
corrupt, and less biased towards the business community, and they benefited
from the election's focus on 'Money Politics'.
This year's election campaign is believed to have cost a total of TDollars
20bn (Pounds 498m), much of which has gone on illegal vote-buying. More than
200 cases of vote-buying are currently being investigated.
The mainstream KMT members are seen as the main culprits, using the huge
financial resources of the party (which owns banks and television stations),
and its support from the island's big businessmen.
Mr James Soong, KMT secretary general, said: 'Our party is very dissatisfied
with the outcome, but we have to accept the voters' choice.' Yesterday, one
conservative KMT faction called for Mr Soong's resignation.
The pro-Mainland backlash is good news for beleaguered Taiwanese premier Hau
Pei-tsun, a Mainlander who looked set for departure in the event of strong
support for President Lee's Mainstream KMT. Given the backing for Hau's
supporters, it seems likely he will remain as figurehead for a big minority
group.
DPP support was also fervent, showing recognition of its evolution into a
serious opposition party.
The lack of support for President Lee is bound to cause consternation in
Beijing. China has been keeping a close eye on the elections in what it
considers to be a renegade province, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin last
week warned the KMT to oppose any support for the independence movement.
The DPP campaigned on a platform of 'One China, One Taiwan' urging greater
independence. Its 50 seats in the 161-seat legislature will therefore smack
of defiance towards the Mainland rulers.
But President Lee looks likely to retain control of an increasingly divided
legislature. Official KMT candidates retained 96 seats. In addition, the
non-Mainstream may be keen to force compromises but they will want to retain
the advantages of party membership, while the DPP agrees with many of the
economic and political reforms proposed by President Lee.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Ruling party retains hold on Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the government and the opposition in Singapore have claimed victory
after a by-election at the weekend which saw the ruling People's Action
Party retain its overwhelming hold on the island republic's politics.
The PAP won 73 per cent of the vote in the four-seat Marine Parade
constituency. Mr Goh Chok Tong, who took over from Mr Lee Kuan Yew as
Singapore's prime minister in late 1990, was a candidate. He said the vote
represented a 'resounding endorsement' for his government's policies and his
leadership.
The fledgling Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), which had put itself forward
as the main opposition party during the campaign, won 24 per cent of the
vote. The SDP said the result marked the beginning of a two-party political
system in Singapore.
The PAP has long had a monopoly on political power in Singapore and was
shocked when its vote in a general election midway through last year dropped
to 61 per cent, with four opposition members voted into the 81-seat
parliament.
Mr Goh, who has had difficulty escaping from the shadow of Mr Lee's long
years as Singapore's leader, had said that this by-election was a crucial
test of his leader ship.
In the general election last year the PAP won 77 per cent of the vote in
Marine Parade.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Yeltsin saves reform cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday reached agreement with Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister, on the make-up of the cabinet and
agreed the basic current team would be preserved, the president's spokesman
said yesterday.
Mr Yeltsin cut short his official visit to China this weekend to mount
efforts at home to retain the core of his economic reform team.
The president flew to Moscow on Saturday, saying 'the master has to return
home to restore order' because of attempts to scatter the reform team
assembled by Mr Yegor Gaidar. Mr Gaidar, the architect of Russia's market
reforms, was last week dumped as prime minister by Mr Yeltsin following
concerted pressure from conservative deputies in parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr Chernomyrdin has toned down earlier attacks on Mr Gaidar's
policies. Mr Chernomyrdin, who earlier had announced he wanted 'a market not
a bazaar', said at the weekend that he simply wanted reforms to be effective
and was ready to 'correct' his view after consultations with others.
However, there were signs last night that Mr Yeltsin might yet face an
uphill task to ensure that the reform team could work with Mr Chernomyrdin.
On the one hand, some of Mr Gaidar's closest colleagues, like Mr Anatoly
Chubais, the privatisation minister, and Mr Andrei Nechaye, the economics
minister, having threatened to resign if Mr Gaidar went, now say that they
will stay on as long as reform continues.
Others, however, say that they want clarification of Mr Chernomyrdin's
plans. The consensus among Mr Gaidar's colleagues is that, while Mr
Chernomyrdin is a decent individual and competent manager, he knows nothing
about macroeconomics and that, if he listens to the wrong advice, he could
steer the country into hyperinflation.
One cabinet change which could help boost the credibility of reforms could
be the appointment of an energetic new finance minister to try to keep a
grip on credit and monetary policy.
It is understood that Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's executive director at the
World Bank who resigned two years ago as the country's finance minister, was
in Moscow at the weekend to explore job possibilities.

THE Italian government is expected this week to publish full details of its
privatisation programme, after the broad endorsement last week from the two
houses of parliament.
Approval was given by the chamber of deputies on Wednesday and the senate on
Friday to a programme which aims to raise L27,000bn (Pounds 12.8bn) for the
treasury between 1993 and 1995. In addition IRI, the state holding company,
is expected to raise some L12,000bn from its own divestments which will go
to recapitalise and repay debts.
Parliamentary backing came despite powerful lobbying by Christian Democrat
and Socialist politicians on their own coalition to water down the scheme so
that the parties could retain control over a large state-controlled economy.
'This is an important step forward,' a treasury official said.
Italian economic growth will begin to accelerate towards the end of next
year if the government succeeds in bringing the fiscal deficit under control
while keeping the lid on wage inflation, the OECD said yesterday, writes
Edward Balls. The OECD expects Italy's economic growth rate to slip to 0.8
per cent next year. But an export- and investment-led recovery should
deliver a 1.7 per cent growth rate in 1994.

THE Ukrainian government has given the US State Departmentassurances that
parliament will ratify the Start treaty on January 14 or 15 when the
legislature returns from its holiday break, officials said in Kiev over the
weekend.
The treaty, which was agreed by the US and the former Soviet Union, covers
reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus have already ratified the accord. Ukraine,
and the 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles on its territory, is the
last important hurdle to full ratification.
Kiev has made a commitment in principle to becoming a non-nuclear state and
has transferred its tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, where they are to be
dismantled.
The Ukrainian pledge follows intense pressure from Mr Lawrence Eagleburger,
the US secretary of state, who has warned Kiev that unless it ratifies the
treaty soon bilateral relations with the US could be threatened. Mr
Eagleburger said in Washington yesterday that the US was 'getting more than
a little bit perturbed' by the Ukrainian reluctance to live up to its early
promises to get rid of its nuclear weapons.
However, there are signs in Kiev that Mr Eagleburger's tough approach could
be counter-productive and that the Ukrainian government's pledge may not be
honoured.
The parliament has been voting with increasing independence lately,
suggesting that no Ukrainian leader is in a position to guarantee
parliamentary ratification of the treaty on any specific date.

THE Italian government is expected this week to release full details of its
privatisation programme, after the broad endorsement last week from the two
houses of parliament.
Approval was given by the chamber of deputies on Wednesday and the senate on
Friday to a programme which aims to raise L27,000bn (Pounds 12.8bn) for the
treasury between 1993 and 1995. In addition IRI, the state holding company,

Parliamentary backing came despite powerful lobbying by Christian Democrat
and Socialist politicians on their own coalition to water down the scheme so
that the parties could retain control over a large state-controlled economy.
'This is an important step forward,' a treasury official said. However, the
official pointed out that parliament had laid down a number of guidelines
which the government had to take into consideration. Mr Piero Barucci, the
treasury minister, who is master-minding privatisation with Mr Giuliano
Amato, the prime minister, pledged a definite plan for privatisation would
be ready before the end of the year.
The broad privatisation proposals were submitted to parliament a month ago
on a consultative basis. One of the main recommendations is that
privatisation be carried out under the aegis of the prime minister and a
committee of three ministers (treasury, budget and industry) who would also
liaise with a new ministry of production. The latter is an attempt by
parliament to force the government to include an industrial strategy in the
privatisation process and not simply sell off to raise money for the
impoverished treasury.

FT  21 DEC 92 / War of advice may hit Russia: Foreign advisers may have to
fight for an ear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOREIGN economic experts who have played a big role in advising the
Russian government on the reforms of the past year have no idea whether they
will still be advising next year, when the government and the policies of Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new Russian prime minister, will be clear.
For some, including the team of Professor Jeffrey Sachs and Mr David Lipton
from Harvard University, it is already clear that Mr Chernomyrdin is a
threat to the reforms on which they advised.
Mr Lipton says: 'It's clear from what Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has
already said on the need to support industry, and heavy industry in
particular, that he has no regard for the interests of the economic
transformation, no regard for consumers, and no respect for markets.'
However, the Sachs/Lipton team, with its score of assistants scattered
throughout the bureaucracy, will remain in place for now.
So will Mr Richard Layard, the London School of Economics professor who
works closely with Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the Economic Reform Centre.
Prof Layard said that he had no plans to cease work, and Mr Vassiliev, a
close associate of former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, said that 'we'll
carry on as long as we feel it useful to do so'.
Nevertheless, the privatisation programme, which is the biggest reform
programme and employs the bulk of the foreign expertise, is now on hold. Due
to be discussed by Parliament last week, it was taken off the agenda while
the new prime minister read next year's programme to see whether he would
support it.
The state privatisation committee, headed by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy
prime minister, is now developing an ambitious programme of mass
privatisation to begin in January, leaning heavily on foreign assistence.
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank division which worked
on privatisation throughout the year, is waiting to see whether the
programme will get under way. This is also true of the team from Credit
Suisse First Boston, which is charged with bringing the first companies to
market in December. 'It's business as usual for now,' said Mr Stephen
Jennings, a CSFB executive in Moscow.
However, it is clear that the privatisation committee is now working flat
out on next year's programme, much more aware than previously of the limited
window of opportunity open to them to make privatisation irreversible.
The US merchant bank, Goldman Sachs, hired in February by the government to
assist in finding inward investment, is now unsure if its services will
still be required. 'We were able to work essentially because of our link
with Yegor Gaidar,' says Mr Bill Crowley, head of the GS team in Moscow.
'Our main contact point is the Agency for International Co-operation and
Development under (deputy prime minister) Alexander Shokhin, and it's not
clear how that will now work.'
The Ford Foundation, one of the biggest funders of individuals in Moscow
through its Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) annual fund for the former communist
states of eastern Europe, is one of the many private and government
institutions now debating whether to continue funding market-oriented
programmes which may no longer be welcomed.
Others include the British Know-How Fund and US Aid.
Mr Chernomyrdin said during his first press conference that he thought that
the foreign advisers should continue their work 'and Russian ones too'.
He has already put feelers out to Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the economist who
served as former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's adviser in 1989.
At the same time, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has appointed as
his economic adviser none other than Mr Yegor Gaidar.
A war of advice clearly looms.

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government has decided to give a return to growth priority
over combating inflation, in a clear policy shift announced after a two-day
ministerial meeting, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
The meeting, called to settle on an economic policy and end instability,
ruled out the idea of an economic shock plan rumoured since last week's
suspension of the privatisation programme and resignation of the economy
minister.
The ministers agreed a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) government works programme
to stimulate production and employment, and a gradual lowering of interest
rates.
'Under this government the population will not wake up one morning to find
everything has been changed by some arbritary act,' stressed Mr Paulo
Haddad, the planning minister who emerged strengthened from the meeting,
having persuaded President Itamar Franco against a sharp cut in interest
rates. He is also expected to take on the economy portfolio.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Steve Ross of Time Warner: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Steve Ross, who died yesterday at 65 after a a long battle with prostate
cancer, built his father-in-law's funeral home business into the Dollars
12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) US media and entertainment conglomerate Time Warner.
On the way he displayed equal charm and ruthlessness. As recently as
February, already ill, he ensured the replacement of his nominated successor
at Time Warner, Mr Nick Nicholas, by an executive more to his taste.
'Steve', said one rival, 'has this uncanny quality of making you feel sorry
for him even when you think he's screwing you.' He was born as Steven
Rechnitz in 1927, the son of a Brooklyn plumber. Mr Ross spent only two
years at a junior college and began his career selling women's bathing
suits. He then went to work for the funeral business, expanding it in the
1950s into limousine and car rentals, carparks and office cleaning.
In 1969 he bought Warner Brothers-Seven Arts, a loss-making film and record
company, and his first cable television business, an entry into a rapidly
growing industry.
After surviving the rise and fall of the Atari video-game subsidiary in the
1980s, his strategic planning culminated in the merger with Time.
The group was as big as he planned; its success proved harder to ensure. To
head off another bid, Time had to make a Dollars 14bn bid for Warner
Communications, leaving the merged entity encumbered by debt. Mr Ross became
its chairman and co-chief executive, but the synergy he had promised to
generate from its range of media assets - television, film, books, magazines
 -was hard to see in the results.
A perennial subject of criticism was the scale on which Mr Ross and his
close colleagues were rewarded by the company. Forbes magazine calculated
that between 1986 and 1990 Mr Ross alone received Dollars 137m out of
Dollars 923m in salary, bonus and stock gains received by all the top
officers of all big US companies. Still, in the 16 years to 1989 he managed
a 24 per cent compounded annual total return for shareholders, better than
three-quarters of all big US companies.

FT  21 DEC 92 / BA sends lobbyists into a spin: A controversial airline deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITY the ladies who run the public records room at the US Department of
Transportation. For them the decision - expected either today or early this
week - on whether British Airways should be allowed to go ahead with its
controversial Dollars 750m (Pounds 493.4m) investment in Arlington-based
USAir cannot come a moment too soon.
Since Mr Andrew Card, the US transport secretary, bowed to pressure from the
'big three' US carriers opposing the deal and agreed to create a public file
on the subject, letters and submissions have flooded in. The result
illustrates the intensity with which the lobbying game is played in the US.
Canvassers have pitched their efforts at the highest level. At the latest
count USAir has secured support from 22 senators and more than 100
representatives - an eclectic group ranging on the Democrat side from
Barbara Mikulski to elder statesmen like Howard Metzenbaum, and such
prominent Republicans as Arlen Specter and John Danforth.
Not to be outdone, American Airlines - one of the deal's most vociferous
opponents - claims to have 23 senators on board, along with President-elect
Bill Clinton and another 95 congressmen.
This is just the beginning. A trawl by the carriers of their respective
regional bases has yielded a mountain of mail from chambers of commerce,
municipal and state organisations, and governors' offices.
The weary souls at the DoT have not even bothered to file the mountain of
public correspondence on the subject. 'You want to look at the letters?'
asks an incredulous assistant, pointing to the nether reaches of the
docket-room, where a dozen bulging boxes are stacked.
All this, of course, is an impressive adjunct to the formal filings and
responses from various interested parties, invariably employing law firms
and using any number of inventive arguments to support their cases.
BA's propaganda effort in the US has seemed restrained, even tranquil, by
comparison.
It had little choice. The carrier was frightened of giving the impression it
was a senior partner telling USAir what to do. That could have opened it to
more charges of wanting to run USAir, rather than merely finding a team
mate.
Behind the scenes things were busy nevertheless. Even before the
announcement of the deal in July, negotiators from both companies discussed
how the propaganda war would be waged. After the announcement there was a
rapid frontal assault on government and its officials in London. Top board
directors, including chief executive Sir Colin Marshall, regularly briefed
both the UK Department of Transport and the prime minister's office.
Staff were drafted in from corporate affairs, government strategy, public
relations, public affairs and investor relations. With BA board members, and
through their USAir opposite numbers, they lobbied congressmen and
shareholders. A lobbyist was hired in Washington and public relations giant
Daniel J. Edelman was engaged.
Today the British airline complains it was outgunned in Washington. 'They
(American, United and Delta) swamped the market completely. They bought up
almost every lobbyist around.' Still, this did not deter BA and USAir
executives from touring the country to talk to editorial boards of
newspapers.
Their targets were the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today and the
Wall Street Journal as well as newspapers in Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta,
the home cities of United, American and Delta airlines.
'The majority were sympathetic,' said one senior BA adviser. 'But you don't
win them all.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUTS IN German interest rates would be the most effective single measure to
revive the flagging German economy, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said
in an interview published yesterday.
At the same time he said there must be 'no taboo' in considering cuts in
public sector spending in any area, including social spending, in a package
of measures to be finalised in January. The package is supposed to be part
of a 'solidarity pact' between the central government, opposition, trade
unions, employers and local government.
While he ruled out any increase in taxation before 1995 as 'totally wrong'
in the present economic situation, Mr Waigel said the abolition of a range
of tax allowances was under consideration.
The government is considering three lists of savings measures to reduce the
public sector deficit and enable more cash to be found to help revive the
collapsed economy in east Germany, according to weekend reports.
They include central government cuts, state government cuts and reduction in
tax allowances.
In an interview with Welt am Sonntag, Mr Waigel admitted there might be zero
growth in the German economy for 1993, although he was confident there would
be a recovery in the second half, thanks largely to a recovery in the US,
and other German export markets.
He stopped short, however, of calling on the German Bundesbank directly to
cut its base interest rates to stimulate the economy.
He merely repeated that rigorous public sector spending control and wage
restraint in the current round of pay negotiations were essential to give
the central bank 'room for manoeuvre' to cut its rates in the new year.
The finance minister promised to have his package of savings measures,
involving the 16 federal Lander and local authorities, as well as the
central government, ready for publication in January at the latest.
Selective leaks of measures in the savings lists have caused a storm of
political criticism over the weekend, with the opposition Social Democrats
charging the government with seeking to finance unification at the expense
of the poorest members of the German population.
Cuts cited include a reduction in unemployment benefit, child allowances and
maternity benefits, and a freeze on student grants, right down to details
such as a cut in the temperature of municipal swimming pools, or an increase
in entry prices for museums and art galleries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of people in the rump Yugoslavia yesterday cast ballots in crucial
presidential and parliamentary elections, in a vote overshadowed by charges
of foul play and media manipulation by Serbia's ruling Socialists.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is widely held responsible for the
war in neighbouring Bosnia, was fending off a challenge in his bid for
re-election from Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, who has
cam-paigned on pledges of peace.
The Belgrade-born California pharmaceuticals magnate yesterday said, 'This
is the beginning of democracy in Yugoslavia. People want changes and I will
bring them.'
An exit poll of 1,370 voters predicted a tie, with both candidates taking 47
per cent of the vote. Mr Miroslav Sutic of the Partner polling agency said
young people who tended to vote later could tilt the final result in Mr
Panic's favour.
But complaints of election fraud flooded hot-lines set up by opposition
parties in Belgrade just after the polls opened at 7am.
'There have been a large number of reports of irregularities. A big
percentage of people say they are not listed in the voter registry,' said Mr
Jack Zetkulic, head of the observer mission of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe.
DEPOS, the main opposition coalition, and the Democratic Party, another
opposition group, said hundreds of people had called in to complain they had
not been allowed to vote.
Mr Milosevic's campaign, marked by its xenophobia and defiant tone, has its
strongest support in working-class and rural areas of Serbia. In the
industrial suburb of Kaludjerica, Mr Dragan Misovic, a student who voted for
the opposition, said: 'The workers will vote because they get paid for doing
nothing. The factories are all closed but they draw salaries.'
Belgrade turn-out was high despite freezing temperatures and a dense fog.
Most voters appeared to back Mr Panic and opposition candidates.
Foreign observers were highly critical of the campaign. 'It was an unfair
campaign. The media propaganda has been shameless, probably the worst we've
ever seen in the region,' said Mr Zetkulic, who added that about 90 foreign
observers had been despatched to monitor local, republican and federal races
in Serbia and Montenegro, the sole members of the reconstituted but
unrecognised Yugoslav federation.
Early results were expected today. If neither candidate gains a 50 per cent
majority a run-off has been tentatively set for January 3.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S centre-right UDF party is to table plans early next year to grant
independence to the French central bank, the strongest indication yet of the
French opposition's commitment to the defence of the embattled franc.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president and leader of the UDF,
the smaller of the two opposition parties, told Les Echos newspaper that he
had asked his party to table a proposed law in the national assembly early
in the year, to be ready for debate straight after the March parliamentary
election.
This would give the Banque de France similar status to the German
Bundesbank, a factor in the D-Mark's strength.
It could be one of the first pieces of legislation by the right-wing
alliance of the UDF and Gaullist RPR, which is expected to win the election
by a wide margin, according to opinion polls.
It would put France well in advance of the Maastricht treaty's timetable,
which - if applied - would make central banks independent some time after
January 1994 and before 1999.
Analysts welcomed the move and said it called into question the theory held
by some traders that the opposition would devalue or float the franc on
winning the election, to pave the way for a drop in interest rates to
relaunch the sluggish economy.
'The clear commitment to a strong currency and central bank independence
from a key opposition figure is extremely important,' said Paribas Capital
Markets.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC will today consider plans to strengthen its arsenal of trade weapons,
including anti-dumping measures and quotas, in preparation for the official
launch of the single market in the new year.
The plans have drawn fierce protests from European toy, textile and footwear
importers, who fear a crackdown against cheap imports from China, Vietnam
and North Korea.
The plans - which some Brussels lawyers describe as the most far-reaching
trade policy revisions since the anti-dumping rule was adopted in 1968 - are
to be discussed at a meeting of EC foreign and trade ministers in Brussels
today.
According to the European Commission, the proposals are needed to streamline
trade rules and 'harmonise' quotas on non-EC goods among member states in
time for January 1 1993, when the single market comes into force. They
include several far-reaching measures.
The Commission wants to reverse policy by requiring that duties be
overturned by a qualified majority. At present, free-traders such as Britain
and Germany need only muster a blocking minority.
The introduction of 'Community quotas' in some sensitive sectors such as
footwear to replace quotas imposed on non-EC states. A Commission proposal
to allow the lower Court of First Instance to deal with trade complaints,
following a plea from an overworked European Court of Justice. Brussels
argues the shift could add to time taken before imposing defensive trade
measures.
So far, member states have divided along familiar lines, with the UK and
Germany set against southern members such as Spain and Italy, which are
worried that the single market could undermine EC trade policy.
Mr Peter Bahr, a Brussels-based spokesman for European footwear importers
and retailers, said the measures would cut low-priced footwear from China
and other target countries by 50 per cent at the expense of the consumer. It
would also leave the Commission in the driving seat on trade policy.
Today's meeting will also discuss a possible compromise over EC plans to
provide up to Ecu500m (Pounds 404.5m) funding for promoting high-definition
television to the European public.

soon be shaped by a leader the UK premier does not know

<TEXT>
IT HAS not been Mr John Major's happiest foreign trip. His farewell to
outgoing President George Bush on a rain-swept White House lawn yesterday
marked the end of more than a decade of reassurance for Britain's
Conservative leaders.
The visiting prime minister could claim one or two modest achievements. Mr
Bush agreed that the US and Europe should set a January 15 deadline for
completion of the stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks in Geneva.
The president also softened the rhetoric of US policy on the military
enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The US, he said, was as
concerned about possible retaliation against British ground troops as it
would be if US forces were at risk.
A new UN resolution to enforce Serbian compliance with the zone will be
passed, probably this week, but the implication is that US fighters will not
immediately be given a free hand to shoot down Serbian aircraft. The
compromise marked as much Mr Major probably could hope for.
Reports that his American trip - which included an EC-Canada summit in
Ottawa late last week - has left Mr Major exhausted and unsettled should not
be taken too seriously. The prime minister is tired after a difficult three
months, but no more than that.
But a friendly weekend in Camp David with Mr Bush could not let Mr Major
escape the reality that from now on American policy will be shaped by a
leader of whom he knows little.
Politicians and diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic insist that what
remains of the special relationship will survive under President Bill
Clinton. But for Mr Major it will not be the same.
For 12 years the occupant of 10 Downing Street could rely on a kindred
ideological spirit in the White House. Now he must deal with a president
whose election symbolised a break with the right-wing certainties of the
1980s.
The prime minister did not have a chance to meet Mr Clinton. It was not a
deliberate snub. The president-elect, still based in Little Rock, is
pre-occupied with shaping his cabinet. Instead the two men settled for a
25-minute telephone call on Friday before Mr Major left for Camp David.
Yesterday, Vice-president elect Al Gore and a number of other high-ranking
Democrats joined Mr Major for lunch at the British embassy. Downing Street
went to great pains to ensure the cameras were on hand. Mr Clinton will meet
the prime minister in early February after his inauguration next month.
Senior officials travelling with Mr Major emphasised that Mr Clinton had
been at pains to emphasise continuity in US foreign policy.
He had been sympathetic to Mr Major's grave doubts about the risks to
British forces of military enforcement of the no-fly zone. He had offered
his backing to the EC agreement with Mr Bush to give new impetus to the Gatt
trade talks in Geneva.
On the basis of his telephone conversation and of extensive briefing by
British diplomats in Washington, Mr Major was said to be 'optimistic' about
the relationship. Aides pointed out that the two men are in the same
generation of post-cold war politicians.
More discreetly they added that Mr Major's centre-left position in the
Conservative party leaves him not that far distant in the political spectrum
from the Clinton brand of Democrat.
But there are obvious uncertainties. The most senior members of the British
entourage pointed out that Mr Clinton's policy statements had so far been
deliberately circumspect. The prime minister was pleased with what Mr
Clinton had said publicly and privately but was uneasy also about what he
had not said.
Mr Major will miss the personal rapport that comes with a shared ideology.
Mr Clinton is no left-winger, but his rhetoric is not that of a natural
believer in unfettered markets. He will have to be persuaded that
maintaining a unique link with Britain should rank anywhere near the top of
a list of priorities which is already crammed with domestic issues.
It was perhaps a sign of the times that before the two leaders returned to
Washington the most important US newspapers did not carry a word yesterday
of Mr Major's Camp David sojourn with Mr Bush.

FT  21 DEC 92 / The European Market: Schengen old guard faces change with
trepidation - Open borders threaten Luxembourg village's way of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE border post on the bridge over the Moselle river at Schengen is locked,
but is not yet empty.
Inside, Mr Rene Zimmer, the Luxembourg village's last customs and
immigration chief, is poring over the new European Community VAT
regulations.
These are the rules which in a few days should open the frontier and close
the border post for good, sending Mr Zimmer, 57, to a well-earned
pre-retirement posting in Esch-sur-Alzette, further west.
Mr Zimmer is pleased. He has spent 17 of the last 25 years manning the
frontier with Germany and France, but he is not a Schengen man.
Esch-sur-Alzette is closer to his home.
In the Cafe International, however, opposite the bridge, proprietor Ernest
Schemel, 73, his son Guy and a handful of Schengen's 350 locals believe the
single market will bring trouble. They see more crime, more bureaucracy,
more uncertainty and, at worst, redundancy for those villagers who for years
have made their living from the frontier.
That Schengen, squeezed into the south-eastern corner of Luxembourg, should
fear the lifting of border controls is ironic.
It was at Schengen - or, more accurately, in a boat moored beneath the
bridge - that France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the Schengen
agreement in June 1990 which was supposed to herald the barrier-free
Community.
The five countries, now swollen to nine, committed themselves to moving
ahead of the rest of the EC by lifting controls on people by January 1 1993.
Only Britain, Denmark and Ireland have not signed.
The agreement has already taken effect in Schengen itself. Regular frontier
controls on the Luxembourg side of the Moselle disappeared earlier this
year. In Germany and France a handful of uniformed officials are still
carrying out desultory checks.
Villagers are not nostalgic about the old days of border controls. They are
hard-headed enough to realise that change is inevitable.
But the concerns of those who benefit from Schengen's privileged border
status are easy to understand. At weekends it is difficult to cross the main
street for queues of German and French cars. The visitors do not come to
Schengen principally for its pretty chateau and church, or even for its
vineyards, sweeping down to the river from the steep hills above the
village. They come for its half dozen petrol stations, all of them
exploiting the excise loophole which means that fuel is LFr10 (19 pence) a
litre cheaper here.
Alcohol and cigarettes are also a better buy in Luxembourg.
As it turns out Schengen has little to fear from the immediate impact of
single-market tax harmonisation. Under the indirect tax deal done with its
EC partners, the Grand Duchy will guard most of its excise advantages at
least until 1995.
Mr Ernest Legill, the village's echevin, or local councillor, and a
wine-grower like most inhabitants, is generally optimistic about what will
happen after January 1.
But like many older villagers he cannot disguise a visceral unease about the
lifting of borders. He remembers the second world war, when the Schengen
bridge was one of the first to be destroyed as the Germans advanced west.
Similar concerns are voiced less diplomatically in the Cafe International
over glasses of the local white wine.
A local haulier, preferring to remain anonymous, points out that now there
are fewer customs and immigrations officials on the bridge, the number of
burglaries in the village has increased.
Mr Schemel and his family also fear the loss of their livelihood. Since 1959
they have worked as customs agents - employed by exporters and importers to
deal with tax forms at borders. Those forms should disappear on December 31,
replaced by an electronic system. But Schengen is where the smooth-running
computerised dream of a thousand EC tax officials breaks down.
Local pessimism reflects wider gloom about the goal of open frontiers.
Growing evidence suggests that companies across the EC are not ready for the
complex new VAT system. Even the ideals of the Schengen accord have soured
in the last few months.
Ministers from the nine countries met in Madrid this week and agreed on a
common visa for the free-travel area. But their January deadline for
completely open borders has slipped at least until the middle of the year.
Passport checks are likely to remain in place well beyond that date in the
UK, Denmark and Ireland.
Such sluggishness will not prevent Mr Zimmer clearing his office on December
31 and leaving the Schengen border crossing unmanned for probably the first
time since the Grand Duchy came into being in 1839.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Brazil announces push for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government has decided to give a return to growth priority
over combating inflation, in a clear policy shift announced after a two-day
ministerial meeting.
The meeting, called to settle on an economic policy and end instability,
firmly ruled out the idea of an economic shock plan widely rumoured since
last week's suspension of the privatisation programme and resignation of the
economy minister.
The ministers agreed a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) government works programme
to stimulate production and employment, and a gradual lowering of interest
rates.
'Under this government the population will not wake up one morning to find
everything has been changed by some arbritary act,' stressed Mr Paulo
Haddad, the planning minister. 'There will be no economic shocks or measures
such as incomes and prices policy, price freezes, dollarisation or
confiscation of savings.'
Mr Haddad emerged strengthened from the meeting, having persuaded President
Itamar Franco against a sharp cut in interest rates. He is also expected to
take on the economy portfolio.
The discussions contrasted starkly with those of the previous administration
of President Fernando Collor which concentrated on privatisation and lifting
trade barriers. Instead the Franco government is focusing on state
intervention to build up the internal market and alleviate social problems.
As a first step the government will invest Cr44,200bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in road
and house building projects next year with the aim of creating 1m jobs. It
was not clear where the money would come from, as the budget deficit for
next year is already more than Dollars 13bn.
The government is also introducing differentiated public sector tariffs,
keeping down prices for low users of gas, electricity, postage and
telephones.

The French franc remained at the bottom of the European exchange rate

selling last week was countered by intervention from the French central bank
which, by the end of the week, appeared to have headed off the threat of
devaluation. However, most economists are convinced that speculators will
return in the new year to test the government's commitment to the currency.
Meanwhile the Irish punt and the Danish krone remained under pressure,
though the krone received support from the Belgian and Dutch central banks.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Britain backs enforced no-fly zone: Bush and Major seek UN
resolution to step up military involvement in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Britain last night agreed to increase the international pressure
on Serbia with a jointly sponsored United Nations resolution to allow
military enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia and a package of new
sanctions against Belgrade.
But in a compromise between the hardline position of the US and the much
more cautious British stance, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
outgoing president George Bush acknowledged that there would be a warning
period before Serbian aircraft violating the zone would be shot down.
After weekend talks with Mr Major at Camp David, Mr Bush returned to
Washington emphasising that the US shared Mr Major's concern not to put at
risk UK and other ground forces serving with the UN humanitarian operation
in Bosnia.
'We must be careful that we do not needlessly put young men and women there
in harm's way,' Mr Bush said.
In a statement issued by the two leaders, they said the aim of the
resolution 'would be to prevent flights taking place other than those
specifically authorised by the United Nations.'
The statement acknowledged that 'many more lives will be lost this winter'
if the humanitarian effort were halted. They also agreed that the UN
presence in Macedonia and Kosovo should be stepped up to prevent the spread
of fighting in the regions. New sanctions against Serbia could include
initially the severing of postal and communications links and might also
lead to 'closing the borders and complete diplomatic isolation for some
years to come'.
Senior US and UK officials said that they expected the UN resolution
providing for military enforcement should be agreed within a few days,
probably before Christmas. Mr Bush, who spoke yesterday morning to Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, said he was confident that Moscow would not
block it.
The two leaders said the length of the warning period before Serbian
aircraft would risk being shot down would be decided at the UN. Defence
secretary Dick Cheney said on television that a 15-day warning could be
given, while stressing it was not his decision to make. Reports that this
had been agreed were dismissed as without 'credibility' by Mr Major. One
British suggestion was that it might run until the inauguration of
President-elect Bill Clinton on January 20.
Mr Major's reluctance to see any escalation in the military conflict in
Bosnia was reflected in the refusal of his officials to discuss the terms
under which the no-fly zone would operate. Last week Mr Major said that
aircraft violating it might be forced to remain on the ground rather than be
shot down.
He said: 'We've got a lot of discussing to do before we determine how the
deadline is going to be enforced. We agreed that it is necessary to enforce
the no-fly zone. There is more than one way of doing that.'
But Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, suggested that the
US favoured still more decisive action. He indicated that the warning period
would allow western ground forces to prepare for possible Serbian
retaliation. The US has also drawn up contingency plans to bomb Serbian
airports.
Mr Major said that the 'paramount importance' of retaining the security of
ground forces and aid workers should underpin the UN resolution. He hopes
that the deterrent effect will keep Serbian aircraft grounded.
The joint statement warned of the danger of fighting spreading to other
former Yugoslav republics. The US and UK hoped the UN presence in Macedonia
would be stepped up. They agreed to 'press for a very early increase in the
number of observers in Kosovo'.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Higher taxes before end of 1994 predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and KEITH FRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING crisis in public sector finances will force the government to
raise taxes before the end of 1994, according to the latest Financial Times
survey of economic forecasts.
The most comprehensive survey of forecasts for the UK economy over the next
two years shows that more than half of City, academic and independent
economists believe the government will have to increase taxes to claw back
some of the revenue lost as a result of the recession.
Although the consensus forecast for this year's public sector borrowing
requirement is in line with the Treasury's expectation of Pounds 37bn,
economists see government borrowing spiralling to-wards Pounds 50bn in
1993-94, or about 8 per cent of gross domestic product.
'In order to bring the PSBR down to 3 per cent of GDP over the medium term,
it would re-quire annual increases in taxation - excluding any changes to
expenditure - of anything up to Pounds 10bn a year,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank.
Few predict that the government will raise direct taxes. Increases in
indirect taxes are more likely, and a number of economists expect the scope
of value added tax to be widened and excise duties raised. Abolition of the
upper earnings limit on national insurance contributions is also possible.
The outlook for inflation is more pessimistic than official forecasts
suggest. More than half of the 38 economists questioned expect the retail
prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments, to pass the upper limit
of the chancellor's 1-4 per cent target range in the next two years.
Forecasts for average inflation next year range from as little as 2.3 per
cent to 6.2 per cent, although a number of economists forecasting a rise in
inflation next year expect it to drop back again in 1994, once the
devaluation of sterling has made its impact on the index. The average
forecast for 1994 is 4.4 per cent.
Expectations for growth among economists are broadly in line with the
Treasury's latest forecast of 1 per cent next year. The following year,
economists see GDP growth rising to 2.4 per cent, but this will not be
enough to make a significant dent in the unemployment total. This is
forecast to stay at just over 3m both next year and in 1994, with only four
economists expecting the peak before the end of 1993.
Few foresee an early re-entry to the European exchange rate mechanism, if at
all.
'Assuming that economic sanity reigns - a bold assumption given the events
of recent months - the UK will not rejoin the ERM in the forseeable future,'
said Mr Paul Neild at County NatWest.
'Britain will only rejoin when German monetary policy is appropriate for the
UK. With the UK and German cycles out of phase, re-entry is unlikely within
the life of this parliament,' said Mr Keith Wade, chief economist at
Schroders.
Those who do expect re-entry, believe it will happen in 1994 at a rate
between DM2.40 and DM2.60.
An emergency government programme in the new year to create jobs was urged
yesterday by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. He argues that the
widespread fear of unemployment is a significant factor in delaying the
recovery.

FT  21 DEC 92 / BA hopes of USAir deal fade after Camp David talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR failed at the weekend to break the deadlock with Washington
over British Airways' bid for a 44 per cent stake in USAir, reinforcing
expectations that the offer will fail later this week.
After talks at Camp David between Mr Major and Mr George Bush, the outgoing
US president, British officials said they were pessimistic that the US
administration would approve the bid before its expiry date on Christmas
Eve.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, will have a final round of talks
this week with Mr Andrew Card, US transportation secretary. But officials
said that the talks were likely to be a 'formality'.
President Bush told Mr Major that the US would not drop its demand for
greater access for US airlines to Heathrow airport before clearing the
Dollars 750m (Pounds 493m) British Airways deal.
The three largest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta
Airlines - want a complete 'open skies' policy as their price for the deal
to go through. Britain is offering improved access to regional airports.
Speaking after the Camp David meeting the British official said that the
'two sides are too far apart' to hold out expectations of a last-minute
compromise.
The BA bid for a stake in USAir is designed to further its ambitions to
become a global carrier through the acquisition of stakes in other
international airlines. Last week it secured a 25 per cent interest in
Qantas, the Australian national carrier.
But the official said that despite its disappointment if the bid failed, BA
would probably judge it would lose more than it gained if Mr Major acceded
to the US demand.
Under US regulations, foreign airlines are restricted to 25 per cent of the
voting rights in a US carrier although they can acquire up to 49 per cent of
the shares.
The proposed BA deal with USAir deal is designed to comply with those rules.
BA seeks 44 per cent of USAir shares and 21 per cent of the airline's voting
rights. However, rival US airlines have argued that small print in the
agreement would give effective control of USAir to BA.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines and the most vocal critic
of the proposed deal, claimed that the big three US carriers would between
them lose Dollars 500m a year in revenues if the BA acquisition went ahead
without a balanced UK-US liberalisation agreement.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Private sector pay deals 'fall to 3.1%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE sector pay settlements are falling sharply again after a period of
stability and could soon drop below 3 per cent.
Between September and November they averaged 3.1 per cent and since August
one manufacturing group in three has introduced a pay freeze, the
Confederation of British Industry's manufacturing pay databank estimates.
The latest settlement rate compares with a 4.2 per cent average in the
quarter ending in September, and 4.4 per cent in the last quarter of 1991.
Employers welcomed the figures, which were released yesterday as part of a
new monthly series for CBI members. The figures will also please the
government, which wants pay in the private sector to fall as close as
possible to the 1.5 per cent public sector limit.
Pay awards in the service sector also fell sharply, according to the CBI,
from 4.5 per cent in the three months ending in August to 3.7 per cent in
the three months ending in November.
The data suggest that the national average earnings figure, which remained
5.5 per cent in October, will start falling again. Official average earnings
figures are usually higher than current settlements, especially when
inflation is falling, because they include overtime and bonuses and rises
from up to 12 months ago.
Manufacturing productivity increased by 2.7 per cent in the third quarter
giving an increase in manufacturing unit labour costs for that period of
about 1 per cent, according to the CBI. This is well below current unit
labour cost rises in Germany and Japan.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, welcomed the figures. 'If
these positive trends can be consolidated across the economy we will be well
positioned to compete effectively in world markets when recovery comes,' he
said.
The CBI notes that 70 per cent of survey respondents expect their next
settlement to be lower than the last. But it warns that UK earnings growth
has been well above the US and Japan.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Siberian copper race loses appeal: Six companies drop
tenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RACE to develop Russia's biggest copper deposit has been reduced to just
two contenders after six large western companies dropped out of an
international tender for lack of time to complete proposals by a deadline
which expired last Tuesday.
The only two companies now formally in the race are Australia's BHP and the
Udokan Mining Company (UMC), considered the only 'Russian' participant
although it is indirectly half-owned by two little-known foreign companies.
Its lack of experience of a big mining project is being compensated for by
advice from Fluor Daniel, the San Francisco-based consultancy which puts
together international mining projects and has already submitted a detailed
feasibility study for the project.
In a sign of budding Russian co-operation with China, the UMC has also
arranged to sell the copper to the Chinese, who are just across the border
from the deposit in the eastern Siberian region of Chita. UMC's confidence
that it will get the contract also rests on a definite shift by the
authorities towards helping heavy industry find profitable new civilian
markets after decades of catering to the military establishment.
Mr Boris Yatskevich, deputy chairman of Russia's state geology committee,
who declined to confirm or deny which companies were taking part, said the
tender committee would produce its conclusions by January 15, leaving the
final decision to be taken by the Russian president and government. 'Eight
companies have expressed an interest in the project. Proposals have reached
the tender committee.'
But other sources confirmed that RTZ, Phelps Dodge, Placer Dome, Cyprus
Mining, Mitsubishi and Marubeni, despite being registered as tender
participants, had dropped out of the hugely complex project which requires
building not just a mine but lots of infrastructure to operate it. An
executive for one of the companies cited a lack of time to prepare properly
since the tender was declared this summer, and said that another
complicating factor was the metallurgical specificities of the ore.

ENTINA should settle down to sustained, investment-led growth with

minister Domingo Cavallo said at the weekend, John Barham reports from

Mr Cavallo told the Financial Times: 'In 1993 we expect economic growth to
continue at a rate of 6-7 per cent, driven by supply-side improvements
through investments and productivity gains.'
He said growth of 8.5 per cent in 1991 and 9 per cent this year was led by a
consumer spending spree that was now giving way to more sustainable
expansion.
He forecast a marked 40 per cent increase in investment that should bring
the investment rate to 21-22 per cent of GDP, 'more than enough to justify
his growth targets'.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Survey of Japanese Industrial Review (11): Re-think on
robots - Factory automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consider the following coincidence: the two Japanese car companies boasting
the newest, most-highly-automated assembly plants in Japan are also facing
the most severe financial difficulties.
Nissan Motor is losing money this year and Mazda Motor will be lucky to
break even. Earlier this year both opened sparkling clean,
highly-sophisticated car assembly plants - Nissan in Kyushu and Mazda in
Hofu - that are packed full of the very latest computer-controlled equipment
for stamping out metal sheets and assembling cars.
Both companies are having trouble in part because they are now paying for
the new facilities by taking a depreciation charge on the profit and loss
account, at a time when car sales are slumping. Yet, more fundamentally,
questions are now being asked about whether the companies may have
over-automated and thereby unnecessarily jacked up the cost of producing a
car.
It is an open question and when car markets eventually recover the
production engineers from both companies may be fully vindicated. Even so,
it is plain that Japan's biggest and most profitable car company, Toyota,
has adopted a considerably more conservative attitude to factory automation.
Japan's car makers have over the years focused more and more on automation
both because of the rising cost of labour, and because of Japan's long-term
structural shortage of labour. This has been eased only temporarily by the
recession.
Yet Toyota, by some measures, may actually be moving backwards in production
engineering at its newest plant in Kyushu, which is scheduled to open early
next year.
'My basic policy is to make it simple,' says Mr Mikio Kitano, a Toyota
director until recently in charge of production engineering. 'The more you
make it simple, the more you need a lot of knowledge.'
Take, for example, the auto-guided vehicles (AGVs) originally designed by
Honda Motor and installed by Nissan and Mazda in their new plants.
The vehicles replace the traditional line in final assembly. In the
traditional line, vehicle chassis ride on platforms linked together by a
chain, so that all cars in a line move at the same speed and stop and start
together. By contrast, the AGVs allow cars under assembly to move at
different speeds, to go up and down so workers do not have to bend, and to
stop precisely to allow robot installation of everything from seats to
windscreens.
Yet they also raise the cost of installing the line by two to three times
without directly contributing to any increase in productivity. Higher
productivity only comes after spending more money on robots to replace line
workers.
Toyota experimented with AGVs at its Tahara plant which opened last year.
But it has decided against using the apparently more sophisticated
technology in its Kyushu plant and has gone back to the traditional
chain-linked line.
Honda was one of the first companies to achieve fully-automated mating of
the car body and chassis by robot, allowing for simultaneous, precise
bolting together of the car.
The higher precision led to improved ride and handling, yet exact
positioning of the car on an AGV was a key part of this critical assembly
process.
In the traditional line, workers put the car together one bolt at a time as
the vehicle moved slowly down the line, inevitably introducing small
positioning errors. Toyota has, however, decided to use fully-automated
mating while retaining the chain-linked line.
It does this by using two sets of lines, one for the body and one for the
chassis, moving in parallel at precisely the same speed, so that stopping
precisely is not an issue because these two key parts of the car are
attached to each other.
The benefit? A saving in capital cost of about 75 per cent. The machinery
for body-chassis mating in Tahara cost about Y1.5bn; in Kyushu Toyota is
spending only Y400m.
Mr Kitano has a straight-forward philosophy. He says: 'The real intention is
how to make work easy for people. We have not been successful replacing
people with machines.'
Mr Kitano believes that people, who are much more flexible than machines,
are the key to success in the final assembly process. Toyota, unlike some
other makers, is not trying to get rid of people on the final assembly line.
Rather, true to his word, Mr Kitano has focused on how to make final
assembly easier and more satisfying. And Mr Kitano is not overly worried
about the impact of the labour shortage.
He says: 'If we do not make the work easy, we will lose people. If we make
work more comfortable for people, people will stay at the plant.'
He scoffs, for example, at the complex and costly robots installed by
companies such as Mazda and Nissan to attach seats or windscreens without
human intervention. In part, Mr Kitano worries that such complex machinery
is unlikely to save labour because the machines must be maintained and
accuracy checked. Instead, he favours simpler, cheaper machines to help
workers install these parts of the car with a minimum of physical effort.
His engineers have, for example, designed a seat for line workers that
carries them in and out of car bodies to attach dashboard equipment.
He is also sceptical about some radical reorganisations of the production
line. Mazda, for example, has shortened the line by moving assembly of
modules, such as complete dashboards or nose pieces, elsewhere in the plant.
Final assembly-line workers then have only large pieces to install.
Mr Kitano warns, however, that the gains are elusive because: 'This only
transfers the burden to other places (than the final assembly line).'
Mr Kitano has supported one important change on the final line in Kyushu in
an effort to improve worker satisfaction. In the traditional line, bits and
pieces are attached all over the car, one-by-one as it moves along - a bolt
here, a knob there. In Kyushu, Toyota has divided the line into six distinct
sub-sections where a team of workers is responsible for putting together,
for example, a complete dashboard. Mr Kitano hopes this will give workers
more satisfaction, a feeling they are actually creating something.
The final test of Mr Kitano's ideas will not come until the Kyushu plant is
up and running for a considerable period. Given Toyota's enviable record of
innovative engineering, and its profitability, the odds must be that he is
onto something.

SME, the Italian state-owned foods, catering and retailing group which is
high on the government's privatisation list, has sold control of its Adams
sweets and candies subsidiary to Parke-Davis of the US.
Parke-Davis is paying just L660m (Dollars 434,783) for the 51 per cent of
Adams it does not own. However, it will take over Adams's debts of about
L22bn and losses this year estimated to be about L11bn.
Adams, which expects sales of L45bn this year, is the third of the four
joint ventures set up by SME in recent years to have been sold to the
minority partner as part of the group's strategy to divest non-core food
production activities.
Barilla, Italy's biggest privately-owned foods group, which is a market
leader in pasta, biscuits and cakes, expects group sales to rise by about 20
per cent this year to L3,350bn. Part of the increase stems from the
consolidation of Pavesi, in which Barilla holds 59 per cent of the shares
having bought a further 10 per cent from SME earlier this year.
Carrefour and the German retail group Metro Vermoegensverwaltung will create
a joint venture in Italy, said the French hypermarket's newly nominated
chief executive Mr Daniel Bernand, Reuter reports from Paris.
Carrefour will hold 60 per cent of the capital of the venture and Metro 40
per cent.

UNION CARBIDE, the Connecticut-based chemicals group, said it had sold about
Dollars 150m of non-strategic assets this year as part of its goal of
disposing of Dollars 500m worth of assets by the end of 1993.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman of Union Carbide, said the 1992 asset sales
included the company's investment in Exel Limited, a casualty insurance
company; and Carbide's interests in Kemet Electronics and in a Canadian
financial
trust.
Mr Kennedy said that talks were still under way with prospective buyers of
Carbide's Organo Silicon business, a division that makes fluids and
chemicals used in fibreglass, reinforced plastics, textiles, coatings,
automotive adhesives and other specialty markets.
The Union Carbide chairman, in a year-end letter to employees, called 1992
one of the toughest in memory.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Insurers hopeful on deal for terror cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE insurance industry is expecting a government decision this week on the
controversial issue of insuring property against terrorist attack.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has come under
pressure to intervene since the Association of British Insurers recommended
last month that its members should withdraw terrorism cover from commercial
insurance policies, after the withdrawal from the market of some large
reinsurers.
The ABI believes that the government should meet part of the bill for
mainland terrorist damage in future.
The deadline to the discussions between the Department of Trade and Industry
and the ABI, which arises from the expiry of many companies' existing
insurance policies at the end of this month, has given an element of
brinkmanship to the final negotiations.
The solution favoured by some Tory MPs would involve the government in
taking on the position of 'insurer of last resort' - insurers would charge a
levy on premiums to go towards a special fund for terrorism damage, and the
government would pay for any liabilities beyond that figure.
The ABI - which said yesterday it hoped Mr Heseltine would make an
announcement before Christmas - seems likely to accept that offer, and is
now less optimistic that the government will take responsibility for the
cost of all terrorism damage, as it currently does in Northern Ireland.

   THE car park at Lakeside
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the 2m sq ft retail complex some 20 miles along the Thames east of London -
was bursting at the seams yesterday. But it would still have been possible
to take a comfortable nap in some stores. People were shopping, but with
caution rather than fierce passion.
Yesterday, no one was struggling out of the stores, bent double under a mass
of plastic bags.
Apart from a few key areas, particularly toy, game and electrical goods
shops, there was a sense almost of tranquillity. No elbowing and shoving to
get at the counters; no trouble finding sales staff; no difficulty finding
'sale' signs.
'We tend to peak at the beginning of December,' said Ms Heather Davis,
Lakeside's marketing manager. November was a good month, with turnover for
the whole complex - 280 shops - up 20 per cent on November 1991, Ms Davis
said, although she declined to give cash figures.
Lakeside has 250,000 shoppers on a typical week, with each adult spending an
average of Pounds 64 a visit. During the Christmas build-up, the visitors
increase to 350,000 a week and the average adult outlay doubles to about
Pounds 130.
The mood of shoppers yesterday was cautious. 'We might spend Pounds
150-Pounds 200 today, a bit more than last year,' said Mr Toby Howlett and
Ms Joanie St Cliere. Mr John Gittings and Ms Sandra Owen said: 'We've just
come to look around. We're definitely spending less than last year. We're
both working, but it is tighter than last year - we've cut out lots of
treats.'
Mr Derek Summers said: 'My wife and I are here today to look for some
bargains. This year is tougher than last, absolutely, tougher all round.
That's shown in the fact that all the sales are on before Christmas.'
Another shopper, Mr Stan Kinnear, agreed: 'Since when have (the shops) had
sales giving 10 and 20 per cent off just before Christmas? I don't really
see any signs of recovery.'
Some shops were clearly trading well. 'We've sold out of small karaoke
machines (Pounds 80) but we've got some of the big ones (Pounds 120) left,'
said a salesman at Dixons. Some shops were clearly attracting plenty of
browsers, at least. The Leading Edge, selling trendy gizmos and gadgets, was
packed, as was Game, selling electronic and board games.
But at lunchtime, the BhS outlet looked very empty, with signs offering '
1/3 off dinner sets' and '20 per cent off bedding collections'.
Sale signs particularly dominated the windows of clothing stores; Richards
were offering 'half price off many items'.
In Superdrug the aisles were almost empty; the one counter doing strong
trade seemed to be that offering 'up to 30 per cent off fine fragrances'.
In House of Fraser, the empty children's clothing section had signs offering
'25 per cent off'; its bedding, furniture, perfumery and women's clothing
sections were a paradise of peace and tranquillity.
Mr Peter Doherty, House of Fraser's store manager, said: 'Our growth
compared to last Christmas has been very good, with 30 per cent increases.
We've found that the browsing was happening in late October and now people
are here only if they are buying.'
Mr Bob Kurring, chairman of Lakeside's merchants' association said: 'It's
busier than we thought it was going to be, and Sundays have helped
enormously. But people have looked for value all the way through. Any
high-priced goods have been very slow.'
Meanwhile, outside a shop called Data Base, Father Christmas was
determinedly upbeat: 'There seems to be a lot more money about than people
like to let on.'

FT  21 DEC 92 / Power 'duopoly' may face extra curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, is considering
whether the power generating companies should be regulated as electricity
distributors are.
The review comes amid mounting concern about the 'duopoly' exercised by
National Power and PowerGen, which together have more than 70 per cent of
the market.
Prof Littlechild has the power only to regulate prices charged by the
regional electricity companies, since they are considered local monopolies
and regulation is required to keep prices down. But because the generators
are supposed to compete to sell their electricity, they were exempted from
regulation.
Prof Littlechild has frequently criticised the market dominance of the
generators, most recently last week when, in a report on electricity prices,
he called for greater competition.
He has threatened the generating companies with a monopolies reference,
although an alternative would be to subject them to price regulation. Prof
Littlechild indicated last week that he was considering that option.
The generating companies have been accused of damaging the prospects for the
coal industry by failing to pass on all the benefits of falling coal prices.
National Power and PowerGen have denied that and will soon be discussing
pricing with Prof Littlechild.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Companies take poor view of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORSENING relations between banks and their corporate customers have led a
quarter of UK companies to change bankers in the past five years - more than
half of them in the past two years, a Manchester Business School survey
indicates.
That is an increase in market volatility of two or three times compared with
the mid 1980s.
At the same time, increasing numbers of companies are splitting their
banking, allowing foreign banks to compete for specific business. Only 8 per
cent of companies now use only one bank.
That has enabled US, Japanese and continental European banks to gain a
foothold in 25 per cent of UK corporate accounts.
Those are among the main findings of a detailed survey of banking
relationships by the school's International Centre for Banking and Financial
Services. The survey was of a sample of 670 subscribers to Financial
Director magazine.
The survey reveals widespread dissatisfaction with banks over new fees and
poor quality of service. There was almost universal consensus that the
banks' introduction of customers' charters this year had been largely
useless to business.
The centre's research team, led by Professor Doug Wood, says banks have a
clearer focus on what their competitors are doing than what their clients
are asking for.
The most common complaint was that banks had not passed on interest rate
cuts, using them instead to improve their own margins and leaving struggling
customers in as much trouble as ever.
Only half of those surveyed said they could depend on their bank in a crisis
and only half believed their bank stuck by the spirit of its commitments.
In the sample, Lloyds and NatWest appear to be picking up as many new
customers as they are losing. Barclays emerges as losing share slowly, but
there was a 'quite sharp' drop for Midland.
Net gainers were continental European banks and Bank of Scotland.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Economists see end to recession but weak growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and KEITH FRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION will end next year but growth will be weak, unemployment will
breach 3m and inflation will overshoot the upper limit of the chancellor's
target range.
Those are among the findings of the latest Financial Times survey of
forecasts, carried out during the first two weeks of December.
The consensus from economists at 38 universities, inter-governmental
institutions, independent think tanks and City investment houses is that the
economy will grow by 1 per cent next year, in line with the latest forecast
from the Treasury.
The following year, growth will recover to just below the so-called trend
growth rate of 2.5 per cent, but that will have only a small effect on
unemployment.
For that reason, most economists remain cautious about prospects for
consumer spending.
Just over a third of the 38 economists surveyed expect it to rise above 1
per cent in 1993. They are also less optimistic than the Treasury about
fixed investment and export growth.
Nearly all the forecasters expect the trough of the recession to occur in
either the present quarter or the first quarter of next year.
But they disagree on how fast the economy will subsequently grow.
Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming, a merchant bank, is
the least optimistic, forecasting growth of only 0.7 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1993 compared with the same period this year.
The most bullish forecast comes from Mr James Walsh, macroeconomic
forecaster at the Economist Intelligence Unit. He expects growth of 2.7 per
cent over the same period.
Like four other economists surveyed, though, Mr Walsh is forecasting slower
growth - about 2 per cent - in the year to the fourth quarter of 1994, in
expectation of policy tightening as inflation starts to pick up.
According to the survey, base rates will fall to just under 6.5 per cent by
the end of next year, but rise again to 7.5 per cent by the end of 1994.
Only five economists see base rates dropping to 5 per cent next year, an
expectation that agrees with forecasts - at least for three of them  - for
low inflation over the next two years.
The greatest disagreement among the economists arises over the prospective
size of the UK's current-account deficit.
Professor Patrick Minford at Liverpool University, Prof Tim Congdon at
Lombard Street Research and Mr Warburton, members of the 'Liverpool Six'
group of monetarist economists, are much more optimistic about the UK's
trade position than most others.
All three forecast a current-account deficit of less than Pounds 10bn next
year.
That compares with the gloomiest forecasts, from Mr Keith Skeoch at brokers
James Capel and Mr Gerard Lyons at DKB International, the Japanese bank, who
both expect deficits of more than Pounds 20bn in 1993 and 1994.
The monetarists were vociferous advocates of devaluation long before
September 16, when the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Their optimism about Britain's trade balance generally reflects expectations
for slow import growth over the next two years rather than buoyant export
growth.
The outlook for inflation is mixed. The consensus forecast is that the
chancellor's target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent for the retail prices
index excluding mortgage interest payments will be breached next year and in
1994.
Professor Wynne Godley at Cambridge University is one of a number of
economists expecting inflation to rise next year before dropping again in
1994. 'I think inflation will slide back because, unless we devalue further,
the real economy will remain depressed by rising unemployment,' he said.
Mr Skeoch believes a number of factors will boost the chancellor's chosen
measure of inflation beyond the upper limit of his target range.
They include the introduction of the council tax, the over-indexation of
duties as the Treasury recoups lost revenue, any upward pressure on seasonal
food prices after a very weak 1992, and any increase in petrol prices from
today's very low levels.
Mr Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at brokers Charterhouse Tilney, says
that a drawback about an explicit target for inflation is that industry
tends to raise prices at a faster rate as inflation moves towards the top of
the band.
'They do this with the object of getting price increases through before a
government policy reaction,' he said.
The good news for the chancellor is that most economists expect the M4
measure of the money supply to stay within its monitor range of 4 per cent
to 8 per cent.
Only Mr Neil Williams at Daiwa Europe Bank and Mr David Smith at brokers
Williams de Broe expect the upper limit to be broken next year.
Average earnings will drop below 5 per cent next year, but creep back up to
5.7 per cent in 1994, according to the survey.
The outlook for manufacturing industry is slightly more positive than the
Treasury forecast.
The average forecast for manufacturing growth in 1993 is 1.3 per cent
followed by 2.8 per cent the year after, but the latter figure masks
considerable differences.
Most economists expect house prices to start rising - slowly - towards the
end of 1993. Mr Alan Davies at Barclays Bank and Mr Mark Cliffe at Nomura
Research Institute are among the few economists expecting rapid house price
inflation.
'House prices may not begin to make any appreciable headway until well into
1993, but house price inflation could subsequently move up temporarily to
annual rates of 10 per cent of more,' said Mr Davies.
By contrast, Daiwa's Mr Williams says house price growth will not match RPI
inflation until the end of 1995.

FT  21 DEC 92 / Businesses warned of fake fax invoices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF three large-scale, foreign-run fax directory frauds in Britain is
trying to charge interest on unpaid fake invoices sent out earlier this
year, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
Invoices from the Brussels office of a company called Intercontex Publishers
of America, state: 'We enclose details of your full outstanding account
before handing the matter over to our legal representatives.'
One sent recently to Capital Business Machines of Chatham, Kent, claims
Pounds 358.51 plus Pounds 73.65 interest at 2.5 per cent a month for a fake
invoice sent in the spring.
Officials of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce believe the
tactic is to trap companies that, to protect cashflow, have told accounts
clerks not to pay bills until legal action is threatened, but then to do so
immediately without referral.
The association, which is liaising with the Metropolitan Police, is being
sent up to 60 fake invoices a day by chambers and companies.
Police are usually unable to act because the fake invoices are prepared in
one country and posted in another, with payment sometimes to a third one. If
sent from a third legal jurisdiction, all the sender has done is post a
letter. Pursuit through three or four countries' courts is costly, with high
risk of failure.
Ms Jocelyn Jackson Matthews of the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce said: 'These people take advantage of cheap bulk mailing rates . .
but have never, to my knowledge, produced anything tangible in the way of a
directory.
'Our advice is not to acknowledge the documents, never to pay, and seek
guidance from the local chamber or the police if in doubt.'
The frauds work by criminals sending thousands of 'invoices' for entering a
victim's company name in international fax directories which are never
published.
The fake invoices are illegal and payment cannot be enforced unless the
victim appears to confirm an order.

THIS WEEKEND the axe falls on at least 50 staff at Sotheby's offices in
London and Europe. On Tuesday Christie's made over 60 staff redundant.
Phillips is staying mum. Only at Bonhams, which on Monday will announce
sales up 22 per cent on the year, can auction house staff sleep safely.
What is rather shocking about this new wave of redundancies is that it
follows earlier shake outs, which were sold as the final solution to the
salerooms' problems, and includes distinguished specialists like Anton
Gabszewicz, whose only fault is that he heads a small, and therefore not
very profitable, department in ceramics.
The salerooms are supposed to have turned the corner; the big winter sales
of Impressionists and Old Masters were quite good; why then this inability
to make a profit?
The problem is that both Sotheby's and Christie's are giving it away to
major sellers. When the experts from the two major auction houses arrive to
discuss terms with the owner of a Pounds 1m Canaletto or a Pounds 2m
Picasso, who is thinking of auctioning it, they find that there is nothing
to discus. The rival firm has already been there and offered to put it up
for sale for nothing.
In the past the salerooms made their money by charging sellers a 10 per cent
commission; now the big clients with multi-million properties play Sotheby's
off against Christie's and vice versa. As well as insisting on zero charges
they often want perks, like hard backed catalogues and big marketing
campaigns, to help their art works sell.
By sacrificing profit in the hunt for valuable properties the salerooms must
cut their operating costs, which means shedding staff. Or charge buyers
more. They started to extract a 10 per cent premium on top of the hammer
price from buyers during the recession of the late 1970s. From January 1
Sotheby's is raising this to 15 per cent. Christie's is wavering but will
probably follow suit next week. It is a weird business in which buyers pay
over the odds so that sellers, the real clients, get served for nothing.
Who is the mysterious American who has promised the Tate Gallery Dollars 10m
(Pounds 6.5m) to build new galleries and to convert the existing building
into the Tate Gallery of British Art? The guessing stops at Paul Mellon, who
owns the finest collection of British art in the US and who is rich, and
venerable, enough to make a grand gesture.
Within a couple of months of the London Philharmonic Orchestra coming into
its own as house band at London's South Bank the achievement is acquiring a
hollow ring. The LPO's young (31) music director Franz Welser-Most, has
fallen foul of the critics, and now its managing director, John Willan, has
resigned early. He was expected to go at the end of the season after nine
stormy years at the helm. But now he has asked to be excused by April. He
has plans for a new job in the music world, but a series of rows with the
musicians, and falling out over Welser-Most, have given victory a bitter
taste and speeded his departure.
It is unwise to ask the Italian dealers and collectors currently flooding
London where the money they seem determined to spend comes from - it is
probably something to do with living in a cash, rather than a tax paying,
economy - but they are certainly cheering up the London dealers and auction
houses.
Their excuse for being here is the Accademia Italiana in Rutland Gate where
the Orangerie, easily the most classy small-scale antique fair, ended
yesterday. It is devoted to Italian antiques and is displayed like a
particularly grand Venetian palazzo. The flashy things sold best  - the vast
tapestry bearing the Barberini arms and priced around Pounds 40,000, and a
set of views of a Neapolitan villa, at Pounds 100,000.
But the happiest man to date at the Orangerie is a humble English porcelain
dealer, Clive Gill. He was rummaging through a small country auction when he
came across an Italian manuscript. He thought it worth a flutter and secured
it for Pounds 1,650.
It turned out to be a major discovery, an early secular manuscript on
astronomy, produced in Rimini around 1455. It sold this summer, to the
Rimini Museum, for Pounds 105,000 at Sotheby's. On top of his profit Mr Gill
has been awarded a small bronze horse, which is the Leonardo Prize,
sponsored by Crowley Colosso, which the Orangerie awards each year to the
most important discovery relating to an Italian work of art.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Alston to leave Rambert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Rambert Dance Company has just announced that the company's
artistic director, Richard Alston, 'will shortly be leaving his position.'
Alston joined the Rambert as resident choreographer in 1980 and became
artistic director in 1986. The announcement is tantamount to news that he
has been dismissed. The implications are shocking.
Alston, now aged 44, is widely recognised as the choreographer who has done
most to bring British modern dance to its maturity. He was an important
contributor to the repertory of London Contemporary Dance Theatre in the
1970s; his Rainbow Bandit (1977) is perhaps the only masterpiece ever made
on that company. He co-founded Strider, a group which established
experimental post-modern dance principles in Britain. But his use of
technical dance virtuosity marks him primarily as a modern-dance
choreographer, and since the late 1970s his works have also shown
exceptional musicality, most audaciously in response to new or recent
scores.
His work for the Rambert includes a number of artistic and popular successes
 -Rainbow Ripples (1980), Apollo Distraught (1982), Dangerous Liaisons and
Java (1985), Zansa (1986), Pulcinella and Strong Language (1987) and Hymnos
(1988). As soon as he became the company's director in 1986, it was plain
that the company acquired its most coherent artistic policy for many years,
and its work won several prestigious awards.
His recent choreography to Boulez's Le Marteau sans maitre for the Compagnie
Chopinot in La Richelle is exceptional, his finest achievement since at
least 1988; it will shortly be reviewed in these pages and may be shown on
the South Bank next summer.
The subject of present controversy is his artistic direction - or, more
likely, money. Alston's Rambert has been unique and invaluable among our
major companies for making no concession to populist notions of
accessibility. However, the company has not had a great box-office success
for seasons, and this summer had a financially disastrous season at London's
Royalty Theatre. Since then there has been high tension amid the company's
administration. The company's dancers even wrote to the board's director,
Angela Serrota, expressing their loyalty to Alston - to no avail.
The situation is an obvious parallel to that which English National Ballet
reached in 1989, when ENB's artistic director, Peter Schaufuss, was sacked,
and then its administrator, Richard Jarman, was allowed to depart soon
after. (In this case, the Rambert's administrator, Roger Taylor, is expected
to depart early next year.) Few spectators of ENB before and after 1989
could be convinced that the company's board made a wise decision then; few
regular spectators of the Rambert today could think that its board has been
well advised. The Rambert under Alston has had its recent doldrums; but
without him?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
William Baird yesterday sold most of its engineering contracting arm to a
rival, Cape, controlled by Charter Consolidated, for Pounds 9.5m.
At the same time it announced the purchase from the receiver of the designs
and trade marks of Van Gils, a Belgian men's wear label, for Pounds 600,000.
The moves are the latest stage in Baird's move away from engineering towards
textiles.
'The returns on capital in contracting have not met our expectations,' said
Mr Andrew Mills-Baker, finance director.
Darchem Contracting had 1991 sales of Pounds 37m and operating profits of
Pounds 0.9m. The businesses sold were the UK and Middle East arms of the
company. Baird retains the Darchem name and some activities in Australasia.

FT  19 DEC 92 / DTI 'to clear' NatWest in report on Blue Arrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry has received the report of its
inspectors into allegations that National Westminster Bank and its deputy
chairman, Mr Tom Frost, misled a previous DTI inquiry into the Blue Arrow
affair.
Bankers who have seen excerpts from the report, presented to the DTI on
December 1, believe that Mr Frost and the bank have been cleared of serious
offences. The report is unlikely to be published until after Christmas,
according to government officials.
The latest DTI investigation was launched in March. It was prompted by
allegations during the Blue Arrow trial last year that Mr Frost had
concealed documents from DTI inspectors during an investigation into the
Blue Arrow affair carried out in 1989.
During the trial, a barrister said a draft memo on NatWest's involvement in
the Blue Arrow rights issue, containing handwritten notes made by Mr Frost,
had not been submitted to the inspectors.
Separately, Mr Hugh Hudson, a NatWest employee who conducted an internal
inquiry into the affair, said he felt 'let down' by Mr Frost and Sir Philip
Wilkinson, a former NatWest deputy chairman, for not supplying him with all
relevant documents.
However, bankers who have seen excerpts from the new DTI report believe Mr
Frost has been vindicated. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, is expected
to be particularly pleased since he took the unusual step of calling for the
second DTI inquiry.
He asked for the probe in an attempt to end the speculation about Mr Frost's
role, which he felt was damaging the bank.
After it was launched, Mr Frost was replaced as NatWest's chief executive by
Mr Derek Wanless. Mr Frost said he was stepping down in order to devote
'sufficient time' to assisting the inquiry in an attempt to clear his name.
He said that he planned to retire from the bank next August. He has recently
played a more active role in the bank's affairs, having kept a low profile
for several months.
The focus of the earlier DTI inquiry was how NatWest failed to disclose for
several months that it had acquired a substantial exposure to Blue Arrow's
shares through a rights issue by the employment agency group even though, in
normal circumstances, its exposure should have been disclosed to the stock
exchange.
That inquiry was followed in 1991 by a trial of NatWest Investment Bank,
County NatWest and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - and seven individuals - who were
accused of conspiring to mislead the market over the Pounds 837m rights
issue.
Four of the individuals were convicted but had their convictions quashed on
appeal. The others were acquitted.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Bid for fifth national TV channel fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a fifth national television channel for the UK looked remote
last night after the Independent Television Commission rejected the only bid
for the venture from Channel Five Holdings.
The bid - led by Thames Television and backed by several prominent
international media groups - was turned down because of ITC concerns over
projected costs, audience share and revenue projections in the consortium's
business plan, and dissatisfaction over 'the level of investor commitment'.
Mr Richard Dunn, chairman of Channel Five Holdings and chief executive of
Thames Television, said last night: 'I am shocked and dismayed.' He was told
the news at his London office by Mr Kenneth Blythe, secretary of the ITC.
The Thames executive saw his lawyers yesterday. A decision will be taken
next week whether to seek a judicial review.
Among companies expressing interest in investing in the venture were Thames
and its parent Thorn EMI; Time Warner, the world's largest media group;
Capital Cities/ABC, the US network company; Cox, the large US media concern;
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and Associated Newspapers, publisher
of the Daily Mail.
The ITC said yesterday that evidence of board commitment covering 'the great
majority' of the Pounds 175m investment had not been received by the
deadline. Thames ceases to be an ITV company at the end of this month after
losing its franchise to Carlton Television.
The consortium surmounted two prime obstacles. The ITC accepted its
proposals for retuning millions of video recorders to eliminate interference
expected from the Channel 5 signal, and approved its programme plans, in
spite of concern they might be too London-oriented.
Thames had a 35 per cent stake in the venture authorised by its own board
and that of its majority shareholder, Thorn EMI.
Time Warner International, a division of the US media company, committed
itself to just 10 per cent because of a divisional investment limit of
Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m). A further 25 per cent stake was to have been
considered by the Time Warner board in the new year.
Pearson said it needed to gain acceptance for its stake from its partners in
British Sky Broadcasting because of an understanding that shareholders would
not invest in competing media ventures.
SG Warburg, the merchant bank, wrote a letter to the ITC saying it had no
doubt the project could be 100 per cent funded.
The commission appears to have disregarded the interest from Pearson, Cox,
Capital Cities/ABC and Associated and the 25 per cent of possible Time
Warner investment.
The ITC decision not to award a licence to the consortium disrupts the
government's hopes embodied in the 1990 Broadcasting Act that a fifth
channel would offer more choice to both viewers and advertisers and provide
more competition for ITV and Channel 4.
The fifth channel would have been able to reach at least 70 per cent of the
UK population.
Channel Five Holdings planned to launch a service in London late next year.
A Manchester service was to have followed. The channel planned to specialise
in local news programmes, popular music and films.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, said yesterday that Channel 5 was
not dead. There would be a review of options including the readvertising of
the licence.
Another option would be to offer a number of separate city television
licences for truly local television services, although such a step would
require legislation.
The ITC's decision was welcomed by the Consumers' Association last night
which said it was a clear case where 'nothing is actually better than
something'. There was now an opportunity to start a proper debate about what
viewers wanted from Channel 5.
Mr David Elstein, director of programmes at Thames Television, is to become
director of programmes at British Sky Broadcasting, a new post at the
satellite television company.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Raking in a lucrative cut for the croupier: Plans for a
national lottery are a bizarre reversal of Tory policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is the time of the year when I am accustomed to panic. So many
relatives, a surprising number of friends, and so little imagination. In
other words, I am haunted by the spirit of Christmas Giving. But this
Christmas, I have worked everything out. I shall ask all my best friends and
relatives to make a donation to The Dominic Lawson Christmas sinking fund.
Then I shall put all their names into a hat. The winner shall receive about
half to three-quarters of the fund (I have not made up my mind exactly how
much) as a bumper present, to spend as he or she wishes.
The remainder I shall spend on what I consider to be worthy causes, such as
the opera. I shall support the opera by keeping the money myself and
spending it on attending the biggest loss-making productions at Covent
Garden. It goes without saying that I shall make no contribution to the
fund, but, in the spirit of Christmas, I shall not charge my friends for my
time spent in administering and dispensing the fund.
This idea is not mine, I claim no credit for it. It is merely borrowed from
the government, which on Thursday revealed its plans for a national lottery.
Essentially, it works just like the Dominic Lawson Christmas sinking fund.
Indeed, according to a report on the matter in yesterday's Daily Telegraph:
'The national lottery. . . senior government sources are describing as 'the
government's Christmas present to the nation.''
Thank you, Mr Secretary of State, how did you know it was exactly what I
wanted? And to think all I have given your lot is my pathetic taxes. The
introduction of a national lottery was not just a Conservative commitment
during the last election campaign. It was also firmly written into the
Labour party's manifesto. There, it fitted in perfectly. But for a Tory
government, it is a bizarre reversal of everything that Conservatism has
stood for over the past 13 years.
The main ideological plank of these administrations has been privatisation.
But it was not a matter of mere ideology. It was based on the essentially
practical idea that the economy is harmed when the public sector competes
for limited funds and manpower in areas where the private sector is both
competent and willing to do the job, and the notion that the public sector
is incompetent in running businesses and allocating capital.
This belief led from the privatising in 1979 of some pubs in Carlisle owned
by British Rail right up to the sale of entire utilities. Never, until the
National Lottery Bill, has the government considered reversing this process,
and introduced the public sector into an area prefectly well managed by
private companies such as Littlewoods, the leading football pools company.
That company, incidentally, forecasts that, if the National Lottery Bill
becomes law, it will lose 40 per cent of its turnover and have to sack about
3,000 of its Liverpool-based staff.
That is probably an exaggeration for polemical purposes, but there is no
doubt that the effect will be to steal market share from the private sector.
The only reason why the government permits even Littlewoods to operate is
that it considers the football pools to be a game of skill rather than
chance. This, of course, is not the case, but it is a loophole convenient
for both parties to overlook. It allows the government to continue to claim
that it is the only body with the morals and incorruptibility to be
permitted to operate a lottery. And it clearly believes that under its
benevolent dictatorship, a lottery will not, in the words of a Commons
select committee in 1808, lead to 'idleness, dissipation and poverty. . .
the most sacred and confidential trusts are betrayed, domestic comfort is
destroyed, madness often created, crimes subjecting the perpetrators to the
punishment of death are committed, and even suicide is produced'.
None of these consequences are as bad as those which will actually follow
from the National Lottery of the 1990s: the government will simply be using
its croupier's take as an additional form of voluntary taxation to pay for
things which it is embarrassed about not funding already. The only exception
might be the absurd Millenium fund, aptly described as a something at which
you throw public money which will not be seen again for 1,000 years.
Perhaps the closest parallels to the government's lottery are the bingo
competitions intermittently launched by tabloid newspapers. They are
designed to rally flagging support for a product which, on its merits, is
facing a sharp decline in public appreciation. Or, in other words, the
government is taking a leaf out of Robert Maxwell's book.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Private View: The general recants - General Dmitri
Volkogonov is the ex-Stalinist who advises Yeltsin and is in charge of the
Communist party, state and KGB archives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL remembers it very well. 'I was eight or nine years old. I
remember how my mother took me and my sister to this place; we had just a
couple of bundles of clothes. It was a terrible time and we saw these camps
 -wherever we looked, there were concentration camps.'
The year was 1937, the height of Stalin's purges, and the general's father
had been executed in the small Pacific town of Nakhodka. The rules dictated
that the family be exiled - which usually meant to the east.
'Since for us that would have meant the Pacific Ocean' - he laughed drily -
'and since it was not Stalin's custom to exile people to the Hawaiian
islands, we were sent to the Krasnoyarsk region in western Siberia.'
Colonel General Dmitri Antonovich Volkogonov has inherited, almost
literally, the legacy of his Communist past. For, in addition to his role as
senior military adviser to President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, he is chairman
of the commission which is declassifying the state, party and KGB archives.
Paradoxically, part of his own story remains hidden.
'Even though I have total access to all the most secret papers,' he said, 'I
have been unable to discover exactly when and where my father was shot and
where he is buried.' All he knows is that Stalin, after signing his father's
death warrant, went off to the theatre.
Ideologically, Volkogonov has travelled further - though not faster - than
most of his bewildered countrymen. In spite of his father's execution and
his mother's early death in exile, he became a zealous Stalinist, a
hardliner who rose rapidly through the ranks to emerge a leading commissar:
deputy chief of the political indoctrination bureau for the armed forces.
Gradually, he began to live a sort of double life, using his privileged
access in order to research Stalin's purges. He had to quit his commissar
post. Editorship of a history of the second world war cost him his job as
director of the Institute of Military History.
He was the first general to leave the Communist Party and join Yeltsin,
before the failed coup in August, 1991. He is a deputy of the Russian
parliament (from the same region as Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime
minister) where he leads a small liberal grouping.
What Volkogonov calls his 'agonising, long process of reappraisal' includes
a blockbuster biography, Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy, begun in the late
1970s when he was still writing socialist utopian tracts, and published
three years ago under glasnost. (It is now available in English).
A study of Trotsky followed and he is working on Lenin, a book which he says
'will be my most liberated'. The man he once revered as a genius he now
describes as 'a great revolutionary but not a great character. Lenin's ideas
flew very high but in the wrong direction'.
We discussed the explosive potential of the archives in his charge, some of
which have already been opened to foreign researchers but some of which,
especially the later KGB material, may be held back under a 30-year rule due
to be enacted next year.
There are 600,000 dossiers on people Stalin threw into the meatgrinder.
Many, under torture, invented terrible lies to incriminate others.
'Thousands of people worked as undercover agents. We can not predict the
outcome if we were to publish these lists. It is very difficult to know how
far to go.' It was like taking organs from the dead without the family's
consent.
There are gaps in the record. One concerns Krushchev's celebrated
closed-session speech to the 20th Party Congress in 1956. 'It was an
extremely brave step,' the general said, 'because Krushchev was part of the
process he was de-Stalinising.
'He asked for every document to be brought to him that had his signature on
it. The former head of the KGB, Shelepin, told me he took Krushchev a huge
pile of papers. I asked Shelepin: 'Well, where have the papers got to?'
Shelepin paused for a moment and then he said: 'I suspect he burned them all
on a bonfire at his dacha.''
I pointed out to the general that he, too, is part of his own de-Stalinising
process. He was unruffled.
'Without any doubt. I've never hidden the fact that I was part of the
process and I would accept that I was one of those who did a lot to
strengthen the totalitarian system . When I was a lieutenant, I was a
zealous Stalinist. When Stalin died, I thought the sky was going to fall in.
For many years, I was an orthodox Marxist.
'On the other hand, for many years I also felt we were going up a blind
alley. And I was one of the first to say, in 1986 at the very beginning of
perestroika, that political officers in the army should be abolished.'
Why did you say nothing before?
'Well, I knew that there was a lot wrong but, like Gorbachev, I thought the
system had the ability to reform itself and that it would be reformed from
within. My excuse is that if you look at any of the books I wrote when I
was, as it were, a hardline Stalinist, you will not find any references to
Krushchev or Brezhnev or Stalin. I did not pay lip-service in the way that
an orthodox Marxist-Leninist would have done. It is my only excuse.'
He described his speech to the 1990 party congress, when he warned that the
party would die unless it dropped marxism-leninism. 'There was an incredible
uproar in the hall. They stamped and shouted and would not let me speak. How
could it be that a three-star colonel-general could get up and speak against
the party?
'I regard my own past as part of the evolution of the Russian
intelligentsia. But I have never denied my responsibility for things I was
party to.'
But how on earth did you explain to yourself the death of your own father?
'You have to remember that my mother also died in exile. I explained it to
myself as a terrible, tragic mistake of history. Many people had the same
attitude to similar tragedies. The whole system, somehow, was making these
errors. Nobody blamed Stalin. Forty years ago, one had no conception of the
real essence of the system. One lived in it.
'When I later discovered just how many of my family and close relatives had
been liquidated - and many of them had - I felt we had all been held in the
bloody claws of the most tyrannical regime that the world had ever known.'
But would not the natural reaction of a child in your circumstances be to
grow up hating the system?
'The fact is we were brought up to believe this was the perfect system.
Since infancy, I was taught that the world was only waiting to destroy the
Soviet Union. We believed there were enemies. We believed that Stalin was
the wisest of men.'
The general's voice rose. 'We believed that in ten or 15 years, we would
live in Paradise. Everyone was somehow shackled by the ideas of primitive
dogmatism. The worst crime that you can commit against a people is the
spiritual crime, a crime against thought. And I have finally managed after
25 years to drop this terrible burden of ideology and dogmatism.'
The deeper the intellect, the more dramatic the conversion. This renegade
general has doctorates in both philosophy and history and it is easy to
conclude that the philosophy (which in the USSR meant Marxism-Leninism
though he has read British and German thinkers, too) was overturned by the
history.
I asked about the future. Volkogonov thinks the danger of civil war is real,
but avoidable by means of compromise and coalition. He is now convinced that
the socialist system must be destroyed before Russia can become what he
calls 'a civilised society', a process that he says will take a decade.
Russia had to be eclectic, and distinctions between 'socialism' and
'capitalism' were fruitless. 'I do not think there has ever been an ideal
society on earth. There is not and there will not be.'
Are you still, in any sense, a socialist?
'Socialism has the same right to exist, as an idea, as other philosophies.
One idea of socialism I do believe can survive, one it took from
Christianity, and that is the idea of social justice.'
You are like a man who has lost his religion, I said finally. What do you
put in its place?
'It is wrong for a man to believe in corporate values. We are people who
live all on the same planet and mankind has to devise universal principles,
truths and values.
'Therefore, in place of Marxist ideology, we have to put universal human
values. We do not have to invent them. They have always existed.
'We merely have to affirm them, the eternal values such as those espoused by
Cromwell, Kemal Ataturk and Peter the Great: nobility, bravery, honesty,
decency, conscience.'

IT OCCURRED to me this week that I have been letting my friends in St
Petersburg down. My friends in the KGB. Not that they are the KGB any more.
They are now called the Russian security ministry, and a jollier, more
law-abiding group of people you could not hope to meet.
I first made contact with the security bosses in St Petersburg at the start
of October, after reading that they were miffed that Barbara Hay, the new
British consul-general to that city, had been offered lavish quarters near
the town hall in which to carry out her duties.
The security bosses said that cables carrying government information from
the town hall ran under the building in which Ms Hay was to be ensconced,
and that they believed that the British intelligence service would be able
to plunder classified information 'using various technical means and
devices.'
An ugly tiff was in the offing. So in I stepped. I rang Andrei Korodkhov,
the security ministry's liaison officer, and said that if he would get Ms
Hay bedded down swiftly in her new quarters, I would radio him, regularly, a
wad of intelligence news from London to offset any titbits Ms Hay might
glean by plugging - perhaps when turning on her TV or using her electric
toothbrush - into the security cables beneath her building.
On October 2 I radioed off a fine cache of intelligence snippets. The
security bosses were ecstatic. Then I forgot about them.
Anxious to make amends, I rushed to my transmitter yesterday and dashed off
another bulletin, encrypted, as before, in five-digit numerical groups
transformed (using false addition: 2 + 3 = 9) by a second devious
encryption. I know the Cold War is over, but those of us involved in the
espionage business prefer to stick to the old rules, plus minimum standards
of tradecraft.
To start with, I filled them in on some news that could save Russia zillions
of roubles:
'Whatever you do, be extremely sceptical of western 'experts' who urge you
to spend money you haven't got on fancy remedies for environmental damage.
We all know Russia is a mess, but take cheer from what Keith Clayton, dean
of environmental studies at the University of East Anglia, said this week. A
self-styled 'mad professor', Clayton thinks the North Sea a good place to
dump sewage, and says the bottom of deep oceans is suitable for disposing of
unwanted nuclear submarines.
''There is a lot of pressure against putting sewage into the North Sea,' he
said, 'but that is the best place to put it. You can do far worse than
putting it into a deep and well-flushed sea. As far as poisoning the
fish is concerned, that's rubbish. The sewage has probably kept the poor
fish alive.' Similarly, he favours jettisoning nuclear subs in deep oceans.
Eventually, they would be dragged down into the Earth's core. Listen to
Clayton, and you could save a meaningful fraction of your 21st century GDP.'
Having steered the Russians away from schemes of crackpot greenery, I told
them how to make some money, citing Britain's plans for a national lottery,
starting in 1994:
'Offering prizes of Pounds 1m-plus per week, and raising funds for various
good causes, the UK's national lottery will be a huge success, given that
the British rank alongside the Chinese and Australians as the world's most
addicted and addled gamblers. But nobody compares with you Russians.
'For seven decades your experiment with Marxist totalitarianism amounted to
the biggest lottery in the solar system. With a track record like that, I
suggest you launch a trans-Russia lottery soonest, and introduce horse, dog
and camel racing, plus bingo and casinos, in all towns and cities. You
already have the Mafia, so give them something to run.'
As a further good turn, I warned the Russians against over-indulgence at
Christmas, quoting directly from a story in yesterday's Daily Mirror:
'Rip-roaring Aussies are so full of wind they're blasting a huge hole in the
ozone layer, says a top doctor. Pongers from Perth and Sydney stinkers are
seriously damaging the environment by letting off a litre of gas each a day,
he claims.
'Professor Terry Bolin, stomach specialist at a Sydney hospital, is calling
for urgent research into the whiffers of Oz. 'There's been no real
measurement of emissions from humans as a contributor to the ozone problem,'
he said. 'But the methane produced does have an effect.'
'Professor Bolin is urging Australians to eat seafood and fruit instead of
the traditional Christmas dinner.'

FT  19 DEC 92 / Fashion: Weaving that old black magic - Evening wear that
puts other dresses in the shade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NAVY has been this half-century's safely elegant choice for women in
daytime, there is no doubt about its after-dark equivalent. At night, one is
seen in black.
Although black is every designer's choice for evening versions of this
winter's fashion themes, you cannot say that black is back. It has never
been away. In British stores, at least, little black dresses, long black
dresses and black evening separates far outsell any other colour every
winter.
At Fenwick, in London's Bond Street, the figure is three to one. At Harvey
Nichols in Knightsbridge, buyer Yasmin Yussuf estimates her sales of black
equal those of red, purple, cobalt and gold put together.
Those bright shades read like a list of also-rans. At some point, each has
been touted as the evening colour of the season, only to founder among the
black shadows. This year it is the turn of gold, but you are more likely to
see it on fashion pages than at parties. Yet, all those colours look very
good as a highlight to a predominantly black outfit.
Indeed, that is one of black's enduring strengths - it is a brilliant foil
for the vivid little item, such as a bag or scarf, that individualises a
simple dress and, most of all, for jewellery. Not for nothing do jewellers
display their best pieces on black velvet.
Buyers and designers say the greatest appeal of black is its versatility.
'It dresses up or down as much as you want,' explains Yussuf, 'and,
therefore, you only need buy one evening outfit, especially as the long slim
dress is now acceptable wear from cocktails to grand balls.
'It can be low-key or, if a woman enjoys really glittering costume jewellery
or has wonderful real jewellery, nothing will set it off to better
advantage. And black is the most slimming colour.'
There is also the question of investment value. 'Because the accessory
variations are limitless,' says Yussuf, 'you can keep on bringing out a
black dress and, even more so, interchangeable black evening separates. But
that stunning red dress is once seen, never forgotten.'
For designer Donald Campbell, who has many private customers for whom he
makes to measure, it is a matter of discretion. 'This is not the time for a
grand statement in flamboyant colours,' he says. 'I have had many orders for
simple black dresses but the fabrics - silk, crepe or velvet - are very rich
and feel wonderful to wear. It is a time for private luxury, not public
display.'
As Emanuel Ungaro showed in his couture collection for this autumn, you can
confect a complex mix of velvet, lace, taffeta, beading and ribbons and,
provided everything is black, the result is charmingly tasteful.
Try that in red or gold and you would be fit only for the stage at the royal
variety performance. It is also very hard to put a price tag on a plain
black dress, as even inexpensive fabrics have a knack of looking better in
black than any other colour.
Apart from the grand ball dress, all the clothes photographed here are
priced moderately - but they give maximum value for glamour and good taste.
They also illustrate the chameleon ability of black to slot into any of
fashion's present moods. The grand dress is the place for mixing texture,
fabric and decoration to great effect; and the quality of fitting and
finish, plus the craftsmanship of the detail, mark the special effort from
the common herd.
Conversely, the new, slim, long dress is the plainest canvas to decorate
with your own fashion fantasies, from jewellery to a bright chiffon or
velvet scarf (or, if you have the face, figure and confidence, to wear in
minimalist mode with nothing but clean hair and a naked smile).
The full, long skirt is a less demanding option but here, too, fashion
decrees a low-key pairing, with a simple Lycra 'body' or a slip of soft knit
 -plenty of opportunities to bring in colour here - rather than the big
organza shirt or spangled corsetry of last year.
Short dresses may have been declared passe by the pundits but they are still
many women's choice and look fresher for evening than for day. Provided the
shape is simple, you can load on the glitter here - the black, sequinned
shift dress has become a modern classic.
Finally, this year's emphasis on mannish styles has turned the spotlight on
another classic, the dinner suit. Worn with cascading hair and wicked
womanly touches such as delicate mules or a transparent chiffon shirt, it
can look more beguilingly feminine than the flounciest of frocks.
But the last word should go to a designer who is not a single-minded
supporter of black. Amanda Wakeley, a rising young star of evening wear and
winner of the glamour section of this year's British fashion awards,
produced much of her winter collection in deep navy or chocolate brown.
'I see them as alternatives which fulfil the same function as black,' she
says, 'All are very subtle and can be dressed up with jewellery, and some
women find the others suit them better.'
She adds, though: 'Black is still the best-seller when I wholesale to stores
because it's the safe option, the colour everyone has accessories to go
with. But my private customers who come for special orders often want
something different.'
FOR alternative looks for those alternative evenings:
Tuxedos: wool crepe with sequinned lapels, Pounds 75 from Fenwick; velvet
smoking jacket with beaded tie-belt, Pounds 450 from the Harvey Nichols
Collection.
Longs: short-sleeved round-necked cheongsam, Pounds 179 from Jaeger; stretch
jersey with twist front and long sleeves by Jasper Conran, Pounds 330 from
Harvey Nichols.
Grands: a selection at Donald Campbell, Chelsea Manor Street, SW3; Chelsea
Design Company, Sydney Street, SW3; David Fielden, Fulham Road, SW3. Price:
the sky is the limit.
Fulls: black and purple satin stripe by Monix, Pounds 89.99 to order on
081-531-6622; selection at Tatters, Fulham Road, SW3 and Harrods, SW1,
prices from about Pounds 500.
Shorts: all-over beaded vest dress by John Charles, Pounds 130 from House of
Fraser; sequin T-shirt dress, Pounds 179 from Jaeger.

FT  19 DEC 92 / How to Spend It: New games win as old favourites go by the
board - Peter Berlin tests this season's new and repackaged ideas and judges
how the die is cast for them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Reverend Green is dead. His place among the murder suspects in the
Cluedo set is to be taken by a businessman. Green's fans jammed the
switchboard of the game's UK licensee when the news leaked out this week.
But when you unwrap the family Christmas game this year, you will find that
he is not the only victim of changing fashion.
This year's seasonal releases include new versions of those old favourites,
Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. They are joined by, among others, a growing
number which hark back to the British tradition of parlour games.
The tried and trusted Christmas games are both repackaged this Christmas.
There is a Trivial Pursuit - The Annual Edition, to celebrate the game's
tenth birthday, containing questions culled from events of the last year.
There is no board. Instead, there is the usual pie and a die with coloured
dots for categories. This keeps the price down but removes the last vestiges
of tactics.
Since it is rarely possible to deduce the answers to Pursuit questions, this
is essentially a game of luck. Furthermore, like all trivia games, it
favours adults who have had more time to accumulate the debris of modern
society more than children and, in this version, adults who are obsessed
with Madonna most of all. There are also three different versions of the
full set with board (Pounds 43), a travel version, additional specialist
boxes of question cards and sets of CD and cassette questions (Pounds 15).
In Euromonopoly (Pounds 29.95), the EC version for 1993, the dark blue
properties (the most expensive) are, unsurprisingly, German: Berlin's
Kurfurstendam and the Konigsallee. Strangely, the two cheap brown ones are
Danish. The currency is Ecus, the playing pieces are the Eiffel Tower, the
Tower of Pisa, and so on. But the game is played exactly the same way. It is
a pretty tackily made version of the old favourite, but you can always buy
Standard Monopoly (Pounds 15), Deluxe Monopoly (Pounds 25) or Pocket
Monopoly (Pounds 9) instead.
The latest Trivial Pursuit may have dropped the board but imitations crop up
everywhere. Both Pictionary (Pounds 32.95) and Articulate (Pounds 24.95)
come with boxes of question cards and boards divided into coloured segments.
Both also owe a large debt to charades.
At least with Outburst (Pounds 33.95), the board is black and white. All
three games contain little plastic egg-timers which break easily. Articulate
is the least-well made and accordingly the least expensive.
All three are really rather fun. They fit into the booming category of rowdy
team games. In Pictionary, players must communicate words to team-mates with
drawings, in Articulate they must explain as many words as quickly as
possible and in Outburst, teams must name as many words in a category as
quickly as possible.
Pictionary is not for those sensitive about their art. Drawings are subject
to ridicule, but even bad drawings can be communicative. It is amazing what
stick men can do.
Articulate is, for the most part, a test of quick wits and word-power but a
team can run aground on questions of general knowledge - if you do not know
what the Maldives are, you cannot explain them to team mates.
There are other, inferior, variations on this theme. Pazzazz, which is not a
team game, comes with what looks like a set of clockwork dentures instead of
an eggtimer. This flops over at the end of a player's timed turn of naming
words in a category. If you do not want a set of jumping teeth, you
certainly will not want the whirring, plastic clapperboard which comes with
Guesstures (Pounds 33.95), a reworking of charades. Save your money and play
the original.
One cheeky repackaging of an old parlour game that is worth the money is Ex
Libris (Pounds 10.95). It contains a well-disguised set of rules and a pack
of cards. These offer plot synopses of novels. Players, if they do not know
the real first or last lines, write down versions of their own devising and
then try to guess the right one.
Once you have used the entire pack, you can start working your way through
paperbacks on your shelves. It is immense fun. Even the best-read will be
surprised at how little they remember, while the least bookish can show a
surprising literary flair.
Apart from the many repackagings of Monopoly and Cluedo (Pounds 14.95)
old-fashioned board games are rare. The biggest British games manufacturers
are obsessed with jumping teeth and do not believe old-fashioned games will
sell to the Nintendo generation.
The worthwhile exceptions include Fair Means or Foul (Pounds 17) from
Germany, where such games still sell well. It takes antique collecting as
its metaphor, so it is full of rather pretty playing cards showing antiques
and modern works of art. Players collect sets of art by outbidding opponents
or stealing from them. But if you spend too much time building a collection
rather than moving your piece, you might be too far behind at the end.
This is a nicely designed, testing and infuriating game which can occupy a
couple of nerve-wracking hours in comparative quiet and allow children a
good chance of beating their parents. The same goes for Hare and Tortoise
(Pounds 17), a British game, in which a gift for mental arithmetic is
helpful but not essential as you try to calculate how many carrots your
rabbit needs to hop round the course.
One way games companies are trying to compete with the video and computer
games is by putting games on video tape. The most heavily advertised is
Atmosfear (Pounds 32.95), a board game which has the advantage of taking
exactly the 60 minutes the tape lasts. Players race around a graveyard
collecting six keys by luck rather than skill. Every so often, an
over-the-top actor playing 'the gatekeeper' snarls instructions from the
screen. As the game goes on, he grows more over-the-top, his make-up
thickens and his growls become louder and more frequent. Good fun for
teenage children and their friends following the Christmas Eve visit to the
pub after which it will probably be forgotten.
Another video game is 221b Baker Street. The video offers badly-acted but
entertainingly scripted little snippets of plot but is little more than a
decoration of the board game of the same name (Pounds 15) - a sophisticated
variation on Cluedo. Fans of the great detective might also enjoy the rather
quirky card game Sherlock Holmes (Pounds 8.95) which contains elements of
the old card game Hearts. It is most entertaining if players announce plot
developments in a Dr Watson voice as they play each card.
The obsession with detectives has carried over into the ultimate
dinner-party game: the murder evening. Players take the parts of suspects in
a murder and play out their roles over a meal. The leaders in this field are
the How to Host a Murder (Pounds 23) series. The box includes a cast list,
so you can invite the most suitable of your friends for each role.,
You begin the evening with a tape in which you are told by a policeman that
you are suspects in a murder and may not leave. The players spend the meal
wheedling secrets out of each other. Each has a booklet of information their
character knows, after each course they turn the page to find out more,
after dessert they turn to the solution.
It can make for an entertaining evening if everyone enters into the spirit,
but it can be trying for the host, running in and out with food and missing
clues. One strange aspect of some of the games is that the murderer does not
know he or she has done it until the last turn (or course).
The How To games run through the usual gamut of Agatha Christie country
houses and train journeys.
For those with a large wardrobe of Lycra tunics and nylon slacks, there is a
Star Trek mystery, but you can only play each mystery once. It is also
impossible to make real conversation while you are playing a game - perhaps
that makes it more attractive for a family Christmas.
Retail prices of games vary greatly. Those quoted are from Harrods, for
games it stocks, or specialist shops Just Games and Esdevium Games. Both of
these offer mail order; Esdevium Games, 6 Wellington St, Aldershot, Hants,
GU11 1DZ, tel: 0252- 311443; Just Games, 71 Brewer St, London W1R, 3FB, tel:
071-734-6124.

FT  19 DEC 92 / How to Spend It: Making child's play of choosing - Luxurious
last-minute presents for both the little folk and large
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYBODY who has ever tried to track down fine editions of the great
children's classics will know how difficult they are to find. Everyman's
Library has come to the rescue this Christmas with a boxed set of 10 of the
great children's classics. Simply but beautifully printed and bound, they
cost Pounds 67.50 for the set and should give any child hours of pleasure.
Included is Alice in Wonderland, Kipling's Just So Stories, fairy stories by
Grimm and Andersen, Treasure Island, Aesop's Fables, Peter Pan, The Wizard
of Oz, A Child's Garden of Verses and Lear's Beasts.
They can also be bought separately at Pounds 5.99 for the smaller tomes,
Pounds 6.99 for the larger. Find them in most bookshops, including WH Smith.
David Plagerson's beautifully crafted wooden Noah's arks and animals are of
heirloom quality. Much too good really to be wasted on children, many of his
toys are increasingly sought by collectors.
Anybody in an indulgent mood and prepared to spend the money his toys cost
will find that Plagerson himself (28 Bridgetown, Totnes, Devon, tel: 0803
866786) will be glad to sell them either a doves' frieze or a cherry frieze
ark with an assortment of wooden animals.
Prices start at Pounds 320 for the ark set in mixed woods, while painted
ones (pictured right) are Pounds 840 for the smaller size with 15 pairs of
painted animals and Pounds 1,330 for the large ark with 25 pairs.
MATTHEW Rice has produced some exceedingly pretty and well-priced card and
paper briefcases for children.
The one photographed here (above) sells for about Pounds 21 and features
Noah's Ark and pairs of wooden animals on the front and a stable of toys on
the back. When the child opens the lid, there is a map of the world.
Also made from card and paper is a sweet, small chest of drawers (again for
children) with chickens and rabbits on the front. About Pounds 14.95, and
ideal for keeping together all the tiny precious things that children love.
Look out, too, for photograph frames, ranging in price from Pounds 5.25 to
Pounds 10.60. The Matthew Rice range is stocked in London by the General
Trading Company, 144 Sloane Street, SW1; Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly; Graham
&amp; Green, 4 and 7 Elgin Crescent, London W11 21A; Barclay &amp; Bodie, 7 Blenheim
Terrace, NW8. You can kill two birds with one stone and see some of the
delightful glass and spongewear made by Matthew Rice's wife at the same
time, at her shop, Emma Bridgewater, 739 Fulham Road, London SW6. For out of
London stockists or for mail order (still just time]), ring Rice Paper on
071-371-9077.
TARTANS and checks, as if regular readers of How To Spend It needed telling,
are all the rage. In fine Viyella in sophisticated colourways, they make
exceptionally chic nightwear, particularly for chaps. Look for dressing
gowns with tartan cuffs, shawl collars piped in red, for matching
nightshirts, and perhaps most sophisticated of all, look for dressing-gowns
and pyjamas in a Prince of Wales check Viyella, such as the set by Bonsoir
pictured above.
Pyjamas are Pounds 87.50 a pair, the dressing gown, Pounds 105. A little
cheaper, at Pounds 72.50, are the Viyella nightshirts.
For those who prefer to conduct their nightlife in good soft cotton poplin
instead of cosy Viyella, the same designs come in regimental and satin
stripes, paisleys and spots. Pyjamas, Pounds 59.50, nightshirts and
dressing-gowns, Pounds 45 each. Bonsoir is available from most good
department stores.
COCOON produces the most luxurious bedding in the world - silk-lined,
silk-filled, exquisitely finished and embroidered, based on the heirloom
bedding that throughout the great dynasties of China was deemed the right
and proper accompaniment to blissful sleep for the high-born and
well-heeled.
These days, these delicious duvets, pillowcases and bedcovers are beyond the
reach of all but the seriously rich - they start at Pounds 1,665 for a
double quilt but perhaps a doting grandmother might consider Pounds 400 for
a pampered offspring's Baby Bundle?
However, a smashing present for an indulgent chap to give his best-beloved
would be one of the classic silk hoods the company now produces. Made from
sand-washed silk charmeuse filled with pure silk floss, they are the most
glamorous wind-cheaters I know. In dark blue, midnight blue, black, pale
rose and pale blue, trimmed with a dark brown velvet cuff, they cost Pounds
400 each. The Cocoon Collection is stocked by The Monogrammed Linen Shop at
168 Walton Street, London SW3 and in Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, SW1,
and by Thomas Goode of 18 South Audley Street, London W1.
TOMLINSONS catalogue is filled with charming ideas for Christmas presents
for all ages and anybody still agonising over lists and decisions can ring
081 944 8348 today from 9am to 2pm and next week to glean ideas. Many of the
suggestions are relatively inexpensive - two beautiful beeswax candles for
Pounds 18.85, painted wooden picture frames for Pounds 10.50, luscious
soft-fringed 100 per cent pure wool checked throws at Pounds 49.95,
long-sleeved white cotton Victorian-style nighties for Pounds 31.95, fat
etched coloured glass pens for Pounds 12.55 each. The wooden book-ends at
Pounds 15.65 and coat-pegs at Pounds 4.95 below would enliven any nursery or
child's bedroom.
It has always been hard to beat a good book as a present and these days
proper hardbacks are expensive enough to be considered treats. For anybody
short of time, Interbook is a godsend - an idea so simple one wonders why it
took so long to happen. Any book ordered before 3pm can be delivered
anywhere in the country the next day. The Interbook telephone line - 081 200
1515 - is manned 24 hours a day, every day except Christmas day, and the
cost is the full published price of the book plus a Pounds 4.99 delivery
charge, no matter how many books are sent. The service includes gift
wrapping, a greetings card, printing of a message on the bookplate,
insurance and hand delivery. Payment is by credit card and books can be sent
abroad.
A ROCKING horse is the classic heirloom present - every adult's idea of the
essential prop for the ideal nursery. The Stevenson brothers are the classic
makers of modern fine-quality rocking horses. Prices start at something like
Pounds 1,000 and go up to Pounds 3,000. As they are hand-made (from
non-endangered woods), they should really be ordered in advance but the
Stevenson Brothers have an Ayres horse, made from popular wood with beech
legs, still available in their workshop (first come, first served, Pounds
1,700, ring 0233 820363). They also have charming teddy-bears, part of a
limited edition of 100, left at about Pounds 170 each. Dolls start at Pounds
70, small rocking horses at Pounds 500.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Barnum walks the tightrope - Not the greatest show on
earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STORY of Phineas Taylor Barnum, the man who brought the circus to town,
is so extraordinary that it must be almost impossible to tell it badly. The
musical version at the Dominion does not quite do that, but except for a
spectacular 15 minute finale, it is curiously lacking in style.
Barnum (1810-91) was a remarkable man by any standards. He called himself
the Prince of Humbugs, yet managed to continue to take people in for most of
his life. His specialisation in show business was exceptions to the rule,
like the midget who never grew more than 25 inches tall whom he called
General Tom Thumb. He also acquired Jumbo, the biggest known elephant in the
world, from the London Zoo and put him in his circus. At the same time, he
dabbled in politics, was on speaking terms with US presidents and had tea
with Queen Victoria.
But it is not the greatest show on earth that has arrived in London. Barnum
looks slightly amateur, precarious and under-rehearsed. Possibly this is a
very clever device, designed to show the fragility and hit-or-miss nature of
show business. If so, some of us would prefer professionalism.
There are opportunities galore. One of Barnum's first successes was to
discover an ancient black slave called Joice Heth, whom he passed off as
George Washington's 160-year-old nurse. Here the exhibit looks just like
another shabby side show. The production does not do a great deal better
with Tom Thumb, though it does allow another of Barnum's discoveries, a
Swedish opera singer called Jenny Lind, to demonstrate what can be done with
a confident voice and attractive looks. Played by Clara Miller, she is in a
higher league than most of the rest of the cast.
This teasing division between what is really good and what you can get away
with runs through the show. There is a striking example when Paul Nicholas,
playing Barnum, walks a tight rope. True, it is not much more than six feet
high and the rope is not the thinnest you have ever seen, but it is a very
long walk and there are no visible means of support. At the opening on
Thursday, he made it and let out a huge whoop of 'yes'. Perhaps it is part
of the suspense that he may not make it every night.
One part of the plot is bewilderingly obscure. After a touching scene with
his wife on the steps of the town hall where Barnum has been elected mayor,
it is not clear whether she goes off and leaves him or simply goes off and
dies. Either way, that is the last we see of Charity Barnum played by Carol
Duffy. Perhaps the subtlety is that, whatever happened, the show goes on.
The music is by Cy Coleman. Its weakness is that there is only one passably
good song, 'The Colours of My Life', and not enough is made of it. Yet just
when you are thinking what an uneven show this is comes the dazzling finale:
acrobatics all over the place, Barnum arriving on a rope from the gallery,
the circus at its best. Indeed there is so much simultaneous spectacle in
the last few minutes that it is hard to take it all in. One wonder why some
of it had not come before.
I do not want to disparage. Barnum is fun. Nowadays, however, when you put
on a musical in the West End you have to compete with the technical
excellence of the Royal National Theatre doing Carousel. Put the RNT on to
Barnum and it might be a different story. The show is directed and staged by
Buddy Schwab and will run for a six week season.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Dangers of being Number One fan - 'Misery' steers an
uneasy course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS the play of the film of the Stephen King horror thriller, and the
most remarkable thing about it is the alarming degree to which Sharon
Gless's portrayal of the grinning, auburn, sturdy, determined, grunting,
obsessive, homicidal and unbearable heroine Annie Wilkes resembles the
Duchess of York. Once the likeness hits you, the play becomes considerably
more interesting.
Otherwise it steers an uneasy and corny course. Suspense is an awkward path
to negotiate. Steer too far one way and you bore the audience; steer too far
the other and you are into realms of camp. Misery-the-play veers off in
either direction several times. Though usually among the most squeamish
people in any audience, I was on this occasion one of those who chuckled
heartily through the Act Two climax - and I was among the few who did not
already know the plot. I may be lowbrow enough to enjoy Ed McBain, Captain
Beaky and Eastenders, but I have not yet made it to Stephen King.
For those few of you who also need telling, the plot of Misery concerns a
writer of cheap historical romances which feature a heroine named Misery. He
is rescued from a car accident by Annie, who happens to be not only the
world's Number One fan of the Misery novels but also a psychopath. Since his
legs are agonisingly injured, she is able to hold him captive. Soon she
discovers with rage that he has begun to attempt another kind of fiction and
that, in the latest Misery novel, he has actually killed Misery off. You can
just imagine how she starts terrorising him after that. Novel, hovel, grovel
. . .
It is fun to see Sharon Gless perform a role so unlike that of the TV Cagney
(&amp; Lacey) that has made her famous. She conveys has the character's gauche,
growling stolidity - but as a psychopath she is just a ham, along Whatever
Happened to Baby Jane lines. As for Bill Paterson, it is depressing to see
him in this material so soon after his superior performance in a rather more
compelling tale of a captive hostage, Death and the Maiden. In Misery, he is
highly intense, convincing and, often, funny. But what a waste of two
talented actors.
I call this the play of the film chiefly because the staging uses loud music
to manipulate the audience into alarm, panic, horror and even ironic
laughter. This is the Indiana Jones school of dramaturgy: hammer the pulses,
and switch the volume up, up up. The composer is Gavin Greenaway, but I
blame the director, Simon Moore, who is also the playwright. Though he
succeeds with the deliberately comic/campy parts - the Misery novels are
plainly pulp - he leaves us unsure how often we should be laughing
throughout the other sections. Misery is a pretty cynical exercise in
audience manipulation that is not canny enough to succeed.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: A high risk Flute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY those with long memories will be able to picture clearly the Sadler's
Wells production of Don Giovanni from the 1960s, which brought modern sets
and pop-art drop curtains featuring green triangular trees to classical
opera. Imposing an abstract style on Mozart is a high risk strategy.
For Scottish Opera to try such a trick after the abuse that greeted its last
new production was brave indeed. But the company has taken out an insurance
policy. The conductor was Nicholas McGegan, who commands wide respect as a
Mozartian of authority and lively ideas. He conducted this new Magic Flute
on Thursday without a baton, but one would never have known: the orchestra's
playing was crisp and the whole score swept along, bristling with energy.
It was the sort of musical performance which stamps its personality on the
opera from the opening bars - in this case a businesslike call to attention,
nothing pompous at all, which is just what Martin Duncan's production will
have wanted. For his aim was to put on an anarchic show, which tramples all
the hallowed conventions underfoot. This is a Magic Flute of no particular
time, of no place, just a riot of colourful ideas in a fashionably
alternative style. The audience has tuned in to Mozart and found him on
Channel 4.
In such a demotic view of the opera there is no point in bothering about
lofty philosophical truths. Instead we get an adventure pantomime, in which
Paul Nilon's eager and boyish Tamino, rather short on princely nobility of
voice, sets out to win his girl - Susannah Waters, an attractive Pamina,
though one who does not sound at ease with her music.
On the way he encounters various bizarre creatures. The Queen of Night, sung
by Jennifer Rhys-Davies, becomes a vamp and evil magician, who pins the
birds that Papageno brings her on the wall at home. Rupert Oliver Forbes's
Monostatos is dressed as a human dung beetle with grotesque dangling bits
(one does have to sympathise with singers these days). Gidon Saks makes a
refreshingly unstuffy Sarastro, broadly sung; David Mattinson is the
dignified Speaker. The Three Boys seemed unnaturally confident, until a
glimpse of their child-bearing hips gave the game away.
The star of the evening, however, was Simon Keenlyside as Papageno, a
brilliant comic creation conceived (one imagines) by singer and producer
together. Here the bird-catcher becomes part bird himself, half peacock,
half gobbling turkey, his gait a stalking bird-like strut, his nose a
pointed beak, while the human part was wrapped up in the guise of a
Liverpudlian alternative comedian - a unique double persona, dazzlingly
brought off.
When he is on stage, the production takes wing. For the rest Duncan amuses
himself debunking the opera's convoluted symbolism. Into Ken Lee's brash
designs is tossed any symbol that happened to be at hand, windows, doors,
triangles, circles, all meaningless and a wickedly merry jape. I liked the
three temples of Sarastro's kingdom, which come out as triangles of stone,
on each of which a classical column (Ionic, Doric and Corinthian) has been
chalked as graffiti.
Less than half of what makes The Magic Flute a great opera is to be found
here, but what there is flies high with a brazen sense of fun: a symbol,
maybe, of renewed confidence at Scottish Opera.
Performances continue at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, until 10 February (Box
Office 041-332 9000); then on tour

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Jazz Collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Collection is three nights of comedy and music in aid of Friends of the
Earth, held in Islington's Union Chapel. Unusually, for 'a benefit', and a
popular one at that, the music part is entirely jazz and not entirely
mainstream.
Saxophonist Barbara Thompson has long inhabited the mainstream usually
veering towards the funk/fusion aspect of the music with her touring band
Paraphernalia. The new outfit Sans Frontiers is a more eccentric and
cosmopolitan vehicle, however, and is currently parading a jointly written
suite. The six pieces, arranged by Thompson, which includes Michael
Urbaniak's electric violin and the keyboards of Jasper Van'T Hof, creates a
dense wall of sound.
On Monday, her own persuasive tenor voice spoke clearly on 'Into The Eye Of
The Storm', the soprano taking a back seat for Enrico Rava's rip-roaring
trumpet in 'Stuttgart'. 'Secrets', written by Rava, opened with a wiry bass
solo from Bo Stieff set against the meshing cymbals of Jon Hiseman, giving
way to more fat notes from the trumpeter. 'Over the G', written by Stieff,
commenced with a threatening and industrial rhythm which blossomed into an
opening for Urbaniak's extraordinary instrument. The gum chewing Urbaniak
has the better of it though, and even exchanged melodramatic sawing for an
electronically induced alto saxophone sound at one stage.
The scene for Thompson's heavyweights was set by the weltering piano
technique of South African Bheki Mseleku and later the likeable whimsy of
British pianist Django Bates. Mseleku arrived wearing a tenor sax and
accompanied himself competently at the keyboards for a couple of bars before
dedicating himself to the poignant chords, trickling notes and nasal
utterances which have brought him to prominence this year. As an improvisor
he is full of ideas and the moaning top line he sings adds surprisingly much
to his pieces. Hopefully, sustained success will enable him to fulfill one
of his burning ambitions - to own a piano.
Django Bates and saxophonist Iain Ballamy's cranky, out of kilter tunes  -
'Potato Picker', 'Serendipity' - fitted nicely in between Mseleku and
Thompson. An energetic performer, either at the keyboard or the curious peck
horn, Bates' quartet is a pocket version of the tumultuous 18 piece
Delightful Precipice and swung precariously. Indeed, it would have been
better to hear more of his wistful meandering material and less of compere
'personality' Jools Holland, whose facile remarks and boogie-woogie
tinkering filled in the gaps.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: A rare soprano talent - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISS Upshaw's Wigmore recital on Thursday offered rare and complicated
pleasure. For one thing, her heart-tugging high soprano prompts epithets
like 'natural' and 'unaffected', when it is nothing so simple as that. She
is an enormously intelligent artist, and any native wood-notes wild that she
emits are no product of innocent spontaneity. For another, she plainly
chafes at the limits of the high-soprano soubrette repertoire (she is an
enchanting Despina, and I long to hear her Susanna): here, she took on
Schumann's op. 39 Liederkreis - the opulent Eichendorff cycle, not the
bleaker Heine (op. 24) - which might seem to favour her kind of voice only
in a few songs.
More of that below. She had begun with three of Haydn's English songs,
delivered with bright American vowels and as charmingly as expected.
Probably her pianist Gilbert Kalish made even more of an impression, finding
original dramatic force in every accompaniment. (Contemporary music fans
have long admired his recordings, but over here we know too little of his
Classical work.) After the interval, Miss Upshaw was touching, funny,
imaginative and precise in five of Mussorgsky's Nursery songs - what can she
possibly have got against the other two? - and revelled in a batch of the
most familiar Charles Ives songs, nicely varied.
They concluded with lullabies, all limpid and lovely: Montsalvatge,
Szymanowski, Falla, Brahms - and what may have been the first performance of
an unaccompanied and unpublished one that Debussy composed for a play. Miss
Upshaw remarked that it struck her as un-Debussyish, more like a troubadour
song; it struck me as a close cousin of Melisande's Act 3 ballad, but anyhow
she sculpted it beautifully. Somebody, somewhere, is surely pleading with
her to learn the role of Melisande, and Mozart's Constanze too.
As for the Liederkreis: the slight mismatch between the Upshaw timbre and
tessitura, and our conventional expectations of a ripe mezzo or baritone
sound, threw her unwinking insights into high relief. 'Die Stille' was
natural territory, of course - winsome staccato, with a touch of irony; but
where she might have just floated 'Mondnacht' exquisitely (she controls long
lines to perfection, and rhythmic periods too) her visionary purpose drew
tears. 'Waldesgesprach' became a genuinely chilling vignette. There were
dark, penetrating tremors in 'Zwielicht' and 'Im Walde' as well, the better
to set off the rapturous final outburst of 'Fruhlingsnacht'.
It is some time since I have heard any live performer - even those more
'naturally' suited to the music - attack every song in this cycle with such
searching fervour. In his lean, pointed way, Kalish matched her. More
generous pedal-cushion might have flattered her voice better, but his
forceful articulacy was of a piece with her laser-sharp intentions, clothed
though they were in an air of sweet simplicity. These American artists mean
serious business; they do not forget Old Europe, but they do not indulge it
either.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Fragonard inspired by La Fontaine - Elizabeth Mortimer
enjoys scenes from a libertine age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELIZABETH MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PETIT Palais has just completed an operation which has never been done
before, and which it confidently claims will never be done again: the
restoration of its set of 57 pen and wash drawings by Fragonard illustrating
a splendid handwritten copy in two volumes of La Fontaine's Contes et
Nouvelles. Since they had to be unstuck from the albums, it was decided to
put them on show, setting them in the context of contemporary drawing and
book illustration using the museum's own resources. The result is both
delightful and startling.
These stories started their published life under royal disfavour. Their
subject matter, inspired by Ariosto and Boccaccio, with a strong dash of
Rabelais, is lewd, satirical, anti-clerical and funny. But once the pious
reign of the Sun King came to an end, it became increasingly clear that La
Fontaine's Contes provided a canon of instantly recognisable scenes for a
more libertine age (just as Ovid's Metamorphoses had provided culturally
correct licence for artists to paint high-brow hanky-panky on Mount Olympus
or in Arcadia in the preceding century). Paintings were made to hang in
salons and boudoirs, and several illustrated editions were brought out in
the course of the 18th century, including one with no text.
It is not known who commissioned the Petit Palais Fragonard illustrations,
nor when they were made. They first came to light in 1840, more than 30
years after the artist's death. Some of the same compositions had been
tidied up for engraving in an edition which was announced in 1789, but was
overtaken by events. Scholars now believe the drawings were probably made
around 1765-75.
Fragonard's dated works are scanty, and his drawings much copied by forgers,
but these are clearly genuine, and of exquisite quality. The technique is
the same throughout: a drawing is made in pierre noire, then a counterproof
made by pressing it against a new sheet on which the image appears in
reverse. The artist them elaborates it in bistre (a brown pigment made of
soot, water and gum), using pen and brush to produce the final version.
Of course they were made to be looked at from close to, as you turned the
pages of the book. What strikes the viewer at once, seeing them hanging at
eye level at regular intervals in a series of fairly large rooms, is the
pictorial quality of the compositions. The masses of light and shadow and
the proportions of the figures in their settings make them seem like small
paintings rather than drawings yet they are sketched and painted with such
freedom that they seem completely spontaneous. The effects of light -
lamplight, firelight and daylight, direct and reflected - are both subtly
observed and deliberately theatrical. Sunshine filters through leaves and
surrounds a pair of reclining lovers in an airy haze, as their badinage is
interrupted by a peasant on a branch above, asking if they have seen his
lost calf. The glum hunched figure of a husband, sitting moodily in bed
after being caught on the point of seducing a supposed serving maid (really
his wife's lover in disguise), is lit by a flash of light, while the
successful conspirators head for the door discreetly wrapped in shadow.
Beds feature largely, and come in all shapes and sizes, from the hermit's
pallet to the canopied four-poster. Their curtains half conceal countless
substitutions and subterfuges - including the administering of an enema to a
long suffering lover by his mistress's governess - while their swinging
draperies give rhythm and weight to the design.
The poses of the protagonists are varied and expressive. Modest ingenues
undress at the bidding of corrupt clerics. Parents walk in on incautious
lovers. A youth crowns himself with rushes to seduce a bathing beauty by
claiming to be a river god. Perrette scares off the Devil by raising her
skirt; and an abbess, summoned to rebuke an erring sister, coifs herself
with her lover's breeches by mistake in the dark.
Many of the stories deal with that sadly declining sport, cuckolding jealous
husbands - preferably with their unwitting connivance. They are not for the
prudish. The relevant extracts are quoted in full on the labels, but just as
La Fontaine never quite spells it out, Fragonard is always erotically
suggestive rather than obscene.
The exhibition includes illustrations to the same stories and others by
minor artists, who although charming are completely outshone by Fragonard.
Among them are some curiosities, in particular several picture sales
catalogues and a couple of guide books to Paris - prototypes of the modern
illustrated version, crammed with marginal sketches of architectural detail
and street scenes. They are fascinating source books for art historians,
giving a clear idea of lost paintings known to have been in famous
collections.
There are also are finished pen and wash compositions by Greuze and David;
but an unexpected discovery is a fine group of drawings by Joseph-Marie
Vien, future neo-classicist and teacher of David, done while he was studying
at the French Academy in Rome in 1748. They are the record of a sumptuous
masquerade or costumed procession which the French students devised as their
contribution to the Roman carnival that year, on the theme of the Sultan's
Caravan to Mecca. The Grand Vizir, the Aga of the Janissaries, the Mufti,
the pashas, eunuchs, sultanas and ambassadors are set down in all their
finery, a tribute to the students' powers of invention and also to the
excellence of their drawing masters.
Indeed, it was thanks to the solid founding of all art on drawing at the
Academy in Paris and at its offshoot in Rome that the artists of the 18th
wielded chalks, pens and brushes with such unequalled distinction.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Restoration work completed on Benozzo Gozzoli's
frescoes in the 'Magi Chapel'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Restoration work has been completed on one of the great masterpieces of
renaissance painting - Benozzo Gozzoli's frescoes in the 'Magi Chapel' of
the Medici Riccardi Palace in Florence. The frescoes, executed between
1459-63 and depicting the procession of the Three Kings and the company of
Adoring Angels, will be open to the public appropriately in time for
Christmas.
The restorers have been able to remove the dirt of ages and several
indifferent restorations. In so doing they have managed to re-establish the
magnificent delicacy of Gozzoli's style and his rich colouring. In these
frescoes green is one of the essential colours. But because the chapel is
enclosed within the palace, the original frescoes have been protected from
light and this has prevented the normal - and irremediable - conversion of
green colouring to brown.
Among the restorers' discoveries were two blue seraphim in the sky,
cancelled out in earlier restoration, as well as enhancement of the
background, uncovering previously hidden vegetation. The portraits of
Gozzoli's contemporaries in the Magi's procession, including young Lorenzo
the Magnificent, can also been seen more clearly.
The restoration concludes Florence's year celebrating the 500th anniversary
of Lorenzo the Magnificent's death. The bulk of the restoration work costing
over lire 1bn was financed by Banca Toscana. Given the tiny size of the
chapel, the public will be limited to 15 at a time.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Arts: Traditionally male - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIO counter-feminism I detected last week takes a gentler line in
Radio 4's new series, This Happy Breed, in which Jennifer Holden explores
communities traditionally male. Her first probe was a week's trip on board
HMS York, on an exercise that included a simulated action. From captain to
ordinary-seamen, she found a general contentment. With female company
confined usually to a distant home or to current ports of call, with
disciplinary standards those of a boarding school, the ratings think of
themselves as little boys. Only one confessed to discontent.
It is hard to think that fundamentally masculine assemblies will behave in
their normal way when visited by inquisitive ladies. The best we can hope
for is a rough description of what they see. Holden's visit next Wednesday
is to a Benedictine monastery in north Scotland - not all that different,
but safer, and not so much leave.
There are few better judges of this happy breed than Robert Louis Stevenson,
though as we saw in the Saturday Classic Serials on Radio 4, currently short
stories, he did not rate them all notably high. Last week's The Wrong Box
gave us Finlay Welsh, fine as mean, crooked Morris Finsbury. This week, in
The Suicide Club, that canny essay in delayed revelation, Crawford Logan and
James MacPherson as Florizel and Geraldine cunningly, and not quite
ethically, deprived the President (Robin Thomson) of his lethal club. Both
plays used an effective consciously dramatic style under Patrick Rayner's
direction.
An even less admirable hero was Ben in Radio 4's Monday play, Guy Slater's
At Sea on Inya Lake. He was 18 in 1962, son of the British Council's rep in
Burma, and in love with Sally Win Maung. Thirty years later he revisits
Burma to interview the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Daw Aung San Suu Kit.
Sally, now married to a Burmese, matters more to him, and he seduces her in
her married home. It was good to be reminded of the Burmese situation, but
really this was only a sentimental love tale. Slater is a TV producer, so he
likes short, undeveloped scenes and alternates them between periods - not a
good idea for radio, no matter what director Sue Wilson can do.
Who are the heroes in Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing? We have the choice
between a married couple, lovers, characters in good plays, characters in
bad plays or the bad play's author, who is serving time in gaol as the
result of trying to burn the wreath on the Cenotaph. At the centre of events
are dramatist Henry (Clive Francis) and his actress wife Annie (Emily
Richard). They survive a modest marital problem, but retain opposing
attitudes to the leftist wreath-burner.
Such results are actually less important than the argument so sharply set
out in the sympathetic dialogue, in episodes allowed to develop besides
setting the scene. Stoppard's exchanges can convey their meaning at one
remove; we are not really concerned with Swiss holidays, or crudites, or
sixtyish pop music, but we are think we are until we realise we are dealing
with something else. High marks to Gordon House, for both adaptation and
direction of a co-production with the World Service.
Also on Radio 3, on Saturday, we had John Allen's The Last Viking - not
about the Danes joining the EEC but about a Norseman in Greenland, in 1492,
a year as telling as 1962. Ingolf, the last Viking in their colony, is
hammered by the voices of dead Norsemen who had tried to live in the region,
unsympathetic except to the 'little brown buggers', as Ingolf calls the
Inuits. We had a superficial view of the tales of Eirick the Red and the
first sight of Vinland (hence the date's importance), but not much of a
story.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Books: Back to the classics both ancient and modern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHENEVER someone publishes a new book' said the poet Samuel Rogers, 'I read
an old one'.
IN THESE busy days when there is far too much of every kind to read, it is a
comforting principle by which to live. If you adopt it you find, for
example, that Proust knocks most contemporary novelists into a cocked hat.
Yet it is only recently - 1989 - that French scholars have established a
truly definitive text of A La Recherche du Temps Perdu.
Remembrance of Things Past was how it was always known in English in the
translation by Scott Moncrieff. That translation was somewhat prosy and not
strictly accurate. The late Terence Kilmartin, for many years literary
editor of The Observer, did a fine job tidying it up and publishing a
revised version under the old title in 1981. Now DJ Enright has gone through
the novel again in Kilmartin's version checking it against the latest
textual scholarship and he has given us In Search of Lost Time - not a new
English version but rather a revision of a revision in six attractive
volumes from Chatto &amp; Windus at Pounds 15.00 each. (A completely new version
starting from scratch is on the way from the American translator Richard
Howard).
Proust died before he had finished tinkering with the last volume, Time
Regained and it still contains one or two inconsistencies. It is bound
together here with the useful A Guide to Proust, compiled by Kilmartin and
has wife Joanna; this is not merely a Who's Who of all the characters, but
also provides a gazetteer of the places and an elucidation of the real
people mentioned.
The present is an opportune time for anyone aiming to build up their own
collection of the main authors of modernism. Bloomsbury's new Classics
series might be the place to start. This is a sturdy, square-cut
pocket-sized hardback series at Pounds 9.95 a volume. Judicious selections
have been made from the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, Gerard
Manley Hopkins, DH Lawrence and WB Yeats. The latter's poetry has been
selected by Ian Hamilton, who has clearly had a hard task knowing what to
leave out. A companion series of modern fiction contains Jean Rhys's Wide
Sargasso Sea, Julian Barnes's Flaubert's Parrot and titles by Michael
Ondaatje, Jeanette Wintersen, Paul Bailey, Margaret Atwood, John Irving.
We are also seeing the splendid renaissance in a completely new and most
ravishing format - 100 years after the first volumes appeared - of that
pioneering series of essential reading, Everyman's Library. A wide range of
new editions from Shakespeare to Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (Pounds
7.99) have appeared.
It is impressive to see, for instance, the whole of Ford Madox Ford's
trilogy, Parade's End, in one volume at Pounds 10.99 with an introduction by
Malcolm Bradbury. In the same Everyman format, Yeats's poetry is reissued in
its entirety in one volume, re-printing all the individual collections in
chronological order. It occupies some 868 pages, with introduction and notes
by Daniel Albright of the University of Rochester, NY. It is excellent value
at Pounds 10.99, but, unlike Hamilton's volume on Yeats, you would have
difficulty slipping it into your pocket.
Anyone wishing to observe how Yeats's poetry and the work of his modernist
contemporaries - Pound, Eliot, Virginia Woolf - was originally greeted in
the staid columns of The Times Literary Supplement, may do so in the first
of the new TLS Companion series from Harper Collins, The Modern Movement,
edited by John Gross (Pounds 8.99). This not only prints the major reviews
in full, but also lets you into the secret of who wrote them. The companion
volume on Communism is edited by the current editor of the TLS, Ferdinand
Mount.
Martin Green's Children of the Sun, now in paperback from Pimlico at Pounds
10.00, is a fascinating long view of 'decadence' in English literature after
1918 with special reference to Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, Brian Howard and
others of that generation. And to make an end - back to Ireland with all the
autobiographical writings of Sean O'Casey in two volumes, Autobiographies I
and II, in Macmillan's Papermac series at Pounds 12.99 each. The great Irish
playwright was also a robust writer of memoirs.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Books: Bait for anglers - Fishing books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT remarkable man and fine angling writer, Arthur Ransome, described
shaking hands with the man who had caught the record English carp thus: 'he
looked as if he had been in heaven and hell and had nothing more to hope
from life'. Never having met Chris Yates, I cannot testify as to the look in
his eye. But I do know that he, too, held the English carp record. And, more
to the point, he is about the best writer on fishing today - on a par with
Ransome himself.
Yates has given us two classics, Casting At The Sun and The Deepening Pool,
and if his latest book, The Secret Carp (Merlin Unwin Pounds 16.95), is not
in quite the same class, it is still a furlong in front of anything else. It
is a meditation on, and celebration of, the dark, tree-shaded pools where
great carp bask and glide - and, occasionally, take the angler's bait. We
share with the author the vigil by the water, broken at last by the
vanishing of the float and the fish's tearing run. The prose is limpid, the
humour understated, the effect magical.
From the same publishers comes Conrad Voss Bark's History of the Fly Fishing
(Merlin Unwin Pounds 25), an entertaining canter through the evolution of
the sport. The Chinese, we are told, used a kingfisher's feather to lure
fish several thousand years BC. A wily lot, the Chinese, although it would
be nice to know what they caught. The book is sprinkled with similar
nuggets, and Voss Bark wears his learning lightly.
Sidney Vines has produced a large and handsome study, The English Chalk
Streams (Batsford Pounds 19.99), which fulfills most expectations. He is as
informative about the little jewels - like the Meon and the Frome - as on
the Test and Kennet, and is commendably sane on contentious issues, such as
stocking and overfishing. His assertion, though, that Skues, Halford and
Sawyer were greater writers than Grey of Falloden, because they were more
observant, strikes me as absurd.
Serious students of angling literature should be grateful to Justin Knowles
of The Fly Fisher's Classic Library for continuing to exhume the gems of
bygone ages. Among this year's delights have been Chaytor's Letters To A
Salmon Fisher's Sons, Plunket Greene's Where The Bright Waters Meet, Grey's
Fly Fishing, and Bainbridge's Fly Fisher's Guide. They cost between Pounds
31 and Pounds 39 each, and are available from the Fly Fisher's Classic
Library, Bovey Tracey, Newton Abbot, Devon.
The Big Fish (Robinson Pounds 14.95) is a highly entertaining collection of
monster stories edited by Arthur Oglesby and Lucy Money Coutts. Some are
familiar, but many are not, and all will give pleasure. I particularly
enjoyed Jim Corbett's tales of mahseer fishing in India and Byron Roger's
improbable and ludicrous account of the capture of a colossal sturgeon in
Wales.
Even more fun is The Irish Game Angler's Anthology (Country House Pounds
17.95). Ireland's people and its lakes and rivers inspires the story teller,
and the editor, Niall Fallon, has done a splendid job in bringing the best
of them together. Many were English - Grey, JW Hills, GD Luard, Frank Barker
and others, are all here. So are the great Irish writers, among them the
judge, TC Kingsmill Moore. I love the commentary of an envious neighbour on
the judge's capture of four spring salmon from the Slaney: 'Good, Kingie is
in a fish.' 'My God, the judge has got another'. 'The bloody fellow has
hooked a third]'. 'This is too much. The bastard has a fourth.'
Bryn Hammond's Halcyon Days (Swan Hill Pounds 18.95) is more of a series of
essays than a true anthology; although he quotes at length from other
writers to illustrate his subjects. It is a novel and interesting approach,
somewhat incoherently realised.
The oddest and most fascinating book I have read this year, by a wide
margin, is Down The Crazy River by Paul Boote and Jeremy Wade (Sangha Books,
17 Stockton Road, Swindon, Pounds 18.95). It is an account of obsessive
quests for the mighty mahseer of India, and the even mightier goliath tiger
fish of central Africa. I, too, have dreamed of pursuing these fabled
species - and having read of the hideous discomforts and horrors endured by
these fearless adventurers, I am relieved I got no further than that. The
book is riveting, although it would have benefitted greatly from ruthless
pruning.
Two other appealing curiosities are Michael Marshall's Tyne Waters (Witherby
Pounds 18.99), and Lake Vyrnwy - The Story Of A Sporting Hotel, published at
Pounds 12.95 by the authors, Sir John Baynes and George Westropp. The first
charts the extraordinary story of the Tyne's transformation from open sewer
to top salmon river; the other makes me want to do what I have never done,
namely fish for trout in Wales .
Finally, a brief mention for An Angler For All Seasons (Merlin Unwin Pounds
16.95), which is a selection from the writings of HT Sheringham, edited by
me. I will say no more than that there is very little of me in it, and a lot
of him, and that he was an even better writer than Chris Yates.

EDGAR ALLAN POE, HIS LIFE AND LEGACY by Jeffrey Meyers John Murray Pounds
25.00, 348 pages
EDGAR POE grew up expecting to be rich. His parents, travelling actors in
post-Independence United States, died when he was a boy. Poe was informally
adopted by a Virginia merchant who hoped to shape him into an heir who would
be suitable, in due time, to take over the business and the slaves. Allan's
name was inserted into his own as a sign that he had a new father.
Poe was given the liberal education of a Southern gentleman, but no money.
When he tried to eke out his income at the University of Virginia by
speculative gambling, he was forced to leave. He then enlisted as a soldier
and became a serjeant. Allan rescued him back to gentility, arranging for
him to go to the officer school at West Point, with the prospect of a
secure, financially independent and honourable career. But, with the dour
persistence of his Scottish ancestors, Allan again demanded love and
gratitude but paid Poe a hopelessly inadequate allowance. As the problems
mounted, he refused to settle his son's debts, closed his ears to anguished
appeals, and stood self-righteously by when he went to jail.
In 1831 Poe took matters into his own hands. He deliberately refused
military orders every day for a month, was court-martialled, declined to
offer a an explanation, and was dismissed from the service. He had at last
broken free, but the disgrace cut him off from his family and his prospects.
He was an orphan again.
For the rest of his life Poe earned an uncertain income as magazine editor
and short story writer, seldom out of difficulty and sometimes crushed by
worry. He swung between care and recklessness, abstinence and binge. When he
was 27 he married Virginia Clemms, then aged 14, who declared in the oath
that she was 21. They had been living together for some months. The early
signs of her tuberculosis were already visible, the coughing of blood
followed, and she died a few years later.
Poe - in what was to become a tradition among American men of genius - drank
himself to death when he was 40. When asked what things harmed a writer, he
is said to have replied 'Politics, women, drink, money, ambition. And the
lack of politics, women, drink, money, and ambition.'
Externally Poe's life was as romantic and as doomed as that of any invented
Byronic hero. But it was not enough. Poe pretended to have set off to fight
in the Greek War of Independence and to have visited St Petersburg. Other
incidents merge fact and fantasy. Some of the erudite, exotic, wonderfully
evocative, quotations from Italian authors with which he prefaced his tales
turn out to have been his own composition.
In his excellent new biography, Edgar Allan Poe, His Life and Legacy,
Jeffrey Meyers reconstructs the life with unobtrusive skill, demonstrating
but not exaggerating the extent to which Poe adapted his own experience in
his poems and stories. In a final section he traces the development of Poe's
reputation. The book is well researched, judicious, fluent, scholarly and
readable.
Poe is one of the fathers of the modern detective story. The conventions of
the tradition from Sherlock Holmes to Inspector Morse are already present -
the admiring matter-of-fact narrator, the misleading clues, the bumbling
official force, the sharp easily forgiving detective who prefers justice to
the law - although not all in the same story.
But in the tales of the imagination Poe created something far more
mysterious, a world of enchantment, terror, desire, and impending disaster.
Long before Freud wrote about the unconscious, Edgar Allan Poe had ventured
into the dark cellars and vaults of the mind. Poe is sad, strange, and
unique, and in Meyers he has found a worthy biographer.

A CONFUSION OF PROPHETS: VICTORIAN AND EDWARDIAN ASTROLOGY by Patrick Curry
Collins &amp; Brown Pounds 18, 192 pages
ASTROLOGY slipped from its zenith in the mid-17th century to its nadir in
the rationalist 18th. But what happened in the sentimental 19th century?
Patrick Curry has filled A Confusion of Prophets with bewildering
information; but he does so indiscriminately, so it takes a soothsayer to
divine the salient facts.
Curry offers five short biographies. John Varley (1778-1842) was friendly
with William Blake in the 1820s. He used the poet's visionary bouts for
collaborative spiritual research, conjuring Wat Tyler, Richard Coeur de Lion
and Moses from a zodiacal past. Varley suggested the subject, Blake drew it;
these drawings of 'zodiacal physiognomy' remained undiscovered until 1989.
Varley combined knowledge of individuals with specific, unavoidable
prediction. He impressed other luminaries: Ruskin, Turner and John Sell
Cotman. Bulwer Lytton consulted Varley about Disraeli's future, and received
the safe prognostication: 'he will bequeath a repute out of all proportion
to the opinion now entertained of his intellect, even by those who think
highly of it.'
After Varley comes Robert 'Raphael' Smith (b1795), occultist, astrologer,
and editor of various prognostic rags in the early 1820s. On the back of The
Prophetic Messenger, which reached sales of over 250,000 by 1830, 'Raphael'
wrote the 1828 Manual of Astrology. This was his annus mirabilis, for
although 'Raphael' failed to predict his own death four years later, he
reported an incognito visit from George IV, at which 'DEATH WAS FORETOLD
within the short space of two years]' George died on June 26 1830.
Royal death was the astrologer's livelihood. The full moon in March 1861
prompted Richard 'Zadkiel' Morrison (1795-1874) to predict: 'the position of
Saturn in the third degree of Virgo in May, following upon this lunation,
will be very evil for all persons born on or near the August 26; among the
sufferers I regret to see the worthy Prince Consort of these realms.' Albert
obliged by dying on December 14. This made Morrison's reputation and
Zadkiel's Almanac sold steadily during the 1870s and 1880s.
The great populist, however, was Alan Leo (1860-1917): karmic astrologer and
luminary of the Theosophical Society; the theosophist who took the hand of
palmist Ada Phillips, and headed for a predictable married future. Leo
founded the Astrological Society (at noon on January 14 1895).
Leo is the most modern of Curry's quintet. His lasting contribution to
astrology was the notion that attitude of mind towards events was key, not
the events in themselves.

FRANK CAPRA: THE CATASTROPHE OF SUCCESS by Joseph McBride Faber Pounds 25,
734 pages
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? by Michael Caine Century Pounds 16.99, 475 pages
THESE TWO books, both about rags-to-riches film careers, carry on a dialogue
with each other even in their titles. 'What price glory in the movies?' they
ask, though in only one of the books does the subject himself raise the
question.
There are different approaches to deprecating success. While Michael Caine
goes for the I'm-still-a-fish-porter's-son and-never-mind-the-Ferrari
approach, Capra's chronicler Joseph McBride sees the director of It Happened
One Night, Lost Horizon and It's A Wonderful Life as a man who carried a
ten-ton chip on his shoulder. Caine glories in his background; Capra spent
60 years trying to hide it.
Indeed the Sicilian-born film-maker is famous for writing the most
untrustworthy autobiography in Hollywood history, The Name Above The Title.
Much of McBride's perceptive, well-researched book is devoted to replacing
Capra's self-mythologising factoids with the real, unpleasanter truth. He
was clearly a racist. He was clearly a social climber who despised his own
family. (Read the opening chapter of his disastrous visit home to Sicily in
1977.) And beneath the populist filibustering of films like Mr Deeds Goes To
Town and Mr Smith Goes To Washington lurks an intolerant snob who in real
life used shows of emotion mainly to manipulate the emotions of others.
In his very first job, newsboy Capra made sure he sold his pile each day by
arranging fake fights with his brother and then bursting into tears,
complaining to passers-by that he was being beaten up for not selling all
his newspapers. 'Right then and there he got rid of them all,' recalls that
brother.
Later, Capra turned his talent for plangency to profitable use as the great
sentmentalist of New Deal cinema. He was the inventor of 'Capracorn': the
man who with screenwriter Robert Riskin created the hayseed hero who could
conquer bureaucracy and corruption. Incarnated on screen by Jimmy Stewart,
he would later be emulated in real life by Jimmy Carter.
If success became the catastrophe of McBride's title, it was because Capra
himself failed all the tests his heroes passed. Carrying resentment of his
birth and background through every phase of life, he horded magnanimity like
a miser. Mean of praise to his collaborators (especially Riskin), he was
also mean of courage when the McCarthy era came. Though the witch-hunting
Senator from Wisconsin would seem a real-life ringer for one of Capra's own
movie villains - those who used the letter of the law to beat the spirit of
the poor - Capra self-protectively became McCarthy's propagandist.
For the Capra fan, the anguishes mount up. He was a bad husband, a so-so
father, a fair-weather friend. (Riskin's widow never forgave him for not
visiting the ailing screenwriter on his deathbed). Can we still see those
starry-eyed comedies with the innocent delight we did before? Or should we
just grit our teeth and minds, insisting that the song is what counts not
the singer.
Michael Caine has all the charm that Capra appeared to lack. But then he has
to: he goes in front of the camera. What's It All About? is a 470 pages of
anecdotal extemporising, some of which we have heard before on chat shows
and 'Evenings with Michael Caine'. But the book helps to define why we like
this actor on screen. We sense a busy, funny, retentive mind behind that
runic face with the hooded eyes.
Solely excepting Sean Connery, who was Bonded into stardom by a
world-beating spy saga, Caine has proved the most durable and exportable
British film star since the 1960s. He has the star's perfect equipment. He
is always the same, but that 'same' is elusive and absorbent enough to
attract different roles. He has been a drawling British officer (Zulu), a
poker-faced cockney spy (The Ipcress File), a cross-dressing homicidal
psychiatrist (Dressed To Kill), a con man in multiple disguise (Sleuth) and
a hapless mid-life adulterer (Hannah And Her Sisters).
After reading What's It All About you begin to know the secret to this
changeless versatility. Caine lies back and lets back life happen; then he
gets up and gleefully annotates the text.
Do not be fooled by the comatose look. Those halfmast eyelids are due to an
incurable disease called Blefora. Not a lot of people know this, but we take
Caine's word for it: as for the funny story of Cliff Robertson's
Filippino-carved Oscar (p264), of Shelley Winters and her nose-impaling
corset (p184), of Caine going to bed with Mia Farrow while Woody Allen and
Andre Previn looked on (p431), of Caine trying to cheer up Mrs Thatcher
after her fall (p467) and of Caine falling in love with his future wife on
the strength of a TV coffee commercial (p286). Just stories, perhaps. But
with Caine, unlike Capra, we like the teller as much as the tales.

WILLIAM CAMROSE, GIANT OF FLEET STREET by his son, Lord Hartwell Weidenfeld
&amp; Nicolson Pounds 17.99, 362 pages
THE NAMES Beaverbrook and Rothermere will live for ever, if only because
their daft ideas and political scheming provoked Stanley Baldwin into the
immortal piece of invective against the press lords: 'power without
responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages'.
Much less is known today about their contemporary, Lord Camrose, perhaps
because villains are so much more agreeable to write about than a man who
was wise and honourable and built sound businesses.
Yet a strong case can be made out that of the three, Camrose's achievements
were the greatest. He not only saved two great newspapers from likely
oblivion - the Sunday Times and the Daily Telegraph - but also gave a
platform for Winston Churchill when Churchill found himself 'without an
office, without a seat, without a party and without an appendix'. To Lord
Camrose's accomplishments must also be added the ownership of the Financial
Times for a significant period and the creation of the 'Men and Matters'
column, for some reason now called 'Observer'.
The biography of William Camrose by his son Lord Hartwell, former chairman
of the Daily Telegraph, should serve to bring into focus for those not born
at the time how one of the great newspaper empires was created in a single
generation by the three Berry brothers from Merthyr Tydfil.
Of course there is a danger in sons writing about fathers that the account
will either be too fulsome or too bitter. 'It is a filial but not I think a
sycophantic book' says Lord Hartwell, who adds that he hopes it will seem to
be the sort of book an independent author would have written had he had
access to all Hartwell's sources.
That is exactly what has been achieved.
For example, after Chamberlain told the House of Commons he had been happy
to receive assurances from the German government of its desire for a
peaceful solution to the Czechosolovakian dispute, Hartwell has this to say
of Camrose: 'the following day Chamberlain saw William and gave him the same
'sunny-Jim' story for which William, like the House of Commons, seems to
have fallen'.
The book will be of interest to many constituencies. It is fascinating as a
personal story of adventure, coincidence and achievement. When he was 13,
William was entered by his school in a competition to precis a lecture on
pessimism. The judge, the editor of the Merthyr Times, said: 'this boy
should take up journalism'. Many years later Camrose was in a position to
appoint the precis judge, William Hadley, editor of the Sunday Times.
Then there is the world of advertising at the turn of the century, and
William's first business venture - the launch of a trade publication, the
Advertising World. William and his brother Gomer went after ads at Pounds 6
a page, wearing overcoat s with a special large inside pocket to keep the
specimen copy of the magazine clean and flat - and make sure that it
'doesn't give us away as canvassers when we go into an office'.
His handwritten memoranda to his editors revealed a proprietor who cared
about every word that appears in his papers - and was clearly a sub-editor
of genius. 'A house is not a mansion nowadays even when it belongs to the
Marquis of Londonderry' he wrote. And rather more significantly, he attacked
a leader that appeared to be like a Conservative Central Office statement:
'What the leader does . . . is to say in the most unctuous way that we will
agree with whatever the government may do', Camrose wrote pointedly.
The biography also has a great deal to say on the abdication crisis - and no
less than five chapters on appeasement, plus several appendices.
And this, however, is the main problem. While the book begins at the
beginning and ends properly with the death of William Camrose, in between it
is not easy to read. Chronology is abandoned and there are many detailed
descriptions of the politics and the politicians of the period without the
book's hero managing to get much of a look in. But just when there seems to
be a danger of the reader coming to the end without really knowing enough
about the man, the final chapter reverts to the personal. When Camrose died,
Harold Nicolson wrote in his diary of the flags at half-mast in Fleet
Street, and added: 'he was a staunch friend and wise counsellor. He showed
that one could be a press lord and a gentleman'.
There is one final point that has to be made. It is a point that the book
does not state, but is nonetheless implicit: it is that there seems to be
cycles of decline and renaissance in newspapers and, as William Berry and
Conrad Black proved conclusively, it usually takes an outsider to end a
cycle of decline.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Food &amp; Drink: The essence of Islay malt whiskies - It takes
more than new technology to distil good Scotch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IAN HENDERSON, who manages both the Laphroaig and Ardbeg distilleries on the
whisky island of Islay, off the Scottish coast, tells a charming story about
a group of Japanese technicians who visited there.
'They were very bright lads,' says Henderson. 'They had put their doctorates
well behind them and had come to learn about whisky distilling first-hand.'
Every day for two weeks, they tailed Henderson, his stillmen and
warehousemen, observing the process from start to finish.
First, they saw the steeping of the barley to transform it into malt. They
watched the malt drying in the peat kilns and the preparation of the
porridge-like 'mash'; the sweet 'wort' being turned into a strong beer
called 'wash'; the wash distilled once to make the 'low wines' and then a
second time to make the clear spirit that was young whisky. Finally, they
went out into the warehouses where the spirit was run off into old bourbon
hogsheads or the occasional sherry butt.
The Japanese fed everything into their computers. After two weeks, a worried
member of the party requested a meeting with Henderson. They were sorry to
have to say this, they told him, but they were now absolutely certain that
something was being hidden from them: 'Please, when is it that you add 'the
essence'?'
I sympathise. The basic process of making whisky is not hard to understand.
For centuries, the roughest Irish peasant has known how to do it on an
exposed outcrop with a few potatoes and a kettle.
Great whisky, however, is a little more complicated. Much depends on the
shape of the stills, and few distillers can offer an adequate explanation of
why the distillery decided on a squat, onion-shaped still, or some more
elegant form with a thin, tapering stem. The one, they tell us, will make a
heavy, even coarse, whisky; the other a light, refined spirit.
Until comparatively recently, Islay was a remote place with a wild,
Gaelic-speaking population who responded only (and even then only
occasionally) to the authority of the exciseman.
Jim McEwen, who manages the Bowmore distillery in Islay's 'capital,'
remembers the days when the distillery played host to all sorts of strays
from the hills.
'They would take their cups and drop them into the 'deoch' (the strong beer
or wash which is called 'Jo' in Speyside), then settle down by one of the
many coal or peat fires which burned in the distillery and sing Gaelic
songs. When the exciseman returned from his tea, he would chase them away,'
McEwen said.
As a child, he and his classmates would steal lumps of coal from the
distillery and carry them back to his parents' house. At 15, he started work
in the cooperage. One of his jobs was to prepare the 'drams' for the thirsty
workers. Thinking they would appreciate something special, he dipped into a
sherry butt to find a particularly sweet, old whisky. But the workers turned
up their noses at the stuff. For them, the only drink was 'white' whisky,
straight from the still at a fiendish 65`.
With eight surviving large distillery buildings dating from the 19th century
(a ninth, Port Charlotte, was closed in the 1930s and the buildings
subsequently demolished or turned over to other uses), Islay whiskies
clearly were valued in the last century.
Until fairly late in the 19th century, Islay was something of a tax haven
for distillers by virtue of its remoteness. Another possible factor in its
rise was its proximity to Ireland (it is just 18 miles to Antrim).
Irish whiskey was rather more famous than Scotch a century ago and it is
feasible that Islay malts were passed off as Irish ones. Islay must have
come into its own, however, with the beginning of whisky blends at the end
of the last century.
Blenders appreciated Islay spirits for their 'peat reek.' The peat bogs of
the island always have been a cheap source of fuel, and malt kilned over
peat will develop a heavy, smoky character which will contribute a distinct
taste to the whisky. Both Bowmore and Laphroaig kiln about 20 per cent of
their malt. The rest, along with all the peated malt for the other
distilleries, comes from the maltings at Port Ellen at the south end of the
Island.
A little peat goes a long way when it is expressed in parts per million: a
great bruiser of an Islay malt such as Ardbeg will specify 50 parts per
million. Its stablemate, Laphroaig, requires 35, at which level the
peatiness will still be there but some of the delicacy of the spirit will
come through. Bowmore treads the middle way with 25-30 in the pursuit of
elegance. As for Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich, their specifications are
1-2 parts per million for the former and none for the latter.
At the maltings, they assured me that Bruichladdich would still have some
peat character, just from the peat smoke travelling round the maltings. That
not withstanding, at these levels both Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich could
be described as Speyside in style.
That leaves three. Port Ellen closed its doors in 1983 - although bottles of
its exceptionally fine malt are still available from specialists. Both the
remaining United Distillers' plants, Lagavulin and Caol Ila, used to ask for
45 parts per million. Three months ago, however, the instruction reached
Port Ellen to reduce the peating of the malt to 35, the same level as Allied
Distillers' Laphroaig. I was told this at the maltings.
Elsewhere on the island, I found few people were aware of United's decision
to alter radically the style of its whiskies. Many thought I had been given
privileged information. At Laphroaig, Ian Henderson had been told of the
move but was reluctant to offer an explanation.
Whereas Caol Ila is used chiefly for blending - a good deal goes into
Johnnie Walker - Lagavulin is marketed widely as an exquisite 16-year-old.
For the next 16 years, nothing will affect the taste, but what then?
Lagavulin is also the mainstay of the White Horse blend. Was the decision to
tone down Lagavulin taken with White Horse in mind?
In terms of value for money, the Lagavulin 16-year-old is one of the best
old malts on the market, with Threshers selling it at Pounds 22.99 a bottle.
Laphroaig's delicately fruity 15-year-old is more than Pounds 10 more.
Neither the rather angular Caol Ila nor the massive, robust Ardbeg is
distributed widely, which - in the case of the latter, at least - is a pity.
Now that United has begun to change the peat levels on its whisky, Ardbeg
assumes an even greater importance as the most uncompromising of the Islay
malts.
It should never be forgotten, however, that peat is just half the story when
it comes to present-day Islay malts. Like Bunnahabhain, Bowmore uses an
appreciable amount of sherry wood on its old whiskies, imbuing them with
sweet fruitiness which covers the peatiness of the raw spirit.
The 17-year-old is balanced superbly but the 12-year-old (Pounds 21.29 from
Peatlings, tel: 0284-755-948), with its notes of candied peel, is not to be
sneezed at, either. Bunnahabhain's warhorse is the 12-year-old (Oddbins
Pounds 19.99).
The big stills here run off a spirit at a higher strength, making the whisky
more delicate with a sweet honey and heather character.
Tasted 'blind,' few would recognise Bruichladdich as an Islay malt. The
15-year-old (Pounds 26.50 from Lea &amp; Sandeman, tel: 071-376-4767) is the
favourite of the distillery manager, Ian Allen. I agree with him. The sea
there is everywhere, rusting the hoops of the casks before they are two
years old. The sea is yet another inscrutable part of Islay's essence.

Robinson completes her round-up of the best buys from the off-licence chains
and the big supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK, we enter the competitive, knife-sharpened world of the major
supermarkets, together with the two biggest off-licence chains, both
brewery-owned. There is an unfortunate gulf between the wines that sell in
quantity (well below Pounds 4 a bottle) and the window-dressing wines the
supermarkets tend to show off to us wine writers, typically the second wine
of a smart Bordeaux chateau available in just two branches at a price
remarkably similar to that offered by the independents. (Supermarkets' best
bargains are lines that can be bought in serious quantity). Here is my pick
of what they all offer, but some of the more expensive bottles are only at
bigger stores. The stars denote my own rating.
Safeway***
Safeway does try terribly hard, embracing all manner of worthy if awkward
causes such as organic wines and English wines (good examples available in
their regions of origin). What I like is the stamp of individuality that is
apparent throughout the range. I included three of the wines below before
learning their prices had been slashed for Christmas.
Hungarian Country White 1991, Pounds 1.99. Wonderfully Hungarian with real
fire. Poor man's Gewurztraminer.
I Frari Bianco di Custoza 1991, Pounds 3.75. Comes in one of those
super-smart Italian bottles that look as though it alone is worth a fiver.
Nice, powerful, versatile dry white.
Australian Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 3.49. Everyone's got 'em. This one (from
Griffith, the marijuana capital of NSW) has better acid than many.
Domaine de Rivoyre Chardonnay 1991, H Ryman, Pounds 4.99. Languedoc fruit
internationalised beguilingly by Australian-trained winemaker. Elegant.
Yarden Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 7.29. Very sophisticated wine -
barrel-fermentation, malolactic fermentation, all the tricks - from the
Golan Heights. Much the best-value wine made in Israel and, quite
incidentally, kosher.
Safeway Australian Red, Pounds 2.65 a 75cl cardboard brick. Relatively fresh
and exciting - and in a light, non-smashable pack.
Villany Kekoporto 1991, Pounds 2.79. Excitingly lively, characterful
Hungarian red from the same winemaker as Reserve Cask F12.
Romanian Cabernet Sauvignon 1985, Pounds 2.69. Absurd price for a
seven-year-old, oak-aged classic, exclusive to Safeway.
Domaine de Soulie 1991, St Chinian, Pounds 3.95. Vigorous, chewy, organic
Midi red.
Reserve Cask F12, Villany Cabernet Sauvignon 1991, Pounds 3.99.
Exceptionally fruity, exuberant Hungarian red that will improve.
Don Maximiano Cabernet Sauvignon 1988, Pounds 6.39. Full-blooded Chilean
red.
Lustau Old Dry Oloroso, Pounds 3.29 a half. Lovely light, greenish tawny,
it's so old. Silly price. Sad.
Sainsbury *
I have tried particularly hard to pick out the stars from a somewhat
lacklustre wine collection because Sainsbury trolleys are still Britain's
favourite. The new South African wine range is labelled prettily.
Hungarian Pinot Blanc, Pounds 2.59. Good price for soft, off dry, curranty
fruit.
Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc 1991, Pounds 4.99. A Hugh Ryman Aussified wine,
remarkably similar to Safeway's Rivoyre.
Beaujolais-Villages 1991 Les Roches Grillees, Pounds 3.79. Correct,
appetising and discounted specially for Christmas. Best served slightly
cool, with cold turkey.
Ch Tourteau-Chollet 1988, Pounds 4.99. Good, gutsy red Graves. Ready to
drink claret.
Moscatel de Valencia, Pounds 2.99. Probably the best buy of all - a tooth
rotter but a well-balanced, silver-medal-winning sweet white with a useful
stopper cork. Serve icy at the end of Christmas dinner and shake your
spinning head at how cheap it is.
Clos St Georges 1990 Graves Superieures, Pounds 6.96. Almost a Barsac, a
particularly good vintage of an old favourite.
Clos l'Abeilley 1990 Sauternes, Pounds 7.95 a half. Worth it. Fine, classy,
as great sweet wine ought to be. Second wine of classed growth Ch
Rayne-Vigneau.
Sherries, especially the 35-year-old Aged Amontillado at Pounds 3.49 a half
(ridiculous price); the slightly richer Palo Cortado; and, in bigger
branches, the stunningly pale and lovely Lustau Almacenista Oloroso at
Pounds 6.79 a half, putting all the rest, bargains as they are, in the
shade.
Tesco**
Putting significant pressure on Sainsbury's, and several steps ahead of the
crowd in South Africa. Its interesting International Winemaker range, the
product of one man and his air miles, shows too little distinction between
the continents so far but should be worth watching.
Mendoza Blanc 1992, Pounds 2.99. Probably best value of the International
Winemaker range, although Blanc seems an odd word for a clean, aromatic
white made in Argentina.
Tesco Australian White, Pounds 2.99 Amazing value. Poor old Riesling
disguised in a white burgundy bottle and, admittedly, taking on a few Oz
Semillon characteristics. Dry, definitely Australian, white.
Robertson Chardonnay 1992, Pounds 3.99. Good value, well balanced from Danie
de Wet, the Cape's Chardonnay king.
Santa Rita Casablanca Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 6.99 (top 18 stores only). The
most subtle, burgundian Chilean Chardonnay I have tasted, from the new,
cool, coastal region that is the Carneros of Chile.
Jackson Estate Sauvignon Blanc 1992, Pounds 6.99 (top 49 stores).
Grapefruit, gooseberry flavours. See Thresher, too.
Chalk Hill Chardonnay 1990, Pounds 9.99. This quite happily withstood
comparison with a premier cru Chassagne-Montrachet from a reliable source.
Top stores only.
International Winemaker Malbec, Pounds 2.99. Deep purple pastiche of young
claret, from Argentina.
Australian Sparkling, Pounds 4.49. Quite light and frothy but very easy and
good value, from Seppelt.
Tesco Finest Amontillado, Pounds 4.89. You will want to decant this, partly
to distance the wine from its down-market packaging, partly to exhibit its
beautifully subtle, pale tawny colour, the green tints betraying its age.
Light, off-dry and, thanks to its acidity, very refreshing.
Thresher Wine Shop/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up***
Am I the only pedant annoyed by their television advertisement confusion of
palate with palette? Probably. No matter, as Britain's biggest (and, thanks
to chancellor Norman Lamont, most famous) agglomeration of off-licences
cares genuinely about the wine itself (and still cannot quite believe how
much bigger than old rival Oddbins it is).
Prices are edging up, presumably much to the relief of smaller operators.
The moody new Bottoms Up list is a triumph. The best Thresher branches are
emblazoned Wine Shop, but Wine Rack and Bottoms Up (WR/BU) carry the widest
range.
Eden Ridge Dry White 1992, Pounds 3.99 (WR/BU). Adam Wynn's cheap, organic,
lively off-dry crackling bargain made mainly from a shockingly unfashionable
grape variety (Riesling).
Jackson Estate Sauvignon Blanc 1991, Pounds 6.95. Thoroughly serious
Marlborough (NZ) Sauvignon; fine alternative to Cloudy Bay.
Slovakian Pinot Noir 1990, Pounds 3.29. Good colour, leafy aroma. No problem
distinguishing this from a Corton but jolly good value.
Penfolds Bin 2 1991, Pounds 3.99. See Waitrose.
Ch Clement Termes 1990 Gaillac, Pounds 4.59 Smooth, suave, juicy fruit and
not a jot of tannin. Drink now.
Ch Guibon 1990 Bordeaux, Pounds 4.39. A good, leafy claret from Andre
Lurton.
Bourgogne 1990 Domaine de l'Arlot, Pounds 7.99 (WR/BU). Just the sort of
wine we all want: proper domaine-bottled red burgundy from a great vintage
and vines too young to qualify for their normal appellation,
Nuits-St-Georges. Fresh fruit and no doubt about the oak.
Mountadam Pinot Noir 1990, Pounds 5.99 a half (WR/BU). Flattering sweet
mouthful of Australian fruit to be drunk soon.
Saintsbury Pinot Noir 1990, Pounds 11.49. Fine, juicy stuff from one of
California's best Pinot producers.
Ch Les Hebras Monbazillac 1990, Pounds 5.49 a half. Still looking gorgeous,
although demanding cellar space for a few years more vociferously than it
was last Christmas. I am going back for another two cases.
Dow's 10-year-old Tawny, Pounds 6.99 a half. Textbook stuff to be drunk with
cheese or even Christmas pudding.
Victoria Wine*
Some very good prices at the bottom end, but only until January 4 - and only
the top Wine Shops will have all of those listed below. A comparison of VW's
list with those of Whitbread's Thresher group (above) is instructive. Won't
Allied-Lyons throw a bit more money Victoria's way?
Willow Court 1991, Pounds 2.99. Lively, clean white from Gloucestershire.
Good aperitif or with smoked salmon.
Randall Bridge Dry White Pounds 2.99. It was probably much easier to find a
good wine at this price from Australia than from England. Another clever
attempt to make Riesling taste like Semillon (see Tesco). A bargain.
Leziria, Pounds 1.99. Juicy Portuguese answer to Beaujolais that would make
a great house red.
Vin de Pays de l'Uzege, Pounds 2.99 a litre. A soft house red for
francophiles. To be drunk sooner rather than later, this VW exclusiveness
sports a much-improved label.
Cismeira 1990 Douro, Pounds 2.99. Quite different from the other Portuguese
red above. Savoury, solid, yet lively red from port country.
Yalumba Show Reserve Liqueur Muscat, Pounds 6.89 half. A great Australian
speciality, rich and raisiny.
Taylors' First Estate, Pounds 8.99 a litre. Special offer in Wine Shops on
Taylors' delightfully unapologetic concentrated young ruby port. Lovely
stuff.
Waitrose ***
Some interesting new lines here, such as a Vin de Pays d'Oc matured on its
lees to taste like Muscadet; an unusual Vin de Pays from the Cote d'Or, made
from the white Auxerrois grape, at Pounds 4.45; and a low alcohol sparkling
wine from Alsace, called Paul Trudel Alsace, at Pounds 1.99.
Robertson Sauvignon Blanc 1992, Pounds 2.99. Thoroughly commercial (ie, by
no means bone dry) but perceptibly Sauvignon.
Domaine de Lalande Merlot Rose 1991, Pounds 2.99. This versatile dry pink
from Cabardes is sufficiently refreshing and versatile to become anyone's
house wine over Christmas.
Currawong Creek Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 3.99. Exclusive and rather smart
bottling from Rothbury, a blend of New South Wales' unashamedly distinctive
fruit.
Cabernet 1990 Haut Poitou, Pounds 3.99. A real stride forward for the Haut
Poitou co-op. Ambitiously oaked and much cheaper than many of the Loire reds
it matches.
Penfolds Bin 2 1991, Pounds 3.99. Why, oh why, they do not bill this as
trendy Syrah/Mourvedre, rather than Shiraz/Mataro, I do not know, but it
offers an absurd amount of savoury interest for the money. Not too heavy.
Waitrose Special Reserve Claret 1989, Pounds 4.65. Much the best of
Waitrose's clarets in this price range and cleverly chosen from Fronsac,
wines from which are getting plumper and juicier with every vintage. Drink
or keep a year.
Waitrose Solera Jerezana Rich Cream, Pounds 4.99. The awful truth is that
this would probably sell much better in a snazzy package that distanced it
from the appellation sherry. Quite extraordinary maturity and subtlety, with
a neat dry finish after a sumptuously rich palate.
This is the perfect end to Christmas dinner. Another absurdly under-priced
sherry.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Condemned to months of silence: Christina Lamb meets
Brazil's most notorious priest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEONARDO Boff cheerfully admits that in former times he would have been
burnt at the stake. Boff is a harmless looking man with big glasses, who
favours home knitted sweaters. He has the kind of benevolent air that would
make him a natural department store Santa Claus. Yet he is Brazil's most
notorious priest and is considered so dangerous by the Roman Catholic Church
that he has been subjected to 11 months of 'obsequious silence', banned from
writing, making speeches, and this August from teaching.
Able to stand no more, Brother Leonardo Boff recently reverted to plain
Genesio Darcy, leaving the Church and the Franciscan order after 25 years,
accusing the Vatican of 'destroying all hope' and practising the same
repression as the military regimes it once opposed.
He describes the decision as 'difficult and sad' but unavoidable.
Boff, 53, symbolises the distance between the doctrine meted out from the
palaces of Rome and the reality of poverty-stricken Latin America, a gap
that has widened with the centralisation of the Roman Catholic Church under
John Paul II, the most conservative pope of recent times.
Many have seen Boff's departure from the Church as signifying the collapse
of liberation theology, the movement which emerged from the Medellin
conference of Latin American bishops in 1968 proposing a more open, less
hierarchical model of the Church with more participation in social and
economic issues. Boff was one of the movement's founders and its principal
proponent in Brazil, the world's largest Catholic country.
He travelled the world and wrote 60 books, infuriating the Vatican by
criticising its lack of internal democracy, its distance from the people and
the use of big cars and palaces by bishops whom Boff describes as 'appearing
to the poor as if they are on the side of the oppressors'.
Boff practises his preachings and is an advocate of Base Communities -
groups which meet at least weekly to apply the Bible to everyday problems.
These were particularly active during Brazil's military years of 1964-85 as
a shelter for political dissidence, producing most of today's leftist
politicians and union leaders.
CEBs use theatre, dance and folk art in sessions which often go on all night
and which are run by laypeople, often women. According to Boff, 'the idea is
to create a dialogue people understand - people to whom no-one ever listened
here feel God is listening to them'.
CEBs help with food, housing, education and health. In Brazil's
drought-stricken north-east, members check that ovens have been lit as a way
of finding out if people have food.
In the 1960s and 1970s, when the Church was at the vanguard of the fight
against military regimes all over Latin America, the common enemy helped
bridge the differences between the two models of the Church.
But as the dictators fell, Boff's criticisms caused increasing irritation in
Rome, particularly to Cardinal Ratzinger who heads the Sacred Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith, the old Inquisition. In 1985 Boff was
punished with 11 months of 'obsequious silence' for his book Church,
Charisma and Power which sold 100,000 copies in Brazil and was reprinted in
15 languages. Since then his work has been censored.
The Vatican questioned Boff over his 'doctrinal deviations' and he was
removed from the editorial board of Vozes, Brazil's Catholic magazine and
publishing house, and stopped from lecturing for one year. In April a German
was appointed as Boff's censor and in August, when he was due to resume
teaching, he was informed that for 'the good of the Church' he would be
stopped.
This was the last straw: 'They have immobilised me. This is exactly what
military regimes did and the Church always opposed.'
According to Boff's brother Clodoviz, a priest in Rio, what made the Vatican
turn on Boff was the popular roots of his theory: 'Rome is scared of Boff
because his theory has one foot in theology and one foot in the people who
ask 'why should Rome nominate our bishops, why shouldn't women be priests?'
It's not advanced or brilliant but behind liberation theology are people,
whereas behind European theology is a library.'
'Church and religion are important,' says Boff, 'in that they have the
capacity to provide hope, resistance and meaning of life but in Brazil
people are crying out and no-one listens.'
He believes that the Church should be decentralised and should be more
attentive to local cultures. 'Religion is not made in the clouds but on the
ground so what matters is what ground your feet are on. Faith is very
different for someone living amid abundance and development in the first
world than in a poor African nation.'
Boff says he did not leave the Church before because 'I felt I could fight
from within. But like frying hot cakes in a closed room you eventually reach
a point where the steam all around is suffocating'. He stresses, 'leaving
the Church does not mean giving up faith. It's just a matter of changing
hierarchical positions.'
Nor is his departure an admission of defeat: 'We've achieved a lot. Usually
it takes two or three generations before a new theology is heard in the
centre of the Church. Ours took just 15 years to oblige the highest levels
to take a position and for the Pope to pronounce on it.'
He estimates that 120,000-150,000 CEBs are still operating in Brazil with an
average 50-60 members. A recent study showed these are responsible for 80
per cent of Sunday services.
Moreover, the agenda of the Church in Brazil is very much that of liberation
theology with its focus on social issues such as land reform, defence of
Indians and human rights. Boff believes that most of the 360 Brazilian
bishops lean towards liberation theology, although senior positions are
still held by a core of conservative bishops.
Boff says he wants to spend his time reading everything from world affairs
to quantum mechanics, but his first act on leaving the Church has been to
publish Latin America: From Conquest to New Evangelism. The book sold 5,000
copies in the first week and accuses the Church of ethnocentrism, 'claiming
a monopoly on truth and salvation'.
He writes: 'The Church was part of an immense colonial project - its role
like a fox trying to spread the word to the chickens.'
For all his rhetoric, Boff undoubtedly revels in his notoriety and many
believe that his real motive for leaving the Church was to be free himself
to marry his secretary Marcia. It is a matter on which he refuses to
comment.

FT  19 DEC 92 / As They Say in Europe: The fairy-tale summit - Why the best
journalists believe what they are told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING a good part of the second week of Advent cooped up with 2,000
colleagues in a sports complex attached to the Meadowbank Thistle football
club is not my idea of fun. But that is where the Edinburgh EC summit took
us.
One becomes envious of people who are doing something else. It was only on
the way home that my mood of self-pity was lifted by an account in a Sunday
colour magazine of a day in the life of young woman who made her living
buying and selling handbags from a shop in London. She 'loved cars,' read
the Daily Mail and washed her hair every day. There is always someone worse
off than yourself.
That brief moment of relief was hardly compensation for an event in which
the media entered into an unholy alliance with the politicians to turn the
predictabilities of Edinburgh into a cliffhanger. 'The 12 seek a compromise
to avoid a major crisis,' said Le Monde. But, of course, it all came right
in the end, partly because the British were in their element during that
weekend.
Organising royal bust-ups, marriages and right royal rows comes naturally to
the island race. The production of a fairy-tale result is what matters, and
it always happens when the British are in charge: John Major told an
interviewer from the Edinburgh Evening News that the conference in London
last August on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia had been 'hugely
successful.'
So, on Monday the papers could breathe a collective sigh of relief. The
Berlin Tagesspiegel wrote: 'The 12 state and government heads achieved more
than could have been hoped.'
The main quality needed by a successful journalist is not cynicism, but
total credulity. You have to believe that there is a crisis atmosphere to
generate an atmosphere of crisis. You need an atmosphere of crisis to sell
newspapers. And a crisis is what politicians love to overcome. Imagine if
the headlines of last week had said: 'Major plans facile compromises to
bluff Danish at Edinburgh.'
So it was that many of the less committed squatting at Meadowbank got their
priorities right. The Americans and the Japanese had their eyes on the royal
re-match up the road at Balmoral. Stories, and conversations, became mixed
up in all sorts of ways. The caterer, Pru Leith, did the food for the
summit; the port of Leith was where the royal yacht Britannia docked so the
Euro-leaders could dine with the temporarily united royal family. (The
princess of Wales was placed next to the Spanish foreign minister, which was
seen as a kind of punishment for the wayward lass).
At least one paper tried to ram the stories together. France-Soir wrote:
'The household rows provoked by the Maastricht marriage contract have been
carefully suppressed by a juridical poultice of the same abstruse character
as that of the treaty. It will all be better than a divorce and we shall
applaud the papering over of cracks so long as it is not played out as a new
honeymoon.' (Do not make the mistake of believing it sounds better in the
original])
The notion of Scotland as a different country struck the representatives of
the international media forcibly. For many, it was their first visit to
Edinburgh, and it knocked them out. (The natives also put on their
traditional show of nationalism and resentment, which gave a lot of innocent
pleasure.)
Then there was that sense of isolation in which the Scots specialise.
British (or Scottish) Telecom ensured that although we could all make
telephone calls out, we could not receive any. As a result, BT received the
lion's share of the gigantic revenue always derived from such events.
But what of the meat of the meeting? In the end, much depended on whether
the charmingly named 'cohesion' countries (all those even poorer than
Britain) would settle for a Dollars 19bn handout or whether they wanted more
in the form of 'structural investment.' They settled in the end, partly
because they did well for themselves at Edinburgh
I glanced at the Diario de Noticias of Lisbon to see what would happen to
this sudden influx of other people's cash. The Portuguese prime minister,
Anibal Cavaco Silva, produced a well-judged ambiguity. He said he would be
'very demanding as to the use of Community funds.' Future summits may indeed
pay a good deal attention to what happens to 'cohesion money.' It might even
enable those who report such occasions to avoid having to concoct artificial
crises to generate interest and excitement.
The headline of the week echoed last week's story in this column about the
Swiss and Europe. The Journal de Geneve led its front page with:
'Liechtenstein isolates Switzerland even more.'

FT  19 DEC 92 / Nine phases of Arthur: Robin Lane Fox salutes gardening
writer Arthur Hellyer, who turned 90 this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ALL know about guardian angels, and even I would like to believe in them.
Gardening angels may be less familiar but, as I have just been in touch with
them, for this week you can believe in them, too.
They do promise that they are trying to do their best. They really will stop
the rain when most of the water companies stop losing quite so much of it
between the reservoir and the customer. They know that we would all like to
keep our Christmas azaleas alive for more than a month, but they do feel a
conflicting loyalty to the house-plant trade and the growers must come
first.
Just at the moment, they are feeling rather pleased with themselves. Many
years ago, they had a master plan; this week, they are seeing it enter phase
nine.
He might not realise it but the master plan concerns my colleague, Arthur
Hellyer, who reached his 90th birthday this week. When he began to write,
old age was still old age, but nowadays we are being asked to call it
chronological experience in order to be correct. So, we must all
congratulate him on his chronological experience while reminding him that
the saleroom correspondent of Country Life magazine, to which Arthur also
contributes with distinction, was still writing to the highest levels after
seven years' further experience in his 90s.
Meanwhile, if you ever wonder about retirement or the passing years, he is
the definitive evidence that the best answer is to get out into the garden
and never retire at all. If so, you ought to start as soon as possible.
Here, the gardening angels must take up the story, beginning with what they
see as their successful phase one.
In 1916, the lad Hellyer was ordered by his father to go to work on the
lawn, dig it up and grow vegetables because the Germans were threatening the
British imports with submarines (nowadays, they threaten them with a strong
currency).
Arthur passed his patriotic test and was ready for phase two: three years of
post-war farming in Jersey, which must have been good for the back muscles.
Phase three, until 1929, took in eight years at a general nursery in the
south-east. All the while, the angels knew why it was needed.
The pen, we all know, is mightier than the sword: usually, it is less of a
match for the spade. Perhaps the previous schooling at Dulwich played its
part, perhaps it was angelic direction, but Arthur now moved from the
potting shed to the printer and became an associate editor for Commercial
Horticulture, one of those titles which did not wait around for a Maxwell to
buy it.
So phase four rapidly became phase five, the backbone of the angels' plan:
the young Hellyer moved to something even more solid, Amateur Gardening,
where he was to work for the next 38 years.
From 1929 onwards, the British home-owner had a fully-trained expert,
willing to be photographed in sensible jerseys, sometimes with a reassuring
pipe in hand or mouth. Who better to tell them what they perhaps wanted to
know: how to lay a land drain, dig a bastard trench, or make their own
cabbage crop fertiliser and apply it to a rod of ground.
In 1937, it was time for phase six: commercial authorship under the Hellyer
name, beginning with Your New Garden. The angels admit the timing was rather
optimistic; but they never could stop men fighting and, during the sequel,
they could win only one small concession: the publication in 1941 of the
Amateur Gardening Pocket Guide.
This Hellyer classic would have fitted in a kitbag or suited any
soldier-gardener who found himself wondering how to cope with carrot fly
while sitting near the front. It proved the merits of angelic foresight by
going into endless editions until 1971, rivalled only by The Amateur
Gardener, the deserving favourite of Arthur's many books.
When the war ended, there was a significant conjunction in the charts. I was
born on an October day when The Times was offering chrysanthemums at one
shilling and threepence for 10 and, as a sort of angelic, pre-emptive
strike, Arthur moved up to phase seven: the full editorship of Amateur
Gardening which he held, famously, for 21 years.
In 1959, the angels felt that the working gardener now had enough friendly
pictures of Arthur sowing seeds from his much-photographed hands, or looking
reassuring among the brasiccas with that trim moustache and ever-cheerful
eye. The next target lay in the idler reaches of the social pyramid, and so
phase eight began: the weekly column for the FT.
It started modestly with a piece on the definitive art of weed control but,
like weeds, it is still with us after 33 remarkable years, almost without
interruption. You all know and admire the clarity, generosity, grasp of
plain science and the range of plantsmanship and gardens visited all over
the world and written up to encourage us.
Perhaps you are wondering why the angels needed so many phases for their
purpose. They do believe in free will and, once Arthur was started, they
could guide but not coerce him. But they had also foreseen two dangers. One
was the appearance in 1970 of a second FT columnist who did not know the
true properties of bone meal, hated heathers, and was prone to run riot on
the topic of the National Rose Society's gardens. They had to have their own
man in place to keep me firmly in hand.
Their other reason, I can now reveal, was that they had foreseen the rise of
the conservation movement in the 1980s. Everyone would enthuse about the
merits of 'lost' garden plants and try to conserve them. However could we
keep a grasp on reality unless Arthur Hellyer had been conserved long-term
for the purpose?
I recall, with relish, the gentle deflation in his FT review of a book by
the director of Wisley called Vanishing Garden. The good director lamented
as lost treasures plants which Arthur had known intimately during his phase
three in the 1920s. With the unique authority of the one surviving expert
who had grown and assessed them himself, Arthur reminded the conservation
authors that, so far from being a tragically lost heritage, these plants
were weak, sulky nuisances.
Now it is to be phase nine. Will it be a new line in fruit management, a
critical review of gardening by urban councils, or the continuing defence of
the balance of knowledge and unpredictability in a garden-lover's life?
Perhaps all three; but before you could do more than wish the FT's senior
correspondent the best of it all, the gardening angels vanished to the
strains of their signature tune, In the Mild Mid-Winter, and I was left
wondering if even Arthur has ever seen a better year for winter-flowering
cherries.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Sport: A wind-blown heaven - Golf / American friends
introduced John Hopkins to the joys of Porthcawl's links in his native Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD grown up hearing stories about Royal Porthcawl, the famous golf course
in south Wales, and years later I covered amateur and professional events
that it staged. Porthcawl, then, had a place in my mind, but as I had never
played there, it had not yet won a place in my heart. The chance to try out
my middle handicap game over its 6,600 yards came unexpectedly in the form
of a letter from my friend Robert Macdonald in the US.
Macdonald and his fellow enthusiasts were making their annual pilgrimage to
play golf in Britain. Last year it was Muirfield in Scotland and
thereabouts; this year it was to be the Welsh courses. They would start at
Hoylake, move down to Aberdovey, Royal St David's and Borth and conclude
with Southerndown and Royal Porthcawl.
There was no messing around. These were the sort of men who put the word
serious into the phrase serious golfers. It was 36 a day, nothing less.
Would I join them for all or some of the trip? Could a Welshman refuse such
an invitation?
Macdonald cares deeply about golf as it is played in Britain. He has no more
interest in watching most professional tournaments than a pro would have in
joining one of his monthly Shakespeare play-readings in New York city where
he lives. He and his friends have been making these golfing trips to Britain
on and off since 1980. The organisation is meticulous.
Before Macdonald settles the itinerary, telephone calls are placed hither
and yon and letters whizz across the Atlantic. 'To travel hopefully is a
better thing than to arrive,' wrote Robert Louis Stevenson. Macdonald does
not agree. 'I am well aware that what seems like a rainbow to me may seem
like a wisp of fog to others,' Macdonald wrote to me.
Tee times are booked well in advance, hired cars organised, route maps drawn
up. I would not be surprised if the foreign secretary received a carbon copy
of the final itinerary. I have no doubt the US Ambassador to Britain is on a
red alert.
The golf is only the half of it. We are talking of men of substance, who
like to complement their efforts on the golf course each day with something
more than bread and dripping. The quality of the eating and drinking
receives as much attention as a two-foot putt to win a hole.
So one evening in September I made my way to the Egerton Grey Hotel at
Porthkerry near Porthcawl. As I walked in, I heard transatlantic voices
coming from the lounge.
In one chair was Arch, a tall man with a warm smile and clumps of hair that
sprang out seemingly uncontrollably from above his ears. He was The Keeper
of the Records and deadly serious about it, too, noting all the details in a
thick book.
At one point the discussion turned to the forthcoming US presidential
election when Arch suddenly interrupted. 'Wait, wait,' he said urgently. 'I
have got to write down our putts from this morning. How many did you have
Robbie?'
Macdonald, meanwhile, was wearing the smile of a man who is halfway to
heaven. He had played well that day and fallen in love with Porthcawl.
Sidney, the third member of the trio, had his head in the wine list
assessing the bottles as he had scrutinised every putt that day.
Up to this point, 1992 had been a good year for me in my quest to experience
good courses. In March I had played at San Lorenzo in Portugal and been
enchanted by its stirring holes by the sea in the middle of the round and
its wonderful finish.
The morning after the conclusion of the US Open, I tackled Cypress Point on
the Monterey Peninsula. Behind me was Ian Baker-Finch, the 1991 Open
champion. 'Good-day mate,' he had said. And as we walked to the 16th tee,
who should appear but Mark Calcavecchia, the 1988 Open champion.
Still, it is not for so many stars that I remember Cypress Point. It is
because I went par, par, par on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes, two par
threes and a four on three of the most photographed holes in golf.
By September, the flush of excitement at my feat had worn thin and when I
saw the sea hurling itself furiously at the shore by the side of the first
hole at Royal Porthcawl doubts assailed me.
Four hours later I was as elated as Macdonald had been the day before. I
changed out of my spikes and admired the magnificent wooden lockers, which
must be as old as the club. Silently I berated myself for ignoring the
charms of Porthcawl for so long.
It was a good enough test to stage an Open. The sea is visible from nearly
every hole and as we leaned in to the wind we could glimpse in the distance
some of John Masefield's 'dirty British coasters with salt-caked smoke
stacks' barging through the seas. 'I think I am going to have to revise my
top five British courses,' said Macdonald. 'This place is terrific.'
At the bar over ham sandwiches and beer, Arch worked out that he and SK were
level on the morning's play. Robert Macdonald calculated the state of our
match. It was to be good news: 'John has won.' I took delivery of three 50p
pieces and returned to London, victorious, windblown and deeply contented,
like an art lover who has found an unexpected Rembrandt.
As for Macdonald and company, they played another 18 - and then a further
four. If darkness had not intervened, they would still be there.

NEW MODELS grab headlines. But well-established cars that have had a
facelift-cum-heart transplant in mid to late life often are the shrewd
buyer's choice.
All the initial snags - and it is a rare car that has absolutely none from
the outset - have been sorted out. Over the years, the product has been
honed as close to perfection as it is ever likely to get.
In the past few weeks, I have tried four cars in this category: the 1993
model ranges of Jaguar and Vauxhall; the latest V8-engined BMW 730i; and the
24-valve, 3.2 litre Mercedes 320E. Only the Vauxhall Cavaliers (Opel Vectras
in mainland Europe) looked much different. But all the cars were
significantly better than those they succeeded.
The Pounds 43,528 Daimler four-litre is, as ever, a slice of old England,
trimmed in pungently sweet-smelling Connolly hide and wearing its wood
veneer as unself-consciously as any Bentley. Going slowly on winding lanes
and around town, I thought it felt rather soft and loose-jointed but, as
speed rose, it became a real driver's car, not just a chairman's transport.
A driver's side airbag and a state-of-the-art security alarm are among a
number of individually small but cumulatively significant improvements to
all 1993 Jaguar saloons.
Long term, though, Jaguar must produce a smaller, roomier and essentially
more up-to-date model, possibly with a V8 engine, to remain competitive with
BMW, Mercedes and the up-market products of Japanese makers. In short,
something around the size of the BMW 5 series.
Although the present BMW 7 series is nearing the end of its life, it remains
a brilliant performer with the new three- and four-litre V8 engines.
Before long, these V8s will power the 7 series replacement, but they also
are available now in the range-topping 5 series.
The Pounds 37,250 730iA with five-speed automatic transmission was so quiet,
swift and agile that I found it impossible to fault. As I settled
luxuriously into its soft, hide-trimmed upholstery, I scented victory in my
war of attrition against the traditionally hard Teutonic seat. (Come to
think of it, it has been some time since anyone in Munich or Stuttgart told
me, earnestly: 'Hard seats are very good for you').
Vauxhall deserves any number of Brownie points for giving its posher Astra
models a central display on which the radio wavelength is shown boldly
enough for people like me to read easily without glasses.
The power-steered, Pounds 11,912, 1.6 Astra automatic I tried was
well-mannered and compact, lively though solidly built, and parked easily.
On minor roads covered with sodden mats of autumn leaves, a turbo-charged,
204-horsepower, Pounds 19,259 Cavalier 4x4 was astoundingly safe and grippy.
The whole Cavalier range has had a major revamp for 1993, with automatic
seat belt tensioners, side impact protection beams and optional driver-side
airbags. Luxury models with 2.5 litre, V6 engines are coming soon.
The 320E I drove was the top model in a collection of 12 mid-sized
Mercedes-Benz saloons, estate cars and a four/five seat convertible with
new, low-emission, multi-valve petrol engines. All have driver-side airbags
as standard.
Its eager 220 horsepower was usable safely on wet roads because the optional
 -and highly desirable - ASR automatic skid control system (Pounds 1,982)
was fitted. This matches power delivery to tyre grip, avoiding wheel-spin
during hard acceleration and assuring balanced handling.
The 320E is listed at Pounds 32,256. Extras - including ASR, leather seats,
cruise control, Sportline suspension and eight-hole alloy wheels  - raised
the price of my test car to Pounds 39,604.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Sport: Casey at the bat in the US Senate - Baseball / Jurek
Martin looks at the US national game's continuing troubles with politics,
race and money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JULY 9 1958, a Senate judiciary sub-committee convened to investigate the
exemption of baseball from the nation's anti-trust laws. The star witness
was Casey Stengel, then manager of the New York Yankees, whose contributions
to the English language make those of the fictional Mrs Malaprop
insignificant.
It was an immortal display of Stengelese. After one extraordinary
digression, Senator Estes Kefauver declared, in frustration: 'Mr Stengel, I
am not sure I made my question clear,' to which the great Casey replied:
'Yes sir, well, that is all right. I am not sure I am going to answer yours
perfectly, either."
There was one moment of clarity. 'An owner,' Stengel said, 'gets most of the
money at home and it is up to him and his staff to do better or they ought
to be discharged.'
Plus ca change. On December 10 1992, the same sub-committee reconvened with
the same purpose. Its star witness was Fay Vincent, dismissed summarily last
summer as the commissioner of baseball by the owners for failing
sufficiently to heed their bidding.
Vincent speaks no Stengelese, but he loves the sport as much. He described
himself as just 'another former bureaucrat without formal standing in
baseball.' On balance, he thought baseball still warranted anti-trust
exemption but should have to prove continuously that it does.
Gently, but pointedly, he said one condition should be the existence of a
truly independent commissioner who represented all the sport's component
parts. He told Senator Howard Metzenbaum: 'I said one time that the business
of baseball is like the sun: you can't look at it for very long without
turning away.'
The problem for baseball is that the indispensable public might be turning
away from it, not in legalistic confusion but in disgust.
The big off-season story has been the case of Marge Schott, owner of the
Cincinnati Reds. It is most charitable to describe Schott, whose fortune is
derived from used cars, as silly, even eccentric, in the indulgence she
allows her pet Saint Bernard, Schottzie Two.
Her arbitrary treatment of her employees on the field and off it is
legendary. Lou Piniella quit as Reds' manager in October, less than two
years after bringing a World Series crown to Cincinnati, because he could
stand her no longer.
As owners go she was not exceptional; and with George Steinbrenner, the
ultimate autocrat, returning to the helm of the Yankees next year, she might
have attracted minimal attention outside Cincinnati. That was until her
fondness for racist and anti-Semitic epithets became public knowledge.
Four years ago, Al Campanis, of the Los Angeles Dodgers' front office,
opened baseball's hidden can of worms when he remarked that he did not think
blacks were up the demands of managing baseball clubs. Schott's references
to two of her players as 'million-dollar niggers' were equally offensive and
in no way mitigated by the fact that she then hired a former Red, Tony
Perez, a black Cuban-American, to succeed Piniella.
Of course, the Rev Jesse Jackson intervened and, of course, Schott
apologised, as had Campanis. But the public outcry was enough to induce the
owners to form a committee to investigate how she should be 'disciplined'
(although how poachers bring gamekeepers to heel is not easy to imagine. An
independent commissioner might).
If all this were not bad enough, baseball then nearly countenanced the
ultimate sin of sacrilege on its own history. Nobody disputed the San
Francisco Giants' right to pay Barry Bonds, of the Pittsburgh Pirates,
Dollars 43.75m (Pounds 29m) for the next six years. For a player who has
never hit much in post-season play, the contract seemed high; and for a team
that would have moved to Florida, had the other owners agreed, because it
could not make money in the Bay Area, there seemed a lack of financial
sense. The Yankees, bidding furiously but offering only the same annual
salary over five years, had the gall to complain that the Giants were
distorting the salary market.
What upset the purists was Bonds' demand that the Giants allow him to wear
the number 24. That number belonged to Willie Mays, not merely the best ever
to wear a Giants uniform but, beyond all reasonable doubt, the greatest
player of the last 50 years.
Mays is Bonds' godfather, and is said to have given him permission to use
the number, but even that was insufficient explanation. Fortunately, Bonds
relented and said he would wear 25, the number sported by his father Bobby
in the days when he and Willie patrolled the outfield together.
The other trades showed how much clubs with money are willing to pay for the
right free-agent talent (although, with 18 of the 26 major league teams
operating at a loss, not all have the resources).
The dismemberment of the Pirates, probably the best National League team
over the past five years but not the richest, proceeded apace. They lost not
only Bonds but also Doug Drabek, a fine pitcher, to Atlanta, which is
stuffed with fine pitchers already.
David Cone, transferred from the New York Mets to help pitch the Toronto
Blue Jays to the World Series title in the last month of last season, is off
to Kansas City for a Dollars 9m signing bonus. The Blue Jays also lost Jimmy
Key, a good left-hander, to the Yankees and are letting the venerable Dave
Winfield go, replacing him with the medium-in-the-tooth Paul Molitor from
Milwaukee.
The Yankees also signed Wade Boggs, who had spent all his career with the
Boston Red Sox compiling a gaudy .339 batting average but hit only to .260
last seaon. The Mets and the Red Sox, coming off anni horribiles,
respectively picked up admirable ancients, Frank Tanana and Andre Dawson.
But the ultimate question is whether there will be a next season. By a
narrow margin at their winter meeting, the owners voted to re-open contract
talks with the players' union in the weeks ahead. It had been thought they
would wait a year and enjoy the Dollars 4bn-plus television revenues
guaranteed next year, but not thereafter.
Trouble looms and there is no commissioner. Perhaps the call will go out to
another great mangler of the English language. After all, George Bush is
about to become a free agent himself.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Property: Why you can bank on Gloucestershire - The
perennial appeal of an English county where even the Romans had central
heating in their houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOUCESTERSHIRE is more than a place on the map. That is inadequate for its
image as a state of mind - like Virginia, in the US - where gentlemen live
and old-fashioned manners and aristocratic, if not snobbish, attitudes rule.
But that is not the whole reason why City bankers pour west down the M4 on
Friday nights.
Next day's shooting and hunting await, or polo in the summer at Cirencester
before a congenial dinner party with. . . other bankers. Then there are
antique shops to visit, or the Coln Valley Smokery to get delicacies for
that dinner, and splendid gardens such as Hidcote, Kiftsgate and Barnsley.
It could be lunch at the Marsh Goose in Moreton-in-Marsh, followed by a tour
of the Cotswolds' noble churches. Or a visit to the Roman villas which, like
the churches, were built on wool money. (The Roman gentry anticipated 20th
century Gloucestershire with their comfortable, centrally heated living and
had their own mosaics studio in Corinium/Cirencester to build their floors).
Being tucked into the angle of the M4 and M5 is convenient and, if you are
going north-east, you still take the Romans' road to Leicester, the Fosse
Way (A429). Another attraction of this beautiful county is its tight
planning laws. Much of it remains unspoilt.
Gloucestershire's greatest advantage is that it has many liveable houses.
They are not stately homes demanding armies of non-existent local servants
but easy-to-maintain farmhouses, manors and old rectories. Even small
villages have two or three houses of this size; and in a prosperous town
such as Cirencester, they are many and grand.
Plenty are now for sale, many of them done up in the 1980s when
Gloucestershire boomed. Debt has forced some of these sales. 'It is one of
the three Ds to the house market,' says Tim Lawson of Knight, Frank &amp;
Rutley. (Death and divorce are the others.) Many of the former farmhouses
have a few acres with them, enough to graze a hunter or children's ponies.
For real farmers, Lane Fox in Cirencester (0285-653-101) is offering
Slaughter Farm at Bourton-on-the-Water, a Georgian house with 372 acres,
cottages, barn, silage clamp and a kilometre of double bank trout fishing on
the Windrush, at around Pounds 1.15m in all. Outside Stow-on-the-Wold, the
Brellim House estate - where the annual horse fair still attracts the
gipsies - is for those who will bid over Pounds 1.3m to run a
state-of-the-art equestrian centre (through John D. Wood in Oxford: 0865-
311-522).
Berrimans at Lypiatt is also for serious horsemen. It features a
Kentucky-type barn with 10 loose boxes and 'staff rest room' for about
Pounds 495,000 (from Jackson-Stops in Cirencester: 0285-653-334).
If you dream of keeping a herd of deer, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Cirencester
(0285-659-771) will wave the magic wand at Priors Meyne, Lydney, a
pink-stuccoed house overlooking the river Severn with 72 acres of park and
woods (for about Pounds 600,000) and the chance to buy the resident 50
fallow deer.
Houses with smaller parcels of land that will keep a horse include the
Edwardian Clifordine House at Rendcomb. It has a whirlpool bath to ease
limbs tired from hunting and can be had from Strutt &amp; Parker in
Moreton-in-Marsh (0608-50502) at around Pounds 650,000.
Then there is the late-Georgian Close Farm House at Coberley - Pounds
587,500 from Allen &amp; Harris in Cheltenham (0242-580-883) or Humberts
(0242-513-439) - and Ellenborough House, a well-converted barn near
Winchcombe with five holiday cottages producing a net income of around
Pounds 20,000 and well-placed for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. From Humberts for
around Pounds 675,000.
A typical Cotswold farmhouse with some land, barns and a cottage is Upper
Coscombe at Temple Guiting, from Savills in Banbury (0295-263-535) for
Pounds 550,000 (or Pounds 125,000 more to include a second cottage). Another
for horse-owners is Crows' Nest Farm at Upton St Leonards, outside
Gloucester, which has been made out of an old farmstead. The long views to
the Malvern Hills and Wales give the house its name; Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
offers it at Pounds 450,000.
If you can live without horses, Bluegates near Berkeley Castle (where Edward
II met a sad end) and just 20 miles from Bristol is a Victorian red brick
farmhouse with one wall picked out in yellow and blue bricks. It lies in the
flat ground of the Severn valley, beyond the Cotswolds, where the weather is
much warmer. Cluttons in Bath (0225-469511) has it at Pounds 300,000.
Near Cirencester, some attractive cottages are on the market. Jackson-Stops
is selling two in Meysey Hampton at Pounds 97,500 and Pounds 184,000; one in
Edwards College, the terrace almshouse in South Cerney, on instructions from
the diocese, at Pounds 115,000 (and needing work); and the old village shop
in Eastleach, a more substantial building, at Pounds 285,000. In Birdlip,
between Gloucester and Cheltenham, Strutt &amp; Parker offers Birdlip Farmhouse
at Pounds 130,000.
The grander village houses show how prosperous the wool trade was, and are
good places now in which to hole up when snow cuts off the estates on the
hills.
Best of the Georgian village houses is the handsome Colebrook House at
Blockley, near Moreton-in-Marsh. Built by a silk miller and featuring a
two-acre garden with brooks, Savills offers it at Pounds 495,000. Also in
Blockley is the converted Regency-style 1835 Ebenezer chapel, with
Jackson-Stops in Chipping Campden (0386-840-224) at around Pounds 285,000.
About a century older are two properties with walled gardens: the Oak House
in Tetbury, on offer from Humberts there (0666-502-284) at Pounds 325,000;
and Picton House in Broadway (the village well known for the Lygon Arms
hotel) which had an antiques shop on the ground floor with a flat above -
from Jackson-Stops at Pounds 750,000. The premium is in its 'fine retailing
position'.
Oldest of the pre-Georgian village houses is the basically Elizabethan Brook
Bend, in Weston Subedge at the foot of the Cotswolds near Chipping Campden
(from Jackson-Stops at Pounds 335,000); and the early-17th century Roberts
House in Siddington, south of Cirencester. It looks the ideal of a gabled
and stone-slated Cotswold house, and has a cottage which could contain
either the gardener (for its walled garden) or granny.
The Cirencester office of Jackson-Stops is selling it at around Pounds
675,000 and, for around Pounds 210,000, also offers the late-17th century
Glebe House in Avening, near Tetbury, which looks entrancing.
Twice that price is the 17th century Brimpsfield House in Brimpsfield,
between Cirencester and Gloucester, with a first-floor oriel window. This
house - from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, together with Halifax in Cirencester
(0285-650-576) - is for archaeologists or military historians. The remains
of its predecessor, a medieval castle, are in the grounds.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Property: A more complex cowboy - Because of its
cross-border nature, the timeshare industry is particularly difficult to
clean up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIANA Hanks is on the telephone in the Timeshare Council's basement office
in Buckingham Gate, steering yet another caller away from potential
disaster.
'The company is registered in Gibraltar? I think that speaks for itself,'
she says. Apart from inquiries from would-be buyers and sellers of
timeshare, Hanks, the council's consumer services manager, deals with
complaints about the behaviour of some of the industry's shadier operators.
On an average day, the council, which represents the acceptable face of the
timeshare industry, deals with 23 complaints.
Last October, a new Timeshare Act came into force, giving buyers 14 days to
withdraw from contracts and claim their money back. The act, however,
provides a remedy for only one of the timeshare industry's many abuses:
high-pressure selling. And that remedy is available only to those who
conclude timeshare contracts in the UK. The council estimates that 75 per
cent of contracts are concluded while the buyers are on holiday abroad.
The council aims to improve timeshare's reputation - not an easy task. When
the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year revoked the consumer credit
licences of six companies associated with Club Riviera, one of the UK's
leading timeshare groups, Simon Clarke, a director, did not think the image
of the business would suffer. 'Being in the timeshare industry alone is as
bad as you can get,' he said. 'In terms of public awareness, you don't have
good timeshares and bad timeshares, you just have timeshares.'
Club Riviera's application to join the Timeshare Council has been refused.
Tom Critchley, until recently the council's chairman and now its European
affairs specialist, concedes that timeshare is a difficult business to clean
up. 'Cowboy housebuilders, doubling glazing and insurance salesmen - to some
extent, they've been seen off. But timeshare has the complexity of its
cross-border aspect. You might have a German developer selling to the
British in Spain. The legal structures are widely different.'
Of the complaints that the council receives, 90 per cent concern alleged
crookery in Tenerife. One of the most common types of sharp practice is
perpetrated on people who already own timeshare.
Typically, the timeshare owner is in Tenerife on holiday. He is invited to
visit a resort which, he is told, is superior to the one he is in. He visits
it; it is. A salesman tells him: 'You paid Pounds 5,000 for your timeshare.
We can get you Pounds 7,500 if you want to sell it. This place will cost
Pounds 7,000.'
All the customer needs to do is pay a deposit of 20 per cent. He hands over
Pounds 1,400. His old timeshare is never sold. He does not pay the balance
of the Pounds 7,000, but the salesman would have been in trouble if he had.
On a typical day, the salesman might take 20 per cent deposits for the same
apartment in the same weeks from five different people.
In spite of experiences such as these, the British are big buyers of
timeshare, although the recession has recently led to a fall in sales. When
the OFT investigated timeshare two years ago, most owners said they were
happy with what they had bought. Among continental Europeans, timeshare is
gaining popularity.
What is the attraction? Timeshare owners say the quality of the
accommodation and facilities is often far superior to that available at
hotels. Those who go back to the same place every year say they know what
they are getting, with no nasty surprises such as all-night discotheques and
crowds of rowdy post-adolescents.
Another advantage, surprising perhaps to the uninitiated, is the choice that
timeshare offers. Some buyers of timeshare never visit the resort in which
they have bought their weeks. By becoming members of exchange companies,
they can swop their weeks for time in resorts all over the world.
Some owners believe their timeshare is a good financial investment. It is
not. Buyers of timeshare, even from highly respectable companies, have
nothing like the protection offered to a purchaser of a package holiday. If
you buy a holiday from a member of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta), you are fully protected if the travel company collapses. The
Timeshare Council takes up complaints against member companies but does not
monitor their finances and offers no compensation if they go out of
business.
The OFT report said timeshare did not compare favourably with the cost of
taking a series of annual self-catering holidays of a similar standard.
Timeshare buyers were also committing money they might need in the future if
they suffered changed circumstances, such as redundancy.
Champions of timeshare reject this view, arguing that it has the financial
edge over annual holidays because timeshare can be resold, whereas money
spent on holidays cannot be recovered.
But even while arguing that timeshare is cheaper than paying for holidays
each year, the industry's advocates agree that no one should buy timeshare
purely as an investment. When property was still an attractive proposition,
some thought that by buying timeshare they were investing in bricks and
mortar. This is not the case. Timeshare is merely the right to use
accommodation for a specified number of weeks each year.
The value of timeshare falls by 40 per cent or more as soon as it is bought
because a large proportion of the initial price goes towards paying the
resort developer's marketing costs. Peter Lewis, managing director of
PrimeShare, a large resale company, says timeshare does not regain its
original price until five years after purchase.
This means that before buying timeshare it is worth seeing what is available
from a resale company. Again, however, it pays to be cautious. Buying from a
resale company, as opposed to a resort developer, does not secure protection
by the new Timeshare Act, even the contract has been concluded in the UK.
This is because private vendors are not covered by the act and the resale
company is merely acting as their agent. Make sure the resale company offers
a 14-day cooling-off period.
Also ensure it intends to put your money in a designated account, supervised
by an accountant or qualified professional, until the transaction is
complete. Never deal with a resale company which is not a member of the
Timeshare Council.
In these recessionary times, it is not only buyers who are interested in
timeshare resale. Many existing owners are keen to sell. Some have received
calls asking whether they want to sell. If, as an existing owner, you get
such a call, ask for the name and telephone number of the company and say
you will call back when you have established that it is a member of the
council.
You will probably not hear from the company again. The chances are it has
obtained your name and number in an underhand fashion. The council has
received complaints about companies taking registration fees from existing
owners of up to Pounds 175 for each week owned, and failing to do anything
to achieve a sale.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Travel: In search of the shy tribe of Thailand - Justin
Wintle heads south from Bangkok into baking hot mountain country in pursuit
of a tiny timid people and is greeted with laughter

HAVING escaped the sticky velvet claws of Bangkok, I am in no hurry to
return. I decide, instead, to head south, all the way down the Kra isthmus
to the Malaysian border. My object is to visit a tribe called the Sakai.
My interest in the Sakai is twofold. In the first instance they are
Australasian-Negroids, sometimes called pygmy negritos. Having once
travelled around the Solomon Islands, I am curious to see for myself the
physical relationship between the Sakai and some of the black Melanesians
encountered in the South Pacific.
Secondly, more whimsically, I am chasing a different sort of memory. My
earliest forays into Thailand, in the mid-1970s, regularly took me to the
north of the country, beyond Chiang Mai. There, like other would-be
jungle-bashers of the period, I hunted out relatively unknown hill-tribes.
My happiest achievement was to have spent a week with the dog-eating,
opium-smoking Akhai, in a village to which even my hired guide refused to
accompany me. Since then, however, those remote mountain areas have been
opened up, and hill-tribe-visiting, among the Akhai, Meo and Karen, has
become a tourist routine.
The deep and mainly Moslem Thai south, on the other hand, has lagged behind
tourism's relentless exploitation of the country's human resources, and so
it is my hope to resavour some of the joy of original travel.
I take the early boat from Nathon to the mainland, weaving through smaller
islands of great beauty. Then it is a five-hour coach journey to Hat Yai,
about half-way to my intended destination.
Hat Yai, though, is more than a staging post. Rather, it is the south's
principal commercial city. Three long central streets provide a mart for
chattels of all sorts, including exotic birds and fish. What gives the place
its character is the identity of the shoppers: mainly Malaysians who have
streamed over the border at Sadao or Padang Besar in search of bargains or a
good time.
Like every other place in Thailand, Hat Yai has a smattering of tarts, only
more so. There are no go-go bars, though: for the Moslem customers a
non-alcoholic presentation is preferred.
Even so, in the wake of Aids, Hat Yai has been the cause of considerable
acrimony between the Thai and Malaysian governments. South of the border the
authorities have done what they can to discourage sex-trips; north of it,
officials have issued dubious disclaimers.
I check in at the Dusit J B, the hotel that seems most likely to offer me
comfort and least likely to give me a sexually transmitted disease.
Fortunately, my hunch is accurate on both counts. A new wing has rooms that
are probably superior to any others in a radius of several hundred
kilometres and no massage parlour-cocktail lounge-nightclub, although the
same cannot be said of the old wing.
Then I make my way to the regional tourist office. In no time at all, and
with the help of a local tour operator, a three-day programme is planned.
Mercifully, the only material about the Sakai available is half a typed page
that tells me they 'are content just living day to day eating this and
that,' and that 'their greatest fear is the fear of ghosts.'
The following day is spent loitering in the Hat Yai area, which mainly means
loitering around Songkhla, the adjacent port and resort city. I am taken to
a splendid seven-tiered waterfall at Ton Nga Chang which massages the eyes
and ears as no human agent could. Then it is eastwards and up another hill,
to the Institute for Southern Thai Studies' Folklore Museum, a scattering of
teak pavilions that contain, among many other traditional artefacts, an
unrivalled collection of personalised coconut graters.
A coconut grater in this part of the world is not a slim tin object you hang
on your kitchen wall. Rather, it is a low-lying stool, carved out of a
single block of wood, with a metallic blade inserted in the forward section.
In a country that offers more scope for individualism than anywhere else in
the Far East, these blocks have, over the centuries, taken on the forms of
various animals - tigers, rabbits, turtles, even small boys.
But perhaps the finest exhibits are the stunning views over nearby fishing
villages, with stilted prawneries stretching far into the sea, and across
Songkhla Lake. Thither I now descend. What is left of the afternoon and the
early evening is spent loitering on Samila Beach. Miss Ouyporn from the
tourist office gathers spiral shells from around the base of a deteriorating
and much-photographed golden mermaid and gives them to me: a simple
hospitality that puts even the offshore naval frigate in a kindly light.
But Miss Ouyporn, alas, has not been detailed to venture with me to Yala and
beyond, so my travels are now to be unleavened by the female presence.
Instead, they are increasingly hot. The temperature climbs steadily to 40`C
and higher. There is also a frisson of danger, as my (male) guide explains.
The southernmost provinces were once a communist stronghold, and although
there are no communists now, there are still a few 'outlaws' who have
somehow acquired 'war weapons.'
The road, running parallel but at a distance from the slanting Malaysian
border, is serviceable, the half-baked landscape thinly populated. A
disproportionate quantity of white Mercedes, not all of them bearing
Malaysian number-plates, kick up clouds of dust that pick out the road
ahead, as do a disproportionate quantity of small military convoys. In the
villages, where there should be gleaming temples, there are mosques instead.
We are now on the edge of a typhoon belt, though happily, in boiling April,
the belt is dormant. We pass through Chana, a nowhere village that boasts
one of the oddest festivals in Asia: a competition of singing doves. In a
small park a forest of tall bamboo poles stands ready and waiting for 1,000
cages to be hoisted aloft. The trills and cooing of the zebra doves, brought
by their owners from all over south-east Asia, are then keenly compared,
though with the poles only 1 metre or so apart and 3m-4m high it must be
hard to arrive at a clear winner.
After two hours the road forks: Pattani and Narathiwat to the left, Yala to
the right. We turn right. Hills and small mountains materialise. In one of
these there is a vast cave, as big as a provincial cathedral, and within is
a reclining Buddha, 25m long and 700 years old, a remnant of the Srijaya
civilisation of far-away Java.
At my insistence we spend too long at Wat Khuhaphimuk. The Buddha really is
impressive, the more so since I had no forewarning of it. But what makes the
place special, even unique, is the ragged gaping hole in the cave's roof.
Overgrown with twisted tropical flora on its circumference, it seems to
control the inflow of light so that the Buddha's vast closed-eyed face is
naturally illuminated without being woken. Spindly grey monkeys clamber up
the steep rockface to peer down through this vent. To see them from within
is a curious inversion of roles. One feels examined, as though a member of a
peculiar species that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the natural
order.
And so to Yala, which again surprises me, for it is not, as I had expected,
a scrubby southern market town but something of a garden city, painstakingly
laid out in concentric circles with a long and more or less prosperous
boulevard to boot.
We put up for the night at the Yala Rama, which is clean and modern enough,
but clearly a prostitute hotel. Notices in the lift proclaim three distinct
retail outlets: a nightclub, a cocktail lounge and a barber-shop backing
onto a snooker room, both offering massage.
On the morning of the third day we at last set off for the Sakai village, in
Than To district, Yala province. The road, snaking toward the border town of
Betong between steep and jagged mountains sporting heavy green jungle
plumage, is nothing short of glorious. We have entered one of the better of
Thailand's 63 national parks.
We stop first at the park's headquarters, to collect a ranger and his
antique rifle. From there it is a mere 30 minutes in our Toyota Carry Boy to
the Sakhai settlement, called Village No 3 in the Ban Rae sub-district.
It is a small place, eight huts and an open hall strewn on the side of a hot
hill overlooking a hotter valley, total population 37, the only Sakhai
domiciled in Thailand. As luck would have it, 25 of them, representing
one-twelfth of all the Sakai on the planet, are absent, visiting relatives
in Malaysia. But as luck also has it, the headman, Mr Lud, has stayed behind
with two of the womenfolk and two of the childfolk.
When I arrive, all five are seated in the open hall watching TV. In spite of
their legendary shyness, none of them runs away. They remain glued to the
box. Yet I manage to detach old Lud, a cheerful, smiling man. His features,
weathered and compressed, with upwardly exposed nostrils and reds insteads
of whites around the small brown eyes, are instantly recognisable, or would
be were I on Guadalcanal. Although he is 50-plus, he has the unspoilt torso
of a 12-year-old.
What is even better is Lud's volubility. Nor is there a language problem: he
speaks the same Malay as my guide. He tells me as much as anyone could be
told about the Sakhai in an hour.
Originally his people were nomadic, wandering to and fro across the frontier
at will. But the communist insurgency put a stop to that. Both governments
decided it would enhance security if the Sakhai put down roots, so most were
settled in Malaysia while a few ended up in Thailand. The village children
attend Thai schools, where they are taught the Thai language. It is left to
Mr Lud to teach them the Sakai language. It would, he says, break his heart
if the day ever came when no-one knew the rudiments of Sakhainese.
But does he like his new home, his new environment? Lud giggles. Things are
very nice. The huts are well-made, the government provides electricity, and
he likes the TV. The village itself is 10 years old. But there again, it is
different to the way he grew up.
As well as housing, his people have been granted some land. But land
ownership brings responsibilities. In the old days one simply scavenged in
the forest for food. Now, to an extent, the Sakai must earn their keep. They
produce four or five sheets of rubber a day, as well as a little coffee and
some coconuts. 'So we can make some money for ourselves, which we never had
before, to spend on rice, which we never ate before.'
Lud takes me across to his hut, vanishes for a few moments, and reappears
with some scrawny roots. These, it transpires, are the traditional herbal
medicines of his people, culled from the forest. They work against most
jungle diseases - he has never had malaria - but in the big world of
antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals, he finds they have no value.
What, I ask, does Mr Lud think will happen to him when he dies?
'Oh, religion, you mean. We find that very confusing. Of course we want to
go to heaven, but the Buddhists tell us the path lies this way, while the
Moslems say no, the path lies that way. Should we burn our dead, or bury
them?'
'But what did the Sakai believe in the past?' Again he giggles.
'Not a lot, I think. We were too busy enjoying ourselves, moving through the
jungle all the time. Or, if we did believe in anything, I've forgotten it
now.'
'And visitors? Does it annoy you when people like me arrive in your village
with a lot of questions and cameras?'
Mr Lud explodes with laughter.
'No, no, no. I love visitors. I wish we had more. You see, even with the TV,
even when everyone is here, it gets so lonely.'
I stand to leave. My guide puts in a question of his own. Can Mr Lud show us
his deadly blowpipe? For the first time he looks sad. Sorry, no blowpipe. He
had one, but he sold it to the local police chief for a measly sum.
The word from Village No 3 is that the Thai Sakai are well on their way to
being assimilated . . . all 37 of them.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Travel: On the trail of the true safari - Practical
Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORD 'safari' is not without controversy writes David Pilling. Take the
following extract from one travel brochure: 'Anyone who goes to Africa
without walking in the bush or sleeping in a tent has only been on holiday,
not on safari.'
This definition excludes many who would swear they had enjoyed the ultimate
wildlife experience, but it hints at the breadth of choice available. There
are package tours, adventure or luxury camping, stays in lodges or private
homesteads, safaris to two or more countries, activity safaris, even fly-in
safaris to remote areas.
Old Africa hands are prone to caricature package tours as the Costa del
Kenya, but off-the-rack tours can be good value. Take Hayes and Jarvis (tel:
081-748-5050), which offers seven days in Kenya's Tsavo and Amboseli
national parks from Pounds 499. Clients stay in basic campsites (putting up
their own tents) and travel in minibuses. Most tack on a week at the beach.
Thomson Holidays (071-431-2005) has a Worldwide brochure which includes
safari options in Kenya and Tanzania. One tour combining both countries
starts at Pounds 1,299, staying in lodges. Thomson guarantees a minibus
window seat.
Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-7795) organises slightly grander itineraries,
such as its 12-day luxury-tented tour built around the wildebeest migration
through Tanzania's Serengeti park. Departure is on February 13 1993 at an
all-inclusive cost of Pounds 2,224. The same company offers gorilla-tracking
in Zaire (Pounds 937 from Nairobi) and a 16-day Botswana tour for Pounds
2,338.
Bales (0306-885991) has similar deals, for example a 12-day escorted tour
through Zimbabwe and Botswana for Pounds 2,390. Its safaris are often
combined with Nile cruises. Twickers World (081-892-7606) concentrates on
Zambia ('unspoiled and relatively unsophisticated') and Zimbabwe. A 15-day
foray to Zambia's Luangwa Valley works out at just under Pounds 2,000. Kuoni
(071-374-6601) is generally a little cheaper, with safaris part of a
beach-holiday package in Kenya, Mauritius or the Seychelles.
With upmarket tours, flights should be scheduled, groups smaller,
itineraries more flexible and imaginative, accommodation better, transport
private (preferably in open-topped, four-wheel drive vehicles), and game
parks less crowded. Make sure you know precisely what you are paying for.
One way to ensure this is to have your safari tailor-made. Good companies
should listen to your requirements, which might include: particular types of
game or landscape, an aversion to tents, minimum travel by road, or a fear
of small aircraft. Your consultant should have bags of ideas, be realistic
about your budget, and have on-the-ground experience of the options being
offered.
Art of Travel (071-738-2038), with which I travelled to Namibia's
magnificent Skeleton Coast, is an extremely helpful and enthusiastic
company. Others in this category are Safari Consultants (0787-228-494),
Grenadier Travel (0206-549585) and Tempo Travel (081-361-1131).
The main safari countries are Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South
Africa as well as - to a lesser extent - Namibia, Malawi and Zambia. Gorilla
spotters go to Rwanda and Zaire.
Kenya is most popular (though sometimes crowded), with heart-rendingly
spectacular scenery. Tanzania's landscape is no less overwhelming and many
consider it Africa's greatest wildlife treasure, though economic
difficulties make for poor infrastructure and occasionally second-rate
accommodation. Zambia, rarely visited, has similar problems, but can be
outstandingly rewarding.
The scenery in Zimbabwe does not match that of east Africa, but there is
abundant wildlife, especially elephants. Botswana boasts the Okavango Delta,
while Namibia has desert wildlife and the famous Etosha national park.
Safaris are best in the dry season when grass is low and the game
congregates around water. Do not rule out the off-season, though. You may
see fewer animals but you will also see fewer fellow tourists.

FT  19 DEC 92 / Travel: Great Lakes and jumping mice - Practical Traveller

WHAT is it about Canada that invites so many jokes? Denis Leary, the
American comedian, says he wants a Patriot missile launcher so that he can
sit in his swimming pool 'and blow up Canada'. I have always liked the
place. It is not particularly boring. Some of it is lively: Toronto, for
example, which many fair-minded souls would rate among the best cities in
North America: spacious, friendly, some distinguished modern architecture,
always a lot happening, excellent shopping and food - and safe. Toronto is
said to have very few muggers. Critics say Toronto is more about style than
substance, but they are the sort of people who probably like Detroit.
Last winter, short-stay travel between Britain and Ontario picked up
smartly. The most popular short-stay products were minibreaks in Toronto
(including Niagara Falls) and Ottawa, resort visits (snow-mobiling, dog
sledding, and cross-country and downhill skiing), and winter fly-drive
tours. The London-Toronto flight takes about six hours, so you can leave
London on Friday morning, have two and three-quarter days there and be back
in London by Monday morning.
Globespan (0737-773055) is selling London-Toronto flights from Pounds 239
plus tax, with hotels from Pounds 36 per room per night. Thomas Cook
(0733-330111) has short breaks in Toronto and Ottawa from Pounds 334, plus
Niagara Falls, resort stays and winter fly-drive. Capture Canada
(081-393-0127) has Toronto three-night breaks from Pounds 319 and the same
for Ottawa from Pounds 324. Travescene and Crystal Holidays are joining the
fray.
Another operator, All Canada Travel and Holidays (0502-585825), offers
practically everything, including skiing, winter sports and city breaks.
An example is an eight-day, self-drive Ontario winter-break giving three
nights in Toronto and four nights at one of two Muskoka hotels, Pow Wow
Point Lodge or the well-equipped Deerhurst Resort, three hours' drive from
Toronto. Prices per person (twin-bedded room) are Pounds 348-Pounds 375, or
Pounds 628-Pounds 698 for singles. Prices include seven nights'
accommodation, five days' car hire and basic insurance, but not
trans-Atlantic flights.
Air-fares are reasonable at present. Air Canada (081-759-2636) recently cut
Pounds 50 off some winter fares. Until March 31 1993, excluding the
Christmas period, it will quote you Pounds 259 return: Heathrow, Glasgow or
Manchester to Toronto (some booking restrictions; minimum stay seven
nights). If you only want to stay the weekend, check fares with bucket shops
or agents. (Word to the wise: Air Canada is a no-smoking carrier,
trans-Atlantic flights and all).
Once winter passes, you might want to use Toronto as a base or launch-pad
for touring the Great Lakes. Not all at once, though. There are five Great
Lakes - Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior - with a total coastline
of 11,000 miles.
The Great Lakes region includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the US, and Ontario in Canada -
427,358 square miles, almost as large as the EC. There are 637 state parks,
two national parks, 191 downhill ski areas, 47,000 miles of snow-mobile
trails, more than 5,000 miles of cross-country ski trails, and 4,659 golf
courses.
I visited Deerhurst Resort recently, north of Toronto, and found it sporty
and relaxed. It has facilities for almost everything. Close by is Algonquin
provincial park, excellent for canoeing (more than 800 miles of canoe
routes), backpacking, fishing and wildlife. As well as moose, black bears
and other big things, Algonquin hosts two members of the jumping mice
family, the meadow jumping mouse and the woodland jumping mouse. Not many
people know that.
From Deerhurst, I returned to Toronto, took the train to Windsor, crossed
the US border into Michigan (close your eyes when passing through Detroit)
and drove 180 miles, via Kalamazoo, to the eastern shore of Lake Michigan,
stopping at one of the most picturesque and charming small fishing ports -
South Haven - you could hope to find. If you make it to South Haven and are
travelling with the chairman's wife, try and stay at the Old Harbour Inn
(515 Williams St, tel: (616)-637-8480. You will not find better-appointed
jacuzzi suites or nicer beds for. . . 11,000 miles.
