FT  30 OCT 92 / Currency board warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency boards, which issue local notes and coins convertible into a
foreign reserve at a fixed rate, are unlikely to solve the long-term
problems of monetary instability in east European countries, Ms Anna
Schwartz, a monetary expert and colleague of Mr Milton Friedman, said last
night, Emma Tucker writes.
Speaking at the annual Wincott lecture in London, Ms Schwartz said such a
system would not work because political authorities in modern democracies do
not want to give up discretion over monetary policy.
However, the example of Argentina, which has recently established a currency
board arrangement whereby the peso is fixed to the US dollar, suggests
'rules rather than discretion are now thinkable by heads of government',
said Ms Schwartz.

<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-biggest US steel group, blamed continuing
recession and intense competition for increased third-quarter losses.
The company posted a net loss of Dollars 72m, or 92 cents a share, on sales
which fell 9.8 per cent to Dollars 1.01bn. A year earlier, it had a deficit
of Dollars 60.6m, or 88 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.12bn.
Bethlehem said its wider third-quarter deficit reflected lower realised
steel prices, an unfavourable change in product mix and higher employment
costs.
Mr Walter Williams, chairman, said: 'We expect that (the) intensely
competitive market will continue over the near-term and that we will not
return to profitability in the fourth quarter.' Mr Williams is retiring this
week and will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive by Mr Curtis
Barnette.
Third-quarter results from LTV, the US steel group which has been operating
for five years under the protection of bankruptcy courts, were also hurt by
depressed steel prices and higher employment costs. The company turned in an
underlying third-quarter net loss of Dollars 9.2m.
During the quarter, LTV posted a Dollars 625m gain on the sale of its
missiles and aircraft businesses to a group made up of Loral, Carlyle Group
and Northrop. This helped LTV report net income of Dollars 615.8m for the
three months to September 30.
A year earlier, LTV had net income of Dollars 115.5m, including an income
tax refund of Dollars 129.7m.
Sales in the latest quarter were Dollars 944m, compared with restated sales
of Dollars 940m last year.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: DSM earnings fall sharply in
third period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, saw its profits fall by more than half in
the third quarter under the combined influence of industry-wide
overcapacity, the slowdown in economic growth, cheap imports from eastern
Europe and the strength of the guilder against other currencies.
The company cautioned that fourth-quarter results, excluding extraordinary
items, were also expected to be lower.
Net profit in the latest quarter dropped by 55 per cent to Fl 53m (Dollars
30.3m) from Fl 117m a year earlier.
The sharply lower figures dragged results for the first nine months down to
Fl 263m from Fl 451m in 1991.
The figures, which were lower than predicted by most analysts, caused DSM's
shares to fall by 9.2 per cent to close down Fl 7.80 at Fl 77.20.
DSM said profit margins were hit hardest in its hydrocarbon, polymer, base
chemicals and fertiliser businesses. By contrast, engineering plastics
showed a slight improvement, it said, without giving details.
Overall, operating profit was down 65 per cent at Fl 46m. The net profit
figure of Fl 55m includes Fl 10m in extraordinary gains resulting from the
disposal of Chem-Y in Germany.
A year earlier, DSM's results had been lifted by Fl 15m in extraordinary
gains.
Third-quarter turnover fell by 6 per cent to Fl 2.1bn. Although DSM's sales
volume was down just 2 per cent, turnover showed a larger drop because of an
average 5 per cent decline in selling prices and because of the weakness of
the dollar against the guilder. The fall in sales volume was attributed
mainly to a downturn in fertilisers and in cracker products.

<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, may take legal action against the
hostile ADollars 8.80 a share takeover bid by Campbell Soup of the US,
Reuter reports from Sydney.
'It is far too early to say . . . but one of the steps that could be taken
is legal action,' Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts chairman, said after the company's
annual meeting.
Campbell already has 33 per cent of Arnotts and its bid values the company
at ADollars 1.2bn (UDollars 857m). It needs just over 17 per cent
acceptances to gain control of Arnotts.
Mr Sandy Dawson, an Arnotts shareholder and former managing director, urged
legal action at the annual meeting, saying Campbell had gone back on
undertakings that it would not increase its stake beyond 40 per cent.
Mr Dick Shea, president of Campbell Soup's global biscuit and bakery
division, said in Australia that his company had no plans to lift the
ADollars 8.80 a share offer for Arnotts.
'We believe that the figure is a very valid and wholesome offer,' Mr Shea
said.
'There are really no facts from this morning that would cause us to change
that offer,' he said, referring to earlier opposition voiced at the Arnotts
annual meeting by Mr Purdy and shareholders.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: IBM to offer chips to external
customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest producer of
semiconductor devices, has unveiled plans to begin offering its products to
external customers.
Until now, IBM's large chip plants in Europe, Japan and the US have served
only the company's internal needs.
The new focus of IBM's semiconductor operations is the latest in a series of
sweeping changes within the company over the past year.
Last December, Mr John Akers, chairman, announced plans to transform IBM
into a 'federation of free-standing businesses'.
Unlike IBM's end-user product divisions, such as its personal computer
operation, the technology products division - which includes IBM's
semiconductor production operations - has been largely hidden from public
view until now.
However, technology products generate annual revenue of about Dollars 8bn,
said Mr Michael Attardo, IBM vice-president and general manager of
technology products.
IBM's strategy in the semiconductor market will be to compete as a supplier
of sub-systems, said Mr Attardo.
'This is because for some time most of the chips that we have been
delivering to internal customers are in the form of sub-systems,' he said.
'We will focus on the information technology market because those
applications are IBM core competencies. Clearly, computers and peripherals
will be our initial market focus.'
IBM will be a significant new competitor for established semiconductor
manufacturers.
However, Mr Attardo said that by entering the semiconductor market place
now, at a point where US manufacturers were gaining ground in the world
market, would strengthen the US micro-electronics industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAKER Canadian dollar and lower costs helped Noranda, the Toronto-based
resources group, overcome volatile commodity markets in the third quarter.
The company cautioned that recovery in its businesses was continuing only at
a very slow pace. Zinc prices, which contributed substantially to higher
metals earnings in the third quarter, have moved down sharply in recent
weeks.
Net earnings were CDollars 26m, (USDollars 21m) or six cents a share,
compared with a CDollars 57m loss a year earlier, equivalent to a loss of 39
cents a share. Revenues climbed to CDollars 2.18bn from CDollars 2bn, and
interest charges fell to CDollars 85m from CDollars 105m.
Cash flow from operations almost tripled in the third quarter to CDollars
284m, but long-term debt climbed to CDollars 4.8bn on Sept 30 from CDollars
4.5bn a year earlier.
Earnings from mining and metals rose to CDollars 48m from CDollars 7m,
largely due to a more favourable currency, the healthier zinc market and
productivity improvements.
Forestry earnings were CDollars 6m, compared with a CDollars 20m loss. While
demand for lumber, panelboard and paperboard has strengthened, prices for
pulp, newsprint and most other types of paper remain below levels a year
ago.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dasa, Fokker reach takeover deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany is to pay Fl 880m (Dollars 503m) for a
51 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft builder, under an agreement
reached yesterday after several months of intense negotiation with the Dutch
government.
The deal, which ushers in a major restructuring of Europe's regional
aerospace industry, calls for Dasa to pay Fl 37 per share for the 10.6m
shares owned by the Dutch state and the 13.2m new shares to be issued by
Fokker.
This price, which had been widely leaked to the press, is well above
Fokker's closing price of Fl 17.80 on Wednesday. The shares were suspended
all day yesterday because of conflicting initial reports on whether or not a
definitive deal had been agreed.
The delay in announcing the deal was caused by the precise wording of the
contract's references to the future of the Fokker 50, a 50-seater turbo-prop
launched in the mid-1980s with the help of government funds.
Mr Koos Andriessen, minister of economic affairs, sought guarantees that the
Fokker 50 would be safeguarded.
The aircraft is a direct competitor to the ATR-42, built jointly by
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Dasa is planning to sell parts
of its Fokker stake to the French and Italian companies later in the 1990s
to create a European regional aircraft consortium.
Both sides have now agreed that production of the Fokker 50, which generates
25 per cent of the company's turnover, can be halted, if necessary, provided
that the move does not threaten Fokker's 'continuity'.
Mr Andriessen said that this gave him 'reasonable' confidence about the
aeroplane's future.
Fokker, which also produces the 100-seater Fokker 100, welcomed the deal
because Dasa has promised to give it the leading role in aircraft with
between 65 and 130 seats. This means that Fokker can continue developing a
new aircraft, the Fokker 70.
The takeover has proved to be controversial in the Netherlands, sparking
debates about industrial policy and the position of minority shareholders in
Dutch listed companies.
Under a preliminary agreement signed in July, the state will use half the
proceeds to buy shares in a new Fokker holding company to be set up by Dasa.
However, it will have to sell this 22 per cent holding within three years.
Yesterday's accord must still be submitted to the unions and the European
Commission for approval.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has privatised its largest state-owned steel mill, selling 80 per
cent of Aceros Parana to a consortium led by Techint, an Argentine
industrial conglomerate for Dollars 409m.
Techint, the only company to bid for Aceros Parana, is one of Argentina's
largest industrial groups and owner of the Siderca and Propulsora specialty
steel companies. It bought Aceros Parana, previously called Somisa, in
alliance with Usiminas and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil and Chile's
CAP.
The buyers offered Dollars 140m in cash, plus Dollars 12.1m in foreign debt
certificates, which trade at half their face value.
They are to spend a further Dollars 12.6m to comply with Argentina's rigid
labour laws which force them to sack and re-hire Aceros Parana's 5,800
employees. Furthermore, the buyers must take on Dollars 250m in financial
and contractual liabilities.
Aceros Parana suffered large losses in 1991, when sales of about Dollars
500m were outstripped by losses of Dollars 570m. The buyers expect it to
move into the black in 1995 with a Dollars 37m profit.
Techint - which is injecting Dollars 50m into the venture - is likely to own
30 per cent of the new group, while Usiminas is expected to hold 5 per cent.

THE CRISIS in Finnish banking prompted Moody's, the US rating agency, to
downgrade the debt of five Finnish banks yesterday.
The move affects Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Union Bank of Finland,
Okobank, Skopbank and Finnish Real Estate Bank (a Skopbank subsidiary), with
a total of Dollars 14.4bn in outstanding debt.
KOP's senior debt was downgraded to A3 from A2 and its subordinated debt to
Baa1 from A3. UBF's senior debt was lowered to A3 from A1 and its
subordinated debt to Baa1 from A2. Okobank's senior debt dropped to A2 from
Aa3 and subordinated debt to A3 from A1. KOP and UBF had their commercial
paper ratings cut to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
Moody's said its main concern for the three was the increasing level of
non-performing loans and credit write-offs.
With Skopbank and the Finnish Real Estate Bank, Moody's said its main worry
was 'weakening fundamentals,' given the continuing fall in asset values.
Skopbank saw its senior debt downgraded to A2 from Aa3, while the Finnish
Real Estate Bank's senior debt was lowered to A1 from Aa2.

<TEXT>
UNION BANK of Switzerland, the country's largest commercial bank, said group
profit for 1992 would be up from 1991 due to improved cash flow, Reuter
reports from Zurich.
UBS said trading results in the third quarter were excellent. After-tax
consolidated cashflow in the first nine months was below budget, but still
higher than in the same period a year ago.
'Assuming no unforeseen events occur, the results for the current year
should be better than last year's,' it said. A number of Swiss equity
analysts have forecast UBS's group net profit will rise by between 10 per
cent and 14 per cent this year from last year's record SFr1.22bn (Dollars
890m).
The parent company assets rose by SFr2.2bn in the third quarter to
SFr204.2bn.
The bank, which had already said it expected improved earnings this year,
said personnel and general expenses were below budget in the third quarter.
'The necessary depreciation and provisions are expected to remain high in
1992,' it said. 'The ensuing increase in cash flow should nonetheless spell
a year-on-year improvement in group results,' it added.
UBS said the good third-quarter result, which it did not quantify, largely
reflected peak earnings in foreign exchange and banknote trading, although
trading in securities failed to match results of the two preceding quarters.

DATA General reported a small profit in its fourth quarter as the US

profitability.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 500,000, or 1 cent per share. During
its fourth quarter last year, the company reported net income of Dollars
18.4m, or 50 cents per share. Revenues were Dollars 288.2m, down from
Dollars 295.6m last year but above those in the immediately preceding

On Wall Street, Data General's share price fell sharply on news of the
results to close at Dollars 10 7/8 down 2 1/8 from Wednesday's close.
Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, said: 'Our challenge is to
further increase revenues while improving our operating margins.
'While we remain very cautious for the short term in light of worldwide
economic conditions, which continue to negatively impact the industry, we
believe we are well positioned to be successful.'
For the full year, the group suffered a net loss of Dollars 62.5m, or
Dollars 1.91. The loss includes a restructuring charge of Dollars 48m from
costs associated with job cuts announced in April.
In fiscal 1991, it recorded net income of Dollars 85.6m, or Dollars 2.45 per
share, which included a one-time gain of Dollars 13m from the sale of its
Japanese subsidiary.
Revenues were Dollars 1.12bn, compared with Dollars 1.23bn for 1991 year.
The 1992 revenues were reduced by the sale of its Japanese subsidiary,
Nippon-Data General.
Revenues from the Japanese market place were Dollars 53m lower than the same
period last year.

A high-definition digital videocassette recorder that uses cassettes about
three-quarters the size of a standard VHS tape and has a playback time of
two hours has been developed by NEC of Japan.
Previously, digital VCR gave high-quality recording but lacked superior
compression technology, so the machines were large and cumbersome.
NEC's new Hi-Vision digital VCR uses a picture compression technique that
achieves very high compression rates without spoiling the picture; a
magnetic head for which NEC claims the highest recording density in the
industry; and new ultra-thin (11 micron) tape.
In combination, these technologies compress the signal to about one/fifth
the conventional rate. NEC sees applications in the home and for
large-screen displays. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6511.

<TEXT>
Smelly shoes will be controlled within five years under the new UK
Environmental Protection Act, writes Daniel Green.
The problem is not sweaty feet but solvent-based adhesives used to glue
soles and uppers. The solvent escapes into the atmosphere during
manufacture, contravening rules on emissions.
Green alternatives have problems: hot melt adhesives require new and
expensive specialised machinery, while traditional water-based glues slow
the production line so the water can evaporate, and can fail when the shoe
gets wet.
Adhesives-maker Evode thinks it has come up with a solution. Its Aquadur
footwear glue is a suspension in water rather than a solution so once it has
set it resists water.
A test batch of 100 dozen pairs of ladies shoes using Aquadur will go on
sale at Marks and Spencer before Christmas. Evode: UK, 0785 57755.

The relentless search for new ways to package consumer products has taken a
new turn with the launch of a revolutionary system intended to put the fizz
back into bottled soda water.
LMG Fibrenyle, part of the Canadian packaging company Lawson Mardon, has
developed a patented system for Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages which combines
the appearance of a glass soda syphon with a 1.5 litre PET (polyethylene
terephthalate) bottle.
Instead of the traditional glass soda syphon, the system is based on a
'petasol', LMG Fibrenyle's pioneering plastic aerosol. The system maintains
the fizz until the syphon is empty, unlike the immediate loss of carbonation
when a conventional bottle of soda water is opened.
The PET container is lighter and safer than glass, and can also hold twice
as much liquid. LMG Fibrenyle: UK, 0502 713700.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology: Stamping out food poisoning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK claimed a world first this week in the battle for improved food
safety with the launch of a Pounds 7m scheme that uses computer models to
predict the growth, death and survival of common food-poisoning bacteria.
The new product, Food Micromodel, could make a major contribution to the
food industry's competitiveness by speeding up development times in
fast-growing product sectors such as convenience foods. It is already
generating worldwide interest.
The scheme, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, could also allay public
worries about potential health hazards from ready-to-cook and other foods
following recent outbreaks of poisoning by Salmonella or Listeria bacteria.
Nicholas Soames, the food minister, said the product offered 'huge benefits'
to the food industry. It would not have been possible without collaboration
between the food industry and the public sector.
The aim of the scheme is to reduce the need for the food industry to use
time-consuming 'challenge-testing' to measure the bacterial safety of food.
These are only relevant to the foods and conditions tested.
In contrast, Food Micromodel will use a comprehensive database drawn up from
tests over the past three years, along with commercial and academic data, to
generate predictions for how a particular bacteria would behave in a wide
range of foods and conditions.
The system could be used by a food manufacturer to discover quickly the
microbiological consequences of, for example, reducing a product's salt
content. Alternatively, a user could check which formulation for a new
product most effectively inhibited the growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
The ministry has licensed Food Micromodel to the Gloucestershire-based
Campden Food and Drink Research Association which, along with five other
research organisations, will provide expert centres for users to contact by
telephone.
Soames made clear that Food Micromodel will be self-financing from 1994,
when the ministry's five-year involvement in the product ends. A Food
Micromodel hotline has been set up on 0386 840274.

today as head of Hewlett-Packard, gives Louise Kehoe his thoughts on US
industrial competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Young is vacating the corner office on Hewlett-Packard's 'executive
row' this week, but he is not giving up his 10-year crusade to boost the
international competitiveness of US industries.
'Securing America's technological leadership is one of the most critical
issues we must address in order to ensure the health of our economy and our
nation's competitiveness,' says Young.
It is a message that the HP president and chief executive has delivered many
times over the past decade. Young's calls to make technology leadership a
national priority have been given a new edge, however, by his recent
decision to publicly endorse Bill Clinton, the democratic presidential
candidate.
A life-long republican, Young shocked colleagues when he joined Clinton at a
campaign rally in Silicon Valley last month. It is now evident, however,
that Young has been instrumental in shaping Clinton's 'private sector-led,
government-encouraged' National Technology Policy.
By choosing sides, Young has made competitiveness an issue in the race for
the White House. His action has also sparked rumours that he may be slated
for a role in the cabinet of would-be president Clinton.
This is not the first time that Young has been viewed as a prospective
candidate for political office. In the past, however, he has defused such
talk by insisting that he 'already has a job'.
No more. Young, 60, retires after a 15-year stint at the helm of
Hewlett-Packard during which the company has been transformed from a
manufacturer of electronic instruments and calculators into one of the
world's leading computer suppliers. Annual revenues have grown from Dollars
1.3bn (Pounds 800m) at the beginning of his tenure to an expected Dollars
16bn this year.
Yet as he ends his career at HP, it is Young's dogged efforts to persuade
successive US administrations to recognise the critical role that technology
could play in putting American industry back on to a growth track that are
commanding attention.
Young began his mission in 1983 when he was drafted by President Reagan to
head a commission on industrial competitiveness. Although the commission
succeeded in drawing attention to declining US technological leadership, its
call to action was rebuffed by the Reagan administration.
Bitterly disappointed, but determined to move forward, in 1985 Young formed
the Council on Competitiveness, a private-sector, bipartisan group which
includes industry leaders, academics and labour representatives. (Not to be
confused with Vice President Dan Quayle's council of the same name, which
critics charge is a 'haven for special interests' because it has halted the
implementation of numerous environmental and other regulations.)
In a seminal report published last year, the council called for Bush to
'announce his intention to increase dramatically the share of federal
research and development expenditures that support critical generic
technologies'. The president responded by approving joint projects between
industry and the federal laboratories.
Young also gives the president credit for 'some real progress in moving from
a science policy to a science and technology policy,' and hails the
administration's acknowledgment of the role of the government in supporting
generic pre-competitive research and development as a 'landmark change'.
Young regards much of the competitiveness agenda as bipartisan. He has been
won over, nonetheless, by Clinton's enthusiastic response. 'America cannot
continue to rely on trickle-down technology from the military to maintain
competitiveness in its high-tech and manufacturing industries,' argues the
democratic candidate.
Clinton has pledged to refocus the work of the federal laboratories on
technologies that enhance industrial performance; establish education and
training programmes for highly skilled jobs; create a civilian research and
development programme; and offer tax incentives for private-sector research
and development.
One democratic proposal that has excited Young is the plan to invest public
funds in a '21st century infrastructure', a national communications network
that would serve as a 'technology driver'. This would set a fast pace for
related developments in the private sector.
Yet isn't there an element of self-interest in an electronics company
executive championing technology? 'Technology is key to winning the
competitiveness battle,' Young maintains. 'The health of America's high-tech
industry isn't only the concern of that industry, because technology has
benefits that cut across different industries and drive national
productivity and economic growth.'
The whole country, rather than just the high-tech industry, or indeed HP,
would be the beneficiaries, he asserts. Declining competitiveness has a
direct impact on individuals, Young stresses. 'Our ability to increase our
standard of living and that of our children is at risk,' he says.
With republicans and democrats apparently agreed upon the importance of
pursing industrial competitiveness, why is Young backing Clinton?
'It is not just a matter of technology policy, it is a matter of
leadership,' says Young. Clinton, he believes, has the ability 'to get over
this gridlock that we have in Washington (between the administration and
Congress) and make changes.'
Little wonder that some people in Washington believe Young will be invited
to join Clinton's cabinet, if he is elected. Betraying at least a mild
interest, Young observes that 'the worst thing that could happen would be
for Clinton to win and the liberals to take over his agenda. The best thing
we in the business community could do would be to give him our support for a
centric position'.
So will Young go to Washington to help Clinton be a 'centric' president? 'It
is hard to comment on something that is so speculative,' he demurs. After 15
years on the firing line in the electronics industry, Young says that he
would like to take six months to decide 'what I want to do with the rest of
my time'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: Drug prices that bear some interesting comparisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C SONABEND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Paul Abrahams' article 'Cost of prescribed drug
ingredients rises 22 per cent' (October 23), it seems to me the cost is
based on 'get as much as you can' from Britain's National Health Service.
As a diabetic I am naturally interested in the cost of insulin and during my
recent travels I have found some interesting cost comparisons. The retail
price of a bottle of insulin manufactured by a Danish company is Dollars 16
in the US and FFr38 in France; though free on prescription in the UK the
bottle is priced at Pounds 14.99.
When I asked the Department of Health for an explanation I was fobbed off
with gobbledegook. No wonder the NHS is short of funds.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: Consultants and 'hazy' reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack, in his objective overview of the present management
consultancy scene (FT Survey, 'Focus has to sharpen', October 21), comments
that some larger firms see professional associations as 'a waste of time'.
I am bound to accept that his comment is accurate. And that is regrettable
because, without the involvement of the large-firm consultants, the
profession can number only one in four of practitioners in the UK. There are
at least 6,000 consultants practising ethically and competently beneath the
banner of their firm's commercial reputation.
If those consultants were to join their independent professional body,
clients would benefit from a strong profession that would, in time, draw in
all ethical and competent practitioners - and would exclude all those who
were not.
The terms 'qualified' and 'unqualified' would then take on real meaning; and
management consultants would no longer have to be concerned that, as Mr Jack
so well expresses it, 'their reputation as professionals remains hazy'.

Sir, Dominic Lawson's stress (October 24) on the need for companies to pay
more attention to customers in a recession is expanded impressively by the
report on sales-people by Sales and Marketing Solutions of York ('Shaken
sales staff slip up on job', October 26). Throughout 1992, as ordinary
consumers, my wife and I have had sales-people-related problems in parting
with modest amounts of money to buy shoes, compact discs and, most recently,
cars for each of us. My wife's request to change her VW Polo for the latest
model was met with disbelief and it was only by showing impatience and
insisting she was not window-shopping but wanted to buy a car that she
succeeded. I put in a request to garages for figures to change my own
G-registered vehicle in July and received no response. As an experiment,
this month I tried 10 car dealers (Peugeot, Renault, VW-Audi, Mercedes-Benz
etc). Only three dealers responded immediately and only one of them
(Mercedes-Benz) was animated and keen enough to ensure I changed the car.
When I read in your pages of a recession in the UK car industry, I now add
mentally 'largely self-induced'.

Not an organisation renowned for its openness, the Foreign Office on
Wednesday took the unusual step of issuing journalists with an internal
memorandum throwing doubt on the acceptability of Danish proposals for
clarifying the Maastricht treaty.
But it was all an unfortunate mistake, embarrassed officials now declare.
The memo was stapled to a batch of documents on Hong Kong prepared for
release to the press. So even the Foreign Office could not deny its
existence. But, true to form, it stated that the memo was already out of
date.

Lord Tebbit, former Conservative party chairman, still knows how to hit
where it hurts. So what better place to deliver his keynote speech on Europe
last night than the Salisbury club in Henley, constituency of Michael
Heseltine, perhaps the foremost pro-European in John Major's cabinet.
First, he questioned Hezza's pro-EC credentials. 'I do not advocate leaving
the European Community. I supported our membership when your MP was hostile
to the Community and I still do.'
Next, he attacked his apparent unwillingness to debate the Maastricht
treaty. 'When your MP and I were invited by Lord Joseph to share a platform
provided by the Centre for Policy Studies to debate the treaty, I accepted
and he refused.'
Finally, he criticised 'the grotesque farce of Heseltine's presentation of
government coal policy'. With party colleagues like these . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden transfer of Robert Priddle out of his job as deputy secretary
responsible for energy matters at the Department of Trade and Industry
followed uncomfortably close on the heels of the recent debacle over coal
pit closures.
The DTI, which has put Priddle in charge of the corporate and consumer
affairs division, insists that this 'career move' simply frees the
department from any accusation that the review of energy policy on which it
has now embarked was in danger of being pre-judged.
The review will be headed instead by Priddle's successor, Charles Henderson,
a 53-year-old civil servant who is also a qualified actuary. Henderson has
done spells in various energy divisions of government, though his most
recent post was as head of the Office of Arts and Libraries.
Described by colleagues as personable and endowed with the necessary sense
of humour, he includes mountaineering among his interests - doubtless of
much use as he labours with the piles of paper which the three-month energy
review is certain to produce.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Observer: Tyson packs a punch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Bill Clinton does indeed win the US election, who will be the chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers? Will it be an FOB - 'Friend of Bill' - or
an academic high-flyer?
During the campaign, Clinton has relied heavily on the ideas of Robert
Reich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government and old friend from
his Oxford days, and Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, a
Washington think-tank. Though both would play important roles in a Clinton
presidency, neither seems right for the CEA.
Reich - a guru in the Jacques Attali mould - seems more likely to serve as a
top policy adviser in the White House, while Shapiro may get a senior post
at the Office of Management and Budget.
Among the academics, two of the most obvious choices for the post are Larry
Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, and Alan Blinder, a Princeton
professor and columnist for Business Week. Paul Krugman of MIT is also a
strong contender.
Summers has a combative personality and can offer first-hand experience of
policy-making in a large bureaucracy, although his role as a senior adviser
in the ill-fated Dukakis campaign might count against him.
Maybe the dark horse is Laura D'Andrea Tyson. As Arkansas governor, Clinton
had a female chief of staff for many years and gained a reputation for
promoting women. Tyson, a professor at the University of California's
Berkeley campus, made a strong impression at economic briefings in Little
Rock and shares some of Clinton's economic prejudices. She believes the US
should play hardball on trade, and should seek reciprocal concessions before
opening its markets. She also advocates a national strategy to promote
high-tech industries. That should go down well in Silicon Valley.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Nowhere else to go: Major deserves total support in next
week's Maastricht vote despite the treaty's flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever else may be said about the prime minister, and much of it has been
said here, his determination to press ahead with ratification of the
Maastricht treaty is wholly to his credit. He deserves, on this matter,
total support, starting with a Yes vote at the end of next Wednesday's
debate. He is doing his best to achieve this, by using a combination of
charm and whips' threats to reduce the number of Tory rebels.
Mr Major's detractors might argue that he has no option, that his personal
future depends on his being able to demonstrate that he can reassert his
authority over the Conservative party. To that end he must get the wretched
ratification bill through. Agreed, but there is a more noble reason for
voting Yes. It is, simply, that Britain is in Europe whether it likes it or
not. That means taking part in whatever games the big nations, particularly
France and Germany, are playing at any given time. This perception has
informed the policies of every prime minister since Harold Macmillan
conceded, in July 1961, that the British-inspired European Free Trade Area,
a ring of seven dwarfs around the then European Economic Community, was no
substitute for the real thing.
Yes, I did say 'every' prime minister. Lady Thatcher would doubtless oppose
the Single European Act with all the force at her command were it to be
introduced today. As Mrs Margaret Thatcher she whipped it through with a
determination at least equal to the stubbornness of which Mr Major is
accused by the Euro-phobes when it comes to the Maastricht bill.
The prime minister's answer to a question in the House on Tuesday summarises
his approach. 'I believe that we have had three historic mistakes over the
last 30 years in European policy,' he said. 'The first was when we failed to
join the Community at the outset.' In fact it was Anthony Eden, a failed
prime minister to whom Mr Major has over recent weeks been compared, whose
government declined to send even an observer to the Messina gathering of
foreign ministers of the six in 1956. It was there that work began on the
Treaty of Rome, while Britain dreamed on, tossing and turning as it relived
its imperial past.
The Rome treaty was signed on March 25 1957, 10 weeks after Eden's
departure. Its signatories' mission, contained in the opening words of the
preamble, was to 'lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the
peoples of Europe'. The other two 'historic mistakes' referred to by the
prime minister on Tuesday were, of course, the French vetoes exercised in
1963 and 1967. 'Today,' said Mr Major, 'we have more of a chance than ever
we have had before of building a European Community in the image that we in
this country wish to see.'
Had it not been a poor season in which to do so, he might have concluded
with words penned in 1989 by the president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael
Heseltine: 'The conditions which made it possible for Britain to be
semi-detached from Europe for so long have vanished forever. There is no
empire to sustain us; we are no longer an industrial super-power; we can no
longer pretend that Britain is in any sense an equal partner of the US.
There is nowhere for us to go except as part of a European consortium.' Mr
Major is no wordsmith. But he did quite well yesterday, pointing out that
'people who work in Sony factories in Wales and Nissan factories in the
north' would not regard it as sensible to call into question the UK's
commitment to Europe.
I suspect that it is this kind of thinking that led Mr Kenneth Clarke to
accept the Maastricht deal without reading the fine print. The home
secretary had no need to strain his eyesight. Having given negotiation its
best shot, the government, including all its ministers, can only accept the
deal that at least 10 of the 12 members of the EC are willing to sign. I
have ploughed through the treaty and, like many others, wish that some of
the things that are there were not. The dread Commission pops its prying
head into every sub-clause that matters, including those from which it is
asked, in this or that main clause or elsewhere, to exclude itself.
Subsidiarity is a wonderful concept, but a proper definition remains
elusive.
This kind of thing greatly exercises the Euro-phobes, who have learned to
quote chapter and verse at every stage of every argument. The threats thus
conjured up certainly are frightening. Some government ministers attempt to
soothe us by asserting that the Europeans take little notice of the
legalities, so there is nothing to fear. Some pro-Europeans sigh and ask
whether anyone has thought of the spirit of European integration.
All of this is beside the point. There is one unanswerable argument for
ratifying Maastricht: Britain has nowhere else to go. When even the Swiss
knock on the door of the future European Union, opponents of British
membership have lost their last rational objection. 'Very well, alone' was a
brave and stirring battle-cry half a century ago; today it is the pathetic
bleat of the self-deluded. We would be well advised to stay with our
partners even if the Maastricht treaty had been expressly federalist in
intent. If the exchange rate mechanism is seen to be still in working order
in a year or so, we will be begging to rejoin that. In the highly unlikely
event of a single currency being established, we will, sooner or later, be
on our knees pleading to participate.
It may be protested that if Denmark can reject the treaty, as they have done
once and may do again, then Britain should have the same opportunity. But
Denmark is not one of the great powers of Europe. It is not burdened by a
long history of obstructive opposition to every step the others take. It
does not need to prove its commitment. Britain does. If it rats on
Maastricht now it will pay a high price.
Mr John Smith is well aware of all this. He has been a strong European since
at least October 1971, when he defied the whips and voted for entry. Yet the
leader of the Labour party has chosen this week to hide behind quibbles over
the Danish position in an effort to justify a No vote next Wednesday. Lest
that be seen through, Labour is arguing that what will be on offer is a vote
of confidence in Mr Major, which they feel obliged to oppose. Every vote
these days is a vote of confidence in the prime minister, but Labour's
position is pure humbug. It has moved from being the party of Europe to
being the party of Europe-when-it-suits-us.
If there really was a possibility of forcing a general election Labour's
position might be defensible. Mr Smith knows as well as anybody that this is
not on. Yesterday the prime minister promised a substantive motion to be
debated 'on its merits'. That should retain the support of the Liberal
Democrats while shaming Labour. Mr Major's personal position is primarily
dependent upon how quickly the recession is conquered. A defeat next week
might finish him. A Yes vote would boost his authority, and ease the passage
of the ratification bill. It would not clear away the blizzard of misfortune
which has struck the prime minister since Black Wednesday. That may run
right through the winter.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With rumours mounting that the government is set to suspend the pay
review bodies ('Salary review bodies could be overridden', October 28) the
UK's 38,000 midwives are quite rightly feeling angry and betrayed.
The pay review body may not have always delivered exactly what midwives
wanted, but it has always been seen to be fair, to have provided stability
and to have removed midwives from confrontation with government. Midwives
have promised never to strike in pursuit of pay claims; they care too much
for their clients' welfare. In recognition they only ask that the government
deals fairly with them. Suspending the pay review body would challenge this
trust.
It cannot be right that the existence of the pay review body should be
sacrificed on the altar of a public sector pay freeze.
As general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, I have written,
together with my colleague at the Royal College of Nursing, to John Major,
the prime minister, seeking urgent clarification of this situation. It
cannot be right for Britain's midwives to pay for the hoped for economic
recovery in this way.

dangers
</HEADLINE>

   From Mr RICHARD CORBETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson's point ('Manifesto of despair', October 19) on
competition among EC member states to cut costs leading to 'pressure to cut
out all forms at economic activity which are not immediately profitable' is
a pertinent one. The other member states are all acutely aware of this
danger. That is why they have agreed the social protocol annexed to the
Maastricht treaty in order to lay down minimum social standards that cannot
be undercut by states seeking to gain competitive advantage by devaluing
social standards.
The UK government did accept this argument when it comes to environmental
standards, consumer protection, public health requirements and a host of
other areas.
It is a shame that, for reasons of misguided ideological doctrine, it was
unable to sign up to the social dimension, which remains equally
indispensable.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am curious as to what now constitutes a resigning matter for a
cabinet minister or one of the government's hirelings such as the governor
of the Bank of England? Obviously professional ineptitude no longer triggers
such action. What are a few thousand bankrupts or a couple of billion pounds
of the taxpayers' money squandered when you can brazen out your botching?
Sexual fumbling can make our masters look foolish, but will not necessarily
lead to their exit. A cynical citizenry now expects dishonesty and lying
from the great and far-from-good.
Perhaps the only thing which will remove such people, rarely gracefully, is
if colleagues find that their continuing presence puts them at risk.
I must be getting dangerously old as I long for a little more morality, like
telling the truth and taking responsibility for your mistakes, in our
national life.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers to reduce
workforce by 2,280
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL-Myers Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday said it was cutting its work-force by about 6 per cent, or 2,280
people, in yet another move to improve its position in an increasingly
competitive industry.
In a letter to employees, Mr Wayne Davidson, president, said: 'Health care
cost-containment issues, rebates and restrictions on our ability to market
our products are increasingly affecting the business worldwide. These trends
are expected to continue and, therefore, they need to be addressed on a
sound and sustainable basis.'
Bristol-Myers is also responding to the increasing pressures of price
increase curbs and generic competition which are starting to change the face
of the pharmaceuticals industry.
Earlier this week, the company announced the sale of its Drackett household
products business for Dollars 1.15bn in cash as Bristol moved to concentrate
on its core pharmaceuticals business.
The company's results have been disappointing this year, with profits growth
of only 5 per cent in the first nine months compared with its usual 15 per
cent growth rate.
According to Mr Viren Mehta, partner at Mehta and Isaly in New York, 'all of
the prudent managers in the industry are recognising that the largest market
in the world is not as profitable as it once was. Even companies that are
highly successful have wage freezes, travel and hiring controls and a
greater focus on research. Because of the additional problems that Bristol
has faced and the impact on its share price, management has been motivated
to be more visible with some of the cost controls they are implementing.'
On Wall Street, shares in Bristol-Myers added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 67 1/4
. The stock has traded as high as Dollars 90 1/8 this year.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SARA LEE, the international consumer products group, expects its capital
expenditures in the 1993 fiscal year to exceed Dollars 700m, up from Dollars
509m in 1992, according to Mr John Bryan, chairman, Reuter reports from
Chicago.
Mr Bryan said after Sara Lee's annual meeting that most of the increase
would go toward vertical integration of manufacturing capacity for its
personal products. It would also increase manufacturing capacity for
products including knitwear, which saw a 13 per cent unit volume growth in
the first quarter ended September 26.
Sara Lee's capital spending would exceed its previous peak of Dollars 593m

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dowding &amp; Mills issues warning of further
decline in profitability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Hollings, chairman of Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and
mechanical repair company, warned at the annual meeting that the profits
falls seen in the last two years were expected to continue if business
volume continued to decline.
He said that industrial activity continued to fall and this was having a
direct impact on the company. However the balance sheet was strong and the
company was still profitable.
In the year to June 30 pre-tax profits fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.53m.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Call for private railway contractors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for private-sector engineering contractors to work on the railways
even before privatisation was made by Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister,
yesterday.
Under privatisation proposals, control of the track and other British Rail
infrastructure would become the responsibility of a new body, Railtrack,
from April 1994.
But Mr Freeman told the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors: 'We now
see significant further opportunities for private-sector contractors to
carry out work on the track and infrastructure of the railway.'
He said BR was spending more than Pounds 500m a year on track and
infrastructure maintenance, renewal and other civil engineering works.
Mr Freeman went on: 'This is a significant market and I am certain that a
large proportion of this work can be carried out just as efficiently, if not
more so, by the private sector.'
The minister outlined two broad options.
The first was to 'test the market' - private-sector contractors would be
invited to bid in competition with providers within BR.
The second option was to move straight to an outright privatisation of BR's
internal providers.
The government's railway privatisation plans represent 'as significant a
turning point as the nationalisation of the railways in 1948', Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs yesterday, promising a series of
consultation documents over coming months to flesh out its proposals.

FT  30 OCT 92 / US prosecutor set to oppose dropping of Clifford charges
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney who has led US
investigations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)
affair, is expected to tell a New York court this morning that he is opposed
to dismissing criminal charges against Mr Clark Clifford.
The 85-year-old former US defence secretary - who resigned last year as
chairman of First American Bankshares, the Washington bank that was secretly
controlled by BCCI - was indicted in New York last July on charges of having
taken bribes, conspired to commit fraud and misled US bank regulators.
Soon after the indictment was brought, Mr Clifford said he was innocent and
wished a speedy trial in order to clear his name. But his lawyers argued
subsequently that, because of a heart condition, he might die from the
stress of standing trial.
Mr Clifford's lawyers filed a motion this week to ask a New York judge to
dismiss the BCCI charges, saying he was too ill to stand trial and had been
'grievously hurt' by the events of the past two years.
The New York trial, tentatively set to begin next January 4, is expected to
last three to four months. A trial in Washington on separate charges has
been postponed.
Mr Robert Bennett, the well-known lawyer representing Mr Clifford in
Washington, said he did not know whether the New York motion to dismiss
would be opposed.
However, he said: 'If they oppose the motion to dismiss the case on health
grounds, then in light of the overwhelming evidence, such a position is
terribly unjust and is one more sign that they want to destroy Mr Clifford
and not just prosecute him.'

<TEXT>
COLUMBIA'S astronauts yesterday hoisted a domino-like aluminium panel on the
US space shuttle's mechanical arm, then rolled and waved the panel to test
an experimental robotic vision system, AP reports from Houston.
Crew member Charles Lacy Veach grabbed the 4ft-by-8ft (1.2metre-by 2.4metre)
target panel with Columbia's 50ft (15-metre) crane and lifted it above the
payload bay. He slowly manipulated the target, turning it, pulling it from
side to side and moving it up and down, relying on the Canadian space vision
system of computers and TV cameras to operate the crane.
Canadian astronaut Steven MacLean aligned the system by targeting sets of
white dots on the black panel. The vision device seemed to work well, but it
took the astronauts two hours longer than planned to latch the panel back in
the cargo bay because of a minor problem with the jointed mechanical arm.
Ms Barbara Schwartz, spokeswoman for the US space agency Nasa, said the
delay was not expected to affect further tests planned with the machine
vision system over the next two days.
Researchers hope the computerised eye will give them more precise control of
the shuttle arm, which may someday be used to build the space station.

<TEXT>
AN ELECTED Palestinian self-governing authority could be in place in just
six months, according to US officials at the Middle East peace talks.
They believe the talks are making progress despite the damage caused by
recent violence in Lebanon and Israel.
One year on from the Madrid conference which launched the peace process
under the sponsorship of the US and Russia, it has sometimes seemed that the
only visible progress is that the talks, in separate bilateral tracks
bringing Israel together with Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Palestinian
negotiators, have not broken up.
Arab delegates to the latest round of talks in Washington this week have
complained publicly that Israel is stalling.
'Israel has said that the Arabs have never missed an opportunity to miss an
opportunity. It seems this time that it is Israel which is missing the
opportunity,' said Mr Abdul Salam Majali, head of the Jordanian delegation.
But Mr Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and
South Asian affairs, insisted yesterday that there was progress.
'The negotiations are working. In each track there is negotiation and focus
on the right issues,' he said.
The most visible progress in this round of talks, which will resume on
November 9 after the US election, is the agreement between Israeli and
Jordanian delegates on an agenda paving the way for concrete negotiations.
Mr Djerejian said there was also 'structured, serious engagement' between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators that could lead to the election of a
self-govering authority for the occupied territories by next May.

President Mauno Koivisto yesterday said Finland would meet all its
obligations under the Maastricht treaty, including possible participation in
a common European defence force.
In contrast to Denmark's equivocations, including this week's demands for
opt-outs on a common currency and defence force, Mr Koivisto said Finns
intended to be 'honest members' of the Community. He was speaking at the end
of a trip to Brussels to talk about pending negotiations on full EC
membership.
Finland's economy faces another difficult year in 1993 but competitiveness
is improving sharply, according to the Ministry of Finance, Christopher
Brown-Humes writes from Stockholm.
The ministry yesterday predicted GNP would increase next year by 2 per cent,
following a fall of 2 per cent this year. The lower markka has boosted
exports, leading to a 10 per cent rise in volumes this year and an expected
13 per cent increase next year. The current account is expected to be in
surplus in early 1994.
Unemployment isexpected to more than double to 322,000 (nearly 13 per cent
of the workforce) this year before peaking at 350,000 in late 1993.

HUNGARY and Czechoslovakia have initialled a provisional agreement to settle
their dispute over the damming of the River Danube after EC-sponsored
negotiations behind the scenes at this week's EC-Central Europe summit,
reports Anthony Robinson.
Mr Janos Martony, the Hungarian negotiator, said last night that the
four-part agreement called for a standstill on damming work. The Czechs have
guaranteed to supply at least 95 per cent of the normal flow of water along
the old channel of the Danube and pledged not to operate the turbines of the
Gabcikovo hydro-power station.
The agreement also creates a five-strong team of three EC experts and one
each from Hungary and Czechoslovakia to assess the technical feasibility of
removing the diversionary dams and restoring the status quo.
Both parties also gave a commitment to submit the case to binding
international arbitration or to the International Court of Justice at the
Hague.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Liechtenstein's prince looks to the future: The last
European monarch with real power has no plans to shed it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VADUZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'IF THEY want some who will just do representational work, they must look
for someone else.' With those fighting words, Hans Adam II, the reigning
prince of Liechtenstein and the last European monarch with real power
(pictured left), dismissed suggestions after Tuesday's confrontation with
his parliament that his considerable powers be curbed.
In an interview in his palace office overlooking his tiny principality, the
soft-spoken 47-year-old prince also claimed responsibility for drafting the
compromise that solved the dispute over when to hold a referendum on
Liechtenstein's entry into the European Economic Area. The EEA will group
some 20 countries from January.
The crisis blew up early this week when the prince threatened to dissolve
parliament because it refused to bow to his view to hold the referendum
before a similar one in neighbouring Switzerland in December.
On Wednesday night, nearly 2,000 citizens - out of a total population of
only 29,000 - took to the streets of Vaduz to protest at the prince's tough
stand, quaintly demanding both monarchy and democracy. 'It is clear to me
that dissolution would not have been very popular,' the prince said.
Under the compromise, the referendum will take place after the Swiss one, as
parliament wished, but the government has agreed to promote a positive vote
on the EEA and, if it is rejected, would explore joining the EC in
co-ordination with the Swiss.
However, he made no apology for his determined stance, claiming that a
majority of his subjects still like having a reigning prince who has power.
He said the clash with parliament and the government had been building up
for some time as a result of a number of areas in which each side had been
testing the other's willingness to exercise its powers.
He said his main concern for over 20 years had been his country's over-great
dependence on Switzerland, with which it has a customs and currency union.
He knew the time would come when Switzerland would move towards European
integration, and Liechtenstein had to be ready. 'I have been shaking the
emotions of people for 20 years.' He pressed the principality to join the
Council of Europe and to become the 160th member of the United Nations in
1990.
His worry in recent months has been that if Swiss voters decide in their
December referendum not to move towards integration, Liechtenstein risked
being isolated, and its export-oriented manufacturing industry - mainly
precision engineering - would suffer.
He said the EEA was the best solution for his country and full membership of
the EC was second best, even though it might bring a flood of tax refugees
from neighbouring countries. 'It is better to have tax refugees than
isolation.'
Like a true monarch, he defended his role. 'I think we should consider
carefully if we should throw out the way we do things. The reigning prince
pays everything out of his own pocket.'
But if the people wanted a purely symbolic monarch, he and his family would
live abroad again, 'as we have in the past', and he would look after the
family fortune.
He had no fears of a decline of Liechtenstein's ability to act as a tax
haven as it moved closer to Europe. 'It does not look as if we would move to
complete harmonisation of direct taxes,' he said.
Asked about Liechtenstein's involvement with Mr Robert Maxwell - many of
whose interests were controlled by a foundation based in Liechtenstein - the
prince said he was disappointed it took the British authorities so long to
request co-operation in the investigation.
'Perhaps they were afraid to approach us because of our bad reputation.'

<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTING news continued to undermine the derivatives market yesterday.
The futures market maintained recent trends, showing a flurry of activity in
the morning and drifting off in the afternoon, writes Peter John.
The FT-SE 100 future contract for December opened at 2,695 and was bought up
to 2,701. Then, high German inflation figures and the realisation that
Germany was not going to cut interest rates knocked December back.
This disappointment was compounded by lower than forecast third-quarter
figures from ICI and a 20-point fall in short sterling.
The Footsie future came back to 2,658 and struggled ahead of the chancellor
of the exchequer's keynote speech timed for yesterday evening. December
closed at 2,677 on turnover of just over 8,200 contracts. It ended the day
35 above the underlying cash market and some 15 points above the estimated
fair value premium, currently at around 20.
Among traded options, total turnover of 24,637 lots was well down on the
previous day with individual stock options attracting little interest.
Barclays was the most active with 1,324 lots dealt as a two-way pull
continued over whether the bank will cut the dividend. Lonrho was unusually
busy with volume boosted by a call spread in the March series. ICI despite
its impact elsewhere saw fewer than 500 lots dealt.

FT  30 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Surprise at new RHM bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURPRISE Pounds 935m bid by Tomkins for Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM) sent
shares in the two groups in wildly opposite directions and, together with
RHM's other bidder, Hanson, produced the three heaviest traded stocks in a
London market almost wholly negative in its view of the agreed offer.
Tomkins shares tumbled 49 to 212p in turnover of 29m as the industrial
conglomerate revealed the terms of the takeover, which included a 2-for-1
rights issue. Turnover in RHM reached 38m, the shares soaring 21 1/2 to
273p, 6p ahead of the Tomkins offer price.
Analysts described the price, which dwarfed Hanson's Pounds 790m hostile
offer, as 'very full' and many expressed misgivings at Tomkins' intentions
to keep RHM together. Mr Tim Potter of Smith New Court said: 'It's a tall
order to fulfil. Tomkins has no expertise in running a food business and the
problem areas, such as baking, will be difficult ones to address.' Many
observers believe Tomkins is over-optimistic in its belief and that, should
the bid be successful, some disposals from RHM will be inevitable.
Most analysts were advising RHM shareholders either to take the cash
alternative or to sit tight and wait for Hanson's response. Initial market
reaction was that Hanson would walk away from the deal. However, Lord
Hanson, chairman, ignited some excitement telling RHM shareholders in a
statement to 'take no action for the time being'.
County NatWest was among several houses yesterday to issue sell notes on
Tomkins. Analyst Mr Geoff Allum argued that the rights issue would put too
many shares into the market and that the bid price was too high. 'Tomkins
say they have plans for RHM but they will not say what they are,' he said.
'I cannot see anything in this bid which will not weaken the shares further.
They should be sold.'
Disappointment over the arrival of a rival bidder and large selling from the
US prompted Hanson shares to fall 5 1/2 to 226 1/2 p. Analysts said a
takeover of RHM would enhance Hanson's earnings by 3 per cent before tax
benefits were factored in. The shares have performed well since the bid was
announced.
There are also worries that the US might introduce protectionist tax
charges. These would hit Hanson, which has very high exposure to the US.
Dealers said one US investor was trying to unload a very large line of stock
yesterday and that the weight of it was pushing down the share price.
ICI upset
Long-awaited third quarter results from ICI turned out to be even worse than
the bears had anticipated. The announcement of the headline figures, hot on
the heels of disappearing rate cut hopes, sent the shares and the FT-SE 100
Index sharply down.
ICI shares had been wallowing around 20 lower, but when the profit figure of
Pounds 93m for the quarter and Pounds 513m for the year to date appeared,
marketmakers chopped quotations and ICI was down 46 at worst.
Analysts returned from the company meeting with the view that ICI was
determined to maintain the dividend. This, coupled with continued commitment
to the planned demerger, helped the shares to recover and close only 14 off
at 1036p with 4.2m traded.
However, Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said the dividend would be
uncovered for the first time and the demerger might have to be postponed. He
cut his 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m to Pounds 550m and his 1993 figure by
Pounds 775m to Pounds 700m.
Broker Hoare Govett, which surprised the market with hefty cuts a month ago
maintains its caution. Hoare's Mr Martin Evans has cut back to Pounds 580m
for this year and taken a particularly gloomy view of 1993 prospects,
slicing his estimate by Pounds 155m to Pounds 720m.
Hotels hint
A dull leisure sector was enlivened by talk surrounding Queens Moat Houses.
Shares in the hotel group have been buoyant all week and there were hints
that a deal with Bass was in the offing.
Speculation that the brewery group is looking to dispose of some of its
Holiday Inn chain is not new, but renewed talk yesterday had Bass
considering taking a stake in Queens Moat in return for management of some
of its hotels. Analysts were mostly sceptical. Shares in Queens Moat, held
back by a downgrade from Smith New Court, fell a penny to 40p. Bass fell 7
to 544p.
There were many trading features in a busy oil and gas sector. Shell was by
far the biggest traded stock, easing to 531p and subsequently closing a net
penny off at 534p after exceptionally heavy trade of 11m shares.
The bulk of the trade was made up by the purchase at 528p and and resale at
531p of a block of 2.2m Shell shares, apparently by one of the leading UK
securities houses. Later in the session another block of 2m Shell traded at
528p.
The reasoning behind the recent exceptionally heavy trading in BP traded
options, apparently on behalf of one of the big US investment banks, became
evident as BP and the Colombian authorities announced new reserves estimates
for the Cusiana oilfield located in Colombia. BP and Triton Energy, of the
US, are participants in Cusiana, along with the Colombian state-owned oil
company.
After some confusion, when BP estimated reserves at 1.5bn barrels of crude
and condensate, against Colombian official estimates of 1.3bn barrels,
dealers adopted a bearish stance on the figures, chopping BP shares from
around 236p to an eventual closing level of 231p, a net loss of 3 1/2 ,
after turnover of 8.7m.
Specialists were also said to have been disappointed at prospective levels
of production from the field. There was similar disappointment in the US,
which now speaks for well over 20 per cent of BP shares. Triton stock came
under heavy selling pressure and were down some six per cent in early
trading.
One UK oil sector analyst said the Cusiana numbers were 'the best the
realists could have expected'.
Royal Insurance was the pick of the composite insurance sector, the shares
improving 6 to 213p on higher than usual activity of 4.3m shares. Dealers
said speculators had revived long-running stories that Allianz, the German
insurance group, was about to pounce with a 300p a share bid for the
company.
Sun Alliance moved up 3 to 320p and Commercial Union (CU) eased 2 to 571p;
the bought deal in which Sun Alliance disposed of a block of 60m shares in
CU on September 18 was executed jointly by Smith New Court and Cazenove.
Pharmaceutical stocks moved against the market on strengthening conviction
that President Bush might retain the presidency. Glaxo was the strongest
performer. The shares rose 10 to 809p on turnover of 4.2m.
A downgrade and reiterated sell stance by Smith New Court hurt
Cadbury-Schweppes, the shares slipping 14 to 451p. Similar treatment was
meted out by James Capel on MFI, the shares losing 6 to 112p.
Automated Security Holdings ran up 9 to 137p with dealers noting persistent
US support for the stock ahead of a visit next week to the company's US
operations by UK analysts. It was also suggested that recent steady selling
of the shares by several UK institutions had dried up and that domestic
funds are now keen supporters of the shares.
Reuters fell 20 tp 1178p on worries over a threatened overhang of stock
after shareholder United Newspapers (off 2 at 453p) announced it was
exchanging preference shares for Reuters shares.

FT  30 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares easier after an active session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market remained depressed yesterday as it waited for last
night's Mansion House speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor
of the exchequer. With hopes for immediate cuts in interest rates again
discouraged both in London and Frankfurt, UK stocks were left to make their
own response to a flow of corporate developments.
Investment activity remained high, with retail or customer business boosted
by substantial placings of stock in blue chip companies. But the
institutions traded very selectively and the FT-SE Index was influenced by
arbitraging with stock index futures and by reaction to ICI's trading
statement. The chief feature was an unexpected but agreed Pounds 935m
counter-bid from Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, for Ranks Hovis
McDougall (RHM), the bakery group under offer from Hanson.
ICI's third quarter results were every bit as bad as feared. Nor did the
chairman's comments on the outlook provide much encouragement for a stock
market already upset this week by statements from British Steel and Marks
and Spencer.
Shares in ICI fell very sharply in initial response to the profits news,
helping to drag the Footsie down by 22.2 to its day's low. However, the
shares rallied after ICI removed one cause for uncertainty by confirming
that plans for the proposed demerger of its bioscience businesses remain on
track.
The absence of any change in rates following the routine Thursday meeting of
the Bundesbank policy council, while no surprise in London, provided a
further dampener on share prices. The Bank of England, through London money
market activity, indicated that, as was also well understood, UK rates would
not be changed during the session.
However, the City's underlying conviction that domestic rates will be cut
again soon was reflected in continued firmness in UK government bond prices,
despite a further dip in sterling.
The stock market was left to follow its own devices ahead of the
chancellor's speech to the bankers and City representatives, which was not
delivered until well after trading hours. The FT-SE Index steadied, helped
by a calm opening to the new Wall Street session, and closed at 2,642.3,
down 8.1 on the day.
Seaq volume, boosted by the activity in ICI and in the RHM situation stocks,
totalled 567.1m shares against 517.2m in the previous session. On Wednesday,
retail business was worth Pounds 1.1bn, around the levels regarded as
profitable for the London investment community. However, it was confirmed
yesterday that BZW, the UK investment bank, had reduced staffing in its
corporate finance division.
Few City professionals expected any dramatic developments in Mr Lamont's
speech in London last night, and most agreed that the financial markets will
remain nervous over the next week as they await the outcome of the US
presidential elections as well as of the Maastricht debate in the UK.
Further reductions in UK interest rates are likely to provide the basis for
the next move by the stock market.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities mixed as
investors ignore data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were mixed in heavy trading as investors shrugged off bad
economic news and the latest opinion polls on the presidential race, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.13 at 3,246.27. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also little changed at the
finish, up just 0.72 at 420.85. Secondary indices, however, fared better
because of stronger demand from investors for small and medium-sized stocks.
The Amex composite closed 2.29 higher at 381.29, and the Nasdaq composite,
which performed best of all, finished up 4.43 at 605.82. Turnover on the
NYSE was high at 206m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 959 to 772.
The day's economic news - an 8,000 rise in weekly jobless claims - had
little impact on investors. Although the rise in claims was bigger than
expected, it was not enough to unsettle the market.
Similarly, investors chose to pay little attention to reports that the gap
in opinion polls between Governor Clinton and President Bush has narrowed.
The polls have become extremely volatile in the final week of the campaign,
and the uncertainty over the result - even if the President's chances of
re-election look brighter - is proving more of a hindrance than a help to
market.
Among individual stocks, the final batch of third quarter corporate reports
continued to trickle in. General Motors eased slightly in early trading but
finished unchanged at Dollars 31 3/8 in busy trading after the troubled
motor manufacturer announced a quarterly loss of Dollars 752.9m, an
improvement from the loss of more than Dollars 1bn at the same stage a year
earlier. The figures were in line with analysts' forecasts.
Ford, which reported its earnings earlier in the week, fell Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 37 1/4 after the securities house Lehman Brothers downgraded its
1992 and 1993 profits estimates for the company. Chrysler was slightly
firmer, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 27 1/8 .
Data General dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 10 7/8 in turnover of more
than 1m shares after the company reported net income of just 1 cent a share,
down sharply from the 53 cents a share earned in the same quarter of 1991.
US Surgical fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 after the company told
analysts that October sales were below expectations. The stock was also
damaged by negative comments about sales by the broking house Hambrecht &amp;
Quist.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed steady in another day of extremely active trading.
Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose just 1.30 points, or 0.04
per cent, to 3,336.01. Advances led declines 329 to 242, volume of 45.2m
shares was below the previous 49.9m shares, and trading value was CDollars
359.8m against CDollars 495.6m. The 14 stock groups were evenly split
between winners and losers.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Petrofina shares tumble on North Sea
fears - Shareholders have also been worried by the sharp drop in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a long time, as one Belgian stock market analyst pointed out recently,
the oil company Petrofina was 'a sort of sacred cow'. It was one of the
largest stocks on the small Brussels bourse and beyond criticism, at least
at home.
Since the summer, however, shareholders in Petrofina have had much to
criticise, starting with the announcement that profits had fallen from
BFr9.5bn (Dollars 300.6m) to BFr4.2bn. That was on August 6, when Petrofina
shares stood at BFr10,950, broadly the same level at which they started the
year.
Meanwhile, the shares have not climbed back to five figures. Worse still,
bad news from the North Sea has driven the price down further this month.
During the last week, Petrofina has rallied from its low point of BFr7,150,
but the shares were still wallowing at BFr7,780 yesterday.
The sharp decline since September was prompted by a press release from the
Norwegian Petroleum Directorate on October 8 indicating that, for safety
reasons, it was considering closing the Ekofisk field's oil processing and
storage tank before the 1995-96 winter season.
Petrofina and Phillips Petroleum of the US, which heads the Ekofisk
consortium, were aghast at the publicity given to the alleged safety
problems, and hit back with claims that the oil field would be producing
well beyond the year 2000. The war of words is likely to come to a head
today or early next week, when Phillips will issue its formal response to
the Norwegian authorities.
There is no doubt that the future of Ekofisk is important to Petrofina. Some
30 per cent of the 10-platform complex is owned by its Norske Fina
subsidiary, and the field accounts for about half of the group's crude oil
production. But there are also other deeper-rooted reasons why Petrofina is
out of favour with investors.
Mr Marc Debrouwer at the broker, Petercam, says: 'Up to now a decline in
profits in one division has been offset by increases in the others, but the
problem with 1992 is that two main divisions - refining/marketing and
petrochemicals - are experiencing a downturn, and at the same time we are
seeing problems with exploration and production.'
For other oil analysts, it is Petrofina's commitment to chemicals production
 -which accounted for BFr95.3bn of the group's BFr599bn net turnover last
year - that is helping to depress the share price. In addition, it has
relatively low exposure to downstream activities, the part of the oil sector
which some observers believe will be first to recover.
As Ms Wendy Anderson of County Natwest in London explains: 'It doesn't have
the oil reserves, it doesn't have the exposure to refining, and it's heavily
exposed to petrochemicals. What redeems it? Not very much, I'm afraid.'
Petrofina's share price has been supported in the past by the presence of a
large and apparently committed shareholder, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the
Belgian holding company which directly and indirectly controls about 28 per
cent. Recently, it has been supported by the intervention of a mystery
buyer, possibly another European oil company.
But since the collapse in the share price, the mystery buyer has vanished
and the sacred cow been duly slaughtered.
There are mixed views about how Petrofina's share price could be revived.
Some analysts are calling for a cut in the full-year dividend, in spite of
the possibility that such a move might be misunderstood by the market.
Others pin their hopes on the possibility of links with new industrial
partners, or on the outcome of long-running talks with private Saudi Arabian
investors interested in buying part of Fina, the group's US affiliate.
But most agree it will take a more lasting recovery in one or more of the
company's three main sectors to put a firm floor under Petrofina's flagging
share price.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines
in index-linked trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO shares eased in index-linked trading, pushing the Nikkei average below
the 17,000 support level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index lost 130.70 to 16,937.71 at the close, having opened at
the day's high of 17,069.21 before breaking below 17,000 by mid-morning. The
index fell to the day's low of 16,927.38 in the afternoon on index-linked
selling.
Volume fell to 160m shares from 209m, as investors remained sidelined amid
interim earnings announcements.
Losers led gainers by 648 to 275 with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks fell 5.26 to 1,287.13 and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.32 to 1033.20.
Apart from a few individual theme stocks, share price movements were
dominated by small-lot, index-linked trading.
While some traders hope that lower interest rates will encourage
institutional investors to shift funds from bonds and money markets into the
equity market, most investors regard current share prices as too high. One
fund manager said that the Nikkei average, trading at a price-earnings ratio
of 46.8, would have to fall further before he could start buying.
Dealers dabbled in speculative theme stocks. Aisin Seiki, the most active
issue of the day, gained Y40 to Y1,190 on the nuclear fusion theme.
Mitsubishi Materials gained Y13 to Y440 and Nippon Mining advanced Y16 to
Y488. Both companies are producers of palladium, necessary for
room-temperature nuclear fusion experiments.
Ito-Yokado, the leading supermarket chain, rose Y40 to Y3,680 on bargain
hunting after the company's president announced his resignation. The company
had been hit by a wave of selling after its officials were arrested last
week for alleged gangster links. Ms Setsu Yamazaki, retail analyst at James
Capel, said that the resignation news had prevented further damage to
Ito-Yokado's image.
High-technology issues were lower on foreign selling. NEC lost Y14 to Y670
and Fujitsu fell Y4 to Y560. Traders said that some foreign investors were
shuffling their portfolios, liquidating electronics issues with weak
earnings forecasts.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 129.44 to 18,641.99 in volume of 14.5m
shares.
Roundup
KUALA LUMPUR, which closed at an all-time high yesterday, and Seoul were the
strongest gainers in the region.
HONG KONG closed slightly weaker after a day of moderate fluctuations, but
the market largely shrugged off the latest Sino-British dispute over the
colony's future. The Hang Seng index closed down 9.48 at 6,117.50 as
turnover fell to HKDollars 2.1bn from HKDollars 2.5bn.
Bank of East Asia, suspended yesterday after a HKDollars 1.9bn placement to
foreign institutions, resumed trading and closed down HKDollars 1.50 at
HKDollars 36.0, the same as the placement price.
KUALA LUMPUR surged in the afternoon, with strong gains in major stocks
pushing the composite index up 3.82 to 637.13. Brokers said that sentiment
had been encouraged in anticipation of a positive budget statement today.
SEOUL advanced for the fourth consecutive session, on news that Daewoo Group
chairman Kim Woo-choong would not stand for president. The composite index
added 20.44 to 605.78.
All Daewoo shares, which hit their lower limits in the morning session,
reversed to close limit-up. Both Daewoo Corp and Daewoo Heavy Industries
gained Won400 to Won9,100 and Won9,400.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to close lower on profit-taking. The weighted
index, which was more than 30 points higher in early trade, ended 30 down at
3,640.90 on turnover of TDollars 10.4bn after TDollars 7.8bn.
A vote by the finance committee of parliament late on Wednesday to cut the
stock transaction tax encouraged some early buying. But brokers do not
expect the motion to pass the full parliament because it is opposed by the
finance ministry and ruling Nationalist Party.
BANGKOK broke above 920 with strong gains in large-capitalisation issues.
The SET index rose 13.47 to 931.36 in turnover of Bt15.12bn. Thai Farmers
Bank rose Bt44 to Bt688 and Siam Commercial Bank gained Bt24 to Bt996.
MANILA rallied with interest in Meralco and Philippine National Bank. The
composite index gained 25.46 to 1,357.01 with Meralco B shares up 7.50 pesos
at 262.50 pesos and PNB rising 8 pesos to 246 pesos.
NEW ZEALAND fell as Fletcher Challenge dropped 10 cents to NZDollars 1.63.
The NZSE-40 lost 11.45 to 1,369.34.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses hit by more bad
company news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE bad news from the corporate sector weighed on German, Dutch and Swedish
equities, while a drop in French interest rates failed to support the Paris
bourse, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was also upset by higher inflation data and the DAX index tumbled
below the 1,500 level to close down 16.66 at 1,493.64. Turnover fell to
DM4.8bn from DM5.9bn.
While the Bundesbank's decision not to lower interest rates came as no
surprise, a bigger-than-expected CPI figure from Hesse did. Taken together
with data from other states, west German inflation is now running at its
highest level since June, at 3.8 per cent compared with 3.6 per cent a year
earlier.
The chemicals sector fell heavily as BHF Bank joined the growing number of
analysts who expect the big three to cut their dividends this year. BASF
lost DM7.50 to DM208.50, Hoechst fell DM6.30 to DM236 and Bayer declined
DM3.30 to DM263.50.
Steels were undermined by heavy first-half losses from the Dutch group,
Hoogovens. Thyssen was down DM2.50 at DM153 and Preussag lost DM3 to
DM302.50.
Porsche slid DM10 to DM455 after Wednesday's late announcement of a DM65m
loss in the year ending July 1992 and the company's forecast that it expects
a further decline in earnings in the current year.
BMW, down DM1.50 at DM480, attracted sell notes after the company said that
earnings prospects will be affected by the recent appreciation of the
D-Mark.
AMSTERDAM fell after very poor interim results from DSM and Hoogovens. The
CBS Tendency index closed down 1.7 at 102.9.
The DSM third-quarter figures, which showed a 55 per cent fall in profit,
were much worse than expected and the shares slid Fl 7.80 or 9 per cent at
Fl 77.20. The group said that earnings had been affected by guilder strength
and continuing overcapacity in the petrochemical industry. Akzo fell Fl 3.20
to Fl 127, in sympathy.
It was even a worse day for Hoogovens, after reporting a Fl 70m first-half
pre-tax loss after Wednesday's close. Its shares closed down Fl 6.30 or 23.5
per cent at Fl 20.50. The group said that restructuring costs would also
depress second-half results.
Fokker was suspended at Fl 17.80 ahead of news that Dasa had reached
agreement with the Dutch government on the terms by which it would take a
majority stake in Fokker.
PARIS ended 1.1 per cent lower as news that the government planned to sell
off part of its majority stake in Rhone-Poulenc eroded early gains inspired
by the Bank of France's cut in its 5-10 day lending rate. The CAC-40 index
fell 18.99 to 1,730.87 as turnover remained modest at FFr1.8bn.
Although the partial privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc had long been expected,
the company's CIs fell FFr20 or 3.7 per cent to FFr523 on fears that the
issue of new paper would depress the price.
Generale des Eaux lost FFr72 to FFr1,926 in spite of reporting
better-than-expected first-half results. News that it was injecting FFr150m
into the real estate company, Lucia, through a planned recapitalisation,
fanned worries that it faced further problems from its property interests.
STOCKHOLM dropped 1.7 per cent on disappointment about SKF's
bigger-than-expected loss and higher domestic money market rates. The
Affarsvarlden general index fell 12.10 or 714.0 in turnover of SKr484m after
SKr302m.
B shares in SKF dropped SKr8 or 11 per cent to SKr65 in heavy trading after
news after the close on Wednesday that the ball bearing company made a loss
of SKr361m in the first nine months, compared to expectations of a loss of
around SKr290m.
MILAN bucked the continental downtrend, but dealers detected some
nervousness as the market approached 430, seen as a resistance level on the
Comit index. The index closed 1.41 higher at 428.51 in turnover estimated at
L170bn after L194bn.
Shares in the state-controlled food group SME fell L69 or 1.4 per cent to
L4,780 as comments by the prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato that plans to
privatise state industries could not be rushed prompted profit-taking after
the recent rally.
Dealers reported some demand in Italcable which rose L70 to L4,710.
ZURICH weakened in active trading as the SMI index lost 4 to 1,905.0.
Ciba-Geigy came under pressure after it was reported that the stock had been
downgraded: the bearers lost SFr11 to SFr609. Roche went against the trend
as its certcificates put on SFr30 to SFr3,620.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank signal ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK failed to make any new headway against the dollar and European
currencies in Europe yesterday despite the fact that the Bundesbank failed
to change official rate policy at its council meeting, writes James Blitz.
In the run-up to the last two Bundesbank council meetings, the failure to
change policy has been followed by a sharp wave of D-Mark buying in the
markets. However, earlier this week, the Bundesbank repeatedly signalled
that policy would remain tight and this expectation had already been priced
into the market.
Dealers continue to assume, however, that the direction of German rate
movements is firmly downwards and that there will be another cut in the
discount rate before the end of the year. Against this background, the
dollar closed at DM1.5415, up from a previous close of DM1.5385. It suffered
a set-back later on in American trading, however, dropping back to DM1.5380.
Though the general expectation is for downward moves in German interest
rates, creeping fears are starting to emerge that the speed at which the
Bundesbank will ease policy will be a good deal slower than the market
expects. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London,
pointed to several factors yesterday which underlined this view.
One was the rise in annual consumer price inflation to October in the
western part of Germany by 3.8 per cent, an increase of 0.4 per cent on the
month. A second concern was the continuing debate in the German government
over whether the budget deficit - and subsidies to east German industry -
should be cut, or whether there should be increased taxes. Mr Lyons believes
that some currency turbulence could return if German policy does not become
clearer in the next few weeks.
Yesterday, though, there were increasing signs that the currency tensions
have eased. The Bank of France managed to reduce the rate at which it lends
through its 5-10 day lending window by 1.5 percentage points, back to 10.5
per cent where it was 5 weeks ago. The franc was unaffected by the move,
closing unchanged at FFr3.3920.
The lira also continued to rally as key parts of the Italian government's
emergency programme received parliamentary approval. In New York last night,
it was trading at L853.75 from a previous close in London of L862.4, adding
to speculation that the lira could re-enter the European exchange rate
mechanism before the end of the year.
As financial markets waited for news of the chancellor's Mansion House
speech, sterling continued to lose ground on speculation that another cut in
UK base rates was imminent. The pound closed down  3/4 of a pfennig against
the D-Mark at DM2.4200.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Money Markets: European rates firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in European money markets were slightly firmer yesterday after
the Bundesbank decided to leave rates unchanged and official figures showed
that inflationary pressures in Germany remained high, writes James Blitz.
Rates in the sterling money markets also firmed yesterday afternoon as
dealers took the view that there would be no cut in UK base rates to
accompany the chancellor's Mansion House speech.
Money market dealers had come to believe that there would be no cut in
German rates earlier in the week, but the final decision still triggered
some bearishness. Compounding this was news that the cost of living in
western Germany had risen by 0.4 per cent in October from September, and was
3.8 per cent up on the year.
The news swamped any bullishness that might have accompanied the Bank of
France's decision to cut the rate at which it lends for 5-10 days from 13
per cent to 10.5 per cent. This reversed the move made five weeks ago to
defend the franc in the face of huge currency speculation, but yesterday's
reversal was seen as mostly technical.
In the face of all this, German call money firmed to 9 per cent yesterday
morning, although it later fell back to 8.8 per cent.
The December Euromark futures contract dropped 18 basis points from its
previous close, to finish at 91.55. The December French franc contract rose
20 basis points in the wake of the French rate cut, but later closed
unchanged at 90.78.
In the sterling cash markets, 3-month money dipped to 7 5/16 per cent in the
morning, its lowest level since the last base rate change. The fall was
triggered by hopes of another base rate cut.
However, the Bank again dealt at the established rates in the early round,
and the cost of cash rose sharply in the afternoon.
Three-month money closed at around 7 5/8 per cent from a previous close of 7
1/2 per cent, although 1-month money closed at an offered rate of 8 1/2 per
cent. The December short sterling contract fell very heavily, closing 20
basis points down on the day at 93.47.
However, that closing price still assumes that there will be a 1 1/2
percentage point cut in rates before the year's end.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador maps out its future
path - The government's moves to boost reserves and exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH AN aggressive agenda to revitalise Ecuador's oil industry, the new
reform-minded government of president Sixto Duran Ballen is seeking to boost
its petrol production and increase its oil reserves over the next few years.
Also, with the aid of foreign investors, Ecuador is seeking to secure its
status as an oil-exporting country into the next millennium.
Behind Ecuador's recent announcement to abandon membership of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries by next year lies, above all,
its intention to increase its petrol production beyond the current limit of
273,000 barrels imposed by Opec. Already Ecuador's daily production hovers
around 320,000 barrels, of which about 200,000 barrels are destined for the
export market. The country is seeking to increase its production to 470,000
b/d in 1993 and to 576,000 b/d by 1996.
'We have nothing against Opec, but we need more freedom in our production,
at least for the next four years,' declared Mr Andres Barreiro, the minister
of energy and mining.
Pressure to increase oil production mounted steadily as the country's oil
revenues threatened to fall short of the projections for this year. The 1992
fiscal budget was calculated at an estimated price of USDollars 17 a barrel
for the national crude oil 'Oriente'. In fact, the price in the first eight
months averaged USDollars 16.28 a barrel. With the already increased
production, then, Petroecuador exported in the first six months of this year
32.3m barrels of crude oil, worth USDollars 527.8m.
Petroecuador has long-term contracts for the sale of 210,000 b/d of crude.
Also, it has two contracts to sell 12,000 barrels of petrol to Clarendon and
Tricentrol, each lasting one year.
In an effort to maintain the country's oil reserves, which currently amount
to 1.46bn barrels, Ecuador is planning to explore new fields in its
mineral-rich Amazon region. The reserves have not been augmented for many
years. Mr Barreiro criticised the former government of not having secured
'one single contract for exploration, as a result of which the reserves did
not increase, but actually were depleted year by year'. He added that if
Ecuador did not increase its oil reserves now, the country would have to
begin importing petrol in 10 to 12 years.
The proposal to increase the country's production and oil reserves follows a
study by the US government's General Accounting Office, which predicted a
steady decline in crude oil production over the next years. The study also
suggested an annual investment of USDollars 150m into the national petrol
industry.
For that reason the government is seeking to attract foreign investors.
International bidding for contracts to explore oil fields, scheduled for
next year, has already attracted the interest of companies from the UK,
France, the US, Italy and Indonesia.
Officials here anticipate that the areas offered to foreign companies for
exploration, each covering about 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres), will be
near the current oil wells of Lago Agrio, about 180 km (110 miles)
north-east of Quito. Foreign and national capital are to be subject to the
same regulations. Says Mr Barreiro: 'All companies that partake in the
bidding will have the same rights. Nobody, including Petroecuador, will have
advantages to certain areas'. He added that all companies showing interest
were seeking to produce as well as explore.
Ecuador's forward-looking oil policy may well be a result of lessons learnt
from the experiences of its northern neighbour. As domestic demand for
petrol in Colombia rose above its production capacity, the country ceased to
be an oil exporter and became an importer. A series of investments and
contracted aid reversed that trend and in 1986 Colombia once again began
exporting oil.
Ecuador's plan to abandon Opec membership and boost production has been
greeted with considerable domestic scepticism, however. According to Mr Raul
Jaramillo, former director of Cepe, the previously joint private-public oil
corporation, Ecuador will not be able to double its production in three
years. 'The country lacks sufficient investors to enable the necessary
exploitation of the oil fields,' he commented. Mr Rene Ortiz, former
secretary general of Opec, adds that the industry's infrastructure is
insufficient for the planned increase in output. He points out that, in the
middle and long term, production could be increased just enough to offset
the decreasing output from the ageing oil wells currently being exploited.
As a result, says Mr Ortiz, future production is likely to average about
300,000 b/d, plus or minus 10 per cent.
In the past six years several foreign companies, including British Gas, Esso
Hispanoil, Belco II, Texaco Pecten and Petrocanada have left Ecuador because
they were unsuccessful in finding crude oil.
Yet the present government is not only seeking to increase its oil reserves,
but also to cut costs and make current production more efficient. According
to Mr Barreira, the huge state-owned corporation Petroecuador has serious
personnel and management problems. 'Ever since the consortium of
Petroecuador and Texaco was fully turned over to the state, the situation
has worsened - although the technicians remain the same,' the minister
complained. He proposed to the president that Petroecuador be totally
restructured.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cusiana biggest BP field since
1970s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum, the UK oil company, announced yesterday that reserves in
Colombia's Cusiana field are estimated at 1.5bn barrels.
This confirmed it as BP's biggest find since the early 1970s when it
discovered the Forties field in the North Sea and the Prudhoe Bay field in
Alaska.
BP accompanied its long-awaited announcement with news of a second discovery
north of Cusiana at Cupiagua, with estimated reserves about one-third the
size of Cusiana. However, only one well has been drilled so far.
'It is difficult to be clear about the size of the field,' said Mr David
Harding, chief executive of BP Colombia. Four more wells are planned over
next year.
Ecopetrol, the Colombian oil company, put reserves for Cusiana at a slightly
more conservative 1.3bn barrels. That caused an unfavourable reaction on the
London stock exchange, where BP's shares slipped 3 1/2 p to 231p in heavy
trading. However, a final figure will only be available in early 1993, once
appraisal wells are completed and tested, and many experts believe the field
could be as large as 2bn barrels or more.
Cusiana and Cupiagua lie in the foothills of the eastern range of the Andes
mountains, and the geological trend may continue yet further north into
another block where the Pauto-2 exploration well is now being drilled.
Production partners in the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields are BP (15.2 per
cent), Total (15.2 per cent) and Triton (9.6 per cent), but BP is the only
contractor of the northernmost block.
Drilling in the Andean foothills is complicated and expensive, with the oil
between 12,000 and 15,000 ft below ground and wells costing some USDollars
24m each. However, Mr Harding said the cost was dropping as BP acquired
experience in the area. USDollars 200m has been invested in exploration this
year and another Dollars 200m is planned for 1993.
Analysts estimate development costs for the Cusiana field at Dollars 2 to
Dollars 3 a barrel, with lifting and operating costs about Dollars 2 a
barrel and pipeline charges also Dollars 2 a barrel. The tax regime is said
to be less stringent than that in the UK.
The president of Ecopetrol, Mr Juan Rendon, said he expected Cusiana to be
declared commercial in May 1993. Ecopetrol would then take up its 50 per
cent share and development would begin.
The field should produce 50,000 barrels a day in 1994, rising to about
150,000 b/d by the end of 1995.
Although Cusiana also has considerable gas reserves - estimated at between
2,000bn and 3,000bn cubic feet - the gas will initially be reinjected to
maximise crude production.
BP has built a 1.5km spur from Cusiana to the Central Llanos oil pipeline
across the eastern mountains, which is to be upgraded. From there, oil will
flow into another existing pipeline to the port of Covenas.
Colombian guerrilla groups have been particularly aggressive in recent
months, dynamiting pipelines and other oil installations. However, Mr
Harding said guerrilla activity had had 'no significant effect' on work at
Cusiana.
Colombia produces about 470,000 b/d and exports about 250,000 b/d of crude
and fuel oil. The Cusiana find will more than offset the future fall in
reserves at Cano Limon, allowing Colombia to export more than half of its
crude production from 1994.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian gold output slumps by
5 tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN GOLD output slumped to 32 tonnes in the first half of this year
from 37 tonnes in the corresponding period of 1991, according to figures
released by the National Gold Association (Anoro). Production for the year
is expected to reach 70 tonnes, down from 78 tonnes in 1991, said Mr Nathan
Blanche, Anoro's president.
Production is divided in roughly equal shares between independent 'garimpo'
extraction and industrial operations, estimated Mr Blanche. Brazilian output
has declined dramatically in recent years, mostly because of lower 'garimpo'
output.
Mr Blanche believes that lower gold prices, higher fuel costs, and a tighter
margin between the black market 'parallel' dollar, used by 'garimpeiros',
and the commercial rate of exchange have reduced profitability for freelance
miners.
Industrial output is actually increasing, albeit slowly. In 1990, it
accounted for just 35.3 per cent of national output. Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce, the state-controlled Brazilian mining giant, hopes to boost its gold
output of 7.1 tonnes last year to nearly 12 by the end of the year.
Brazilian investment in research and prospecting for all minerals may reach
only Dollars 40m this year, one-third of what was spent in the quest for new
deposits in 1988, according the Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais,
a state-owned prospecting firm.
Constitutional limitations prohibiting majority ownership of mining concerns
by multinationals contributed significantly to lower investment, said Mr
Blanche.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac de Gras diamond project
forecast to have global impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAC de Gras area in Canada's Northwest Territories will be developed
into a diamond producer rivalling Botswana, the world's biggest producer of
gem diamonds in value terms, according to the Credit Lyonnais Laing
financial services group.
The area - or camp - as a whole might have the potential to add 20 per cent
to total world rough (uncut) diamonds production and one third to world gem
diamonds output, says analyst Mr Roger Chaplin in a special study of the Lac
de Gras phenomenon, which has seen 40,000 square km (16,000 square miles)
staked in the biggest rush for land seen in North America.
Mr Chaplin suggests that the first diamond-containing kimberlite pipe
drilled in the area - called the Point Lake pipe - is 'giving world-class
results and we estimate a value of approximately USDollars 2bn for this pipe
alone.
'There are many more pipes to be found, some of which are likely to exceed
the Point Lake pipe in size and grade,' he adds.
The study estimates that the Point Lake pipe may have reserves of more than
105m carats of diamonds and says a conservative estimate of production would
be about 3.5m carats a year, possibly expanding to 7m carats in time. 'These
reserves would have a gross in-situ value of about USDollars 9bn and could
generate revenues of at least Dollars 300m a year, growing to about Dollars
600m.'
Mr Chaplin points out: 'This is equivalent to a gold mine producing 800,000
to 1.7m ounces of gold a year - but far more profitable. To put the size of
the potential mine into perspective in the diamond industry, there are only
five diamond mines in the world which produce at more than 3m carats a year
and between them these major operations account for about 75 per cent of gem
diamonds production.'
He suggests that, although the share price of Dia Met Minerals, the Canadian
company that discovered Point Lake and is now backed by Broken Hill
Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, has risen by 2,000
per cent in the past year, if CLL assessment of the discovery is correct, it
is still undervalued.
Some other analysts are not so enthusiastic. Mr Rob Weinberg at the Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull financial services group points out that Dia Met's
share price puts a value of Dollars 290m on its exploration properties,
which is equivalent to 36 per cent of Australia's Argyle mine. 'We can't
help feeling that that is somewhat excessive.' Argyle is producing about
33.6m carats of diamonds a year, of which about 1.7m are gem diamonds.
Others point out that, although there are more than 3,000 known kimberlite
deposits in the world, only 1,000 contain diamonds and only between 50 and
60 have ever proved economic.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Estimate of world grain
production increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW

<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has increased its estimate of world wheat
and coarse grain production in 1992-93, largely reflecting improved US crop
prospects.
In the latest issue of its Grain Market Report, the London-based agency puts
1992-93 wheat production at 550m tonnes, up from the 546m tonnes forecast in
its October 1 report and 544m tonnes in the 1991-92 season. The coarse
grains harvest is estimated at 836m tonnes, compared with 828m projected on
October 1 and 799m tonnes in 1991-92.
'Better crops in the United States, China, Kazakhstan, Canada, the EEC and
Australia contributed to the (wheat crop) increase,' the IWC says. The US
crop is now put at 66.7m tonnes, up by 1.2m tonnes from the previous report
and 12.8m tonnes from 1991-92. China's crop estimate is raised by 1.5m
tonnes to 99m tonnes, compared with 96m tonnes in 1991-92, helped by
'favourable weather in major growing regions' and 'a significant increase in
acreage in the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin in the north-east'.
The former Soviet Union's wheat estimate is raised by 1m tonnes to 89.6m
tonnes, up strongly from 1991-92's exceptionally low 73.5m tonnes.
The IWC attributes the 8m-tonne increase in its world coarse grains estimate
mainly to 'a further rise in the figure for the United States, where the
maize crop could set a new record of 227m tonnes'. It also expects better
results from former Soviet republics, India, South Africa and Australia to
be only partly offset by smaller outturns in western and eastern Europe and
China.
The Russian grain crop has reached 107m tonnes, but early cold weather means
the harvest has not yet been completed and crops from 700,000 hectares have
not been brought in, Itar-Tass news agency said, reports Reuter from Moscow.
'Almost 107m tonnes of Russian grain has been threshed,' the agency said.
But it added that state purchases of 23.1m tonnes were 6m tonnes less than
required.
Tass did not say if the latest figure was bunker weight or net weight after
cleaning and drying.
Last week the state statistics office said Russia's 1992 grain harvest was
virtually complete at about 104m tonnes, bunker weight.

sugar industry

<TEXT>
THE BARBADIAN sugar industry, overcome by mounting debts, has been shut down
indefinitely because it has run out of money.
The Barbados National Bank, which is owed USDollars 50m by Barbados Sugar
Industry Ltd, the island's sole producer, has cut off all credit to the
industry and has started proceedings to put the company into receivership.
The move has halted preparations at the island's three mills for processing
cane for the next harvest, due to begin in eight weeks.
The shutdown follows years of declining production and mounting losses, with
this year's output of 55,000 tonnes the lowest in 60 years.
The government and the producers had started discussions with Booker Tate of
the UK, seeking agreement on the terms of a management contract for the
British company to run the industry. However, Barbadian industry officials
said yesterday that the discussions had been 'inconclusive'.
The poor performance of the industry in recent years has caused Barbados
some difficulty in meeting its quota commitments to the European Community
and the US, while satisfying domestic demand. Sugar has had to be imported
for domestic consumption.

LONON Metal Exchange COPPER prices continued to stall at overhead resistance
above the Dollars 2,300 a tonne level, and ended with pared gains yesterday.
In sterling terms the cash position closed Pounds 22 higher at Pounds 1,450
a tonne, but some Pounds 7 of the rise reflected the pound's further fall
against the dollar. Dealers said copper's bounce from early lows around
Dollars 2,280 a tonne indicated that the technical picture was becoming
constructive, although upside targets around Dollars 2,315-Dollars 2,320
needed to be cleared to sustain advances. Other LME metals were relatively
quiet, although ALUMINIUM briefly moved back above the Dollars 1,180 a tonne
level for three months delivery. It quickly ran into overhead selling,
however, and subsided to close just Dollars 3.50 up at Dollars 1,176.50 a
tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA prices extended
Wednesday's downturn on lack of buying interest, compounded by a New York
opening below key chart support. The March position ended Pounds 8 down at
Pounds 710 a tonne.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Dollar bloc shows signs of return to
favour after being oversold

VARIETY was the theme of the day in the international bond market yesterday,
with a series of issues in different currencies for credits at the extremes
of the risk-reward spectrum.
The dollar bloc, where traders argue the fundamentals are still strong for
further cuts in interest rates, showed signs of coming back into favour
after being oversold.
General Electric Capital Corporation reopened the Canadian dollar sector,
issuing a CDollars 200m 7 3/8 per cent bond with a maturity of just over
five years and a spread of 52 basis points over comparable Canadian
government bonds. The amount was increased from CDollars 150m, reflecting
strong demand, said Morgan Stanley International, joint lead manager with
Swiss Bank Corp.
While the result of Canada's referendum on constitutional reform was not the
one the market wanted, the removal of the surrounding uncertainty could help
bring about a rally.
Trinidad and Tobago's Dollars 100m five-year bond was priced to reflect the
unusual risk, with a spread of 565 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries. The coupon of 11 1/2 per cent and issue price of 99.00 translate
into an effective annual yield of 11 3/4 per cent.
Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston acknowledges the issue needs much
explanation.
Pricing of the Pounds 100m 8 3/8 per cent five-year bond from Forte, the UK
hotel group at 101.29 was described as realistic in the current climate.
While the 111 basis points spread over comparable gilts looks generous,
hotels are not an attractive sector in a recession and Forte's debt has
recently been downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.
Forte's bonds are being compared unfavourably with Hanson paper trading at
similar levels in the secondary market. Lead manager Goldman Sachs reported
that demand came from banks looking to convert the bond into a synthetic
floating rate instrument as part of an asset package as well as from
traditional bond investors.
Credit Lyonnais took the FFr1bn 7-year 8.8 per cent bond it led for BSN, the
French food group, to the international market, selling it to funds in
Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Finland's DM1bn five-year 7 3/4 per cent bond fell back in line with the
market after being priced at the tighter end of the expected range to yield
63 basis points over German government bonds.
The recent volume of supply has taken some of the steam out of the D-Mark
sector, say traders.
The run of issues by multilateral banks continued with a SFr300m 10-year
issue from Inter-American Development Bank, carrying a coupon of 6 1/4 per
cent and priced at 101 3/4 .
Den Danske Bank will make two bond issues on November 12 and 14, each of
DKr500m, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The loans will be tier II
capital and they will replace ordinary subordinated loans, which no longer
meet the Basle definitions for supplementary capital.
One will be a fixed rate loan maturing in January 1996 with a coupon of 1.25
percentage points over the equivalent Treasury bond.
The second, maturing at the same time, will be a variable rate loan. Danske
last went to the bond market in December last year, when it raised DKr1.2bn.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC and regulators deadlocked
over capital requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversy over international capital requirements for securities
firms, which has dogged this year's meeting of the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) in London, persisted as the
conference drew to a close yesterday.
The gap between the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and most other
regulators appears wider than ever, following the failure of Iosco's
technical committee to reach agreement on this crucial issue.
Firing a last shot in this week's exchange, Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC
chairman, who heads Iosco's technical committee, described comments by Sir
Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, earlier this week
as 'ill-informed'.
In a veiled attack on the SEC on Wednesday, Sir Leon had said 'no single
national regulator . . . can expect to impose their system on everyone
else.'
Speaking at the end of the conference yesterday, Mr Breeden said: 'It is
totally inaccurate to characterise (our position) as imposing our will on
anyone else.'
He added: 'Politicians need to stay out of it and leave it to the
professionals.'
But Mr Breeden raised the temperature of the debate by describing the
capital requirements enshrined in the European Community's capital adequacy
directive as 'the lowest common denominator'.
He pointed out, however, that while there was deadlock on standards for
equities, Iosco had made considerable progress on standards for the much
larger market in debt securities.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the UK's Securities and Investments Board
(SIB), said Iosco intends to resume discussions with the Basle Committee on
banking supervision, chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, on capital requirements
for debt, and will continue work on the equities side within the technical
committee.
The row over capital requirements obscured some of the other issues raised
during the conference, where agreement was reached.
Among the decisions of the conference, Mr Large noted:
A resolution on money laundering, recommending measures to combat the
practice in the securities industry.
A set of principles for the supervision of financial conglomerates.
A blueprint for effective clearing and settlement systems in emerging
markets.
Endorsement of the use of international auditing standards, to facilitate
orderly cross-border offerings.
Work continues in several other areas, such as international accounting
standards and transparency.
Two committee chairmen were elected during the conference. Mr Jean
Saint-Geours, who heads France's Commission des Operations de Bourse, will
head the technical committee, in place of Mr Breeden, and Mr Martin Redrado,
president of Argentina's Comision Nacional de Valores, will chair the
development committee, both for two years.
In addition, the UK signed memoranda of understanding on regulatory
co-operation with Australia and Hong Kong.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts climb on speculation of further
interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market gained three-quarters of a point in volatile
trading, with speculation about further interest rate cuts and a change in
the funding rule serving to drive up the market.
The gilt market started on a strong note, continuing Wednesday's rally, but
early gains were wiped out by profit-taking.
However, gilt prices later picked up ahead of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer's Mansion House speech. Dealers said the gilt market hoped that Mr
Norman Lamont's speech would contain promises of further cuts in interest
rates as well as possible changes in the full funding rule.
The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 rose from 102 15/16 at Wednesday's close, to
end at 103, while shorter-dated issues ended weaker or unchanged.
THE Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged, coupled
with the release of poor inflation figures, disappointed the German
government bond market, and bunds ended lower on the day.
Consumer prices for the western German state of Hesse rose 0.6 per cent in
the month to mid-October and were up 4.0 per cent from a year ago. The
preliminary western German inflation rate showed a month-on-month increase
of 0.4 per cent and a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent - higher than
expected. The inflation figures killed hopes for an easing in the near term
and pushed bund prices lower.
New issuance in the D-Mark sector also helped to depress bund prices
yesterday following the formal pricing of the Republic of Finland's DM1bn
Eurobond issue. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.59 and reached
a high of 91.66 early on, but then dropped to a low of 91.18.
US Treasury prices were firmer at the long end of the market yesterday, with
sentiment receiving a mild boost from a tightening in the election race and
some poor jobs figures.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 96,
yielding 7.584 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower, however, down
 1/16 at 99 27/32 to carry a yield of 4.316 per cent.
Traders reported that, with the week's main economic statistics and the two
big Treasury auctions out of the way, business was extremely light, although
there was some retail interest during the day.
That was probably sparked by the day's only economic news, which provided
some support to buyers. The latest weekly jobless claims figures showed an
increase of 8,000 people claiming state unemployment insurance, a slightly
bigger rise than expected by market analysts. Recent jobs numbers have
suggested that labour market conditions were gradually improving, but
yesterday's jobless claims data cast a cloud over that judgment.
The latest opinion polls from the presidential race also affected the
market. They showed that Governor Bill Clinton's lead over President Bush
has narrowed into single digits. Although some observers believe it is too
late for Mr Bush to catch up, the figures indicate the final result could be
much closer than expected.
This buoyed Treasury investors, who over the past few weeks have been
selling government securities on fears that, if Governor Clinton won the
presidency, he would quickly institute an aggressive fiscal policy that
could push up interest rates, revive inflationary pressures and widen the
deficit. Any sign that Mr Bush still has a fighting chance, therefore, was
greeted warmly by the market.
THE Bank of France cut one of its key money market intervention rates
yesterday, but dealers said the move had little impact on the French
government bond market.
The central bank lowered the rate on its five-10 day securities repurchase
agreements from 13 per cent to 10.5 per cent - the level at which it had
been before the recent currency turmoil. Dealers said the move was intended
to signal that the French franc was no longer under pressure from
speculators. Yields on short-dated bonds ended the day slightly higher,
while the long end was unchanged.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally as short-term money market
rates fell to their lowest in four years.
The December futures contract climbed from its opening of 107.41 to a high
of 107.55, and closed at 107.50. In the cash market, the yield on the
benchmark No 145 moved from 4.73 per cent to close at 4.715 per cent. The
yield touched 4.705 per cent, the lowest level for the benchmark since
December 1988.
The market took its bullish tone from the easing in short-term interest
rates.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Stockholm regains securities
business from foreign centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a year after Sweden abolished turnover tax on share transactions, it
is clear Stockholm has increased its trading volume and raised its share of
trade in Swedish securities. What is less clear is whether it has won much
business back from foreign centres where Swedish shares are traded, notably
London.
Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Share
Promotion, said: 'We are not losing any more business to London, but I am
not sure that we have regained very much either.'
Swedish turnover tax was abolished on December 1 1991. It had stood at 2 per
cent for most of the late 1980s - allowing London to capture a significant
portion of Swedish business following Big Bang - and was phased out in two
steps over the course of last year.
Coincidentally, the fourth quarter of 1991 was a dismal trading period on
the Stockholm bourse. Volume for 18 leading stocks reached 98.1m shares in
Stockholm, or 92.3 per cent of London's 106.3m shares for the same
companies.
In the first three quarters of this year, however, Stockholm's position has
improved substantially. Volumes for the same 18 stocks have reached 132.7m,
140.4m and 125.8m shares in consecutive quarters, ahead of London's 124.9m,
118.8m and 112.4m.
Ericsson, the telecommunications group which in every quarter of last year
traded fewer shares in Stockholm than in London, has seen the position
reversed this year. But it is an exception among Sweden's leading companies:
Astra, the pharmaceuticals group and SKF, the roller bearing group, still
trade more in London than in Stockholm.
Mr Leif Vindevaag, head of research at the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
believes there has been little erosion in London's competitive position when
it comes to trading in leading international companies. But for a second
tier of less actively traded groups, he believes there has been a flow back
to Stockholm now the price differential between the two markets has
disappeared.
Quantifying how much business Stockholm has regained is difficult due to
other factors such as foreign net buying of Swedish shares and increased
activity by domestic players following this year's reduction in capital
gains tax. Stockholm can expect to enhance its position vis-a-vis London in
stocks where it clearly has greater liquidity. But a strong reversal of the
relative positions may require more than that.

THE Swiss National Bank will continue to require lead managers of Swiss
franc bond syndicates to have a local domicile after the planned creation
next year of the European Economic Area (EEA).
Mr Hans Meyer, a director of the Swiss central bank, said the country would
be obliged to liberalise its syndicate rules next year if the Swiss people
ratified the EEA treaty in a referendum on December 6.
However, the bank had learned that many other European countries were not
about to liberalise completely their syndicate rules, and so Switzerland
would not either.
Currently all members of a Swiss bond syndicate are required to have a Swiss
domicile.
Mr Meyer said in future all members other than the lead manager could be
based in other European countries.

<TEXT>
ROYAL Foods, the South African foods group, has published further
information about its planned Pounds 360m (Dollars 565.2m) acquisition of
Del Monte Foods International (DMFI), the canned fruit and juices company,
following criticism in the South African media about poor disclosure.
The funding requirement of about R2.4bn (Dollars 827m) will be raised by the
issue of new shares in Royal Foods (Royfood), in its parent Royal Corp and
in its ultimate holding company Royal Group Holding - known as Royhold.
The new shares will be placed with the shareholders of Royhold. These are
the Imerman Control Consortium (ICC), which has committed a minimum of R30m,
Anglo American Corporation, which has committed R400m and institutional
shareholders.
ICC, which is the family vehicle for Mr Vivian Imerman, executive chairman
of Royal Corp and driving force behind the acquisition, and Anglo have
agreed they will each hold 30 per cent of Royhold - ICC previously held 77
per cent.
Royhold and Royal Corp shares are being placed at 950 cents per share and
Royfood at 925 cents. Their last traded price prior to the announcement were
900, 950 and 875 cents respectively.
Although some local analysts believe the Pounds 360m price to be steep,
local institutions are expected to support the share placing because, with
assets and earnings in hard currencies, DMFI offers a much sought after rand
hedge element to South African investors.
Royal Foodshas reported a 58 per cent rise in earnings per share for the 12
months to end-August. Earnings rose to 36.2 cents from 22.9 cents in the 18
months to end-August 1991.
Earnings for the six months to end-August 1992 were 32 per cent higher than
for the same period in 1991.

<TEXT>
THE rising cost of collecting unsold goods from retailers was partly
responsible for Shiseido, the leading Japanese manufacturer of toiletries
and cosmetics reporting a 7.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the half
year.
Shiseido's pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September fell
to Y15.43bn (Dollars 126.12m) from Y16.72bn a year earlier, on a 4.9 per
cent increase in sales to Y201bn.
The company is maintaining its interim dividend at Y5.5 a share. Net profits
fell by 7.2 per cent to Y7,602, with earnings per share down to Y19 from
Y26.30 in the first half of the 1991.
The fall in profits reflects the downturn in consumer spending which has
spread through the economy over the past year. Shiseido spent Y2bn (Dollars
16.3m) to collect stocks of unsold items from retailers' shelves. The
collection of this stock which was repriced following the abolishment of the
commodity tax in 1989 was originally planned for the second half of the
year.
Shiseido is forecasting a slight rise in full-year pre-tax profits to
Y32.5bn, up 0.8 per cent from 1991 on sales of Y406bn, up 4.4 per cent.

SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise,
yesterday reported consolidated net profits of 2.16bn pesos (Dollars 98.1m),
on net sales of 42.4bn pesos, for the first nine months of the year.
Net income rose 6 per cent from the comparable period last year, while sales
grew by 10 per cent.
The increase in net profit was faster than the 3 per cent recorded in the
first six months. The company said third-quarter profits were up 17 per cent
from the year before due to streamlining measures in operations, 'more
effective control' of costs, and 'higher efficiencies' from the group's
expansion and modernisation programme.
As well as beer production San Miguel produces and markets various
beverages, food and dairy products and has a newly established subsidiary in
property development.
Volume sales of beer, still the group's flagship product, and of 'many other
products' declined in the third quarter due to 'the continued weakness of
the economy'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISHIKAWAJIMA-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), the Japanese shipbuilder and
heavy machinery maker, blamed a decline in domestic capital spending for an
8.1 per cent fall to Y11.2bn (Dollars 91.4m) in pre-tax profits for the
first half.
Sales for the half to end-September were down 0.7 per cent to Y371.7bn,
although sales of heavy machinery for industry fell 45 per cent following
slower demand from car and paper makers, which are suffering from excess
production capacity.
The company said the appreciation of the yen recently hurt export earnings,
although the shipbuilding business, in recession until two years ago,
reported a 25.8 per cent rise in sales. Japanese shipbuilders generally have
full order books for the next two years, and are reluctant to increase
production for fear of renewed price competition that would erode their
healthy margins.
IHI said an expected fall in domestic capital spending during the next few
months had forced it to cut previous forecasts for the full year to
end-March. IHI had expected a pre-tax profit of Y27bn, now revised to Y25bn,
but higher than last year's Y21.4bn. Sales are expected to fall to Y800bn
from Y811.5bn.

ALL Nippon Airways (ANA), the Japanese airline, reported a 39 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits to Y17.35bn (Dollars 141.6m) for the first half to
end-September, as total passenger volume rose, but the load factor fell on
domestic routes.
Sales for the half year rose 2.4 per cent to Y424.9bn, with passenger volume
on expanding international routes rising 16.6 per cent, while the volume on
domestic routes was 1.5 per cent higher.
The slowing of the Japanese economy and attempts by companies generally to
cut transportation expenses led to a fall in the domestic load factor from
75.0 to 70.2, while the international load factor edged higher from 69.8 to
70.4.
ANA has tapped its cash reserves to fund expansion, as the country's
securities markets are still frail and managers reluctant to lift
borrowings. For the full year, ANA expects profit margins to remain under
pressure, and sees a pre-tax profit of Y17.5bn, down 22 per cent, and an
after-tax profit of Y3bn, down 60.5 per cent.

FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: European operations
offer a beacon of hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN GM looks for light in its darkest hour it is the corporation's European
operations that offer a beacon of hope.
GM Europe is the proof that the world's largest industrial corporation can
successfully transform a chronic loss-maker into a record profit earner.
After seven years in which it ran up total net losses of Dollars 2.2bn and
made a tiny net profit in only one year, 1982, GM Europe finally climbed
back into profit in 1987 and has never looked back since.
In the five years from 1987 to 1991 it has racked up total net profits of
Dollars 8.5bn. Last year it was clearly the most profitable of the big six
volume car makers in Europe.
It raised the net profits of its core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial
vehicle operations to a record Dollars 1.96bn, despite the launch costs for
its new generation Astra small family car, GM's best-selling car in Europe.
Admittedly, the return to profit in Europe has occurred during years in
which west European new car sales have also risen to record levels, but GM
has still clearly out-performed its European rivals financially.
Its record profits have also been achieved, while the profits of many of its
competitors in Europe have been sliding, and its arch rival, Ford of Europe,
has seen peak profits of Dollars 1.6bn in 1988 melt away to a record loss
last year of Dollars 961m.
Ironically, Mr Robert Stempel, the man forced out of the GM chairmanship
this week, and Mr Jack Smith, GM president since April's boardroom coup,
were both instrumental in the gradual transformation of the European
business.
Mr Stempel led GM's European car operations from 1980 to 1982 as chairman of
Adam Opel, the group's German subsidiary. The European operation was still
deep in loss, but GM laid the foundations in this period for its recovery
with heavy investment in its first range of small cars in Europe, the Opel
Corsa/Vauxhall Nova, including the building of an assembly plant in Spain.
It was Mr Smith who brought GM Europe into profit, however, and left an
indelible mark on the operations in a period of less than two-and-a-half
years from early 1986.
He is credited with driving down costs, transforming GM Europe components
purchasing with global sourcing, introducing innovative labour reforms and
streamlining the product development process, while also pushing forward
programmes for vital image cars, such as the Opel/ Vauxhall Calibra coupe.
Some of the key senior executives from the successful European management
team have since risen quickly through GM's turmoil elsewhere in the world,
most notably Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom Mr Smith promoted last
April to head GM worldwide purchasing.
A vital ingredient in Opel/Vauxhall's success has been the development of a
highly competitive product range, and Mr Wayne Cherry, GM Europe's head of
design for much of the past decade, has also been promoted back to the US as
design vice-president.
Rivals have drawn on GM Europe too in the search for management talent, most
notably Chrysler which earlier this year poached Mr Robert Eaton, GM Europe
president for the past four years, to succeed the legendary Mr Lee Iacocca
as Chrysler chairman.
From a market share of only 8.2 per cent in 1981 GM is capturing more than
12 per cent of west European new car sales. In a decade it has moved from a
poor last place among the big six volume car makers to number two behind the
Volkswagen group of Germany, having pushed ahead of Fiat of Italy in the
first nine months this year.
It has taken control of Saab Automobile in Sweden, in an attempt to add a
second, up-market marque in Europe.
GM Europe has also expanded aggressively into east Europe. This year it has
opened an engine and small assembly plant in Hungary, a new car assembly
plant in eastern Germany and is negotiating a deal with FSO in Poland.
The task facing Mr Louis Hughes, the 43-year-old president of GM Europe, is
to hold on to the impressive gains of the past decade, as the west European
new car market moves into reverse.
It is a formidable challenge with GM planning to increase its capacity in
Europe by 25 per cent from 1990 to 1995, largely through three-shift
operations and increased productivity at existing operations, but also
through the new plants in east Europe.
With a new management team he must seek to ensure the financial mayhem in
Detroit does not bite too deeply into his plans for Europe, where new
product programmes are needed for areas such as mini cars, multi-purpose
vehicles and light commercial vehicles.

FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Serious surgery needed
to staunch flow of red ink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revolution, observed Mao Tse Tung, that great exponent of the art, is not a
dinner party. It cannot be advanced softly, gradually, carefully,
considerately.
Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, learned this to his cost this
week as pressure from fellow directors forced him to resign after only 27
months at the helm of the world's largest industrial company.
The tall, booming-voiced but kindly Mr Stempel stood accused of failing to
move quickly and toughly enough to implement a 10-month-old revolution
designed to save the company from financial crisis. He agonised over plant
closures. 'The message,' said one analyst, 'is that nice guys don't win.'
However, the main message behind the most dramatic US boardroom upheaval in
many years is the sheer gravity of the outlook facing GM - a case study in
industrial decline stemming from decades of insular, bureaucratic
complacency.
GM is the world's largest industrial corporation with the biggest turnover,
Dollars 123bn in 1991, the biggest workforce, 756,300 last year - and in
1991 the biggest loss ever recorded by a US corporation at Dollars 4.5bn.
It still accounts for nearly a sixth of world vehicle production, while its
turnover rivals the gross domestic product of a medium-sized industrial
country such as Austria. Last year with US losses of Dollars 7bn and a US
vehicles sales volume of 4.3m, it lost Dollars 1,631 on every vehicle sold
in the US.
The group, which has only made a profit in one quarter since Mr Stempel
became chairman, is bleeding red ink. It yesterday reported a third quarter
net loss of Dollars 753m, bringing its losses for the first nine months of
1992 to Dollars 971m. Nor is there any likelihood of a return to the black
in the near future.
The outlook is sufficiently bleak for some analysts to be raising the
spectre of GM eventually filing under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
That is hardly imminent, but it could become possible two to three years
down the road if GM fails to turn round the source of all its problems - its
core North American automotive business.
For the red ink here is overwhelming the profitability not only of GM's
international car operations, but also of its three huge non-automotive
subsidiaries - General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), its finance
arm, GM Hughes Electronics, the aerospace group, and EDS, the data systems
business.
Over the past two years the North American car operations have lost a
staggering Dollars 12bn, including special restructuring charges, and
analysts expect it to lose up to Dollars 4bn this year.
Cash has been draining from the business at a disturbing rate and GM has
been plugging the gap through additional borrowings and the issuance of some
Dollars 4bn of new equity so far this year. The group also has a large
unfunded pension liability , which some analysts believe could reach Dollars
12bn, or roughly a quarter of liabilities, by the end of this year.
GM's credit ratings remain reasonably good, but Moody's Investors Service is
reviewing Dollars 70bn of its debt and Standard &amp; Poor's, the other big
rating agency, says it might lower the company's ratings by mid-1993 unless
the financial performance improves.
The most immediate danger for GM is that the agencies might lower the rating
on its commercial paper - low cost short-term money which GMAC relies on
heavily. This would raise its borrowing costs significantly.
Boardroom concern over the debt ratings may have been a factor in the timing
of Mr Stempel's downfall and the more aggressive revamping programme which
now seems likely.
Yet GM's North American car problems are of such long-standing (and were
acquiesced to by many of the non-executive board members now wielding the
axe) that a turnround will not come quickly or simply.
GM was created in the early years of the century when Mr Willy Durant, an
entrepreneur with a passion for motoring, merged together a group of
fledgling car businesses. It was then forged into an efficient bureaucracy
in the 1930s by Mr Alfred P. Sloan, one of the giants of American industry.
But it so came to dominate the US car market, with roughly 50 per cent of
all sales in the 1950s and 1960s, that complacency set in.
Dominated by finance men (ironically, Mr Stempel was the first chairman with
an engineering background since the 1950s), it lost touch with the market
place and was ill-prepared for the mushrooming of Japanese manufacturing
plants in the US in the 1980s. In the last decade it became mesmerised by
futuristic technologies and the drive to build 'the 21st Century
corporation'. Its investment of tens of billions of dollars obscured the
failure to keep abreast of the basics of successful car-making.
GM's share of the car market plunged, from around 46 per cent at the start
of the decade to around 35 per cent now, as its dull, poorly designed,
look-alike cars, with a dubious quality record, lost ground to the Japanese.
However, the company failed to slim down, shielded from the financial
implications of its crumbling market by booming US demand and its sheer
size. So when recession hit in 1990 it found itself saddled with hugely
uneconomic factories and bloated bureaucracies.
Mr Stempel, after several early rounds of cutting, finally bit the bullet
hard last December when he announced plans for the closure of 21 plants and
the loss of 74,000 jobs - 20,000 white collar and 54,000 blue collar - by
the mid-1990s.
But non-executives on the board, concerned that the revolution was not
moving fast enough, staged a mini-coup in April: Mr Stempel was replaced as
chairman of the board's executive committee by an outside director, Mr John
Smale, while the chairman's right-hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, the head of
north America, was replaced by Mr John Smith, formerly head of international
operations.
Under Mr Smith, who won his spurs turning around GM Europe in the 1980s, the
pace of change has speeded up, but the management has faced increasing
opposition, most notably from the United Auto Workers' union, which staged
two strikes at local parts plants in the early autumn.
These were ostensibly over local grievances, but the so-called 'Apache
raids' were widely seen as warning shots to GM over job cuts. The board
evidently felt Mr Stempel did not respond to the union threats sufficiently
robustly.
The position of chairman is expected to be filled, at least on an interim
basis, by Mr Smale, a tough manager who revitalised the bureaucratic Procter
&amp; Gamble in the 1980s, while Mr Smith is likely to take on Mr Stempel's
chief executive mantle. Their most crucial tasks include to:
Close assembly and parts plants and use the remaining ones more efficiently.
So far GM has only announced the names of 14 of the 21 plants scheduled for
closure. More are expected before the end of the year.
Conserve cash. Directors may consider cutting the dividend at next Monday's
board meeting.
Cut its components costs. One of the most dramatic changes instituted by Mr
Smith has been the creation of the post of worldwide parts purchasing chief.
The aim is to use GM's scale economies to buy components from whatever
suppliers around the world can combine good quality with the cheapest
prices.
Demands for price cuts of 20 per cent or more from some US suppliers have
stirred up strong opposition, while GM's own vast network of parts
subsidiaries fears it will lose business and jobs.
Sell off non-essential components businesses. Mr Smith is expected to
announce GM is willing to dispose of some large slices of its parts
operations and reduce the company's vertical integration.
Quickly cut the size of the workforce. The company has announced plans to
speed up by a year its planned 20,000 white collar job cuts, which should be
completed by the end of 1993.
It is also believed to be negotiating a deal with the UAW which would offer
blue-collar workers special financial incentives to leave the company early.
This could mean a considerable charge against earnings but could also reduce
the potential conflict with the UAW over job losses.
Negotiate a new labour pact with the UAW. The current three-year deal, due
to expire a year from now, contains remarkably generous GM concessions: any
worker it lays off continues to receive virtual full pay out of a special
Dollars 4bn company fund.
Given the weakness of the car market, there are doubts whether the fund will
last till next autumn (which gives the union a strong incentive to support
the early retirement scheme), but the UAW will doubtless want the package
renewed in 1993.
GM will want to negotiate cuts in its healthcare provisions, which have long
given the company the nickname 'Generous Motors'. It recently announced
plans to make white-collar workers pick up a larger share of their health
costs.
Rationalise its engineering and manufacturing organisations. Last week Mr
Smith announced plans to cut from six to four the number of GM car
engineering and manufacturing divisions in north America, with the loss of
some 10,000 white-collar jobs.
The idea is to simplify the GM product range, standardise parts not visible
to the customer, and eliminate the rivalry between design, engineering and
manufacturing operations.
The ultimate goal is to cut the number of platforms - the chassis to which
different styles of passenger compartment are mated - from nearly 20 to just
seven.
There is enough ammunition here for any number of UAW 'Apache raid' strikes
over the coming months, or a full-blown union-management confrontation next
year.
However, over the past few weeks union leaders appear to have been adopting
a more conciliatory tone and the ousting of Mr Stempel sends a powerful
message of management determination.
Even if it cuts costs successfully, GM will still face the huge challenge of
maintaining its market share, which depends heavily on deeply discounted
sales to fleet buyers, such as car rental companies, and conservative,
ageing individuals who are gradually dying off.
It has some hits, such as the Saturn, a compact car built by a separate
company which imitates the best Japanese practices, but is weak in buoyant
sectors such as sports utility vehicles, mini-vans and mid-sized saloons.
The turnround of its operations in Europe (where the market is weakening)
shows what GM can do, yet the US is a far larger and more complicated
operation, and time is very short. Mr Smith's Long March could become very
gruelling.

and biggest potential labour flashpoints - in GM's efforts to slash its US
costs will come in the group's components manufacturing subsidiaries.
GM is the most vertically integrated car assembler in the US, getting some
70 per cent of parts from its own subsidiaries.
This has several drawbacks. First, GM's parts operations have a captive
market which reduces the pressures to improve efficiency. Second, many
employees at the in-house components companies belong to the United Auto
Workers' union and thus can command higher wages than workers for outside
contractors. Third, GM's dependence on in-house businesses makes it
vulnerable to strikes.
This was demonstrated in late August when a strike at a stamping plant in
Lordstown, Ohio, quickly idled 10 assembly plants.
GM officials have long argued the group should shift components purchasing
more to outside suppliers, but this has been fiercely resisted by the UAW.
GM's new cost-cutting regime could thus lead to a fierce tustle. The GM
automotive components group is expected to have sales this year of Dollars
24bn, some 80 per cent of it with GM and the rest with outside customers. It
employs 195,000 people worldwide and operates 195 manufacturing plants in 14
countries.
GM's new global parts purchasing chief, Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, has
stirred fears of job losses in the components companies by threatening to
buy only from the world's most efficient, low-cost, high-quality
manufacturers.
While seeking internal improvements, GM may be preparing to sell off some
major components operations. It has made a start, putting its bearings
business up for sale.

FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Trio of offshoots take
leading roles in their sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GM'S VEHICLE operations overshadow its three huge non-automotive
subsidiaries, yet each of the trio is one of the largest American businesses
in its sector.
Electronic Data Systems (EDS), based in Dallas, Texas, is one of the world's
leading computer services companies and was acquired by GM in 1984 from its
founder, Mr Ross Perot.
Mr Perot joined the GM board with the aim of introducing entrepreneurial
flair to the company but quit in 1986 after repeated disputes with the
management.
Even without him, EDS has gone from strength to strength. Some of its work
involves systems integration - designing computer networks for corporate
customers. But it also runs entire data processing departments for companies
in return for a fee - so-called 'outsourcing' - and is benefitting from a
strong corporate trend in this direction.
EDS handles most of GM's computer operations, but its non-GM revenues are
larger than those in-house and are forecast to reach 66 per cent of the
total in 1993, compared with just 29 per cent in 1985.
That shift has been helped by acquisitions, including the British group
SD-Scicon. It made net profits of Dollars 547m last year on revenues of
Dollars 7.1bn and this week reported income of Dollars 457m for the first
nine months of 1992, up from Dollars 407m.
GM Hughes Electronics has had a more chequered performance since Hughes
Aircraft was bought in an auction by GM for Dollars 5.2bn six years ago. GM
then merged Hughes with its Delco Electronics business, a leader in
automotive electronics. The idea was for GM to diversify its revenues while
taking advantage of Hughes' expertise in systems integration, optics and
other high technology areas.
Rivals Chrysler and Ford both joined the trend but rapidly sold off their
aerospace operations when recession loomed. Many analysts believe GM should
have done the same, or never bought Hughes in the first place.
First, technical transfer between the two businesses has not been
particularly exciting. Examples include 'head up' instrument displays in
some new car models and involvement by Hughes in the development of
battery-powered cars.
For another, Hughes has suffered from the sharp decline in the US defence
budget and its earnings have moved erratically. Earlier this year GM had to
take a Dollars 749m after-tax write-off to cover a restructuring of the
subsidiary, including the elimination of 9,000 jobs. Last year it made
Dollars 435m, down from Dollars 577m in 1990.
General Motors Acceptance Corporation was founded in the early days of GM to
finance car purchases and has grown into the largest non-bank finance
company in the US, with assets of around Dollars 100bn, offering financial
and insurance services to car dealers and buyers, as well as mortgage
banking, marine financing and investment services.
It reported net income last year of Dollars 1.37bn and made Dollars 942m in
the first nine months of this year, up from Dollars 936m. It borrows heavily
in the short-term commercial paper market and would suffer seriously from a
down-grading of GM's credit rating.

FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Smale poised to head
new line-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SOMEONE once defined General Motors as a 'mid-western car company', an
image that strikes at the heart of the parochialism that has plagued the
company since at least the late 1950s.'
So wrote Wall Street analyst Maryann Keller in a perceptive 1989 book on
GM's woes.
The company is so vast, and its insular, bureaucratic culture so entrenched,
that some analysts question whether any executives from within can achieve
radical change. On the other hand, fresh talent from outside would spend
precious time groping to understand the complexity of the beast.
The new management line-up expected to be announced after Monday's board
meeting goes some way to resolving this dilemma: the two men most likely to
occupy the top jobs have long experience of GM, yet each is, in his own way,
an outsider.
Mr John Smale, 65, the non-executive director who has led GM's boardroom
revolt, is expected to become chairman, at least on an interim basis.
A 10-year veteran of the GM board, Mr Smale was chairman in the 1980s of
Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, which he was credited with
shaking up.
A tough, no-nonsense executive, he led P &amp; G on an acquisitions drive,
pushed it into international markets and restructured its systems. One of
his greatest strengths - something GM has lacked - is marketing flair.
Potential weaknesses include a low-key style when the GM chairman needs to
be proclaiming revolution.
Mr Jack Smith, 54, currently GM president, is expected to be named chief
executive. An unassuming man, he has a reputation for decisiveness and
delegation.
He made his name in Europe in the 1980s when he turned around GM's
loss-making operations there. Much of what he learnt there is being applied
to the US, including setting up his own tiny headquarters staff away from
the GM bureaucracy in central Detroit.
Another executive who may emerge in a more powerful role from any reshuffle
is Mr William Hoglund, 58, who was moved up to the post of chief financial
officer in April's boardroom coup.
Popular with middle managers, he has been trying to break up the centralised
financial staff and spread its members to operating divisions.
He has a reputation as a maverick and said this year that motor industry
executives should be as creative as rock-and-roll musicians.

FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Asia Pacific off to
slow start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Asia Pacific new vehicle market has enjoyed the fastest growth rate of
any region during the past 15 years, but General Motors remains a relatively
small participant.
Its regional strategy remains fragmentary with its main presence revolving
around a 37.4 per cent shareholding in Isuzu, one of the smaller Japanese
vehicle makers. Isuzu is mainly a producer of commercial vehicles and
four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles, while its car operations lack the
scale of its competitors.
Isuzu is providing significant product and technology support for GM's light
commercial vehicle and four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicle ranges in
global markets, but it has also confronted GM with serious problems in the
face of continuing losses. GM also holds a 3.5 per cent stake in Suzuki.
Elsewhere in Asia one of GM's main targets for involvement in the rapid
growth of the region was in South Korea, where it has held a 50 per cent
stake in Daewoo Motor. GM had hoped to develop the venture as an important
low-cost production base in Asia. It provided technology in the shape of the
Opel Kadett which has been produced in South Korea and sold in the US.
But the venture has been dogged by problems and by the divergent ambitions
of the two shareholders, GM and the Daewoo group. The conflicts have led
this year to divorce and a final agreement is expected to be signed soon,
under which the Daewoo group will take over GM's 50 per cent holding for
around Dollars 170m.
GM appears to be looking belatedly at the prospects for growth in China,
where it formed a joint venture early this year for the production of light
commercial vehicles. It has been more successful in Taiwan, where it sold
nearly 15,000 vehicles last year and plans to begin assembling Opel cars
next year.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Axa fall reflects French
insurers' gloom
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AXA, one of the largest French insurers which last year invested Dollars 1bn
in Equitable Life Assurance of the US, suffered a 34 per cent fall in
first-half net profits due to a reduction in exceptional gains and forecast
a further fall in profits for the full year.
The decline in profits, from FFr1.48bn in the first six months of 1991 to
FFr979m (Dollars 190.09m) in the same period this year, is the latest gloomy
announcement from the big French insurance companies in the current interim
reporting season.
Earlier this week, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) reported lower
first-half profits, as did Assurances Generales de France late last month.
The insurers have been hit by intense competition in their domestic market
over the past year, particularly in the commercial and motor sectors.
The insurance industry has also been affected by the problems of the
property market and the general malaise in the corporate sector, which have
depressed the value of their investment portfolios.
However, Axa, which is chaired by Mr Claude Bebear, managed to make progress
in its insurance activities despite the general pressures on the French
market.
Axa said that net profits from its insurance and reinsurance businesses rose
by 119 per cent in the interim period.
Sales increased by 16 per cent from FFr25.05bn to FFr30.34bn in the first
six months of this year.
This reflected growth in insurance sales both inside and outside France,
together with strong sales increases from its reinsurance and financial
services interests.
However, Axa experienced a sharp fall in the contribution from sales of
peripheral interests, which contributed FFr875m to its 1991 first-half
figures.
A further reduction in exceptional gains is expected during the second half,
which should produce a 'significant decrease' in net profits for the full
financial year.
However, Axa anticipates a 'small positive' contribution from Equitable
Life.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SVENSKA KREDIT, Sweden's leading credit insurer, has filed for bankruptcy
after its two main shareholders, Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP, and four major
banks failed to reach agreement over its future.
The collapse could have a serious impact on the ability of Swedish companies
to get credit insurance cover and guarantees.
However, since Svenska Kredit suspended payments, two foreign insurers -
Holland's NCM and Germany's Hermes - have stepped in to fill part of the gap
in the market.
The insurer suspended payments on September 9 following reports that it
could face losses of SKr5bn-SKr10bn (Dollars 863m-Dollars 1.72bn).
Since then Skandia and Trygg-Hansa, which each own 47 per cent of Svenska
Kredit, and SE Banken, Handelsbanken, Nordbanken and Sparbanken have
attempted to agree an orderly winding-up of Svenska Kredit over three years.
These talks collapsed, with Svenska Kredit blaming the banks. 'Since the
banks were not prepared to assume risk for any part of the liquidity that
Svenska Kredit could require during the winding-up period, the parties
declared there were no longer any grounds for reaching agreement,' it
stated.
Between 1991 and September 1992, the insurer paid out SKr2.2bn to creditors
whose customers were unable to meet their obligations.
Skandia said it faced a maximum of SKr450m in losses as a result of the
collapse, in addition to a SKr213m write-down at the interim stage.

<TEXT>
VITAL Forsikring, one of Norway's top three insurers, yesterday disclosed a
plunge in nine-month profits to NKr226m (Dollars 36.1m) from NKr1.02bn. The
company blamed a sharp fall in the value of its securities portfolio and
interest rate instability in the domestic bond market for the slide.
It was forced to charge accounts with a NKr453m write-down on shares and
warned of lower profits for the year as a whole compared with last year's
profit of NKr718m.
'These are weak figures,' said Mr Bjoern Elvestad, president. 'Although the
financial markets have developed more favourably in the fourth quarter, it
is unlikely the overall return in 1992 will match last year's result.'
Vital's free shares yesterday closed 10.4 per cent down at NKr60 on the Oslo
bourse.
Group financial income in the nine-month period was cut by NKr807m to
NKr1.621bn, but Vital said it had realised and unrealised gains on bonds and
equities in October of an estimated NKr320m. 'Since the end of the third
quarter the bond market has stabilised and the stock market has shown signs
of recovery,' Vital said.
Premium income increased by 12 per cent to NKr1.98bn in the period as
operating expenses remained at NKr399m.
Vital said it had secured several new corporate pension scheme agreements,
but not all of these had been included in nine-month accounts.
Group assets grew to NKr34.17bn from NKr33.11bn in the nine-month period.
Vital said losses on property loans were a modest NKr20m, or 0.14 per cent
of aggregate lending.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nomura may not aid small brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest broker, yesterday warned that there are
tough times ahead for the securities industry and that the company may not
have the resources to overhaul all of its ailing affiliated brokers.
Mr Yukio Aida, chairman, said Nomura had a tradition of assisting smaller
brokers which are affiliated with the company, but 'even Nomura' may be
incapable of rescuing these brokers in the present difficult circumstances.
'Some of these affiliates are in bad shape. We are concerned about this. I
am apprehensive,' Mr Aida said.
His comments followed the release last week of miserable first-half results
by Japanese brokers. All 10 of the country's second-tier brokers reported a
loss and Nomura itself showed a net loss of Y8.5bn (Dollars 69.67m).
Mr Aida said most Japanese securities companies have begun a restructuring
necessary for their 'survival', and that Nomura has concentrated on cutting
personnel and computer costs.
Nomura has close ties with two second-tier brokers, Sanyo Securities and
Kokusai Securities, and links with about another 30 smaller brokers.
These smaller brokers are more reliant on individual investors, who have
withdrawn from the market because of the collapse in share prices and the
spate of securities scandals last year.
The plight of smaller brokers was highlighted yesterday by a Tokyo Stock
Exchange report that its member brokers have suffered their first collective
loss.
The TSE said its 124 members, including 25 foreign companies, had a combined
pre-tax loss of Y177.2bn in the first half, compared with a combined profit
of Y7.1bn last year.
Those losses would have been much larger if the companies had written off
the losses on their securities holdings - in an attempt to encourage the
stock market in August, the finance ministry allowed brokers to delay the
write-off until the end of the fiscal year in March.
Mr Aida said that a government assistance package announced in August had
helped the stock market, but the stimulus so far had been a 'bit
artificial', and the role the government can play in the market was limited.
He said the market had been weighed down by the difficulties of the
country's manufacturers, particularly the export-oriented companies, whose
profits have been bruised by the appreciation of the yen. However, 'in the
longer-term', he said, many of these companies are likely to prosper.
As for the securities industry's relationship with the Ministry of Finance,
which was severely strained during the scandals last year, Mr Aida said that
the links have been restored but that the brokers are now less 'mothered' by
the ministry.
'Before last year, the ministry was like a father and a mother. Now it is
more of a father. In the past, there was too much of the mother, and now
aspects of the mother are disappearing,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is to take part in a new joint venture financial institution, the
Russian American Investment Bank, in equal partnership with leading western
institutions.
The joint venture has been established in Moscow with the backing of Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and financial participation of the
Russian army pension fund and some of the Russian federation's richest
natural resource regions.
Western shareholders, who have jointly put up Dollars 10m for their 50 per
stake in the bank, include AIG, the US insurance company headed by Mr
Maurice Greenberg; Chemical Banking Corporation; Smith Barney, the broking
house; and J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn &amp; Co, the recently formed London-based
investment bank chaired by Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US
Federal Reserve Bank who now advises Mr Yeltsin.
Russian shareholders include Fund Guarantiya (the army pension fund), the
Foreign Trade Bank of Russia, Unikom bank, the Innovation Fund of Moscow,
Gasprom (Russia's gas industry association) together with the gas-rich
autonomous region of Komi, west Siberian oil region of Tyumen, diamond and
gold producing region of Yakutia and Baltic port region of Kaliningrad.
The western partners will initially concentrate on financial advisory work
and corporate and project financing. This will be focused on natural
resources development and conversion of military enterprises. Foreign
investors should find it easier to find Russian partners.
Welcoming this marriage of western high finance and Russia's nascent
financial institutions at the signing ceremony in Moscow, President Yeltsin
described the new investment bank as 'the bridge over which Russian
businessmen will join with American and other international investors'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Harmony calls for rejection of rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARMONY LEISURE, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday
launched a fierce attack on rebel shareholders who are seeking an
extraordinary meeting to oust the company's executive directors.
Urging investors to reject the proposals, Harmony said the leaders of the
dissident group had misled shareholders about their former directorships and
offered no concrete plans for reviving the company.
'They have been less than candid in their own descriptions and somewhat
economical with the truth,' said Mr Robert Dawson, non-executive chairman.
According to Harmony, rebel leader Mr Andrew Martyr - who claims the backing
of 30 per cent of the shareholders - had never been on the board of Holiday
Inns International, although he listed the company among his directorships
when he first asked shareholders for support.
Mr Dawson also suggested that Harmony's bankers could withdraw their backing
if the rebel moves were approved.
The company's annual accounts, published earlier this month, were qualified
after bankers demanded a substantial reduction in overdrafts and loans.
Barclays is understood to be seeking a six figure debt reduction.
Harmony's pre-tax loss rose 70 per cent to Pounds 3.68m on turnover of
Pounds 6.44m in the 52 weeks ended March 29.
Notifying shareholders of an extraordinary general meeting on November 26,
Mr Dawson said the company was 'actively examining alternatives which
include improving the quality of Harmony's assets within a larger grouping.
This should improve shareholder value over time and be reflected by a higher
share price'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Utd Newspapers to redeem Pounds 105m
preference shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily
Star, yesterday announced its intention to redeem its Pounds 105m guaranteed
exchangeable preference shares by the end of the year.
The decision is expected to enhance earnings in the current year and could
result in a potential gain to shareholders' funds of up to Pounds 20m.
The preference shares were issued in 1989 at Pounds 1,000 each, as a method
of converting United's 2.7 per cent stake in the Reuters news agency into
cash.
They carried annual interest of 8 per cent. They can be redeemed on December
23 or exchanged for 114.1 Reuters shares before December 14.
At last night's price of 1,178p for Reuters stock, a preference share would
be worth Pounds 1,344.
United said last night that it expected most of the 105,000 preference
shares to be exchanged into Reuters stock. That would cut United's stake in
Reuters to less than 0.5 per cent.
If all preference holders swapped for Reuters, then earnings attributable to
shareholders would be increased by about Pounds 3m on an annual basis, the
company said.
That represented the difference between making the interest payments on the
preference shares and the cost of holding the Reuters shares.
The company said the value of the Reuters shares carried on the balance
sheet was substantially lower than the exchange price represented in the
preference deal of 876.5p.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wilton setting its sights on expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wilton Group is well on the way towards disposing of the bulk of its
commercial property portfolio. That, and the improving position at
Glenchewton, would 'place the company in a position to consider proposals
for expansion within the near future,' said Mr Michael Buckley, chairman.
Glenchewton is the 70 per cent-owned listed subsidiary, activities of which
cover the wholesaling and distribution of toys, electrical components,
hardware and housewares.
Mr Buckley said Wilton had sold more than 50 per cent of its commercial
property portfolio and the proceeds of Pounds 4.1m had reduced indebtedness.
Most of the remaining Pounds 4m portfolio should be sold before the
year-end, with further impact on borrowing.
Reporting for the first half of 1992, Mr Buckley said the group incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 753,000 on turnover of Pounds 14.6m. That was not
comparable with the previous profit of Pounds 68,000 on sales of Pounds
1.16m, as the latest figures included Glenchewton.
Losses per share came to 0.15p (earnings 0.01p). Loss on disposal of
property interests amounting to Pounds 1.34m was included in extraordinary
charges.
At Glenchewton, the ongoing rationalisation was producing improved results.
The trading pre-tax loss, before exceptional items, was reduced to Pounds
489,000 (Pounds 679,000) on sales of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 13.8m). A
significant profit was expected in the second half.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cullens Holdings, the food retailer, swung into the red with a loss at the
pre-tax level of Pounds 16,000 for the six months to August 30.
The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 370,000 last time and profits
of Pounds 754,000 at the March 1 year end.
The deficit was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 113,000 (Pounds
38,000 profits) which comprised mainly abortive site development costs and
losses incurred on new sites prior to full trading.
Gross turnover for the six months was Pounds 10.9m, against Pounds 10.1m in
the comparable period. Losses per share came out at 0.1p (earnings 1.3p).

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Currency jitters focus on Unilever swap
option - The difficult decisions behind the switch strategy on Anglo-Dutch
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S downward roller-coaster slide in recent weeks has sent fund
managers reaching for their computer models and calculators to gauge the
potential for switching shares issued in pounds and guilders by Unilever and
Shell, the Anglo-Dutch groups.
The subject has acquired added importance in recent weeks following the
announced merger of Reed International and Elsevier, the British and Dutch
publishing groups. Investors have eagerly awaited further details of the
merger, particularly since exchange rate turmoil has probably made it harder
for the two to reconcile the values of the Dutch and UK businesses. Reed
might reveal more information with its results today.
The decision to switch from one stock to the other is not an easy one, with
several factors to take into account. While the arguments are basically the
same for both groups, the recent experience of Unilever highlights the
problems.
It has been estimated that about 5 per cent of the stock has been swapped.
Earlier this month, several institutions switched from Dutch shares in
Unilever NV to UK shares in Unilever PLC as sterling tumbled. They believed
that Unilever earnings per share, as expressed in sterling, would grow
faster due to favourable overseas earnings.
Some brokers, however, caution that currency considerations are only one
aspect of the switching argument. They say this is demonstrated by NV's
shares outperforming LC.
As the accompanying chart shows, the PLC shares have been running at a 5-10
per cent premium to their NV equivalent for most of 1992, sustained by a
combination of greater liquidity, sterling's membership of the ERM - pre-mid
September - and the periodic outperformance of the London market relative to
the Amsterdam bourse. This led to successive bouts of switching from the PLC
to the NV's, particularly as the PLC's premium to the latter crept up
towards the 10 per cent mark. PLC has also been subject to individual
shocks, for example the Tory election victory in April which boosted the
premium from about 5 to 9 per cent. Sterling's exit from the ERM had the
reverse effect.
If the difference between the two shares is less than 3 per cent, then most
brokers agree that the switch is uneconomical. But beyond that there is
differing opinion as when to consider the move.
'There is no precise science in this,' says Mr John Campbell, food
manufacturing analyst at County NatWest and a former head of investor
relations at Unilever. 'It is a combination of several key components, of
which currency is only one.'
Dividend yield is often cited as one of the fundamental considerations
behind a switch decision and sterling's recent nosedive has made Unilever's
interim dividend payment - to be announced next week - all the more
pertinent.
Merchant bank Robert Fleming says that, in light of the sterling crisis and
the company's method of equalising dividend payments between its two sets of
shareholders, NV shares are likely to enjoy a better yield than the PLCs.
Under the equalisation agreement - with 3 NV shares equal to 20 PLC shares -
the interim dividend is calculated by the average exchange rate during the
third quarter.
Fleming calculates that at an average rate of Pounds 1:Fl 3.14 in the
company's third quarter, and assuming that the NV dividends are raised in
line with market expectations of profits of about 3.3 per cent, PLC
shareholders could see a 10 per cent rise in their interim dividend to 5.5p.
But at rates on the date of dividend declaration (assuming no big shift from
today's 2.76), PLC dividends would be 9 per cent lower than those being paid
to NV shareholders.
Taxation is another factor. Gross UK funds, such as pension funds, which
hold NV shares are subject to a 15 per cent Dutch withholding tax on
dividends. Life funds face a corporate tax of 33 per cent, while UK mutual
funds must pay a 25 per cent levy.
While not quite the same, it is a similar story for Dutch investors holding
PLC shares. And while gross funds at first glance look good to switch, both
UK and Dutch investors tend to favour the PLCs and NVs respectively because
they can only reclaim their domestic witholding tax.
For US investors, the vexed question of taxation faced by most of their
European counterparts is simpler. They are subject to the same 15 per cent
witholding tax in both PLC and NV shares; a tax neutral situation making
their ability to switch easier.
Not surprisingly, it is from the US that most switching originates. US
investors, who trade both NV and PLC shares in New York, now hold some 20
per cent of Unilever equity.
And with the continued strength of the Dutch guilder relative to sterling,
some observers believe that US investors may prefer to take the NV route to
Unilever as the uncertain economic outlook persists, closing down the PLC
premium.
As the gap persists, fund managers continue to plot sterling's plight with
added interest. Mr Carl Short, food analyst at Nomura, said: 'Currency is
very much a double-edged sword when it comes to switching.
When sterling depreciates against other currencies, there is a translation
gain which benefits the group's earnings per share growth when expressed in
sterling terms.
'However, the positive impact of this on the PLC share price needs to be set
against the relative capital disadvantage of holding a sterling asset.'
It has been a similar story at Shell, where the Dutch shares have been at a
premium to the UK shares, which trade as Shell Transport. Black Wednesday
sent Royal Dutch to a temporary high premium of 11 per cent from about 6 per
cent. Arbitrageurs bought into Shell Transport and narrowed the gap.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: ICI suffers downturn in third quarter

   PROFIT THROUGHOUT Imperial Chemical Industries's divisions
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
except regional businesses - fell during the third quarter, according to the
results revealed yesterday.
And the regional operations' profits remained static at Pounds 1m.
Even the theoretically counter-cyclical operations allocated to ICI
Bioscience - pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities - suffered a
downturn.
The pharmaceuticals division endured a 4 per cent fall in sales from Pounds
409m to Pounds 393m, while operating profits also dropped from Pounds 147m
to Pounds 146m. Such a result is highly unusual in the pharmaceuticals
industry.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said trading was affected by the dollar's
weakness and the effects of US generic competition to Tenormin, its
best-selling heart drug, whose American patents expired in September last
year.
Mr Colin Short, finance director, said underlying growth of the
pharmaceuticals business was about 3 per cent during the first nine months
and about 4 per cent during the last quarter.
Tenormin has 54 per cent of the US market, while ICI's generic version of
the product commanded 16 per cent, Mr Short said. Tenormin, the world's
fifth largest-selling drug last year, was one of the largest US patent
expiries in recent years after aggressive targeting by the generics
companies.
Its sales fell faster than expected. Mr Short said the company was unable to
increase prices - a classic strategy to compensate for volume falls when
patents expired - because of political hostility to drug price inflation.
The generics' rate of penetration was slowing, he added.
Tenormin's decline was partly offset by the growth of newer products. Sales
of Zestril, a heart drug, increased by 29 per cent to well over Pounds 250m,
said Mr Short. Zoladex, a cancer treatment, increased 57 per cent to more
than Pounds 100m, while sales of Diprivan, an anaesthetic, grew 28 per cent,
to more than Pounds 100m. The pharmaceuticals division benefited from the
Pounds 10m disposal of its pre-natal vitamin business.
Agrochemical and seed turnover fell from Pounds 243 to Pounds 252m, in what
tends to be a slow quarter. The business incurred a loss of Pounds 2m
compared with a Pounds 1m profit during the same period last year. Sir Denys
said that intense competition in the US herbicide market and concerns about
the restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy in Europe contributed to
a decline in profitability.
Sales of specialities fell from Pounds 311m to Pounds 290m, while profits
fell from Pounds 5m to nothing. During the nine months, Sir Denys said
benefits from cost reduction programmes in the specialities and materials
divisions was offset by reduced volumes and lower prices.
In what remains in the new ICI, materials generated turnover of Pounds 419m
(Pounds 513m) and a loss of Pounds 27m (Pounds 14m loss). Paints's turnover
fell from Pounds 434m to Pounds 394m, while operating profits dropped from
Pounds 42m to Pounds 33m. Explosives's revenues sagged from Pounds 141m to
Pounds 132m and its trading profits from Pounds 15m to Pounds 9m.
The massive industrial chemicals business fell into a loss of Pounds 1m from
a Pounds 42m profit during the same period last year. Turnover fell from
Pounds 3.07bn to Pounds 2.77bn. Sir Denys said chemicals and polymers
continued to suffer falling prices and weak volumes. Tioxide's results for
the first nine months remained static compared with last year.
Regional business turnover fell from Pounds 315m to Pounds 284m, while
profits remained static at Pounds 1m. In the first nine months they made a
trading loss of Pounds 18m (Pounds 4m profit).

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Rebel shareholder renews assault on
Etonbrook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW PERLOFF, the rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, the property
developer, yesterday launched his second attempt in less than six months to
take his holding to just under 30 per cent.
The property entrepreneur announced a tender offer for 10.86 per cent of
Etonbrook shares at 73p each, valuing the company at Pounds 2.8m. Mr Perloff
and the three companies acting with him hold 19.13 per cent of Etonbrook.
The action leaves little doubt among Etonbrook's management that Mr Perloff
is seeking control of the company without launching a full bid.
'It is a further attempt in the saga . . . of trying to get control at a
cheap and cheeky price,' said Mr Keith Moss, managing director. The offer
was too low against a net asset value of 117p, he said.
Twice before - in the cases of Multitrust and the Children's Medical
Investment Trust - Mr Perloff has built stakes of just under 30 per cent in
quoted companies before making an offer.
Although Mr Perloff has twice failed to win a seat on the Etonbrook board,
he has managed to thwart plans for a capital restructuring. This would have
allowed Etonbrook to repay its Pounds 1.19m preference shares. One of
Etonbrook's attractions is likely to be its cash balance of Pounds 2m.
The preference holder, Palmerston Investment Trust, is Etonbrook's second
largest shareholder with 12 per cent. It said that it had no intention of
accepting the tender offer.

HAEMOCELL, which has seen its shares more than double this month following
US approval for its blood filtering device, yesterday announced a 1-for-4

The rights were priced last week at a 30 per cent discount. But the shares

prospects for the device. They closed at 249p.
Before approval for the device from the US Food and Drug Administration,
they traded at 95p.
The proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings of Pounds 1.1m, upgrade
manufacturing equipment and for working capital.
Directors Mr Trevor Wilson and Mr Philip Martin, have renounced their
rights. Mr Wilson has also placed 400,000 shares with UK institutions and,
following the rights, his stake will fall to 11.1 per cent while Mr Martin
will hold 14 per cent.
They have been constrained from selling since the company joined the USM.
The company also wanted to increase its institutional shareholders, who will
hold more than 40 per cent after the rights.
Mr Andrew Priestley, chairman, said the new money would allow the company to
improve facilities and develop new uses for the technology.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Thrifty move clips Heron's wings - The
background of the declining fortunes of Gerald Ronson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the man once lionised as 'the finest businessman of his generation', Mr
Gerald Ronson, must have yesterday been asking himself what had gone wrong.
To avoid liquidation he is proposing to give up all but 5 per cent of Heron
International, the private company he founded 27 years ago.
In the year ending March 1990, Heron, the second-largest private company in
the UK after Littlewoods, with 2,000 employees worldwide, made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 65.3m. According to unaudited figures sent to bondholders,
for March 1992 it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 217m. This prompted it to
enter into negotiations with its bondholders and bankers which resulted in
yesterday's restructuring proposals.
Heron includes Heron Homes, petrol stations, motor dealerships and the sole
Suzuki distributorship in the UK. In America, Heron has extensive property
interests and once owned the troubled Pima savings and loan institution in
Arizona. There was no shortage of Heron bankers willing to give their views
on the private company's fall from grace.
'In the go-go eighties Ronson was driven by a desire to do the next deal.
Some of them were great deals. But, with hindsight, too many of them were in
sectors which were to be hammered by the prolonged recession of the
nineties.'
Another banker opined: 'Three of Heron's main activities - property,
housebuilding and luxury car sales - were pulverised by the recession.'
It would be difficult to disagree with any of these explanations. However,
according to one of Heron's financial advisers, the reason for Heron's
downfall was more prosaic.
Heron made its big mistake when it moved across the Atlantic into the
booming American thrift business - the equivalent of British building
societies - by buying Pima.
By 1984 Pima was claimed to be the fastest-growing financial institution in
its home state of Arizona. Pima looked at one time as if it would prove to
be one of Mr Ronson's biggest successes.
'Unfortunately,' said the Heron adviser, 'it turned out to be one of its
biggest failures and the engine of the group's downfall.'
By 1989 the thrift industry had expanded into collapse as over-optimistic
borrowers got into difficulties and Pima was costing Heron some Pounds 40m a
year. It was also the business to which Guinness paid much of the Pounds
5.8m for Heron's support in the Distillers bid. Heron returned the money.
If it had not been for Pima, Heron's financial advisers believe it would
have probably ridden out the property slump and Mr Ronson would be able to
keep 100 per cent control of Heron, in spite of its total debts of Pounds
1.4bn.
Earlier in the year Mr Ronson was aware of the extensive restructuring
needed to save his company. He suggested various options, including the
splitting of bondholders' debt into interest-bearing and non-interest
bearing portions, along with a maturity extension and the rescheduling of
the bankers' debt.
It was not until KPMG Peat Marwick's circular to Heron's 82 creditor banks
in June, that Mr Ronson accepted the need for a debt-to-equity swap. The
accountants said Heron was 'technically insolvent' last March on the basis
of an asset review prepared by valuers Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks.
The recent devaluation of sterling only underlined Heron's problems - most
of its borrowings are in foreign-denominated currencies. Last month Mr
Ronson finally agreed to dilute the 100 per cent stake (15 per cent he held
personally, 40 per cent held by Ronson family trusts and 45 per cent held by
three Ronson charitable foundations) to just 5 per cent.
Friends say Mr Ronson's experience of Ford open prison, where he served six
months for his part in the Guinness scandal, has left him more determined
than ever to lead Heron out of its present crisis.
Although his wife Gail plans to resign from Heron's board she is expected to
continue to advise Mr Ronson over the restructuring of the company.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: City ambushed by Tomkins' latest target -
The take-over tactics of Greg Hutchings' cashed up conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past year the Tomkins name has rarely been far from takeover rumours
that periodically flash around the City. Earnings growth was beginning to
slow, possibly to stall; more than two years had elapsed since the last
acquisition; and the group had built a handsome Pounds 150m war chest.
But when Mr Greg Hutchings' industrial conglomerate yesterday launched a
recommended bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, countering a hostile approach
from his old boss Lord Hanson, it took City observers by surprise.
'We have a few hard weeks ahead of us to convince people it is not a
departure for us,' said Mr Hutchings.
Judging by the 19 per cent slide in the Tomkins share price yesterday, the
market would seem to be saying Mr Hutchings has some fast talking to do.
On the other hand, Mr Hutchings has his record on his side. Since starting
to build a conglomerate in 1982, his acquisitions have tended to be
infrequent and big, relative to the size of the business.
What is more, they have mostly been very good for shareholders.
The meteoric rise of Hutchings from the personal staff of Lord Hanson via
the 1982 acquisition of a small fasteners company, into chief executive of a
FT-SE 100 company has long passed into the history of 1980s acquisition
driven growth stocks.
But Mr Hutchings is usually credited with trying to build an industrial
conglomerate; RHM would take Tomkins far deeper into markets dependent on
the foibles of consumers' daily decisions about brands.
Mr Hutchings will be trying to remind sceptics that many of his previous
acquisitions have also been into markets that he knew nothing about. This is
a view echoed by Mr Geoffrey Eaton, Tomkins corporate development manager:
'We are always moving into new markets. When we bought Smith &amp; Wesson, we
knew nothing about guns; when we bought Murray Ohio in the US - a
loss-making bicycle maker - everyone threw up their hands in horror.'
Both have turned out to be good acquisitions.
Tomkins' last acquisition, Philips Industries in the US for Dollars 550m,
was typical of what people think Tomkins is about.
The US company was a widely based industrial group where the management was
disenchanted and attempting to put together a buy-out.
Prior to that, however, the 1989 acquisition of Murray Ohio for Dollars 224m
was closer to consumer markets as was Smith &amp; Wesson, the handgun company
bought for Dollars 112m a year earlier.
More importantly, most Tomkins' targets display a number of common threads.
They tend to be mature, low to medium technology manufacturing companies,
and are not in distribution.
They usually generate cash but are poorly managed with lacklustre
management.
RHM, Mr Hutchings says, has many of the same characteristics: 'It is a
manufacturing business and a management opportunity.'
Another Tomkins characteristic is the ruthless revitalisation strategy.
Targets are put swiftly on to the Tomkins' financial reporting system and
management is set strictly defined targets for cash and profits generation
and return on controllable capital employed.
RHM managers, encouraged by the prospect of a more energetic and focused
head office might take note of what they are up against.
'RHM has Pounds 1.4bn of costs that we can examine,' says Mr Hutchings.
While this strategy has been successful, it has left Tomkins with a growing
problem.
About 75 per cent of the business is in the US. Quite apart from currency
exposure problems, Tomkins is approaching a serious ACT problem as the
current mix of businesses do not generate enough UK profits.
The UK was therefore the most likely venue for the next acquisition.
Market reaction yesterday was varied. Conglomerate followers gave Tomkins
the benefit of the doubt because of its successful record.
Observers of the food industry, however, were more sceptical.
Mr Geoff Allum, at County NatWest, said there were clear reasons why Tomkins
would want the deal, not in the least Tomkins' apparent belief that UK
economic recovery is not imminent.
As a result, there was little point in Tomkins investing in recovery stocks,
many of which it believes are still over-priced.
Instead Tomkins' tighter control of costs and cash would be one of the few
sources of profits growth in the UK.
However, Mr Allum said Tomkins has not yet explained how it will lead RHM
out of the difficulties facing the bread market and the problems of the
milling and baking industry.
As a result, Mr Hutchings still has to convince large sectors of the market
that Pounds 935m is not too high a price. 'There may be something that can
be done if capacity in bread can be reduced,' Mr Allum said. 'But there is
no evidence that there is a reasonable strategy to sort out bread.'
Tomkins dismisses the scepticism. Baking, Mr Eaton says, is not a business
in terminal decline.
'The question is who is going to take out the (excess) capacity,' he says.
'We are profit not market share driven.'
Yesterday's share price fall in Tomkins left Mr Hutchings disappointed that
his strategy had not been better understood.
The question remains whether he will have the leisure to explain the move or
whether he will have to deal with a higher counter-offer from his old boss.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Howden expects to settle MT dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howden Group's shares yesterday rose 7p to 50p after the Glasgow-based
engineer announced that settlement of its dispute with MT Group was expected
before the end of the year.
The long-running dispute centres on a contract to supply tunnelling machines
to Denmark, where MT, the international consortium, is constructing twin
rail tunnels under the Great Belt waterway.
In the year to April 30, reduced provisions of Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 10.4m)
related to the matter helped Howden lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.1m
(Pounds 2.99m).
Howden said yesterday that a further announcement would be made shortly.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bank talks behind Pounds 14m loss says Lep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding group and security concern, blamed heavy
interim losses on uncertainty caused by its rescue talks and the continuing
impact of recession. The group was recently restructured by its banks.
In the six months to June 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 14.2m, compared with
profits of Pounds 1.9m, on turnover down from Pounds 749.1m to Pounds
644.9m. About Pounds 97m of the Pounds 104m sales decrease related to
discontinued activities.
Lep was brought to the brink of bankruptcy by borrowings of more than Pounds
500m but reached agreement in August with about 25 banks to convert Pounds
180m of debt into equity.
The losses were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 5.57m, of which
Pounds 3.37m related to restructuring costs and provisions and the rest
being the costs of the debt restructuring.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 17.1m), however future
charges will be reduced by the debt-for-equity swap.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.64m, most of it attributable
to the cost of withdrawing from certain property interests in the UK.
Mr David James, the company doctor brought in to advise Lep in March, said
the board was involved in a review of activities. This was likely to result
in further exceptional and extraordinary charges in the full-year results.
The attributable loss was Pounds 18.7m, (profit of Pounds 391,000). Losses
per share were 11.6p (earnings of 0.4p). Because of the accumulated losses,
the board said it did not expect to pay any dividend for some years.
Mr James, who became chairman and chief executive in August, said that
despite the significant losses, the underlying continuing operations
remained profitable overall. This was reflected by operating income from
continuing businesses, before exceptionals, of Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 16.4m).
No provision has been made in these accounts regarding a claim against the
company launched in October by ADT, the security group which has written off
Pounds 65m of its 27 per cent stake in Lep. ADT claims it relied on
misleading public statements by Lep when it bought the shares in 1990.
LEP has booked a profit of Pounds 1.89m on a deal with its own pension fund
trustees which caused a shortfall in the fund. In June last year Lep sold
its fund a property for Pounds 12.5m, which was subsequently valued at
Pounds 8.5m. Lep now pays the fund Pounds 1m a year in rent for the London
office development.
The deal represented a high proportion of the fund's Pounds 28m assets at a
time when self-investment had been criticised in the pensions industry.
In June this year the trustees said the fund had a shortfall of Pounds
900,000 and suspended transfers out of the fund by former employees. Lep has
agreed to increase its pension contributions significantly in order to
eliminate the shortfall within two to three years.
Lep said yesterday that the Pounds 1.89m profit on the sale had not been
recorded in the 1991 accounts. The figure has now been included in restated
UK property profits of Pounds 5.24m for the half-year to June last year.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Management set to buy British International
Helicopters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONAL agreement has been reached with a management buy-out team for
the sale of British International Helicopters, Mr Robert Maxwell's old
helicopter company. The company has 26 helicopters and 400 staff, mainly
operating in the North Sea and to the Isles of Scilly.
Arthur Andersen, administrators to the private Maxwell interests, said
yesterday the deal was conditional on both Civil Aviation Authority approval
and on finance. The administrators added, however, that financing
arrangements would be confirmed shortly.
CHC Helicopter Corporation of Canada will be a minority shareholder but the
majority will be UK controlled.
BIH has faced uncertainty since Arthur Andersen was appointed administrators
last December, a month after Mr Maxwell's death.
Bids from rival helicopter companies Bond and Bristow were referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission although Bristow then withdrew its bid.
Yesterday, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, accepted
statutory undertakings from Bond and BIH not to proceed with the proposed
merger.
The MMC noted that if the merger had taken place only two operators, each
with about half the market, would remain to provide helicopter services to
the UK offshore oil and gas industry.
BIH said yesterday all existing North Sea services would continue as would
the link to the Isles of Scilly.
Mr Stewart Birt, leader of the MBO team yesterday praised staff for '
working so well through a difficult period.'

FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ratners meets bonds redemption deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS, the jewellery retailer, will redeem almost all its 4 per cent
convertible bonds 2002 today.
Redemption was anticipated because holders had the right to demand
redemption since Ratners ordinary shares have fallen well below the
conversion price of 456p. But it was uncertain that the company could meet
the deadline because of its financial position.
Redemption will cost Pounds 58.5m and the company agreed with its bankers
last year it would only redeem the bonds so long as it remained within its
banking agreements and did not need further borrowings.
Mr James McAdam, chairman, said the development was positive. 'It shows we
have been meeting all our credit obligations. Here is a big one and we are
obviously meeting that,' he said.
The shares added  1/4 p to 9 1/4 p.
Ratners is redeeming Pounds 43.96m nominal at 133 per cent, known as the put
premium. Holders of Pounds 40,000 nominal have elected not to redeem.
Earlier this month Next, the fashion retailer, was also forced to redeem its
convertible bond at a cost of Pounds 89.2m.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Rhone-Poulenc sale may raise FFr3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government will sell at least 10.6 per cent of the capital in
Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, in the
latest in a series of partial privatisations.
The sale, expected before the end of the year, will raise an estimated
FFr3bn (Pounds 350m) to FFr4bn, depending on the price of Rhone-Poulenc's
listed certificates of investment (CIs) - a kind of non-voting share. The
cash will be used to create jobs and to fund other public sector companies,
as in the FFr11bn worth of French public sector asset sales this year.
The government will allow holders of CIs and non-voting participating
shares, just over a quarter of the group's issued equity, to convert their
paper into ordinary voting shares at no charge, so Rhone-Poulenc will end up
with a single class of ordinary shares, instead of a complicated mixture of
three kinds of voting and non-voting stock.
The sell-off will reduce the government's direct ownership stake from 56.9
per cent, at which level it holds 77.5 per cent of the voting rights, to
around 45 per cent, said the finance ministry. However, the public sector
will continue to hold majority control because of the 20.8 per cent of the
group owned by Credit Lyonnais and AGF, the state-owned bank and insurance
company. The final breakdown depends on how many holders of warrants
exercise their rights to buy shares.
Like other state-owned companies in the recent round of partial
privatisations, Rhone-Poulenc will raise no cash for its own needs.
The announcement follows a 22 per cent rise in first-half operating income.
However, the company has since warned that third-quarter growth slowed to
between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. Most earnings growth over the past 18
months came from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer of the US.
Yesterday's move could pave the way for a more ambitious privatisation issue
from Rhone-Poulenc, which needs fresh capital to run down debts built up to
finance diversification into pharmaceuticals, said analysts. Net borrowings
are due to fall from FFr33.1bn - 80 per cent of shareholders' funds - at the
end of last year to FFr32bn by the end of 1992. Alternatively it could sell
its stake in Roussel-Uclaf, possibly to Hoechst of Germany, which already
owns a minority holding.

FT  30 OCT 92 / GM loses Dollars 753m in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, whose chairman resigned this week amid boardroom disapproval
of the group's financial performance, yesterday reported a third-quarter net
loss of Dollars 753m (Pounds 461.9m) and warned that the rest of the year
could remain difficult.
However, the company insisted it was 'even more determined' to continue to
shake up its loss-making North American operations, involving lower costs,
improved efficiency and a better product line.
Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman who set the restructuring in motion last
December, resigned on Monday after strong pressure from non-executive
directors who argued that he had not pushed sufficiently for change in the
world's largest manufacturing company.
He will remain in the post until at least Monday, when the GM board is
expected to name Mr John Smale, leader of the non-executive directors, as
chairman and Mr John Smith, president, as the chief executive.
Yesterday's losses, equivalent to Dollars 1.37 a share, were better than the
loss of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 1.88 a share, a year ago. Sales and
revenues totalled Dollars 29.4bn, up from Dollars 28.9bn. The figures met
Wall Street expectations and GM shares closed unchanged at Dollars 31 3/8 .
Analysts said a large fourth-quarter loss was also likely, while speculation
persisted that Monday's board meeting might consider a dividend cut.
The company said GM's international motor operations remained profitable and
saw better earnings than in the third quarter of last year. US results were
affected by continued market weakness and production cuts, due partly to a
rash of strikes.
GM's share of the US vehicle market dipped from 34.5 per cent in the third
quarter last year to 33.3 per cent, but this partly reflected the group's
decision to focus less on highly subsidised sales to fleet car buyers.
The company said the fourth quarter could remain difficult if the US economy
did not show signs of more rapid improvement, but aggressive cost-cutting
activities were being intensified.
The results were bolstered by Dollars 624m of net income from GM's three
non-motor automotive businesses - Electronic Data Systems, GM Hughes
Electronics and General Motors Acceptance, Corporation, its finance arm.
For the nine months the group reported a net loss of Dollars 970.7m, or
Dollars 2.11 a share, on sales and revenues of Dollars 86.7bn, after taking
a Dollars 749m restructuring charge at Hughes. That compared with net losses
of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 3.72 a share, a year ago, on sales of Dollars
78.7bn.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Ronson may lose 95% of Heron stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD RONSON, his family trusts, and the Ronson charitable foundations
would see their 100 per cent stake in Heron International, their private
property and trading company, cut to 5 per cent if a restructuring plan put
to banks and bondholders yesterday is approved. There is also a proposal to
have the group's debt and equity listed on a stock exchange.
Although the plan would save the group from liquidation it marks the end for
the Ronson empire founded in 1965 and also sees the resignation from the
board of Mrs Gail Ronson, Mr Ronson's wife, and the other non-executive
directors.
Heron said the group would appoint three non-executives to the board,
including a chairman, who would be acceptable to the creditors. Mr Ronson
will continue as chief executive.
The proposal is designed to repay the group's debts, which total Pounds
1.4bn, and leave a business with potential for growth. Mr Ronson, backed by
a group of investors, will offer to buy the Heron Suzuki importing business
and the Heron service station chain, for cash from Heron.
Banks and bondholders which lent Pounds 775m to the Head Office group are
being offered Pounds 400m in equity, Pounds 300m in senior debt maturing in
March 1997, and Pounds 75m in junior debt expiring in 2000. However, some of
the principal amount will be repaid as property disposals are made.
Banks which lent to other parts of the group will be repaid in cash from
disposal proceeds over periods up to 1997.
Directors and senior managers face pay cuts and there will be redundancies,
saving about Pounds 6m head office costs a year. The group's management
would receive up to 15 per cent of the equity if or when the debts are
repaid.
The banks are being asked to put in Pounds 20m of capital. The group's net
worth has worsened slightly since June and is stated at a negative Pounds
225m as at March 31, the financial year-end.
The proposals, supported by the steering committee of five banks headed by
Barclays, were put to the 82 banks and lead managers and representatives of
the bondholders yesterday.
Some banks indicated a positive response. However, some bondholders wanted
the choice of putting Heron into liquidation.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Young bull locks horns with mentor: The curious case of two
corporate raiders from the same stable aiming at one target but with a
different price in mind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for control of RHM presents the classic spectacle of an old bull
locking horns with a young one. At 45, Mr Greg Hutchings of Tomkins is a
quarter of a century younger than Lord Hanson, his erstwhile employer.
Tomkins, the company which he set up after leaving Hanson, is still only
one-seventh of Hanson's size. But it is evidently big enough for him to
tackle his old mentor head-on.
Mr Hutchings would not describe it that way. 'This is not a battle with
Hanson,' he said yesterday. 'Absolutely not. He's far too experienced and
shrewd to be anything other than philosophical about it. And RHM is peanuts
to him. It would be under 10 per cent of his business.'
There is an element of tactics here, since it is plainly in Mr Hutchings'
interests not to goad Hanson into a higher offer. But he is to be believed
in another sense. His bid for RHM is not merely a response to Hanson's. It
was conceived in isolation. For some months now, both men have been working
independently on the same target.
This is rather curious. Both Hanson and Tomkins are large, international
conglomerates with a bias towards industrial rather than consumer
operations. In seeking their next victim, both had the world to choose from.
So why did both end up picking the same rather tired British bread maker?
Mr Hutchings shrugs the question off. 'Great minds think alike,' he says.
But he strongly rejects the idea that in getting into the food industry,
Tomkins is turning its back on its traditional operations.
The basic point, he says, is that RHM makes things. 'Products are not
relevant. It doesn't matter to us whether it's a bicycle, a lawn mower'  -
both of which Tomkins makes - 'or a cake. Raw materials go in one end and
products come out at the other. We have a few hard weeks ahead of us to
convince the stock market that this isn't a departure from our usual
business. But we're not buying an advertising agency or an estate agency,
we're buying a manufacturer.'
And above all, from Tomkins' viewpoint, RHM was cheap. Ever since its last
UK acquisition in 1986, Tomkins claims to have been combing the UK for
another target. A year ago, Mr Hutchings remarked there were plenty of UK
companies he would like to buy, but they were too expensive.
As Tomkins' corporate development manager Mr Geoff Eaton puts it, 'stock
market sentiment towards RHM was awful. In other sectors, there are
companies which are doing badly but the price is astronomical. There are
some engineering companies out there which are being managed bloody badly,
but their share prices are sky high.'
The reason that such companies are expensive is, of course, that the stock
market perceives them as cyclical. It reasons that when the economy
recovers, their earnings will pick up sharply.
But food companies were supposed to be different. Even in a recession, the
argument ran, people have to eat. This thesis came to grief earlier this
year when a number of UK food manufacturers, RHM among them, started to
produce poor results and profit warnings. Their share prices plunged.
For Hanson and Tomkins, this provided the opportunity they had been seeking
in vain in other sectors. Let us accept, Tomkins said yesterday, that a
company like RHM is indeed subject to the economic cycle. That means that
buying it five years ago, in the upswing of the cycle, would have been very
risky. But we are now near the bottom of the cycle.
This puts Tomkins and Hanson squarely at odds with the stock market's
judgment. But this is scarcely the first takeover battle to illustrate the
hugely different value put on shares by portfolio investors and industrial
managers. A month ago, the stock market thought RHM shares were worth 158p
apiece. Then Lord Hanson said they were worth 220p. Now Mr Hutchings says
they are worth 260p. Plainly, they cannot all be right.
Part of the difference can be justified by the fact that Hanson and Tomkins
are in a position to change the top management and let middle management get
on with the business. As Mr Eaton said yesterday: 'You're basically
empowering a group of people who have been totally frustrated by the fact
that the top people don't know what they're doing.'
But on this basis, Hanson and Tomkins ought to value RHM more or less
identically. Both, after all, have similar techniques for dealing with
companies they have acquired, for the very good reason that Mr Hutchings was
trained in the Hanson school.
This makes the end-game of this bid fascinating. It is not yet known whether
Hanson will respond to the Tomkins counter-offer. If it chooses to walk
away, it will leave the obvious implication that Tomkins is paying too much.
If battle is joined, that question will be raised about whoever proves the
winner.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Detailed terms of the Tomkins offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE terms of the Tomkins offer for Ranks Hovis MacDougall are either 2.29
Tomkins shares plus Pounds 5.20p in cash for every four RHM shares, or 260p
in cash writes Maggie Urry. The share offer values each RHM share at 251.4p,
with Tomkins shares closing last night at 212p, down 49p.
RHM shareholders will also receive a dividend of 9.54p net from RHM,
enabling Tomkins to buy shares in the market up to 269.54p cum dividend. The
cash offer values the ordinary shares at Pounds 925m, and there is an offer
for the preference shares at par, worth about Pounds 10m in total.
Hanson's cash offer of 220p a share for RHM plus its preference offer values
RHM in total at Pounds 790m. Tomkins is making a rights issue to help
finance the bid. This is of one new share for every two held at a price of
200p, to raise Pounds 653m net. It will be in two instalments, the first of
120p a share raising Pounds 384m net, which will proceed whether or not the
bid succeeds. The second instalment of 80p, raising Pounds 269m, depends on
the offer being accepted.

FT  30 OCT 92 / ICI's profits fall 53% to Pounds 93m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday confirmed the dire state of the world
economy as Britain's biggest manufacturer reported pre-tax profits down 52.5
per cent from Pounds 196m to Pounds 93m during the third quarter.
The group, traditionally seen as Britain's manufacturing bellwether stock,
now generates more than 80 per of its turnover outside the UK. ICI's shares
fell 14p to Pounds 10.36.
Earnings per share fell 70 per cent from 17.9p to 5.3p, due largely to a tax
charge.
ICI's turnover fell 10 per cent from Pounds 3.07bn to Pounds 2.77bn. Adverse
exchange rates accounted for 6 per cent of the decline, and lower volumes,
mainly in the UK and US, for 2 per cent. The remaining 2 per cent consisted
of price deflation.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said the company had been hit by worldwide
persistent recession. He blamed the disappointing results on particularly
poor demand. He warned there was little expectation of improvement in
trading conditions in the near term.
The recent devaluation of sterling would help overseas markets. Sir Denys
said his priorities remained to contain costs and maintain a strong balance
sheet.
Mr Colin Short, finance director, said the separation of ICI into two
businesses should be completed by the year's end. The group plans to demerge
its pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and the bulk of its specialities
operations into ICI Bioscience, leaving the rest, including industrial
chemicals, paints, materials and explosives, in a new ICI.
A decision whether to go ahead would be taken at the board's February
meeting, Mr Short said. He warned that more deals were likely to be
announced before February and that the group was still in a period of
considerable change.
Sir Denys said the markets for materials and industrial chemicals remained
weak. Prices were under considerable pressure, particularly in Europe.
The earnings per share were hit by a tax charge of 48 per cent during the
third quarter. This was because of earnings generated by overseas and
associated companies. Mr Short said this was a one-off and the rate would
fall to 34 per cent for the whole year.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Bush and Clinton trade insults as president narrows poll gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL PRETENSIONS to politeness in the US presidential campaign are now in
tatters. Governor Bill Clinton and President George Bush are directly
trading charges that each is unworthy of the public trust, while Mr Ross
Perot continues to belittle both as incapable of leading the country.
The heat is being generated against the background of fresh public opinion
polls which agree that Mr Bush is narrowing the gap but differ wildly on by
how much. Surveys out in the past 24 hours put Mr Clinton ahead by as much
as 10 points (the Washington Post) and as little as 3 points in the latest
CNN/USA Today poll released last night. Most also found Mr Perot was no
longer on the rise.
The big change has been in Mr Clinton's approach towards Mr Bush. Yesterday
in Toledo, Ohio, he angrily charged that 'the American people must see him
for what he is - a desperate person who just wants to hold on to power and
doesn't give a rip about them'.
Though Mr Clinton continues to pound away with his economic message, it is
now thoroughly mixed with assaults on Mr Bush's character. This amounts to a
tactical shift brought about by relentless personal attacks by the
president.
Yesterday, in Michigan, Mr Bush himself shifted tack, perhaps concluding
that he had drawn enough blood for the moment with his disparagement of the
characters of Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore. Instead, he returned again to
his great encouragement of the week, the improvement in economic output in
the third quarter. Mr Clinton, he charged, had no understanding of the
global economy, did not appreciate that the US was outperforming its rivals
and would put recovery at risk.
In a rare appearance on the campaign trail in Denver on Wednesday night, Mr
Perot attacked the other candidates indiscriminately. He ridiculed Mr
Clinton because the principal business of the governor's state of Arkansas
was raising chickens - 'and these are not jobs which will pass on the
American dream to our children'.
Mr Bush's attitude, he said, was that, 'if you don't do anything, things
will work out'. He urged a crowd of enthusiasts to 'vote your conscience and
confound the pollsters and media'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Bottomley was warned on ambulance software: MP's letter to
health secretary last year expressed concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, was warned that the software house
which installed the London Ambulance Service's troubled computerised
dispatch system was small and virtually unknown.
The warning about Systems Options of Aldershot in Hampshire, came last year
in a letter to Mrs Bottomley from Mr Robert Jones, Conservative MP for West
Hertfordshire. The London Ambulance Service, replying on Mrs Bottomley's
behalf, said all computer companies involved had the necessary experience.
Months of problems with the dispatch system prompted claims that patients
may have died because of response delays and led to the resignation on
Wednesday of Mr John Wilby, chief executive of the LAS.
The system, which is crucial to the ability of LAS to handle, on average,
2,300 emergency calls a day, has now been all but abandoned and the service
has returned to manual call-logging while a review is carried out.
Systems Options won the commission in July 1991 as prime contractor in a
consortium which includes Apricot, the British-based computer manufacturer
owned by Mitsubishi of Japan and Securicor Datatrak.
Apricot provided personal computers and networking equipment while Datatrak
provided radio transmitters to give an ambulance's precise location. There
has been no suggestion that equipment supplied by Apricot or Datatrak has
been at fault.
Systems Options' bid of Pounds 1.2m was about half that of its chief
competitors, consortia led by McDonnell Douglas Information Systems and
Systems Scheduling.
The company figures in none of the principal software directories and is not
a member of Computing Services Association, the software industry trade
body.
Replying on Mrs Bottomley's behalf to Mr Jones, Mr J. R. Harris, LAS
chairman, said the intention was to provide one of the most sophisticated
emergency control systems of any UK service. All three companies involved,
he wrote, 'have demonstrated expertise in providing and developing bespoke
(custom) real-time systems capable of handling large volumes of data . . .
the evaluation process involved not only an assessment of the ability of
companies to provide the specified systems in time, but also their financial
status supported by customer references'.
Systems Options yesterday refused to comment.
There was surprise when the company won the contract because it has no track
record in ambulance command and control systems.
It was founded in 1984 and made pre-tax profits of just Pounds 2,006 on
sales of Pounds 550,981 in the year to September 30 1991.
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems in conjunction with the
Manchester-based software house MIS has more than one third of the UK market
for ambulance dispatch systems.
The Department of Health last night said the contract for the computer
system had been put out to EC-wide tender, and had been awarded in the
normal way. The inquiry into the system will determine how failures arose.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Delors rules out Danes' treaty plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday inflamed the
controversy over Denmark's demands for exemptions from the Maastricht
treaty, bluntly warning that binding legal agreements sought by the Danes
were unacceptable.
In the Belgian parliament, Mr Delors said the Danes could expect no more
than 'interpretative declarations' to the treaty - an offer which falls
short of Denmark's request for a UK-style opt-out on a single European
currency and exemption from a putative European defence force.
Mr Delors' remarks will upset the Danish and the British governments who
face a delicate political balancing act in selling Maastricht to a sceptical
public. However, his tough stand appears to be supported at this stage by
other EC member states which have reservations about special treatment for
the Danes.
A Foreign Office memorandum, issued by mistake to journalists in London on
Wednesday, said that the Danish proposals, in their original form, were
unlikely to prove acceptable to some EC countries.
The Foreign Office attempted to play down the memorandum's significance,
saying it amounted to no more than 'some first thoughts' written last Friday
by Mr Michael Jay, assistant under-secretary for EC affairs.
The memo's conclusions contrasted with comments from Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, who described the Danish paper as 'strongly positive'.
In his remarks, Mr Delors appeared to pre-empt what Brussels diplomats
predict will be a protracted wrangle between Denmark and its EC partners on
the terms of modifying the Maastricht treaty. He stated flatly: 'You can
only solve the Danish problem by adding interpretative declarations (to the
treaty), you cannot add a protocol because it has the value of a treaty.'
In a veiled warning to Denmark and to Britain's Maastricht waverers, he
said: 'You cannot force a country to ratify the treaty - and none can have
such a large right of veto that it prevents others from progressing.'
Last night, Mr Delors' chief spokesman played down the significance of his
remarks, saying they were in line with earlier statements by the 11 ruling
out renegotiation of the treaty.
Italy yesterday ratified the Maastricht treaty on European union with an
overwhelming vote in favour of support by its lower chamber of parliament.
Meanwhile, the Spanish lower house of parliament approved the treaty almost
unanimously in a first step towards expected ratification on November 25.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In his Mansion House speech the chancellor asserts that he will need to
exercise more judgment now that sterling has left the ERM. While that is
patently true, it will not encourage the markets much. They took a pretty
dim view of the government's judgment while sterling was buttressed by the
D-Mark, and are disinclined to trust the unsupervised views of those who
cried 'no devaluation' just before Black Wednesday. Nor will the proposed
panel of expert forecasters prove a sufficiently robust policeman. As long
as the exact recipe of Mr Lamont's nebulous inflation-predicting potion
remains secret, investors are likely to regard it as snake oil.
Given that credibility is badly damaged, the chancellor might hope to
rebuild his authority with an accurate assessment of the current situation
and a coherent policy framework for the future. Yet there are still worrying
signs that Mr Lamont has not fully absorbed how much debt deflation is
depressing the economy. True, base rates have been cut, but the US
experience suggests they have to fall much further to ease debt-servicing
pressures.
The gilt market may take a little comfort from the chancellor's nods in the
direction of balance between fiscal and monetary policy, and the need to
guard sterling. But with the funding rule unchanged, the government will
still have to sell more gilts next year than the total UK institutional cash
inflow. In the circumstances it is hard to see long gilt yields remaining so
close to those of French bonds.

FT  30 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's proposal to enfranchise non-voting Rhone-Poulenc
shareholders is unsatisfactory as it stands. Holders of non-voting stock are
being offered a straight one-for-one swap for voting shares, but the public
sector is left holding the majority of votes. In return for this minority
position, holders of non-voting stock will give up strong preferential
dividend rights. The deal only makes sense if the rationalisation of
Rhone-Poulenc's capital structure paves the way for full privatisation.
Equally, the planned sale of 6m government-owned voting shares looks like an
opportunistic move while Rhone-Poulenc is near its peak relative to the
French market. Partial privatisations which absorb cash but leave the public
sector in control are the worst of all possible worlds for equities
generally.
There is always a chance, though, that the government will surrender its
majority by allowing Rhone-Poulenc to make a rights issue. With gearing
running above 80 per cent, the company could certainly use an injection of
new equity. With a strengthened balance sheet, a simplified capital
structure and free of the threat of state interference, the company could
enjoy a rating more appropriate to the healthcare sector. But while the
government holds the whip-hand the market is right to remain sceptical.

ICI's demerger plan could still be scuppered by the cycle. The proposed rump
chemicals business made a trading profit of just Pounds 1m in the third
quarter, including losses from associated companies. The shape of the
business may change slightly, but the chemicals side will hardly be in a
position to foot its share of ICI's Pounds 400m dividend bill next year. By
maintaining that chemicals and bioscience will be run as separate units from
the New Year, ICI is keeping its options open. It might be better advised to
shelve the plan until the economic prospects are clearer.
ICI Bio is in better shape, although sales of Tenormin, the heart drug, have
gone into a nose-dive since its US patent expired last year. With other
drugs turning in respectable volume growth - and the benefit of a stronger
dollar - bioscience could yet show respectable growth next year, even
allowing for some drag from agrochemicals.
Judging by yesterday's dire results from DSM, ICI is possibly faring better
than the competition in bulk chemicals. Even so, the prospects are so bleak
that the immediate question must be whether ICI can afford to pay a
maintained dividend this year. On the basis of yesterday's figures, it is
touch and go whether such a payout would be fully covered by earnings. A
lower dividend would ease the burden on the chemicals business if the
demerger goes ahead. But it would hardly encourage shareholders to subscribe
to an ICI Bio rights issue.

FT  30 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: More bread from Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any UK share price these days would shudder at the prospect of a Pounds 670m
one-for-two rights issue and plans to garnish a food-free guns to bicycles
conglomerate with bread and Bisto. The near 20 per cent fall in Tomkins'
market capitalisation yesterday, however, reflects a deeper concern - that
by entering the bidding for Ranks Hovis McDougall Mr Greg Hutchings is
biting off more than he can chew.
Admittedly the sceptics have been wrong-footed before. Tomkins appears to
have done its homework and has proved itself capable of digesting similar
mouthfuls relative to its size. Nor is it as sinister as many suppose that
other food companies are conspicuous by their absence from the bidding. Most
of the obvious candidates for RHM are either discredited, pursuing
strategies which specifically exclude milling and baking, or merely
interested in picking over the company's corpse. That said, Tomkins is being
forced to pay a full price, at least 15p to 20p more than Lord Hanson would
probably have put on the table if his former protege had not intervened. In
the absence of any information on cost savings or tax benefits, Tomkins'
shareholders have to take on trust the assurance that there will be no
earnings dilution. They also have to hope that Tomkins' undoubted skill in
dealing with US retailers translates to UK supermarkets, and that it can
find the necessary marketing flair to make the British eat more bread. It
all sounded suspiciously easy yesterday.
Hanson, of course, is torn between letting a second successive deal slip
through his fingers and the risk of overpaying. While they sit tight for the
next move RHM shareholders at last have a reason to be grateful to their
board. The seemingly kamikaze-style defence - which at least underpinned its
shares - does not seem so daft now after all.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Trouble at the regulators' ball
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS like a very technical issue on which to go to war. Yet there has
been no hiding the passion generated at this week's meeting in London of the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco). Mr Richard
Breeden, the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, says
that a proposed international standard for the capital to be held by
securities firms and banks is imprudent in the extreme, and could lead to
financial disaster in the event of a sharp stock market setback.
The European reaction to this idea has been apoplectic, not least because
the standard has already been enshrined in the EC's capital adequacy
directive. Is Mr Breeden right to be so gloomy? Probably not. The directive
imposes tougher standards across the Community than were in place on Black
Monday, 1987 - a drama which did not lead to spectacular failures among
European securities firms.
Does it matter that securities regulators have so far been unable to agree
on so basic an issue as capital adequacy? Again, the answer is probably not.
There are benefits to be derived from a harmonised approach to such
regulation, but there are dangers as well.
Basle model
Although some Iosco members think otherwise, the Basle model for bank
regulation, which lays down centrally agreed standards for capital, may not
be appropriate for the securities industry. Securities firms and banks have
different regulatory requirements. If a bank gets into difficulties, it is
likely to face claims that are hard to meet because its main assets, loans,
are not easy to sell. A securities firm, by contrast, holds its assets in
marketable securities, so there is less risk of a collapsing securities firm
causing a liquidity crisis in a financial system. On the other hand, because
securities firms trade in vast volumes of securities, there is a risk of
systemic problems from any large-scale failure to deliver stock to
purchasers or payments to vendors. Thus international agreements on payment
and settlement systems may be more important to reducing systemic risk in
the securities industry than are capital agreements.
The main benefits of an international agreement on the supervision of
securities firms and banks would be threefold. It would prevent financial
centres seeking to gain advantage by lowering regulatory standards; it would
reduce duplication of effort; and it might help to limit the risk of
contagion, where trouble in one part of a financial firm or market leads to
disaster in another.
Against that, monopolies in regulation have the same drawbacks as they do in
other spheres of life. They reduce competition and innovation and encourage
complacency. It is healthy that the Europeans have had their assumptions
about capital adequacy tested so roughly this week.
Inherent trade-off
The main public policy issue is the trade-off which exists between the need
for orderly and properly regulated markets on the one hand and for
competition and choice on the other. If regulators seek to establish
standards which apply across a broad front, how do they set them at the
level which underwrites the one without damaging the other? And if they push
things too far, they will be held accountable for market failures over which
in reality they may have had little control. That in turn will lead to
demands for ever more stringent regulations in order to protect the
regulators' jobs and the taxpayer's pocket.
So unless there is a clear danger that the absence of such standards
presents a threat to the system, a more pragmatic approach seems sensible.
As it happens this is just what Iosco has achieved in its principles for the
supervision of financial conglomerates, also published this week. These set
out what is described as a spectrum of possible approaches to group-based
risk assessment, and leave it up to individual regulators to decide which
position to adopt.
Over time, regulations covering the workings of the securities industry are
likely to converge across national borders. But for the moment, Iosco serves
a useful purpose in debating the main issues and in improving contact and
co-ordination between regulators across the world. It does not have to be a
standard-setting body.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Leading Article: One cheer for the chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE collapse of its economic policy on September 16, it was necessary
for the government to start afresh. It had to do so in the worst possible
circumstances: a discredited chancellor, a slump at home and dismal economic
conditions abroad. Everything that has happened since then has made the task
more difficult and more important.
With his new monetary targets and indicators, first set out in early
October, yesterday's 'Mansion House' speech and the Autumn Statement, which
is to be delivered on November 12, the chancellor is setting out the
government's new stall. The question is whether he will manage to deliver
either a plausible economic policy or a credible policy framework. What he
has given so far suggests that he will succeed only up to a point, the
problem being more with what he has not said than with what he has.
The chancellor's position on fiscal policy is persuasive. It would be a
mistake to embrace too naively the prejudice that so-called current spending
is bad and so-called capital spending good. But Mr Lamont is right to
propose a separation between capital and current spending for the first
unified budget, due in December 1993. He is also right to insist on the
maintenance of economically valuable capital spending in a recession, both
for the short-term boost it can give to employment and for the long-term
support for economic growth.
Sustainable growth
The monetary policy framework is more worrying. The key sentences are those
in which the government's old emphasis on reducing inflation and its new one
on growth are reconciled: 'the goal of the government's macro-economic
policy has never been simply to defeat inflation. Low inflation is not just
an end in itself; it is also the means to sustainable growth and secure
employment . . . But just as prosperity can be jeopardised by too lax a
monetary policy and too high a rate of inflation, so too, we have always
recognised that policy can become too tight.'
Loosening can be justified. The danger is that, probably too slowly and too
late, loosening will go too far and last for too long. The host of monetary
indicators the chancellor has chosen allows a discredited government machine
too much discretion. Confirmation that the exchange rate still matters is,
given past experience, not enough of a comfort. That the inflation target is
prospective inflation, though rational in itself, also has its worrying
side, in view of the uncertainty surrounding all forecasts and the
unavoidable lags between policy and outcomes.
Stop-go cycle
The main bulwark against yet another deeply damaging stop-go cycle must be
institutional reform. The chancellor proposes a new forecasting panel. The
idea is good enough, though how much forecasting has to offer is unclear.
The question now is who will be on the panel. Will it include mavericks such
Liverpool's Patrick Minford and Cambridge's Wynne Godley and perhaps some
foreign forecasters as well, or just the great, the good and the habitually
wrong?
The chancellor has a few other sensible notions: a new monthly monetary
report, fuller justification of interest rate changes and, potentially more
interesting, a regular report from the governor of the Bank of England on
how far the government has progressed towards its inflationary objectives.
Where has Mr Lamont failed?
On policy, he has not made the fundamental point that if a devaluation is to
work, prices of tradable goods and services must rise in relation to wages.
Temporarily higher overall inflation than otherwise is how the reduction in
the real cost of labour will in practice occur. But the combination of the
needed reduction in the relative price of labour with the aim of low overall
inflation demands far lower increases in earnings than those a supposedly
desperate corporate sector continues to grant to its employees.
No less important is the chancellor's continued failure to understand how
deeply damaged is the credibility of both the government and of the whole
government machine. What is needed is comprehensive reconsideration of the
roles of the Treasury and the Bank of England. Mr Lamont wishes to persuade
the world that the citadel on Great George Street still knows best. It does
not, as the whole world now knows all too well.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Personal View: How to avoid a slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRYAN GOULD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's humiliating departure from the exchange rate mechanism seems to
have left the government bereft of an economic strategy. The prime minister
talks of expansionary policies, but the assertion that the country can now
benefit from the forced change smacks more of making the best of a bad job
than conviction. Notwithstanding yesterday's long-awaited Mansion House
speech, the uncertainty remains.
Labour, too, has yet to find its voice - partly, perhaps, because of
lingering embarrassment about its own past support for the failed policies
and partly because its continuing need to seem more papist than the Pope
induces an unnecessary degree of caution.
The danger is, therefore, that a government short of ideas itself will
listen to the only political voices raised on the question of what to do
next. The Thatcherite right is in no doubt that massive cuts in public
expenditure are now needed, despite the obvious risk that this will simply
intensify the recession by encouraging it to feed on itself.
Yet there is surely no absence of a coherent strategy with which to
extricate Britain from its present predicament. Parallels are never exact,
but there is a striking similarity between the present plight - as we pay
the price of two years of the ERM - and the recession which accompanied and
followed our adherence to the gold standard.
The Keynesian remedies then adopted offer a guide to what should now be
done. The first step must be to understand and acknowledge the truth about
the exchange rate and its impact on Britain's competitiveness.
The government must now renounce the self-delusion which led it to believe
that, with a massive trade deficit in the middle of a deepening recession,
the UK was competitive with the Germans at DM2.95 to the pound.
It should assert that the depreciation is not just a happy accident, but is
an essential precondition of recovery and that henceforth industry can have
the assurance, on which it can safely base its investment plans, that a
competitive rate will be maintained.
This will enable the government to bring down interest rates much further
than it has so far contemplated. Interest rates at 8 per cent are still very
high in real terms, and they seem even higher to those who are feeling
poorer as a consequence of the savage asset deflation of the past two or
three years.
Low interest rates and a competitive pound will raise demand for British
goods at home and abroad and will stimulate output. That will be reinforced
by the third element in the necessary package of measures  - a substantial,
counter-cyclical increase in public investment, to build the houses that are
needed, provide and restore the infrastructure that has been neglected, and
stimulate a productive sector that has been starved of activity.
But how, it will be asked, is such an increase to be financed? Surely the
public sector borrowing requirement is already spiralling out of control? Is
it not necessary to do precisely the opposite of what I propose - to cut
spending or raise taxes or both?
And if my advice were followed, would not increased public spending
inevitably lead to increased borrowing, thus forcing up interest rates and
negating the benefits of escaping the exchange rate imperative of keeping
interest rates high?
The answer to this dilemma is that, in the short term, the government should
not attempt to fund the extra spending. After all, in the Thatcher years
there was a fivefold increase in the banks' creation of private sector
credit, a credit explosion which flowed directly into asset inflation,
consumption and imports. Surely a government prepared to preside over that
irresponsibility could now essay a modest credit expansion of its own,
especially when it would be put to so much more constructive purposes.
A deliberate policy of underfunding in the short term would provide a
stimulus to industry and keep interest rates down. The current circumstances
of high unemployment and low business confidence are exactly those in which
a cheap money policy is not only appropriate but could be expected to work.
As soon as it did work, and circumstances changed, a change in that policy
would also be required.
There will be those who cry that monetising the debt in this way would be to
take unacceptable risks with inflation. But why should we shy at ghosts?
Only ideologues could argue that the UK's most pressing problem is
inflation, when it is teetering on the brink of a disastrous slump. When
that danger has been averted, there will be time enough to give priority to
inflation.
And as this package of measures does its work, it will also bring with it a
solution to the PSBR problem. The evidence from the 1980s boom is that the
revenue is remarkably buoyant when economic activity is at a high level. The
most effective solution to the problem of the deficit - and to the problems
created by the government's failures and now faced by the whole country - is
to end the recession.

FT  30 OCT 92 / More secure on Wall Street: Five years after the crash, the
US securities industry is less vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A short, crisp memo, containing good news and a warning, will be delivered
over the next few weeks to every staff member of Goldman Sachs, one of the
largest and most successful New York investment banks.
The good news will be the size of employees' annual bonuses, which should be
particularly generous since Wall Street is nearing the end of its most
profitable year ever.
But Goldman's management is also expected to caution staff against making
extravagant changes in lifestyle, pointing out that fat years on Wall Street
eventually give way to lean.
The warning is especially timely, just after the fifth anniversary of the
stock market crash of October 1987. For while the US securities industry is
flying high now it faces three unsettling questions:
First, how long can the current strength of profits last? Second, to what
extent has the industry protected itself against cyclical downturns through
a series of management initiatives taken since 1987?
And third, which securities firms will be squeezed hardest over the next
decade by intensifying competition, coming from three directions: the
increasingly global character of the securities industry; the growing
importance of technology; and the encroachment on the domestic securities
industry by US banks, notably blue-chip J P Morgan?
Certainly, the best US securities firms seem better placed to withstand any
impending difficulties than they were in the bullish 1980s, which ended in a
succession of traumatic shocks that changed the face of Wall Street. The
1987 crash scared individual investors away and forced the retail brokerage
firms serving this market to cut operations. Then the collapse of the junk
bond market in 1990 brought an end to the takeover boom, destroyed the
upstart investment bank of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and left several other
large firms - notably First Boston and Shearson Lehman - in financial
crisis.
These events, combined with the complexity of a business growing
increasingly global and reliant on computer technology, have forced Wall
Street firms to adopt a more professional approach to management.
'Managements didn't get religious about planning until after the '87 crash
and they then became obsessed with it during and after 1990,' says Mr
Michael Flanagan of consultancy Lipper Analytical. The elements include:
More formal management structures, imposing better checks and balances on
policy decisions, often coupled with devolution of responsibility down the
line to executives. Probably the last big firm to undergo such a change was
Salomon Bros, where the new executive team installed after last year's
Treasury bond trading scandal has updated the company's outdated management
system. Better management reporting and cost controls. Mr Herbert Allison,
executive vice-president for finance at Merrill Lynch, the securities house,
notes that in 1985 the firm 'could produce only one bottom line for 90 per
cent of our business. We had no way to determine where we were earning or
losing money. Now we have 3,000 bottom lines and can quickly spot variance
from budget and take action.'
Staff constitutes the largest element of Wall Street's costs - about 75 per
cent in many cases - and the industry's headcount has dropped sharply over
the past five years, from a peak of slightly more than 262,000 to just below
224,000. Salaries remain high by the standards of other industries, but are
now more closely related to an individual's performance. Many of the job
cuts have been in support staff, increasing the ratio of revenue producers
to non-producers.
All this has been accompanied by a rise in the status of managers handling
budgets, expenses and computer technology - traditionally referred to rather
contemptuously as back-office staff. Goldman Sachs, for example, recently
moved three partners from its investment banking operations to add clout to
the firm's financial administration.
Mr Stephen Friedman, co-chairman, explains: 'We said to ourselves: 'We are a
complex multinational business like many of our clients. Should we not give
ourselves the kind of resources we would employ for them?''
Better management of balance sheets and an improvement in asset quality.
Wall Street learned a harsh lesson about liquidity when crises at Drexel,
First Boston and Shearson left the firms short of new capital, and in some
cases dissuaded their regular lenders from rolling over short-term
borrowings.
This would not have been a problem if assets could have been sold quickly.
But the three had trouble either raising new capital or liquidating their
inventories, packed with high-yielding but difficult-to-sell securities such
as junk bonds. In the end, First Boston had to be rescued by its largest
shareholder, Credit Suisse, and Shearson by its parent, American Express.
Drexel, lacking a deep-pocketed associate, went into bankruptcy.
Fearful of similar problems, other securities houses fortified their balance
sheets with more equity capital, and with higher-quality, easily disposable
assets - such as government bonds, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed
securities.
The importance of better liquidity was underlined last year when Salomon
Bros became embroiled in financial scandal. Over a period of just three
weeks it raised about Dollars 50bn to pay lenders who had refused to extend
short-term loans.
The rush to improve asset quality, however, has a downside. The returns from
trading higher quality assets such as government bonds are smaller than
those from higher yielding securities. Because of this securities companies
have 'leveraged up' - increased borrowings against their equity - in an
effort to maintain their return on assets.
That said, firms are also devoting greater resources, including computer
programs, to analysis and control of the financial dangers, whether of poor
credit risks or the trading of complex derivative products such as swaps and
options.
Yet, however elaborate these precautions, human fallibility will always
leave traders open to large losses, and US regulators fear that the risks
inherent in complex derivative products are not fully appreciated. 'If we
get a sudden market drop there are going to be some big institutions which
don't understand their exposure,' warns one prominent Wall Street executive.
In addition to management changes the US securities industry has also
adopted new strategies, for example, the diversification of business. The
securities industry has always been cyclical, with revenues tied closely to
factors it cannot control such as stock prices, interest rates and investor
demand. In response, Wall Street has been seeking to move away from volatile
trading-related businesses and into fields where revenues are relatively
stable, and preferably fee-based.
A good example is asset management, where Merrill Lynch has been
particularly successful. By the end of last year it was managing Dollars
345bn of client funds, making it the largest custodian of individual assets
in the US. One of the firm's goals is to cover fully its fixed costs with
'stable revenues' (such as asset management) by the year 2000, 'so that
we'll be assured of profitability in almost any environment', according to
Mr Allison.
Even at the most diversified firms, however, asset management still
accounted for not much more than 10 per cent of non-interest revenues last
year, and securities houses remain highly dependent on traditional sources
of income - investment banking (advising firms on takeovers and underwriting
issues of securities); using the firm's own money to trade securities and
foreign exchange; and taking commission from clients for buying and selling
securities on their behalf.
The various management and strategy changes have strengthened the industry.
This is perhaps just as well, for after two years in which a buoyant stock
market, falling interest rates and low inflation have ensured strong
profits, the outlook may be turning harsher.
Stock market activity has slowed, demand for equity and bond underwriting
services appears to have peaked and interest rates may start climbing again
next year.
This comes, moreover, as the industry is facing increasing competition from
many directions. The Glass-Steagal Act, which has divided commercial banking
and the securities industry since the early 1930s, is still in place, but is
becoming fuzzier and may be swept away before the decade is out.
In the retail field, the large, established brokers are facing pressure from
cut-rate houses such as Charles Schwab, from mutual fund managers and from
commercial banks. For example, Nationsbank, one of the country's largest
regional banks, this week announced a joint venture with brokerage Dean
Witter to offer securities at its branches.
In the wholesale field - providing services to large institutions and
corporations - the main challenge comes from a handful of well-capitalised
banks which has been given permission by the Federal Reserve to underwrite
issues of securities.
None is more threatening than J P Morgan. Its new securities arm has already
leapt from nowhere to number seven in the list of corporate bond
underwriters over the past few years.
What remains unclear is whether the inroads of J P Morgan and other banks
will inflict most damage on the top half dozen Wall Street houses  - the
integrated firms with a wide range of services and big international
operations - or the middle-rankers just beneath them.
Certainly, the middle-rankers are likely to suffer from lack of financial
and human resources in an industry which is becoming increasingly globalised
and more and more reliant on expensive computer capital equipment.
By contrast, the handful of top US investment banks that has already
established strong global operations - notably Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley, Merrill Lynch and First Boston - are significantly more powerful
international players than their would-be European and Japanese competitors.
In some cases their international operations are growing much faster than
their American business. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley,
predicts that one of the firm's top five officials will need to be located
outside the US before too long. He also argues that, since securities
markets are by nature volatile, there is limited value in trying to predict
which products are going to sell best.
'The important thing is to be able to respond to market changes and move
people quickly. That is one of the keys to managing a global investment
bank.'

Those who usually argue that a monarch is less troublesome than any other
head of state, and of course handy for the tourist trade, may find
themselves wondering tonight. 40 Glorious Years is a 90-minute extravaganza
(7.30 BBC1) which appears to feature everybody except Madonna. We are
promised that the first 40 years of the Queen's reign will be marked by 'the
biggest indoor production ever staged in Britain' opening with Sir Ian
McKellen, a choir of 500, two orchestras, the gold state coach, the Yeomen
of the Guard and the guns of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. The
cast of 4,000 also includes Cilla Black, Lonnie Donegan, Dame Vera Lynn,
Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele and the Tiller Girls.
At 8.30 BBC2's series on Royal Gardens opens your eyes to just what a
disproportionate quantity of land, property, and treasure has come the way
of the British monarchy over the centuries. Best of the movies is Night Of
The Hunter (11.50 BBC2). Charles Laughton's only work as a director, it is
an odd thriller, with two young children at its centre, and Robert Mitchum
playing a terrifying preacher.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: A Little Older - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summer fare from the Edinburgh Festival, like August grouse, often becomes
autumn fodder in London. Now A Little Older, proudly bearing 'The
Independent Fringe Award', has arrived at the Hampstead Theatre. It is a
good play - curt, serious and funny - but never an award-winner; perhaps no
other candidates of sufficient merit presented themselves. Still, it makes
an absorbing evening, intelligently acted.
John Binnie's text typifies the British way of drama: the journey backward
to find the way forward. This resembles nothing so much as Freudian
psychoanalysis, a search for scenes in childhood to cure the adult. Denis
Potter perfected the form in The Singing Detective (1989) and the same
burden of the past weighed on Rodney Ackland's play The Dark River (1943).
A Little Older, serious and considered, centres on Isla, an amnesiac and
aphasic car-crash victim. Her friend Sandy visits her in hospital. When she
fails to recover her speech, action and memory, he prompts her with shared
school experiences from 1960s Glasgow. She responds.
Their past emerges: she is a wild roly-poly vicar's daughter, eager for
experience, and he is a quiet boy discovering he is gay. Eventually, his
affection and perseverance return her to normal life.
The play has moments of cliche ('What are her chances, doctor?') and patches
of dark humour ('You've had an accident' - 'Really?'). Its poignancy lies in
showing the inability of the once able-bodied, the tiredness of the infirm.
But when action in the play means Isla's memory is working, the plot relies
too much on the telling and not enough on the showing. The best scene shows
Isla's memory working better than Sandy's. She remembers snow falling one
Christmas Eve. That incident completes the therapy.
Stephen Docherty and Mari Binnie as Sandy and Isla maintain close rapport
throughout. They have unerring confidence in each other, as befits an
invalid and friend. They make scenes turn on a gesture, a shrug. Both
extract judicious humour from a serious situation.
Robert Rabey's bare set needs Tariq Hussain's inventive lighting to shift
focus between past and present, while John Binnie'directs with verve. Like a
good therapist, he finds a reason for every detail in the text.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: The bell tolls for this 'Don Juan' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with something as monumentally awful as La Legende de Don Juan, with
which the Groupe Emile Dubois infested the Royalty Theatre on Wednesday
night, what can one do? Flee into the night, certainly - which is what I did
after 85 minutes of tenth-rate rock, frenetically silly movement, and even
more desperate inadequacy of dance ideas. Wonder if one could manufacture a
hand-grenade from the programme sheet provided by Dance Umbrella, under
whose aegis this catastrophe was shown, and blow the cast to smithereens.
And wonder, and wonder again, whose misbegotten idea it was to bring this
frightful troupe back to London.
The Groupe Emile Dubois - and here is where the mind reels - is based at the
Centre Choregraphique in Grenoble, and master-minded by Jean-Claude
Gallotta. I presume that lots of French government money is spent in
supporting this enterprise, and I can only suppose that it is a
not-so-secret weapon to be used in some unimaginably terrible war of the
future. The French 'new dance' is, for the most part, a dreadful thing, as
pretentiousness balances with several other intellectual devils on the head
of a pin of uncertain dance technique.
Gallotta's contribution - he was unforgettably, alas, at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall a couple of years ago - looks to me like dance-therapy for optimistic
amateurs. His dancers vary from the competent to the curious (he has brought
two chaps whom I privately identify as The Unfrocked Dentist and The Mad
Vet) and this Don Juan does nothing for any of them, except set them rushing
about as if auditioning for a TV variety show.
The witless theme is that the Don becomes a rock star, vocalist and
saxophonist, and across the 1950s,'60s,'70s he is seen performing (and
frightfully, at that) while interludes show four girls succumbing to his
charms. I left before, as I sincerely trust, he was carried off to Hell, but
I can report that the noise was brutal, that the dance was vapidly
energetic, that his loves were rather solid maidens wearing gold lame
dresses and disporting themselves as if suffering from a mild attack of the
Denishawns. (They skipped and romped like the earliest American free dancers
to weedy piano tinklings).
Pascal Gravat was the Don. Character was suggested by a knee-sagging,
pigeon-toed stance, and occasional inaudible bursts of chat. Sexuality was
represented by some desultory paddling in the girls' skirts. I have rarely
seen a performer less communicative, less interesting. The rest of the cast
had the harried air of people fleeing a burning hotel.
I record with disbelief that the piece was commissioned by Expo '92 Seville
and by the French Ministry of Culture's dance delegation, exported by the
Association Francaise d'Action Artistique, and sponsored here by the
European Arts Festival. Send not to know for whom the bell tolls: it tolls
for them all.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: Inspirational images - Patricia Morison visits St
Jerome the penitent in the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Jerome's distinguishing marks in art are a cardinal's hat and a charming
lion. However, as a new exhibition at London's National Gallery shows,
merely being able to identify this white-bearded old saint does not take one
very far. St Jerome features more often in later medieval and Renaissance
art than any other personality of the Early Church. His popularity survived
the Reformation. Ribera, the 17th-century saint-specialist, painted no less
than 45 St Jeromes. What was it about St Jerome that for four centuries
secured his honoured place in Catholic art and piety?
Theme and Variations: Saint Jerome is the first of a new series of National
Gallery exhibitions which will 'examine themes' in paintings within the
collection - iconography, in other words. This is an extremely good idea and
one becoming fashionable as museum curators try to bridge the gap between an
atheistical, plain uneducated public and the standard repertoire of
Christian imagery and symbolism.
Not that an understanding of the repertoire is by any means the only key to
the appreciation of religious art. Think of the blatantly erotic appeal of
countless Venetian and Spanish images of female saints; knowing their
legends or even their names hardly matters, although it may add piquancy.
And yet, it would be perverse to deny that greater familiarity with
iconography leads to a keener enjoyment of the Old Masters and, almost as
importantly, of pedestrian or straightforwardly inept artists. At a glance
we recognise St Jerome (thanks to the lion, without which we could be
looking at St Augustine) as the great Doctor and Father of the western
Church, working on his Latin translation of the Bible. But only certain
artists could create an inspirational image - the man of intellect who,
oblivious to worldly distractions, is totally wrapped up in the Word of God.
Antonello da Messina was one such artist. In his perfect brown study of a
painting we see St Jerome's study framed within a monumental stone arch. The
scholar is seated in profile, a pose which conveys a certain hard-edged
disciplined quality of mind, one strengthened by the orderly arrangement of
books and implements on the shelves behind.
Putting this very famous painting with another 'St Jerome in his Study' by
the Venetian artist, Vincenzo Catena, helps us appreciate this far less
familiar painting as another wholly successful variation on the theme. Here,
too, are beautifully realised details - the slippers neatly placed by the
raised platform, (did Renaissance scholars take their shoes off because they
used foot-warmers?), the curtain at shoulder height to take the chill off
the stone wall. Whereas Antonello put the saint's study inside a church,
Vincenzo has created a real room, but made the most prominent object within
it the crucifix. Head bowed on his hand, the intellectual is Christ's humble
servant to Christ.
Giovanni Bellini (or someone in his workshop) looks back to St Jerome's few
years spent as a hermit in the Syrian desert. Here is the lion, to be sure,
but not the anachronistic cardinal's hat. The saint in his sky-blue tunic is
sitting on a rock, blissfully engaged in reading. However, that was Jerome
on a good day in the desert.
The saint's other main occupation, as he testified in his celebrated letter
to Julia Eustochium, one of his female admirers, was bruising his flesh on
the hard ground, fasting, letting his skin turn black as an Ethiopians and
beating his breast all night as he sought to extinguish the fires of lust
which still flickered in his aged loins.
For Jerome, one of the early Church's most ardent proponents of chastity,
the Devil lived in the loins and the navel (his euphemism for female private
parts). Many of the images in the exhibition showing Jerome the penitent
would, to the educated Christian who knew the letters, recall Jerome's
victory over his loins.
With such a rich theme and a smallish gallery, hung with no less than 16 St
Jeromes (there are 30 in the Gallery) some elements are missing and there
are some ellipses. It is not correct that Jerome went to the desert because
of his famous dream, in which he was punished for his attachment to reading
Cicero. We should have been told more about Jeronimite monasteries of the
15th century, and more about the saint as a symbol of penitence in
Counter-Reformation, especially in the light of the one, quite magnificent
loan to the exhibition: Georges de la Tour's 'St Jerome in Penitence' from
Stockholm.
This is a delightful exhibition, one ideal for children and bound to tell
almost everyone something new about St Jerome. I wish we could have had at
least a panel on the Jerome subjects not in the collection, for example,
dictating the Vulgate to his pupils (a scene found in a delightful panel in
Dublin by Niccolo Fances). And was there ever an artist who showed the scene
described in the Golden Legend when the saint's enemies, determined to stop
him becoming pope, left a woman's clothing on his bed? St Jerome, the
absent-minded scholar, put on the dress and went to church, which dished his
papal chances for ever. St Jerome the unwitting transvestite - now that
would have been a spicey variation on a much-loved theme . . .
Until December 13: admission free. Sponsored by the Bernard Sunley

FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Comedy of Errors' after Mozart - Wexford Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wexford Festival's chamber opera this year is a fascinating rarity of 1786.
Gli equivoci by the Italo-English composer Stephen Storace, who was born in
London in 1762 and died there, after a short and not very happy life, in
1796. Son of an Italian musician and his English wife, Storace was the
younger brother of a gifted soprano, Nancy Storace, who has earned a place
in operatic history as the creator of Mozart's Susanna. It was probably
Nancy, much admired also by the Emperor Joseph II, who procured for her
brother a commission to compose a comic opera for Vienna's Burgtheatre, to
be written on a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte.
Da Ponte decided upon Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors and produced an agile,
spirited text, rich in comic situations and in varied musical opportunities.
Da Ponte wrote it in Italian and the opera was presented in 1786 as Gli
equivoci (The Misunderstandings). The young composer's sister naturally
played a leading role. Storace scored a considerable success, and while
remaining for some time in the Vienna repertory, Gli equivoci was given also
in Leipzig, Prague, Dresden and Pressburg.
Virtually forgotten during the last century and for most of this, Storace's
opera needed a thoughtful, lively revival, and Wexford has provided the
perfect occasion. The Theatre Royal is just the right size, allowing the
singers to present their music without forcing and, at the same time,
allowing the audience to grasp the words. The opera was given in English,
with its Shakespearean title The Comedy of Errors, while the translation -
by Arthur Jacobs - restored, insofar as the music permitted, the
Shakespearean words.
Inevitably, Storace's score reflects the influence of Mozart. But the
London-born composer, young as he was, had a mind and a talent of his own;
the arias are stylishly shaped, the orchestra is inventively used, the
voices are tellingly combined (the work is rich in ensembles, and the eight
leading singers are employed in numerous different combinations and all
together in the two extended, scintillating finales).
The four leading male parts belong to the two pairs of separated twins
(tenors, the masters; and baritones, or basses, the buffo servants). There
are three female roles: a wife each for one Eufemio and one Dromio, and a
future wife for the other Eufemio. The master and servant couples from
Syracuse are perhaps a bit more important musically, and the roles were
generally well-handed by the tenor Kip Wilborn (who lost timbre, however,
when he attempted to sing softly) and the bass Kurt Link (whose relentless
mugging became tedious in the second of the two acts). As their Ephesian
counterparts, the tenor Gary Harger and the baritone Christopher Trakas
seemed, at the outset, a little less imposing, but as the evening progressed
proved pleasing in their measured approach and their confident musically.
As Adriana, the bewildered wife of Eufemio of Ephesus, Korliss Uecker, a
bright and pretty American soprano, was charming, crystalline of voice and
sparkling as actress. Her rendering of the 'Scottish' air that Storace
adapted and inserted for his sister (based on a familiar tune, 'The
Yellow-hair'd Laddie') was one of the most affecting moments of an
always-enjoyable evening. Her sister, Luciana, was played by the young
British soprano Sarah Pring, also full of vitality and sensibility. In the
third, lesser, but not insignificant female role, the Irish mezzosoprano
Kate McCarney carried out her not always grateful assignment (Lesbia, her
character, is something of a nag) with flair and conviction.
The brisk conducting of Mark Shanahan kept singers and orchestra together
admirably, but at a price: there was little suppleness or variety; fast and
loud were the watchwords. Only now and then were the tender, even wistful
moods of Storace's music given time and space to assert themselves. The set
designed by Russell Craig was in a now surely outdated buffo style: tilted
houses, many stairs, Mediterranean pinks and whites; and the staging of
Giles Havergal, though it kept everyone on the move, was fairly predictable.
But the signers did work together admirably. The staging may not have been
great, but like the musical presentation, it had a welcome convincing
coherence.
Among the non-operatic events of this year's Wexford festival, one was
particularly exciting: Elgar's Dream of Gerontius in the massive Church of
the Immaculate Conception. John Lubbock conducted the visiting Ulster
Orchestra and the combined choruses of the Belfast Philharmonic Society and
the Wexford Singers, supporting a trio of fine soloists: Yvonne Howard,
mezzosoprano; Justin Lavender, tenor; and Anthony Michaels-Moore, bass, in a
performance that glowed. Lavender sang with unhistrionic intensity,
conveying the impace of Newman's soul-bared text. The other soloists
equalled it and Lubbock brought out the grand architecture of the music with
the profound participation of his players and the joined choirs. That
musicians from both parts of divided Ireland were performing, in unity, an
English masterpiece, inevitably enhanced the emotion of the event.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: Brecker Brothers are still kicking - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They're back and they're still bad - or 'kicking' as their fans would have
it now. It is ten years since The Brecker Brothers last crossed horns to
create their gangsterised fusion of rock and jazz. And judging from the air
of anticipation that filled a packed Festival Hall, they have been sorely
missed. A new contract and a new album, The Return of The Brecker Brothers
(GRP 96842), is the reason for a world tour. The inclusion of fusion guitar
hero Mike Stern and a pulverising rhythm section in Dennis Chambers (drums)
and James Genus (electric bass) is the added appeal for the GTi driving
classes.
The atmosphere created by Breckers, Randy on trumpet and younger Michael on
tenor, both miked up and roving around the stage among a battery of pedal
effects, is that of a rock concert. The performance, punctuated by whoops
from the crowd, is a dazzling showcase of heroic solos and technological
firepower. Both Brothers have a cold metal tone, Randy alternating between a
trashy mute sound and synthesised Donald Duck voice; Mike busier, squiggling
and almost Ornette-like.
'We're having a great time,' said Michael pleasantly after opening with two
crushers from the new recording and an old crowd pleaser in 'Skunk Funk'.
George Whitty's keyboards, on a foundation of heavy funk backbeat, sets the
scene for each number. Randy peep-peeping tantalisingly, Michael
pigeon-toed, knees together and wringing out the notes and wearing out
reeds. When Mike Stern embarked on another incandescent, spiralling and
squealing solo effort with the CD single (single?), 'Big Idea', some
headbanging even broke out in the stalls.
'Song for Barry' was the sort of technological tour de force of which
stablemate and technocrat Chick Corea would be proud. A tribute to
trombonist Barry Rogers, the piece begins with Michael blowing into an
innocuous looking device called the ewi (electronic wind instrument). It
looks like a melodica but in brother Michael's hands is more like a latter
day horn of Jericho. Blowing into it gently at first conjured up the sounds
of an African village, bass mumbling and shouts, then a booming orchestra of
didgeridoos. More vigorous application set the walls of the Festival Hall
shaking dangerously.
Exchanging the ewi for a walkabout with the tenor and some caustic notes,
however, heralded the return of Stern and a spinning coda held down by
Chambers' bludgeoning bass drum. Yes, they're back alright.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Management: Run your business by the book - How a company
benefits from good documentation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO needs paperwork? Anyone who wants to get the most out of their buildings
and plant, according to Maurice Ault, who believes technical documentation
should be recognised as an invaluable management tool.
Too many businesses, he contends, operate even state-of-the-art premises by
the seat of their pants, never having properly conducted an audit of the
physical assets they control or setting down best-practice guidelines.
'All too often, managers have no clear understanding of what they have under
their control, how it works and how to get the best out of it. The result is
that businesses can be run sloppily and even dangerously.'
One of the keys to safe, reliable and profitable business operations, says
Ault, is high-quality documentation. Like a car handbook, a set of manuals
exposing the nuts and bolts of every operational facility, can guide an
ever-changing cast of managers through training to the operation and
maintenance of plant.
'Only when you describe a plant in detail can you understand what it is and
what it does. Then you have to explain how you operate it. Many of those
responsible simply do things as they have always been done, without any idea
of whether it is the best way.
'Done properly, documentation will optimise any company's technical and
financial performance. Without it, costs and inefficiencies can escalate,
losses will mount and there is even a danger of physical risk to personnel,'
Ault adds.
As the man responsible for marketing Technical Publications Management
Services (TPMS), purchased recently from National Power by shipbuilding and
engineering group Vosper Thorneycroft, Ault has a vested interest in getting
his message across.
But it is being taken on board by British companies in search of competitive
edge, not least because technological developments and statutory safety and
environmental requirements increasingly demand standards which can be met
and maintained only with reference to formal documentation.
Given its power industry roots, the recent growth of TPMS has been largely
based on its success in offering a documentation service to the operators of
highly technical, complex plant - such as power stations and offshore
installations - although it is now branching out into the water treatment
and supply, defence and aerospace industries.
But Ault believes the need for quality documentation is becoming paramount
in far less technically-oriented businesses - such as hotels, theatres and
cinemas and manufacturing facilities, where safety and health standards have
to be based on a proper understanding of a building's working
characteristics.
'Technical documentation may look like a Cinderella activity but it involves
a fundamental management discipline of increasing importance. Walk around
any factory or plant and you can identify those which have already got the
message and those which are inviting big trouble.'

FT  30 OCT 92 / Management: Pushing pens and pumping iron - Perks / In-house
corporate gyms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the definition of a company perk is a benefit mutually useful to both
company and employee then the provision of corporate sporting facilities has
long fallen within this category.
What originally started as a social idea designed to weld team spirit
between employee and employer is now coming to be seen by employees as a
right rather than a privilege. Established UK companies such as ICI and
Midland Bank have sports grounds and social clubs with histories almost as
old as those of the companies.
The US craze for squeezing workouts into every waking hour, however, has
spawned a new type of facility - the in-house fitness centre. The centres,
which usually comprise a multi-gym, aerobics centre and cardio-vascular
unit, are becoming increasingly popular among City institutions and large
company headquarters as an alternative to corporate membership of health
clubs.
Most in-house corporate fitness clubs are run on a membership basis
requiring an annual subscription. These are often subsidised - which is
where the perk comes in - though the Inland Revenue has not yet decided to
tax the subsidy. 'I don't think the taxman would try to tax something which
is improving a company's bottom line when he's also getting corporation
tax,' said Don Genders, managing director of Corporate Gymnasia, which
designs and builds gymnasiums.
Some companies are moving away from the provision of old-style recreational
centres and sports fields located miles from the workplace at an out-of-town
site. General Accident recently sold its sports ground in Surrey to a local
football club and Standard Chartered Bank has put its own sports ground on
the market.
Thomas Cook has bucked this trend by building a Pounds 4m leisure centre at
its 22-acre headquarters site employing 1,900 people at Peterborough. The
centre is designed to complement the outdoor cricket, bowls, football,
tennis and croquet pitches. It includes three conference rooms and a
day-nursery for up to 50 pre-school children.
More typical of recent corporate trends is the installation of on-site
fitness centres managed by outside contractors. The two main operators of
managed centres in the UK are Fitness For Industry (FFI), a subsidiary of
the Forte Group, and Orion, part of the Coverwood Group.
Both companies have been around for about 13 years and they are still
operating in a small though expanding market.
Ann White, operations manager at Orion, said that providing a perk for
employees was often the motivation for establishing a company fitness
centre. But, she argued, companies were seeing benefits for themselves
across the workforce. 'The companies with in-house centres are finding that
a wider group of people is using the facility including people who wouldn't
normally excercise,' she said.
Some 800 of the 1,000 staff at Freshfields, the London legal practice, have
had fitness assessments at the firm's in-house gym run by FFI. Of those, 400
now use the gym twice or more every week. Companies such as Ford Motor
Company, Wellcome, Rank Xerox and Mercury Communications have gyms operated
by Orion which now has 20 in-house gym-management contracts. FFI has 21
clients, including the House of Commons, Robert Fleming, American Express
and Air Products.
FFI runs two centres for Air Products, the US industrial gases and chemicals
manufacturer. The company installed the centres when it moved some of its
operations to Basingstoke from its Hersham European headquarters. Air
Products has had a large sports centre at its parent headquarters in
Allentown, Pennsylvania, for some years so management took little persuading
about the merits of in-house gymnasiums in the UK.
The centres are run like a club and staff who pay a Pounds 48 subsidised
annual membership fee undergo fitness assessments before they start work on
cardio-vascular equipment. All are given V02 ratings  - the standard fitness
rating based upon a calculation of oxygen intake during excercise.
Paul Waldoch, a 31-year-old engineer manager, is one of the Hersham fitness
success stories. He joined in January, weighing in at 16 1/2 stones with a
V02 of 33 and a blood pressure rate of 166 over 66.
Now he is down to 14 stone, his V02 rating is 57, his blood pressure is 127
over 66 and his resting pulse-rate is down from about 75-80 to 60. He has
taken up rowing, eats lots of fruit and feels sharper for the experience.
'If you ask most people here I think they would say their work has benefited
by being involved in this. You don't get to lunchtime and say I wish the day
would finish,' he said.
Alan Carver, director of human resources who introduced the fitness centres,
said that the 355 members of the club at Hersham, out of a workforce of 800,
had acheived a 20 per cent increase in fitness in its first six months. He
said: 'People at all levels use the facility and it does break down
barriers.'
The centre is open three times a day - 7am to 9pm, 12 noon to 2pm and 5pm to
8pm. All sessions are supervised. Fitting out the centre in a 1,600ft
pre-fabricated building in the grounds of the headquarters cost Pounds
38,000. A further Pounds 50,000 was spent adding showers and flooring.
Annual running costs to the company are about Pounds 50,000.
'When you consider the benefits for staff from that sort of outlay I think
it is a very attractive proposition,' said Carver.
The fitness centre is only part of a wider promotion of health and fitness
at Air Products which includes an almost evangelical approach to safety. The
company believes its policies have paid measurable dividends. In 1975 it had
110 incidents across Europe that resulted in staff needing time off; 4,000
working-days were lost as a result. Last year Air Products had just eight
such incidents resulting in a loss of 50 man-days.
An internal survey of FFI's clients showed that, on average, from a total
sample of 800 scores the fitness ratings of those taking part had risen by
more than 16 per cent between six-month assessments.
Little UK data is available to assess the benefits of corporate fitness
programmes. Reports in the US, where the high cost of health care has
generated enthusiasm for such programmes, indicate lower absenteeism,
reduced health-care costs, increased morale and improved efficiency among
workers.
Coverwood looked at 97 of the US reports and found that, while all the
surveys showed positive results, the findings varied widely and benefits
tended to be overstated. On one of its own managed sites, however, Coverwood
said that its fitness programme had saved more than Pounds 300,000 in
working days lost because of back pain.
Coverwood is now introducing programmes to take corporate fitness into the
management training field. 'We are trying to develop a new way of looking at
things. We want corporate financial management to use fitness centres as a
training base,' said Barry Morgan, chief executive of the group.
This is the third article in a series on company perks. Others appeared on
October 14 and 23.

FT  30 OCT 92 / The Property Market: New act on the fringe circuit -
Opportunities beyond the Square Mile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shabby, historic fringes of the City of London provide as telling
evidence of the property crash as anywhere in the UK. When the buoyant
property market started to reverse into recession in the late 1980s, an
immediate visible result in areas such as Southwark and Clerkenwell on the
City fringes was street after street of boarded-up offices, derelict sites
and brand-new but empty developments.
But the City fringes are not just a unpleasant reminder of the severity of
the property slump. They also present opportunities for a fundamental
rethink about land use in central London. Housing, rather than offices,
could become the favoured choice for empty sites in the 1990s.
The case for converting offices into housing is persuasive. In Islington,
181 sites which have been granted planning permission for offices remain
undeveloped, according to Applied Property Research (APR), an independent
research company. Given the bleak outlook for the City's office market, it
is unclear whether these schemes will ever be viable.
Last summer, APR visited and photographed all 181 sites and graded them
according to their office potential. They concluded that 20 per cent of the
sites would never be a good office site, 63 per cent had little hope as an
office site, 15 per cent could be an office site in 10 years and 2 per cent
could be an office site within 5-10 years. None of the sites fell into the
category 'good office site, developable within 2-5 years'.
'Much of the borough will be blighted by vacant and derelict sites until the
end of the century and beyond,' says APR.
The plethora of planning permissions that were granted in the 1980s bear
witness to an extraordinary transformation in the perceptions of the City's
fringe area over the past decade. Between mid-1982 and 1987, the rents of
fringe City properties increased by 125 per cent, compared with 100 per cent
in the central City area and 50 per cent for the west end, according to
Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. At its peak, rents were bid up to as
high as Pounds 40 per sq ft.
The fortunes of the fringe areas were closely linked with those of the City.
In the run-up to Big Bang in 1987, an unprecedented level of property
activity in the City forced developers to look beyond the Square Mile's
traditional boundaries. The overspill went into the fringes.
With the emergence of screen-based trading in the 1980s, financial
institutions no longer felt bound to huddle together within the Square Mile.
The need for modern offices to house the banks of computer screens also
persuaded banks, brokers and related service companies to move outside the
confines of the City. Some moved to the City fringes, which in turn
displaced existing tenants.
The pressure on the fringes provoked mixed reactions from neighbouring
left-wing boroughs. These boroughs were eager to maintain their strong
industrial base. But they were forced to relax their position because of a
combination of factors: the decline of industry in central London;
successive Conservative victories in general elections; and a substantial
easing of the planning regime.
The planning changes came about as a result of the 1987 Use Classes Order,
in which offices, research and development and light industry were combined
under a single category for planning purposes. These changes, prompted by a
desire to boost businesses' flexibility and cut local government red tape,
often resulted in an upturn in the number of new offices at the expense of
workshops and manufacturing sites.
For the councils, the attraction of granting office planing permission was
the prospect of some community benefit being provided by developers, a quid
pro quo which suited both sides. In the absence of any overall strategic
planning in London, councils had little reason to turn down planning
requests since this would probably have resulted in the loss of potential
business and jobs locally.
But this no longer holds; for over the past few years, the surge in demand
for offices has reversed. The central London service sector has lost almost
as many jobs in the past three years as it created in the previous six. And
the financial services sector, which fuelled the rise in demand for offices
in the City fringes, has suffered among the biggest job losses in the
service sector. Rents in the City fringes have virtually halved since their
peak in May 1990, according to Hillier Parker.
Yet the prospects for the better City fringe office developments are not
hopeless. Some buildings will attract tenants by letting individual floors;
others will become serviced offices offering flexible leases to the small
businesses that have always been an important part of the London economy.
But the majority of tired, obsolete office buildings and vacant sites may
never have a useful future unless their use is reconsidered.
The oversupply of offices in the capital is matched by an undersupply of
housing in its centre. The long commuting times endured by most London
office workers and the high cost of housing point to an underlying shortage
of residential property, even though the market is currently hard hit by
recession.
APR calculates that 72 per cent of the Islington sites with office planning
permission were suitable for housing, if not for private residential
property, then for housing associations and student hostels.
Converting offices to residential uses is neither cheap or easy. The
problems are greatest in the air-conditioned, glass blocks built in the
1980s, with large floor spaces and wall-to-wall sealed windows. Windows need
to be blocked out and new wiring, plumbing and independent heating systems
installed. Moreover, refurbishment on commercial buildings attracts value
added tax, unlike residential property. It is frequently cheaper to demolish
an office building and start again, rather than convert to residential
property.
Obtaining planning permission for office conversions can also be a problem.
Residents, fearful of noisy parties, often object to planning permission
being granted for student accommodation; developers warm to this type of
conversion because offices divide easily into bedsits and the absence of
gardens and car parking present no problems. Furthermore, councils are
sometimes reluctant to allow a change of use because commercial buildings
attract jobs.
Conversions are not confined to Clerkenwell; similar office-to-housing
changes of use are taking place in Mayfair, Battersea and even the
Docklands.
But what makes the City fringes more appropriate for such conversions is
that the area already has the infrastructure of launderettes, shops, cafes
and post offices which serve the existing community. Unlike the office
ghettos of the City centre, the fringes already have a life outside the
hours of nine to five.

FT  30 OCT 92 / The Property Market: Decline gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a marked worsening of the property outlook last month, as
reflected in September's IPD property index. For the market as a whole, the
decline in total return accelerated to 0.7 per cent, the worst performance
since January 1991. Yields shifted outwards across the board - to touch
nearly 10 per cent overall - and capital values dropped 1.4 per cent over
the month, the biggest monthly drop for more than two years. Year-on-year
total return fell to 0.9 per cent for the 12 months to September.
All three sectors covered by the index did poorly. Offices did worst, with a
1 per cent negative total return, down from -0.8 per cent the previous
month. Year-on-year total return was negative, at -6.0 per cent for the year
to September.
The deterioration was most marked, however, in retail properties, which
swung from a positive total return of 0.1 per cent in August to a negative
return of 0.4 per cent in September. 'Despite these results,' says IPD, 'the
retail sector is still attracting the bulk of such modest new investment as
is available.'
Industrial properties fell from the August return of -0.2 per cent to -0.6
per cent in September. Year-on-year total return for the sector, which
recovered to 8.6 per cent in March, has since been falling and reached 3.1
per cent in September.

FT  30 OCT 92 / How projections measure up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE economy has slumped, so have the reputations of many of Britain's
leading economists, virtually all of whom have been slow to spot how bad the
recession would become.
The table ranks economists according to the accuracy of their growth
projections since the recession started. For each year in the study, an
average of each organisation's monthly growth forecasts has been built up.
The difference between the average for each organisation in a particular
year and actual growth provides a measure of forecasting accuracy.
Although even the top-ranked forecasters were some way out in their
projections, the analysis provides insights into who was on the right track.
Because of its use of large numbers of monthly forecasts, the study picks up
better than other analyses the degree to which forecasters update their
projections. That biases it slightly against organisations such as the
Treasury which update their projections relatively infrequently.
However, two of the top 10 forecasters update their projections only four or
five times a year. The table includes only those forecasters who have
published regular projections from early 1990 on.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Bank replies to Bingham report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, last night denied
that it was timid in using its powers to prevent bank fraud. He defended the
Bank's overall approach to supervision.
He was responding to Lord Justice Bingham's report, published last week,
into the Bank's role as supervisor of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, the corrupt bank closed in July 1991.
The report criticised the Bank for being unaware of the scope of its powers
to intervene in BCCI's affairs and wrong not to have taken responsibility
for monitoring BCCI's worldwide activities many years before the bank's
closure
He said that since 1986 the Bank had used its powers under the Banking Act
to close 17 unsound banks and restrict the activities of 28 potentially
unsound banks. 'These are not the acts of a timid supervisor', he insisted.
In a further 35 cases, the Bank had instigated 'remedial programmes' at
banks to force them to restructure their businesses or change their
management or seek new owners.
At BCCI, the Bank attempted just such a remedial programme in 1990, rather
than closing it down. Mr Leigh-Pemberton insisted that that was the correct
strategy on the basis of the information then available to the Bank.
Legislation on environmental responsibilities should avoid imposing
liability retrospectively, Mr David Coleridge, retiring chairman of Lloyd's
of London the insurance market, said at Guildhall last night.
He called on UK and EC legislators to avoid the 'sheer injustice' of
imposing environmental liability from past periods in the way that it does
in the USA.
Mr Coleridge said the financial difficulties of the insurance market in the
recent past provided tremendous opportunities for 'insurers who hold their
nerve, and are prepared to change their ways'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Britain's top 10 forecasters: The FT ranks the performance
of leading economists during the recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1 - Paul Turnbull
UK economist
Smith New Court
Has closely monitored the housing boom and subsequent slump. Long-term term
opponent of UK membership of exchange rate mechanism; wrote in October 1990,
three weeks after Britain joined, of 'dominant risk' of base rates being
kept high due to ERM constraint. Little known outside City, where he has
worked for nearly 15 years. Has few fans in the Treasury. Two months ago had
chance to explain his often trenchant views to Alan Budd, Treasury chief
economic adviser, over private lunch, the first meeting between the two.
2 - Leo Doyle
econometrician
Kleinwort Benson
Computer wizard-cum-economist whose job prior to joining Kleinwort
investment group was a floor cleaner in a psychiatric hospital in Sussex.
Kleinwort's forecasts use a computerised economic model devised by Doyle.
Based on Treasury software, the model takes in extra data on company debts
and housing market. Stays in the background at Kleinwort, where recently
arrived Peter Spencer is chief economist and David Owen the main UK
economist. Surprisingly, the Treasury has yet to contact him about his
model.
3 - Keith Wade
chief economist
Schroders
Low-profile economist whose views are little circulated outside circle of
Schroders' clients. Has worked on UK economy at Schroders for past four
years, initially with Schroders' former chief economist Donald Franklin -
now at Treasury where he works not on forecasts but financial services
regulation. Wrote with Franklin in autumn of 1990 of danger of global
economic slowdown and sugested chancellor 'may have left it too late to
prevent a prolonged recession'. Worked with Alan Budd when they were both at
London Business School.
4 - Patrick Minford
economics professor
Liverpool University
Vehemently anti-ERM and free-market economist. Long disregarded in Treasury
for what have been held to be unsound views. Leading member of 'Liverpool
Six' group of monetarist economists arguing since early 1991 that recession
would be protracted. Says Treasury should have taken more notice early on of
impact of high real interest rates. Wrote - one month after Britain joined
ERM - that devaluation 'seemed inevitable'. Now says 'the Treasury should
come clean and admit it made a hash of things'.
5 - Peter Warburton
UK economist
Robert Fleming
Deep thinker, another member of Liverpool Six group, has been extremely
gloomy about economy since 1990, arguing that weak balance sheets of
companies and large consumer debts would impede growth. On good terms with
Alan Budd; both worked at London Business School. Stopped using computer
models of economy three years ago on ground that they gave wrong results.
Thinks Treasury is too enclosed. Wrote in October 1990 that the economy was
'hamstrung' because of corporate and consumer overborrowing.
6 - Richard Freeman
chief economist
ICI
Outgoing Australian, worked in Treasury before joining Britain's biggest
manufacturing company. Good contacts in industry, receives up-to-the-minute
information on sales and prospects in all ICI divisions, ranging from paints
to fertiliser. Forecasts not widely circulated, writes detailed report every
month on world economy to ICI board. Told ICI directors two years ago of
'big risk' of world recession. Generally gloomy about international outlook
ever since. Key member of informal Treasury panel advising government
forecasters about demand in industry.
7 - Gavyn Davies
chief UK economist
Goldman Sachs
On most counts, Britain's best known economist. Was sounded out last year by
Mr Lamont for post of Treasury chief economic adviser; decided against a
move. With colleague David Walton, quick to change Goldman's monthly
forecasts. Not immune to mistakes: incorrectly predicted recovery a year
ago. Thinks criticism of Treasury has been overdone. He says: 'If I was to
choose two people I would rely on for giving policy advice on the economy
then Terry Burns (Treasury permanent secretary) and Alan Budd would be very
high on my list.'
8 - Tim Congdon
head of Lombard Street Research
Sometimes irrascible but respected monetarist with good track record in
recent years in predicting economic slowdown. Another member of Liverpool
Six, runs his own research group. Wrote in January 1991 of 'nightmarish'
future for Britain with 'severe recession' made worse by ERM constraints.
Says top Treasury officials 'have had too many chances' over wrong economic
decisions and would like to see fresh blood. Thinks Treasury team of Burns
and Budd in particular failed to draw lessons from previous boom-bust
episodes.
8 - Michael Saunders
UK economist
Salomon Brothers
Up and coming, youthful City star, more original than most economists and
particularly good with figures on public-sector borrowing. Poached by
Salomon from gilts broker Greenwell Montagu two years ago. Has warned for
past year of long slowdown. Said two years ago that economy would continue
to weaken during 1991, 'with little prospect of rapid turnround' due to high
real interest rates across Europe and substantial cuts in stocks and fixed
investment. Says that government PSBR forecasts are over-optimistic.
10 - Bill Martin
chief UK economist
UBS Phillips and Drew
Feisty self-publicist; fourth member of Liverpool Six to make the FT's Top
10; the other two, Alan Walters and Gordon Pepper, do not make formal
forecasts. Fierce opponent of ERM; views little taken into account by
Treasury. Has called Treasury projections 'moonshine'. Warned in November
1990 of dangers of 'deepening recession and further political trauma'
arising out of high interest rates and a slide in sterling. Said two years
ago that the government's promise of 'pain first, pleasure later (as a
result of ERM entry) appears impossibly optimistic'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Priority is to restore stable policy framework: Chancellor's
Mansion House speech
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In his speech last night Mr Norman Lamont said:
It is just six weeks since we left the ERM. But it is already clear that the
decision marked a watershed. Though the aims of government policy remain the
same, we are now in an entirely different policy environment. We are outside
the ERM and are likely to remain so for some time. And with a floating pound
we have had more flexibility to reduce interest rates without prejudice to
our goal of permanently low inflation.
But the wider world has changed too.
Most significantly, there has been a further deterioration in the prospects
for the world economy.
Closer to home, events in Europe have been dominated by Germany's unique
economic circumstances. Having faced exceptionally high real interest rates
over the last year as Germany dealt with the consequences of reunification,
we are now having to contend with a rapid German slowdown, further
depressing activity throughout the region.
Here in Britain, the frustrated hopes of the last year have led to a decline
in business and consumer confidence, and this has been exacerbated by recent
events. A deteriorating world environment, political uncertainties, a spate
of industrial redundancies and the removal of a central pillar of the
government's monetary policy - this is an unusual, indeed an extraordinary,
set of events. So it is not at all surprising that the surveys of business
and consumer opinion that we have seen since September 16 have revealed
confidence to be weaker.
I want to set out tonight why I believe that confidence can be recovered;
and, more importantly, how the new conditions can be turned to Britain's
advantage and at long last bring us out of recession.
Our first priority has been to re-establish a stable and predictable policy
framework. Since sterling was forced out of the ERM, we have re-emphasised
the continuity of the government's objectives - sound money, low taxes, open
markets and free trade.
But as the dust settles on the events of the last few weeks, it is crucial
to recognise the relaxation of policy that has already been made.
The significant depreciation in sterling seen over the last six weeks - not
just against the currencies of Europe, but also against the dollar -
undoubtedly gives British exporters greater opportunities to win business in
foreign markets.
And the greater flexibility we now have outside the ERM, together with the
reduction there has been in German market rates, has also allowed me to take
a further 2 points off interest rates. British industry now has interest
rates which, apart from a few months in 1988, are the lowest since 1978.
They are also the lowest in the European Community.
These developments have undoubtedly enhanced the prospects for recovery. But
they have done so in a way that is sensible, responsible - and entirely
appropriate to our own economic circumstances.
Soon after we left the ERM, I said that monetary policy had been tighter
than was required to keep inflation on a downward track. That does not mean
that the painful warwe waged against inflation over the last few years was
not worthwhile. Far from it - that was a war we had to win.
But the goal of the government's macro-economic policy has never been simply
to defeat inflation. Low inflation is not just an end in itself. It is also
the means to sustainable growth and secure employment. It is the vital
precondition for the economic stability upon which a nation's future
prosperity ultimately depends.
But just as prosperity can be jeopardised by too lax a monetary policy and
too high a rate of inflation, so too, we have always recognised that policy
can become too tight.
Leaving the ERM was a setback, but it has given us the opportunity to
rebalance our policy to take greater account of the risks to the world
economy. This does not mean that the government has gone soft on inflation.
But the dramatic progress we have made in getting inflation down does allow
me now to give greater weight to securing an early resumption of growth.
The prime minister has spoken about the government's hopes for recovery and
of our determination to see Britain put this long and difficult recession
behind us.
First, that means that government and industry need to work together to
rebuild confidence. But economic confidence is an elusive quality. It cannot
simply be drawn like a rabbit from a conjurer's hat. I may be dressed as a
magician, but I am, in fact, just the chancellor.
But what the government can do is to set out as clearly and precisely as
possible how we intend to steer the economy back towards the growth we all
want to see.
I have drawn attention already to the relaxation of monetary conditions I
have made over the last few weeks. That was fully justified by the excellent
medium-term prospects for inflation and in making decisions about further
cuts in interest rates I shall continue to take no risks with our long-term
inflation goal. But as Noel Coward might have said, cheap money is not as
potent as cheap music. If slashing interest rates were all that was required
to generate growth, there would not be a single poor country left in the
world. But let me assure you - I have no desire to keep interest rates any
higher than is necessary to meet the government's inflation objectives.
Over the medium term the prospects for interest rates in this country will
depend as much on fiscal policy as on the monetary stance. And that is why
the new public expenditure plans I shall be announcing in the Autumn
Statement are so important.
Last July I set up a new system for the control of public spending with two
aims in mind. First, to ensure that the government's spending plans are
fully within the country's means. While it is perfectly sensible to allow
the PSBR to rise at a time of recession, a tight fiscal position over the
medium-term is absolutely essential if I am to keep interest rates down.
Second, I wanted to ensure that public money was directed towards the
government's priorities. In the package I shall be announcing on November
12, my priorities will be to promote recovery and the long-term prosperity
of the British economy. It must make strategic sense to ensure that,
wherever possible, spending on the infrastructure is maintained at a time of
recession.
But if capital programmes are to come first, government has to take a lead
from industry and keep a firm grip on its current expenditure. And I have
also been determined to find ways of giving the private sector a greater
role in financing capital projects. I shall be announcing my proposals in
the Autumn Statement.
I know that many people have been concerned, over the years, that the
government does not adequately distinguish between current and capital
spending. There are good reasons for this, but having looked at this issue
again, I have concluded that the time has come to make a change. From the
first unified budget in December 1993, government accounts will be drawn up
in a way which makes a proper distinction between current and capital
transactions. I believe this will help to underpin the government's
commitment to infrastructure investment in the longer run.
Lower interest rates supported by sensible public expenditure priorities
will put the economy on course for recovery. But the key to improving the
economy's growth performance over the longer term is continuing supply-side
reform.
So the government will be pressing on with our programme of deregulation and
privatisation; with our reforms of education and our policies to promote
fair competition both at home and abroad. A successful conclusion of the
Gatt round and the completion of the single market will provide enormous
opportunities for British industry. British firms must be fully involved in
the European market. That is why the government attaches so much importance
to ratifying the Maastricht Treaty. We cannot afford to be left on the
fringes while our partners make the rules.
But growth does not come from governments. It comes from individuals.
Above all, growth comes from human nature. It is the human spirit and the
desire of human beings to achieve that in the long run makes growth the
natural course of affairs.
The government cannot press a button and see the economy spring to life. But
we can examine every policy option and ask ourselves - does this support
industry? Will it help confidence? Will this get the economy going? That is
what we shall be doing in the weeks and months ahead.
Much of the criticism of the Treasury's forecasting record has been
misplaced. The last few years have been extremely difficult ones for
forecasters who have been getting it wrong all over the world.
It is not difficult to see why. Forecasters today are pioneering uncharted
territory. Alan Greenspan recently referred to the impossibility of
predicting how and when the US will emerge from a recession based on debt
problems the like of which have not been seen for 60 years. There are
similar problems throughout the industrialised world.
Forecasting also means trying to predict the decisions of millions of
individuals, all with the freedom to spend, invest or save as they chose.
With these forces to contend with, the surprise is not that forecasters
sometimes get it wrong, but that they ever get it right]
In such difficult circumstances no one has a monopoly of wisdom and the
Treasury had always paid close attention to the work of outside forecasters.
I propose to invite a number of independent forecasters to join a new
Forecasting Panel, to meet at regular intervals, and then publish an
assessment. This would include the full range of forecasts made by
individual panel members, as well as some summary of the central view and
the risks attached to it.
The Treasury will, of course, retain its own forecasting capability. But my
proposals will underline that the Treasury forecast is only one of several
which inform government policy decisions.
This change should help to strip away some of the mystique which surrounds
forecasting and in this way, lead to a better elucidation of policy itself.
I turn now to monetary policy.
I set out a few weeks ago how monetary policy will operate now the pound is
floating. This contains an important innovation: an explicit target range of
1 per cent to 4 per cent for inflation. The government aims to get inflation
in the lower part of that range by the end of this parliament.
In judging whether we are on track to meet that objective, we will take
account of the behaviour of the monetary aggregates, narrow and broad; of
asset prices, particularly house prices; other indicators of inflationary
pressure; and of course, the exchange rate. Overall, policy will operate
broadly in the way that it does in many other countries, like the US, Japan
and Germany.
There are three aspects of this policy which are worth elaborating. One is
that prospective, not current, inflation will be our guide. Monetary
adjustments take time to have effect, and a low inflation rate today is not
in itself a reliable cue for a relaxation of policy.
Another issue is the role of the exchange rate. Some people insist that
movements in the exchange rate are just a change in relative prices which
need not affect the rate of inflation. Others argue that disinflationary
forces are currently so strong that such pressures pose no threat.
I am not persuaded by either of these arguments. The first might apply to a
large, relatively closed economy, but it certainly does not hold for
Britain. And those who blithely contemplate an ever lower exchange rate
clearly have not understood what import higher costs mean for business. It
would be a brave man who totally discounts the risk of these being passed
through to domestic prices.
Finally, there is the argument that this set-up is too judgmental. Sometimes
I think that this charge is level- led mainly by people working in the
financial markets, who would simply like me to make their lives easier.
We are, of course, moving from a largely rules-based system to one that is
more discretionary.
The need for judgment is obviously greater outside the ERM, which makes it
all the more important that it is exercised in a consistent way. I propose,
therefore, to implement three changes to make the formation of policy more
transparent and our decisions more accountable.
First, I intend to publish a Monthly Monetary Report following the regular
meetings which take place between the governor and myself. This will, apart
from certain market sensitive items, set out the information on which our
policy judgments are based, showing the bad news with the good, from month
to month.
Second, whenever a change in interest rates takes place, we will provide an
account of our reasoning, much as we did when I cut interest rates on
October 16. By comparing the accounts over time the markets will be able to
make up their own minds about whether or not a consistent approach is being
applied.
Finally, I have asked the Governor to provide a regular report on the
progress being made towards the government's inflation objective. This will
be published in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin.
Together with my initiative on forecasting these changes mark a welcome
shift away from the excessive secrecy which has up to now shrouded much of
the policy-making process.
Openness and accountability, clear policies, steadily pursued, sound money,
low inflation, a firm approach to public expenditure and a determined
attempt to ensure that resources are allocated to programmes and projects
that will support Britain's recovery. These are the objectives the
government has set itself and these are the objectives we will continue to
pursue, with purpose, vigour and determination.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Iraqi trial told of warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR civil servant warned his colleagues that embarrassing 'dirty
washing' within the Department of Trade and Industry would be discovered by
an investigation into the exporting of equipment for the Iraqi defence
procurement programme, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
The warning was given by Mr Michael Coolican, an assistant secretary at the
DTI, in June 1990 after Customs began investigating both the supergun affair
and the exporting of other equipment to Iraq.
In a memo, read out in court, Mr Coolican said: 'The dirty washing liable to
emerge from the actions of Customs and Excise will add to the problems posed
by the gun.'
The timing of the investigation would be 'extraordinarily embarrassing' for
the DTI, given recent conversations between it, the Foreign Office and the
Ministry of Defence, he went on.
DTI civil servants had not been aware of the activities of Customs when they
briefed trade ministers on the matter, Mr Coolican said.
The court also heard that, according to a memo from the British security
services written in August 1987, American blueprints were used by the Iraqis
during the Iran-Iraq war to build a 1,000-pound bomb at their Nassr
munitions factory.
The trial continues today.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Jaguar workers vote to accept two-year deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUAL WORKERS at Jaguar, the loss-making luxury car manufacturer, agreed
yesterday to a two-year pay deal worth a minimum of 8 per cent, linked to
continuing changes in working practices.
Workers voted by 3,072 to 565 in favour of the deal in an 88 per cent
turnout of union members. Union officials described the deal as fair and
realistic given the current economic climate.
The company said the agreement would help Jaguar improve efficiency.
Under the pay deal workers will get a 4 per cent increase from November 1
and a further 4 per cent next year - or an increase linked to the RPI if
inflation goes above that figure.
Employees in return have agreed to the continuing removal of demarcation
lines, a growing reliance on multi-skilled grades, and the extention of
teamworking on production lines.
The pay element is similar to the most recent settlement in the UK car
industry - at Rover - where unions recently accepted a two-stage, 18-month
deal worth a minimum 7.3 per cent.
Many of the working practices included in the deal are now widespread in
manufacturing industry, including companies in the car sector such as Rover
and Ford. For Jaguar they represent the next stage in the radical shake-up
of the company's previously outdated work culture, which started with
changes two years ago.
The size of the vote in favour of the agreement reflects acceptance that the
pay deal was the best achievable in the present economic climate and a
realisation of the particular difficulties Jaguar faces because of declining
sales in many overseas markets.
Jaguar in recent weeks has announced that it is shedding 820 jobs and
cutting its planned production for this year to 23,000 - unchanged from last
year - compared with the 27,000 forecast earlier. Jaguar's current strategy
of overhauling working practices to include a requirement that workers
remain on the production line until the end of a shift follows the company's
takeover by Ford two years ago.
The package includes agreement by the current workforce not to object to the
recruitment of temporary employees if and when a new model is pro-duced.
The pay element in the package illustrates the continuing downward pressure
on private-sector pay, with settlements around 4 per cent.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Digital radio wins support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has signalled its support for the next stage in radio
technology - digital audio broadcasting - and wants UK manufacturers to be
first into the market.
DAB uses digital technology to transmit sound of compact-disc quality to car
or other portable radios and might also lead to many new national and local
radio stations.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, said the government was
working to ensure a leading position for the UK in the introduction of DAB.
Discussions were in progress to ensure that suitable frequencies were set
aside for the new form of radio. Mr Brooke appealed to UK manufacturers to
take the opportunity of DAB to make new sets at reasonable prices, as
existing sets will not be able to receive DAB. He said: 'UK manufacturers
could be the first into both the UK and international markets.'
The first DAB car radio is expected to be introduced by 1995, with other
sets likely two years later.
The government, Mr Brooke has said, would want a flexible framework 'for
innovative and creative radio' covering national and local services.
The desire for 'innovative services' contrasts with the approach being put
forward by the Radio Authority for the introduction of DAB. The authority,
the regulatory body for commercial radio, argued in a policy document this
month that existing radio services had to be simultaneously re-broadcast on
digital services for a number of years.
The envisaged blocks of frequencies would allow 10-12 national channels
between the BBC and the Radio Authority, with five or six local channels
almost everywhere, and with 10 or 12 in a few main markets. That, the Radio
Authority argues, would allow for one or two new national channels.
Mr Brooke would appear to have something more radical in mind.

</HEADLINE>

THE CONTINUED failure to improve conditions in jails was condemned by Judge
Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, in his annual report
published yesterday. He highlighted overcrowding, lack of training for

FT  30 OCT 92 / Aerospace staff march to save jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 2,000 UK aerospace workers, led by a Scottish piper and a jazz
band, marched to the Houses of Parliament yesterday to lobby for government
intervention to save jobs in the hard-pressed aerospace industry.
Union leaders warned that the whole industry, Britain's biggest exporter of
manufactured goods, was at risk. The unions said that even after losing
40,000 jobs during the last two years, a further 70,000 jobs might disappear
unless the government acted urgently to support the industry.
Mr John Weakley, an executive member of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, told a rally in a London hotel before the protest march: 'The effects
of the closure of aerospace sites such as Hatfield and Kingston are just as
devastating as the closure of pits at Grimethorpe and Markham Main.'
Yesterday's protest followed extensive restructuring at British Aerospace,
which announced last month the closure of its historic Hatfield plant and an
additional 3,000 job cuts. Other leading UK aerospace companies such as
Rolls-Royce, Westland, Smiths Industries, Dowty, and Lucas, have been forced
to make substantial job cuts because of a decline in defence spending and
the deep recession in the civil aviation business.
The UK aerospace industry at present employs 150,000 people. The unions
believe the biggest danger to future jobs in the industry is posed by the
threatened European Fighter Aircraft project. They say that 20,000 UK jobs
depend directly on this project and 20,000 indirectly.
A union leader said that although it was not as emotional an issue as the
future of the UK coal mining industry, it was a much bigger one because it
involved the whole future of UK manufacturing.
With the slogan 'Keep aerospace flying', the unions urged the government to
proceed as fast as possible with the EFA even if Britain's partners -
Germany, Italy and Spain - pull out.
The unions are also asking the government to launch a plan to help the
defence sector to diversify into civil activities.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Prison conditions attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINUED failure to improve conditions in jails was condemned by Judge
Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, in his annual report
published yesterday.
He highlighted overcrowding, lack of training for prison officers, lack of
investment, the concentration of prisoners' meals and recreation within the
short working day, the failure to end slopping out, and delays in dealing
with complaints.
Judge Tumim said: 'Many of the criticisms levelled in my report have been
made before and it is disappointing to find so little real improvement in
the quality of life for most prisoners.'
He added: 'The prison service is committed to programmes to provide all
prisoners with ready access to sanitation and to improve standards in prison
kitchens. This money is well spent but it does not address the problem of
the lack of facilities for out-of-cell activity in many establishments.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, accepted that prisoners should not have
to live in 'overcrowded and squalid conditions' but made no commitment to
deal with the specific issues raised by Judge Tumim.
He pointed to the prison building programme, which will provide 11,000 new
places by 1994 at a cost of Pounds 1.2bn.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Customs spending 'irregular'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY A quarter of the funds allocated to headquarters divisions of Customs
and Excise in a 'people money' scheme to improve the staff working
environment was spent outside the scope of the scheme, a report from the
National Audit Office disclosed yesterday.
From Pounds 305,000 spent in 1991-92 in 11 headquarters divisions, much was
'outside both the terms of the scheme and the ambit of the vote and was
therefore irregular', the NAO concludes.
That included money spent on personal stereos, clothing, contact lenses,
club subscriptions, meals, handbags, 'expensive pens' and personal
organisers. Items were supposed to require prior management approval.
The details come in the National Audit Office report on the 1991-92 revenue
accounts for HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, which was
released yesterday.
Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, said the results of
examinations of the accounts by his staff were 'satisfactory'.
The review of Inland Revenue accounts showed that one division will be
reviewing the accounts of 700 farmers involving suspected widespread cases
of tax evasion involving undeclared cash transactions and secret bank
accounts.
Other Customs and Excise difficulties identified include Pounds 394m of VAT
arrears more than a year old, of which Pounds 178m were more than two years
old in November 1991. Those figures were reduced to Pounds 341m and Pounds
116m respectively by June 1992. No information is available on how far the
reductions represent arrears as opposed to tax written-off.
The NAO says Customs appears to have underestimated the amount of training
and support required to help staff to convert from traditional methods of
control to a systems-based approach. Customs staff identified 652
irregularities totalling Pounds 1.4m on export refunds related to the Common
Agricultural Policy.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Way open for claims by civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may face thousands of compensation claims from civil servants
who were confronted with job loss or deterioration in pay and conditions
through compulsory competitive tendering (CCT).
Ms Olga Aikin of Aikin Driver Partnership, the employment law specialists,
told the Institute of Personnel Management's annual conference in Harrogate
that claims could be brought against the government for not complying with a
European Community directive that protects workers' jobs, pay and conditions
when they change employers.
Until now, the government has argued that the directive applies only to
workers in the private sector.
The NUCPS Civil Service union, which represents middle-ranking civil
servants, is to test a recent ruling of the European Court suggesting that
member states are liable for losses suffered by their nationals if they fail
to comply with directives.
The union believes that workers who would have retained their jobs,
public-sector pay and conditions, had private companies not won contracts,
can claim compensation, and that claims for unfair dismissal may be brought
by workers sacked several years ago.
It also says the three-month time limit for unfair dismissal claims would
run only from the date that the directive is fully enforced.
The government, after a separate ruling in the European Court, has accepted
that UK law does not fully comply with the 1977 directive - known as the
acquired rights directive - and an early amendment is expected.
Civil servants at the DVLA driver and licence records office voted to stage
a one-day strike today in protest at a threat to shed 3,000 jobs there.
A ballot of members of the CPSA, the biggest union at the Swansea centre,
was in favour of industrial action, although the smaller NUCPS union voted
against.
Hundreds of staff are expected to stay away from work to attend a rally in
Swansea, supported by local Labour MPs and union leaders.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Cash control criticised at Civil Service catering body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS FINANCIAL irregularities in the Civil Service catering group Forward
were criticised by the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog,
yesterday.
Sir John Bourn, the auditor general, has qualified the group's accounts
because of 'significant failures in financial control and management' which
may have led to the misappropriation of up to Pounds 200,000 from its Pounds
30m turnover.
Forward, with 1,300 employees, is by far the largest provider of catering to
government departments and public bodies. It was converted to a commercial
trading agency last year as a prelude to full privatisation, for which a
date has yet to be fixed.
The irregularities came to light this year, leading the Treasury to suspend
Mr Roy Wheeler, Forward's chief executive, in July.
Discrepancies at the Forward-run restaurant in Marsham Towers, London,
precipitated an investigation that found 'possible malpractice'.
Ernst and Young, the accountancy firm, was commissioned to examine Forward's
operations. Its report - which led to Mr Wheeler's suspension - concluded
that the caterers' financial control was seriously deficient, its management
ineffective, and its balance sheet inadequate and possibly manipulated.
Records were found to have been destroyed, with evidence of fictitious
employees included on the payroll.
Mr Barry Bloxham, Forward's acting chief executive, said the troubles were
being tackled 'urgently'. The organisation is still trading, although it now
faces stiff competition for its contracts, which are subject to competitive
tender.

A PHOTOGRAPH by the Russian Constructivist artist Alexander Rodchenko sold
for Pounds 115,500 at Christie's to a German collector yesterday.
It was a record price for any 20th-century photographic image. The print was
taken in 1934 and shows the photographer Evgeniia Lemberg holding a Leica
camera. It carried an estimate of up to Pounds 16,000. Rodchenko renounced
'easel painting' in 1921 and from 1924 concentrated on recording Soviet
society through the camera.
The other remarkable price in the auction was Pounds 74,800 for each of two
'Vortographs' - attempts to interpret Vorticist art and regarded as the
first abstract photographs. They are the work of Alvin Langdon Coburn, in
1917, and depict fractured light. They were estimated to fetch up to Pounds
18,000 each.
Christie's and Sotheby's have been holding important English silver sales in
New York this week.
Christie's set an auction record for 20th-century English silver when the
London dealer Hancocks paid Dollars 154,000 (Pounds 97,240) for 'Dream
Ship', a silver, silver-gilt and enamel nef, or ship model, by the
celebrated Omar Ramsden.
Ramsden created the ship, which depicts a 15th-century three-masted carrack,
in 1922, when it was bought by Henry Ford, whose estate sold it at Sotheby's
in 1951 for Dollars 625. Its estimate this week was about Dollars 50,000,
but the Columbus 500th voyage celebrations undoubtedly increased its appeal.
The top price at Sotheby's silver auction was Dollars 165,000 (Pounds
104,762) paid for a pair of George II silver-gilt salvers made in London in
1743 by David Willaume II.
Meanwhile in Hong Kong a Taiwanese dealer paid HKDollars 7.48m (Pounds
614,444) for a 'Grand View of the Blue Mountains' by Zhang Daqian, who died
in 1983. It was a record for a modern Chinese painting.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Pollution pledge at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE environment may have to take second place in the government's review of
energy policy, which has been prompted by the recent controversy about coal
pit closures.
Ministers admit that the UK's commitment to reducing harmful emissions,
which was signed by Mr John Major at the Rio summit only last June, is
incompatible with trying to save more of the coal industry.
In common with other EC countries, the UK has pledged to reduce its
emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000. That, though,
was based on the assumption that the power generation industry would
steadily switch from coal to gas.
If the review leads to a new emphasis on coal, environmental regulations
would require heavy investment in desulphurisation and other clean-up
equipment at power stations.
That would not reduce carbon emissions. The result is that coal-fired power
generation would have more costs heaped on it at a time when it needs to cut
costs to become more competitive.
The nuclear power industry, which will be included in the review, took steps
yesterday to highlight its environmental qualifications.
The British Nuclear Forum, which represents nuclear power operators and
suppliers, said the absence of emissions from nuclear power stations made it
a 'natural partner' for coal.
Professor Peter Jones, a consultant to the forum, said a mixture of coal and
nuclear power would leave more room for coal within the emission constraints
than a mix of coal and natural gas, both of which produce carbon dioxide.
The forum's campaign is designed to persuade ministers not to scale down
nuclear power in order to encourage market share for coal. Prof Jones said
the cost of generating electricity from nuclear's long-established stations
where costs had been written down was among the cheapest in the country.
If nuclear was replaced by either coal or gas, that would push up
electricity bills. It would also produce huge plant decommissioning costs
that would have to be absorbed either by the consumer or the taxpayer.
Nevertheless, the view at the Department of Trade and Industry, where the
review is being conducted, is that it will be difficult to save more than a
few collieries and coal jobs.
Although the government has several options for raising coal consumption,
many of them involve government intervention or have undesirable knock-on
effects in other sectors of the energy industry.
DTI sources emphasise that the review is being launched 'with an open mind',
but it will not lead to an increase in the coal market from the 40m tonnes
at present projected to the 60m needed to save large numbers of jobs.

LORD DONALDSON, the former master of the rolls, is to chair a new body that
will tackle legal uncertainties affecting the UK wholesale financial
markets.
The financial law panel will comprise up to 12 distinguished lawyers and
market practitioners.
It will help to resolve legal difficulties before they reach the courts;
review proposed legislation and regulations; and make proposals in the
wholesale financial markets, which encompass issues such as foreign exchange
dealings, derivatives and cross-border insolvency.
Formation of the panel is the main recommendation of the legal risk review
committee chaired by Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of National
Westminster Bank, which was set up by the Bank of England in April last
year.
The committee was established after the confusion over the legal position of
a number of developments in the financial markets including the
local-authority swaps case.
Lord Alexander said: 'We concluded that the underpinning of the wholesale
financial markets is basically sound. But it is important to minimise
uncertainty if the UK's standing as a pre-eminent international financial
centre is not to be jeopardised.'
The panel will have a chairman and a deputy chairman, up to 10 other
members, and a small secretariat. It will also be able to establish working
and advisory groups. Report of the legal risk review committee. LRRC, New

<TEXT>
LONDON Ambulance Service staff have gone back to using paper, telephones and
radios to co-ordinate ambulances after Monday's failure of the new computer
system.
Mr John Wilby, the service's chief executive, resigned on Wednesday after
ambulance staff claimed that up to 20 people died unnecessarily on Monday
because of delays caused by the computer system.
Officers of the National Union of Public Employees, the main union
representing ambulance service staff, say management had been warned
repeatedly that the system was faulty, but employees' objections were
overridden.
Mr Paul Webster, a Nupe branch secretary who works at the ambulance service
headquarters, said: 'We had been telling them for eight or nine months. We
had said all along that it didn't work.'
He blames the escalation of the troubles on a combination of management's
refusal to listen, inadequate training, and political pressure.
The computer system is still operating this week, but once the computer has
allocated a job to an ambulance crew, details are being printed out so that
control room staff can contact ambulance stations and crew directly by
telephone or radio.
'We are using the computer and the paper back-up system so that nothing can
be missed. Calls are not getting lost any more,' said Mr Webster.
Nupe is still not happy about using the 'part and part' system, which has
been in use since March. Mr Chris Humphreys, Nupe regional officer for
London, said: 'It is by no means a secure system. There is still a lot of
risk.'
Mr David Adamthwaite, an ambulance crew member and Nupe senior staff
co-ordinator, says the new system is 'fundamentally flawed'.
'Whatever system you apply, people have to have confidence in it. We want to
go back to the simple system, telephone and radio. Anybody can use it. Crews
have confidence in it.'

FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet to meet on spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET will meet on Monday afternoon for the first in an intensive
series of discussions to resolve the distribution of public spending for
1993-94, amid signs that ministers may find it hard to agree where the axe
should fall.
More than an hour of the extended cabinet meeting yesterday was spent
discussing the options put forward by EDX, the public-spending committee
chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, for keeping to the Pounds
244.5bn spending target.
Downing Street said no decisions had been taken in this preliminary
discussion, but cabinet ministers all reaffirmed the fundamental importance
of keeping tight control of public spending.
The decision to carry on discussing public expenditure at cabinet level
rather than referring matters back to EDX raises speculation that all the
choices on offer are politically unappetising. This route ensures that all
senior ministers are irrevocably signed up to unpopular judgments.
Signals about the pressure points came in the Commons yesterday afternoon,
as Mr John Major underlined the importance of capital projects in the
spending round. His reference to real-term reductions 'in many social
benefits' under the last Labour government was seen as a sign that social
security spending remains in the firing line.
In spite of the pressure on public-sector pay, some ministers are keen that
if there is the slightest room for manoeuvre then the pay review bodies for
groups such as teachers and nurses should still operate, even though they
would do so within a very tight margin on the pay bill.
Others still believe, however, that if there is to be a pay freeze, then
there is a severe disadvantage in having independent bodies advising that
such groups deserve 5 per cent or 7 per cent pay increases.
Yesterday's discussion represented the first formal occasion when spending
ministers have been able to compare the sacrifices they are being asked to
make in their departmental programmes with the casualties in other
departments.
Some ministers have already indicated that their readiness to see cuts in
their budgets will depend on the merits of the cause for which their
spending is being put under pressure.
The November 12 date for the Autumn Statement represents a tough deadline
for the end of the discussions. Announcements on local-government spending
and on the uprating of social security benefits are likely to follow early
in the next week.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots Tories in Rosyth yard row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Conservative party was embroiled in controversy yesterday after
a report that a senior party official had warned local Tories to be braced
for the announcement of the closure of the Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife.
Mr Mark Tennant, treasurer of the Scottish Conservatives, was quoted in the
Daily Record by Mr Mark Graveling, chairman of the Dunfermline West
constituency party, as saying that Tories had to be braced for a major
statement on the dockyard.
Closure of the yard, which employs 4,000 people, would make the final
closure earlier this year of British Steel's plant at Ravenscraig 'look like
a picnic'.
Nevertheless, Mr Tennant denied telling the party to be braced for a closure
announcement - although he confirmed making the comparison with Ravenscraig.
He said Mr Graveling had misinterpreted what he had said. He said he did not
think Rosyth would be closed.
The government should decide shortly whether work on servicing the new
Trident submarines should go to Rosyth, as originally intended, or to the
larger dockyard at Devonport. Whichever yard loses the Trident work would
probably have to close.
Lord Sanderson, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, denied that the
government was planning the closure of Rosyth, but he said he understood
that the Navy Board was recommending in favour of Devonport.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Dire effects of a failure to communicate: What caused the
London Ambulance Service computer system to crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTERISED control of ambulance despatch in London has a troubled history.
The computers at the heart of the current controversy replaced a first
attempt that never worked properly and led to legal action against the
principal supplier and sub-contractors to recover costs.
A computerised command and control system keeps track of staff, machines and
materials, making it easier for managers to deploy resources effectively.
In a typical ambulance despatch system of the kind used by Surrey, West
Yorkshire or Berkshire, telephone calls from the site of an emergency are
routed through the public network to ambulance headquarters, where an
operator at a personal computer takes details. A telephone number is enough
to place the incident and set the ambulance on its way.
Software experts yesterday agreed that a combination of computer
difficulties and staff tensions within LAS appeared the most obvious causes
of the London failure.
There are questions over the suitability of a tiny software house such as
Systems Options, with no record of success in ambulance systems, to act as
prime contractor in such a crucial contract. The company, whose managing
director is listed as Mr James Pedroza, and whose other directors are given
as Mr Julian and Ms Helen Stringer and Mr David Wolfe, is now about 20
strong. Mr Tony Lewis, membership director for the Computing Services
Association, the trade association for the UK leading computing services
companies, said brilliant software was often written by very small companies
but he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Systems Options.
Mr Geoffrey Westcott, a software specialist at LAS, who has responsibility
for ensuring the system meets its users requirements, yesterday defended the
decision to use Systems Options. He said no other company could have done
any better in developing a system to meet London's requirements.
Compared with the several hundred calls a day experienced by country
ambulance services, London received an average of 2,300 calls a day. Earlier
this week calls rose to a peak of 2,900.
Mr Westcott made clear, however, that tensions in the ambulance service were
not helping.
An example of the kind of problems the service is experiencing, which are
unrelated to software errors, involves 'exception messages' which are
flashed when part of the organisation fails to meet a particular deadline -
say an ambulance failing to acknowledge a command.
The result is that senior staff spend precious time dealing with the
exception messages while other tasks are neglected.
Critics of the London system point to examples of this kind as evidence that
the system is over-sophisticated and over-complicated, but say too little
effort has been put into persuading ambulance staff of its advantages.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
What should happen when a 999 call is made
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. A 999 call made from the scene of an emergency is routed through the
   public telephone network to ambulance headquarters, where a
   'receiver' at a personal computer takes the essential details and
   enters them into the system.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The information is transmitted over a local network to an 'allocator'
   also at a computer, who can despatch an ambulance using a map of the
   area showing the location of each emergency vehicle and its
   availiability. Ambulances radio their position to headquarters
   continuously &amp; automatically.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Ambulance crews receive either written instructions at a station or
   are alerted through an on-board computer. All activities are
   monitored &amp; timed; failure to follow an instruction generates
   warning messages at the centre.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Confusion over Danish treaty move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH ammunition for opponents of the Maastricht treaty came yesterday when
a Foreign Office official admitted that it was unclear what the implications
of accommodating Denmark's objections will be for the treaty's ratification
in other European Community countries.
Mr Michael Jay, a senior Foreign Office official responsible for European
Community policy, told the Commons foreign affairs committee that it was
uncertain what form any deal to help Denmark would take.
He went on: 'Until one is clear what the document that comes out at the end
of it will be, it is very hard to know what the implications will be for
other member states so far as ratification is concerned, or for us.'
Denmark released proposals on Tuesday for ending the deadlock resulting from
its rejection by referendum of Maastricht. The UK government has been
embarrassed by the leaking on Wednesday of a memorandum written by Mr Jay
which warned of 'difficult' negotiations ahead between Denmark and the 11
other EC countries over the plans.
Euro-sceptics and Labour believe ministers cannot claim that the way ahead
for Denmark is clearer and that the government's case for bringing
Maastricht back to the Commons next week has been undermined. Mr James Cran,
Tory MP for Beverley, asked: 'Why is parliament wasting its time on
something which is now hypothetical or at least conditional?'
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, challenged Mr John Major in the Commons over
'undertakings' he gave in September not to proceed with the Maastricht bill
until the terms for Danish ratification, and a clearer definition of
subsidiarity (the principle of decisions being taken at the lowest possible
level) were agreed.
Mr Smith said the Foreign Office document confirmed that the prime minister
'cannot possibly discharge the undertakings' before December's Edinburgh
summit.
The government says there is no question of the Maastricht treaty being
renegotiated. Denmark's identified areas of concern - on defence, internal
justice policy, economic and monetary union, and citizenship - could almost
certainly be resolved without fresh UK legislation, one Whitehall official
said.
In the unlikely event of a separate, free-standing treaty being needed, it
would not impinge on the contents of the Maastricht Bill to be considered by
MPs, he added.
The Commons foreign affairs committee has also been told by Mr Jeremy Lever
QC, a specialist in European law, that provisions in Maastricht on
subsidiarity may prove ineffective in areas such as employment and the
environment without stronger agreement on implementation.
Mr Jay sought to counter such fears with figures showing that the number of
legislative proposals from the European Commission has fallen from 162 in
1990 to 118 proposed during 1992, of which only 48 have actually been
brought forward.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Not too late for Major,' says
Tebbit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD TEBBIT last night stormed back into the thick of the European debate,
telling an audience of Young Conservatives that Mr John Major, the prime
minister, should not resign even if he loses next week's Commons vote on
Maastricht.
In a typically robust address, delivered in Mr Michael Heseltine's
constituency of Henley, the former Tory party chairman urged that
ratification of the treaty be postponed 'until the Danish people have spoken
in their referendum'.
Interviewed on Channel 4 News before his speech, he said ratifying the
treaty would require Britain to 'join the ERM or something so like it as to
be the ERM.'
As friends and advisers of Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, sought
to play down the significance of her meeting this week with a group of Tory
backbenchers, Lord Tebbit called for 'whatever concessions are made to
Denmark' to apply to Britain too.
'Let us demand exemptions from any obligations to re-enter the Extend
Recession Mechanism - the ERM - or to work to create a single currency,' he
said. He sought to compare sterling's withdrawal from the mechanism to 'the
Argentinian army's withdrawal from the Falklands'.
Describing home secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke as 'the real shadow chancellor',
Lord Tebbit denied that 'an honest examination' of Maastricht was a factor
in undermining 'the authority of the prime minister'.
The blame was attributable to three episodes: the Mellor affair; the
attempted defence of sterling; and presentation of coal policy. Even so, it
was 'not too late to save the prime minister and this government'.
Repeating his call for a referendum, he hit out at the refusal of ministers
to discuss Maastricht. Unlike Mr Major - who 'says (the treaty) will reverse
the trend towards a centralisation of power within the institutions of the
community' - he believed Maastricht 'takes us further along the road to a
European state'.
Meanwhile at Westminster, advisers to Lady Thatcher strongly denied that an
'ad hoc' meeting with about six Tory MPs marked the beginning of any
systematic new Maastricht offensive by the former prime minister.
'It is not part of any lobby or campaign,' said one of those present at the
gathering, saying it was arranged at the request of MPs. Lady Thatcher would
probably 'see other people' on an informal basis.
Another MP who attended said Lady Thatcher had expressed concern that the
views of the electorate were not being properly reflected in parliament.

There had been a material change in economic circumstances outside the UK,

Mr John Ward, Tory MP for Poole, urged him to agree that maintaining capital

FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Shadow cabinet run-off to be held
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUN-OFF for the vacant place on Labour's shadow cabinet will be held next
Wednesday, as just one vote separated the two front runners, Mr Ron Davies
and Mr George Robertson, in yesterday's first ballot.
Mr Davies, who polled 78 votes to Mr Robertson's 77, is favourite for the
post, having come closest of the contenders to winning a place on the shadow
cabinet team when the main elections were held in the summer. But the
political emphasis on Europe in recent weeks has boosted the profile of Mr
Robertson, the party's European affairs spokesman.
The other contenders were Mr Tony Banks, the opposition spokesman on London,
who won 34 votes, and Ms Clare Short, a member of the frontbench environment
team, who scored 27. They drop out of the next round, and their support is
thought likely to go to Mr Davies, as Mr Robertson - thought to be Mr John
Smith's preference - is the only candidate from the right of the party.
Mr Davies, Labour's agriculture spokesman, is no Euro-enthusiast, but is
unlikely to take Euro-scepticism to the lengths that led Mr Bryan Gould to
resign from the shadow cabinet, creating the vacancy. Although Mr Gould was
shadow heritage secretary, there is no guarantee that the newcomer will take
up that post, which is clearly being coveted by existing members of the
Labour's front bench.
Next week's result may turn on how far either of the remaining candidates
can mobilise their colleagues: 53 of Labour's 269 MPs did not bother to
vote.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots Tories in Rosyth yard row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Conservative party was embroiled in controversy yesterday after
a report that a senior party official had warned local Tories to be braced
for the announcement of the closure of the Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife.
Mr Mark Tennant, treasurer of the Scottish Conservatives, was quoted in the
Daily Record by Mr Mark Graveling, chairman of the Dunfermline West
constituency party, as saying that Tories had to be braced for a major
statement on the dockyard.
A closure of yard, which employs 4,000 people, would make the final closure
earlier this year of British Steel's plant at Ravenscraig 'look like a
picnic'.
Nevertheless, Mr Tennant denied telling the party to be braced for a closure
announcement - although he confirmed making the comparison with Ravenscraig.
He said Mr Graveling had misinterpreted what he had said. He said he did not
think Rosyth would be closed.
The government should decide shortly whether work on servicing the new
Trident submarines should go to Rosyth, as was originally intended, or to
the larger naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Whichever yard loses the
Trident work would probably have to close.
Lord Sanderson, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, denied that the
government was planning the closure of Rosyth, but he said he understood
that the Navy Board was recommending in favour of Devonport. The decision
was a matter for the government and for Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary.
Mr Graveling, whose constituency covers an area including Rosyth, had
complained that instead of fighting against the possibility of closure the
local Tories were being told to 'batten down the hatches and ride out the
storm'.

Bilateral talks between the participants and Sir Ninian Stephen, the

Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, have

Sir Patrick said he hoped there would be only an 'intermission' before talks

closed and said that a 'heads of agreement' was 'a practical possibility'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOMB attacks on Chile's electricity grid blacked out half the country on
Wednesday night, with much of Santiago, the capital, remaining without
electricity yesterday.
Police said the bombs had blown up three high-voltage pylons in southern
Chile. Explosive devices were also hurled against a police station and army
buildings in Santiago during the black-out. No one was injured.
A similar attack last week briefly cut power to the capital.
Police yesterday blamed the attacks on the Manuel Rodrguez Patriotic Front,
a small Marxist guerrilla group that refused to lay down its arms after
Chile's return to democracy in March 1990.
The group has been weakened by desertions and internal divisions, and has
seemed largely inactive for most of this year. Police suspect the attacks
were meant to draw attention to some 40 political prisoners in Chile. Six
guerrillas have been on hunger strike for a month in protest at their
prolonged captivity.
Chile's political prisoners are one of the unsolved legacies of General
Augusto Pinochet's 16-year dictatorship. Many have been in jail for years
awaiting trial, while others were convicted in military courts on the basis
of confessions extracted under torture.
President Patricio Aylwin has pardoned some 300 political prisoners since he
took office, but says he cannot free the remainder as they were involved in
crimes of violence.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council yesterday proposed that member states offer
peacekeeping troops to the world body for rapid deployment in international
emergencies, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
This was the first substantive response to detailed recommendations by Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, at the request of council
members at their summit session last January, presided over by Mr John
Major, UK prime minister.
Since then, various states have offered rapid deployment forces, including a
1,000-member elite contingent from France, while some other member countries
have continued to have reservations about the idea.
The number of peacekeepers around the world has increased from 11,000 to
50,000 in the past year alone, with the majority stationed in Cambodia and
the former Yugoslavia. But the UN currently recruits peacekeepers only after
authorisation by the Council and approval of the financing of such
operations by the UN General Assembly. That has led to lengthy delays in
their deployment, as in the case of Yugoslavia and Somalia.
In the statement which it adopted yesterday, the Council urged members to
inform Mr Boutros Ghali 'of their general willingness to provide forces or
capabilities to the UN for peacekeeping operations and the type of units or
capabilities that might be available at short notice.'
Stressing that the provision of stand-by troops should be voluntary, the
Council recommended members hold talks with the secretary-general so he
could determine what troops might be available for particular operations and
over what periods.
The council endorsed Mr Boutros Ghali's view that the UN needed more
military staff in its secretariat. He was urged to consider creating an
enhanced peacekeeping planning unit and an operations centre.
Member nations should also make available experienced military and civilian
staff for a fixed period to train personnel for peacekeeping operations.

FT  30 OCT 92 / The president crows, but the economic news is not all good:
The latest US statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months of gloomy economic news, President George Bush finally had
something to crow about this week: official figures indicating that the US
economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the third quarter, far
above the projections of most forecasters.
As Mr Bush correctly pointed out, this was the 'sixth straight quarter of
growth', following a brief nine-month contraction triggered by Saddam
Hussain's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
Is he right to complain that the US media are unfairly exaggerating US
economic weakness? Is a strong recovery finally under way?
The growth figures certainly should not be taken at face value. Few analysts
believe the Bush administration tried to massage the numbers, but most agree
that various special factors accounted for much of the increase. The advance
estimate of gross domestic product is based on incomplete data - only one
month in the case of some components of GDP  - and is often heavily revised.
The main driving force was consumer spending, which grew at an annual rate
of 3.4 per cent after a 0.1 per cent fall in the second quarter. This was
well in excess of growth of family incomes and reflected a sharp decline in
the savings ratio - from 5.3 per cent to 4.5 per cent. It thus does not look
sustainable, particularly in the light of extremely weak consumer confidence
figures this month.
Other anomalies included an increase in defence spending at an annual rate
of 7 per cent (which cannot be maintained, given the medium-term plans to
cut the military budget), a blip in business equipment spending, mainly on
computers, and optimistic assumptions about the September trade deficit.
Growth was also lifted by a rebuilding of corporate inventories at a pace
that may not be sustained this quarter.
Allowing for distortions, the economy probably grew at an underlying rate of
1.5 to 2 per cent in the third quarter, roughly in line with the average
growth over the past six quarters. The good news is that GDP has finally
surpassed its pre-recession peak; this means the National Bureau of Economic
Research should shortly be able to specify the month when the recession
officially 'ended'. The betting is that this will be April or May of last
year.
The bad news is that the recovery since then has been the slowest since the
second world war, with GDP expanding at about a third the average rate.
Confidence is down because employment has failed to recover in line with
output: about 1.5m fewer workers are employed in non-agricultural businesses
than before the recession began - a startling change after the rapid
employment growth of the 1980s. The official unemployment rate is 7.5 per
cent, substantially higher than when the economy stopped contracting last
spring.
The figures, moreover, confirm the popular impression that people are not
better off than when Mr Bush was elected four years ago. Real per capita
disposable incomes - the best guide to living standards - have been static
since 1989, a sharp contrast after growth of 16 per cent in the preceding
seven years.
Having made a sluggish recovery, where does the economy go from here? The
economic data are still hard to read. A modest revival of monetary growth,
fitful signs of life in the housing market and an erratic decline in weekly
claims for unemployment insurance are good omens. But they appear to be
offset by negative trends.
Industrial production has fallen in three of the last four months.
Employment fell in August and September. The Purchasing Managers' Index, a
guide to the health of manufacturing industry, has dipped below 50 per cent,
signalling contraction of factory output. Durable goods orders have fallen
in the latest three months. Retail sales have flattened out, car sales are
weak, and consumer confidence is close to historic lows, having declined for
four months running.
Most economists expect a poor fourth quarter; thereafter expectations differ
sharply. Mr David Levy, a forecaster at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute
in New York state, says the economy will slip back into outright recession
next year.
'We are looking for a contraction of GDP in the first half, possibly a quite
steep fall.' Mr Levy believes the economy was supported this year by a
modest fiscal stimulus, reflecting an extension of unemployment benefits and
Mr Bush's decision to reduce income tax withholding rates. The effects of
this stimulus, however, are fading while US exports are being hit by a
global economic slowdown.
Mr Levy's views may sound extreme but, last December, he was one of very few
economists to predict a troubled year for the economy in 1992. Mr Levy
believes the US is caught in a 'contained depression' that will last much of
the 1990s.
Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business analysis
group, takes a diametrically opposed position. She predicts a weak fourth
quarter but expects a sharp rebound next year.
'High operating rates and exceptionally low inventories and backlogs have
set the stage for a radical reorientation of the economy toward growth and
inflation, in response to tax cuts and spending increases after the
election.' However, Ms Fosler concedes that the US 'does not have the
investment base in place' to achieve sustained increases in living
standards.
Most forecasters occupy a middle ground. Mr Edward McKelvey, a senior
economist at Goldman Sachs, believes corporate restructuring in the face of
intense global competition will continue to sap consumer confidence and
restrain job growth. J P Morgan, the New York bank, takes a similar view.
Both of these blue chip forecasters are thus predicting sluggish growth at
least until the second half of next year.
Wags say the US is experiencing an economic form of purgatory. It has
emerged from the hell of recession, but its past sins seem to preclude an
early admission to the heaven of rapid, sustained growth.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Foreign groups fear tax assault by Democrats: New Congress
may tighten transfer price rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN companies with subsidiaries in the US are waiting anxiously for the
result of Tuesday's presidential election, expecting a new assault on their
US profits if Governor Bill Clinton wins.
Regardless of who wins, the next Congress is expected to try to raise more
revenue from foreign corporations by tightening the rules on the transfer
prices at which companies ship goods to their US subsidiaries.
But Governor Clinton has used the assumption that he can raise an extra
Dollars 45bn over four years from foreign companies as one of the
cornerstones of his Dollars 50bn a year investment plan.
Mr Clinton is not alone in eyeing this source of new revenue. Mr Ross Perot,
the independent candidate, has pencilled in Dollars 21.4bn of additional
revenue over the five years from 1994 to 1998 from tighter transfer pricing
rules.
Bashing foreign corporations is good politics, but the target may be more
tempting than realistic. Mr Harry Gutman, chief of staff of the non-partisan
congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, told a recent tax seminar in
Belgium that his committee does not consider the Clinton figure accurate.
Tax lawyers and accountants, as well as officials from the Internal Revenue
Service, agree that both Mr Perot's and Mr Clinton's estimates wildly exceed
any realistic expectation. Their forecasts range from Dollars 168m to a
maximum of Dollars 3bn a year.
If Mr Clinton is exaggerating the jackpot by between 10 and 50 times, as
these officials calculate, the basis of his budget plans starts to look very
shaky.
Complaints that foreign companies are abusing the transfer pricing rules to
evade US taxes have been based largely on studies showing that foreign
companies pay lower taxes, as a proportion of their sales, than US
companies.
Particularly galling to congressmen is the fact that around 72 per cent of
foreign businesses in the US do not pay any corporation tax.
The Organisation for International Investment (Ofii), a Washington-based
group of foreign companies, argues that taxes paid by foreign companies as a
proportion of net worth or of assets are as high as or higher than those
paid by US companies.
Even if the whole discrepancy were attributable to transfer pricing abuses,
IRS figures show that closing the tax gap would only provide an additional
Dollars 3bn a year - not the Dollars 9bn Governor Clinton expects in 1993.
A more aggressive approach towards taxing foreign companies is sitting on
the table in Congress in the shape of a draft bill floated as a discussion
document last summer by Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House
of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, and Mr Bill Gradison, the
senior Republican member of the committee.
That bill suggests arbitrarily taxing foreign companies on the basis of the
average profitability of US companies in their sector. This has drawn howls
of outrage from a number of European countries as well as from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the
Paris-based grouping of industrialised countries.
'The across-the-board, minimum profit approach of the Rostenkowski bill is
too much of a blunt instrument. It moves too far in sacrificing fairness for
simplicity,' argues Mr Carr Ferguson, a tax lawyer at the New York firm of
Davis, Polk and Wardwell.
Mr Clinton has not backed the Rostenkowski approach, which could invite
retaliation against US companies.

ONE POLL does not a US presidential election make, but it can certainly set
the cat among the pigeons.
The opinion polls were flying in all directions at 4.30 on Wednesday
afternoon, when CNN announced that its latest 'tracking' poll, conducted for
it and USA Today by the Gallup organisation, had Governor Bill Clinton
leading President George Bush by a mere two points (40:38), to all intents
and purposes a deadheat.
Not since early July had the president been so close to the Democratic
challenger. He seized on the news with joy, claiming the opposition could
now see victory 'slipping away.' Mr Clinton went on a television talk show
that night to question the changed methodology of this particular poll.
By yesterday morning, Mr Clinton could breathe a little more easily, while
conceding that the race was, as he expected, narrowing. A Washington Post
poll of likely voters, published yesterday, had him still up by 10 points,
with 44 per cent, to Mr Bush's 34 per cent and Mr Ross Perot's 19 per cent,
almost identical figures to those in a Los Angeles Times survey out on
Wednesday.
The NBC/Wall Street Journal survey put the score at 43:36:15 among likely
voters (but 44:33:17 among those registered). ABC's version had it 41:34:21.
Mr Clinton's own pollster estimated his lead at 7-9 points, and Mr Bush's
expert conceded a deficit of 4-7 points.
Both the polls and their takers agreed that Mr Perot's support seemed to
have peaked.
National polls may be misleading, since the election is determined by the
electoral college in which each state delegation awards all its votes to
whoever has carried that state (except for Maine and Nebraska, which
apportion their votes by Congressional district).
A total of 270 in the college is needed for victory.
Here Mr Clinton's edge remains very large, though with increased volatility
in the critical mid-western states. An NBC-TV estimate yesterday had the
Democratic incontestably leading in states with 245 college votes, with Mr
Bush sure of only about 140, including Texas and Florida. It concluded that
the president would have to win all but one of the 15 competitive states to
retain office.
The latest electoral scoreboard of state polls compiled yesterday by The
Hotline, a political newsletter, puts Mr Clinton ahead in 37 states with 392
votes, Mr Bush in 12 with 106, with ties in two states (Texas and Oklahoma)
worth 40 votes.
In 25 states, worth 274 votes, Mr Clinton's edge was outside the standard
polling margins of error, with Mr Bush only enjoying such comfort in two
states (South Carolina and Utah) with ten votes.
But, the newsletter noted, 32 of these state polls were taken a week or more
ago and therefore may lag behind the national tracking polls. This seems to
be reflected in Mr Perot's standing if, indeed, it is now on the wane. In 17
states he was accorded 20 per cent or more, up from only three a week ago,
and in two states (Idaho and Massachusetts) he had moved into second place.
All the national polls give Mr Clinton a bigger lead among registered voters
than among likely voters (six points in the controversial CNN survey). The
nub of Mr Clinton's criticism was that new screening methods had been
adopted by Gallup to identify 'likely' voters, which tilted the survey in
favour of older white males and against the young first-time voter and
working people.
Without these two categories, he conceded the race would be much closer.
But, he argued, citing independent surveys of increased registration, that
voter turn-out this year would reverse a 30-year decline in the US, mostly
because of greater participation by the young and the economically
disadvantaged.
Mr Frank Newport, Gallup's polling editor, disputed yesterday that its
methodology had been much changed and said that his organisation
historically switched from registered to likely voters for its 'tracking'
polls in the final days of a campaign. A tracking poll involves a rolling
sample of daily interviews, with results combined and released every day or
two. They tend, as Mr Newport acknowledged, to be liable to bigger swings.
This approach was contested by the NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters - one a
Republican, one a Democrat - who wrote: 'There is no accurate way to predict
whether people who voted in the past will vote this time, or whether people
who don't habitually vote will decide that this election is important and so
will turn out.'
The volatility of recent polls also reflects when they were taken and the
size of the sample.
Gallup's poll for CNN was taken on Monday and Tuesday, and covered 1,217
likely voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 per cent.
ABC's sample, also taken on the first two days of this week, was smaller at
898 with a 4 per cent margin of error. NBC/Wall Street Journal surveyed 576
likely voters on Tuesday and gives its findings a five-point variability.
All reflect some impact of the controversy surrounding Mr Perot's charges of
dirty tricks against the Bush campaign, levelled on Sunday. The Washington
Post and Los Angeles Times polls, taken with bigger samples on
Friday-Tuesday and Saturday-Monday respectively, were probably less
influenced by this new factor. Both carry 3 per cent margins of error.
Polls are, of course, a snapshot of opinion on the move - and opinion is
moving, for whatever reasons, in Mr Bush's direction. But, as Mr Newport
repeated yesterday, it would even now be 'unprecedented' for him to catch up
and win.
Precedent, of course, is not an infallible guide.

THE DEMOCRATIC Party is as much a part of the scenery as surfers and palm
trees in this Pacific outpost of US politics.
That the Democrats' presidential candidate, Mr Bill Clinton, will win in the
archipelago has long been reckoned a a virtual certainty, so much so that
neither he nor President George Bush has campaigned here. Indeed, no
presidential candidate has kissed Hawaii's babies since 1960, when
Vice-President Richard Nixon made the trip during the 50th state's first
national election. He lost the presidential race that year to John F.
Kennedy.
'If the Republicans are going to win Hawaii, well, they're going to win
anyway,' a Republican party official said. Hawaii has just four of the
nation's 538 electoral college votes, and the odds against those few votes
being decisive are long. The state has deviated from the Democrats only as
part of national landslides for incumbents: Nixon in 1972, Ronald Reagan in
1984.
Mr Clinton's wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea made a campaign stop in
August, en route to an island vacation. They were met, floral leis in hand
of course, by Governor John Waihee. He is rumoured to be on the Clinton list
of cabinet potentials.
Mrs Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice-President Dan Quayle, came in September,
but only to see the aftermath of Hurricane Iniki as an advisory board member
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She made no campaign
appearances.
All four members of the state's delegation in Congress are Democrats; none
of the three up for re-election faces a real challenge.
One ot the state's two US senators, Mr Daniel Inouye, is running for his
sixth six-year term. Allegations that he pressed his barber into bed with
him 17 years ago, and has sexually harassed her since, only seemed to
discredit state senator Rick Reed, the Republican challenger who publicised
the woman's story. She said she was tape-recorded secretly by a former Reed
campaigner. Mr Inouye denied the allegations, and local Republicans raced to
distance themselves from Mr Reed's advertisements.
However, the Republicans have not always been on the outside looking in.
Before statehood was achieved in 1959, they dominated what was a federal
territory with power inherited from missionaries and plantation owners. But
the legacy turned into a burden, as their party came to be perceived as
elitist. Plantation labourers, and their children and grandchildren now
working in hotels, have opted for their alternative.
Hawaii residents, along with many other Americans, are also looking for
change. The national recession has blown ill trade winds for the state's
biggest moneymaker, the Dollars 9.9bn tourism industry.
This year's count of visitors is expected to drop by 4-7 per cent from that
of last year, according to the Hawaii Visitors Bureau. The state, long a big
social spender, is fumbling with budget cuts. Its 1992-93 budget of Dollars
2.8bn was based on projected overall growth of 1.1 per cent, but that has
been sliced to 0.4 per cent.

UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals group, yesterday received approval from the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its Depo Provera drug as an
injectable contraception, nearly 15 years after the company first applied
for approval.
Although Depo Provera has been on the US market for many years as a
treatment for endometrial and kidney cancers, the FDA initially rejected its
application as a contraceptive after animal studies suggested it might be
linked to cancers of the breast, cervix and liver.
Further studies suggested that Depo Provera's link with cancer was minimal,
and the drug is already on sale as a contraceptive in about 60 other
countries. Analysts estimate the drug's US sales at Dollars 108m, while
revenues from non-US markets stand at about Dollars 74m.
Each injection of the synthetic hormone, similar to the natural hormone
progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months.
On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn had risen Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 1/8 at
mid-day yesterday.

<TEXT>
ISRAELI'S finance minister, Mr Abraham Shohat, has defied critics and
presented a budget to parliament which emphasises cutting the budget deficit
rather than public works spending to cut unemployment.
The 1993 budget proposes an increase in spending on infrastructure and
education, tax cuts and a fall in spending on public housing projects,
mainly in the occupied territories.
The Dollars 38.4bn budget is intended to reflect the reordering of national
priorities under the new Labour government.
The budget deficit is equivalent to 3.2 per cent of GDP, compared with 6.2
per cent in the 1992 budget proposal.
'I hope we have the wisdom and the strength to pass the budget without
increasing the deficit,' said Mr Shohat.
Several ministers and MPs have criticised the budget, saying it does not do
enough to cut unemployment.
They have argued for heavier spending on public works projects rather than
cutting the budget deficit.
As it appears now, unless job-creating measures are introduced, Mr Shohat
will not obtain a majority in parliament for the budget.
The budget comes up for a first reading next week, and it must be approved
by January 1, the start of the new budget year.
Unemployment, which has risen in each of the past six years, is running at
11 per cent.
According to treasury forecasts, this trend will be reversed in 1993, coming
down to 9 per cent by 1995.
The main cause of growing unemployment has been the huge increase in the
workforce because of immigration from the former Soviet Union.
The budget forecasts that inflation will stabilise at about 9 per cent next
year. In addition, it expects business activity will grow at 4 per cent,
less than in the previous two years, mainly because of the sharp cuts in
government spending on housing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE split in the largest faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party
(LDP) widened again yesterday when the faction's new chairman, Mr Keizo
Obuchi, excluded his opponents from executive positions.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister, was chosen as Mr Obuchi's
deputy and other loyalists were given senior positions, while their
opponents sought to garner members for a newly-formed 'policy-study group',
which remains within the faction, but which could become a new faction.
The LDP will be put to the test today at a special sitting of the Diet,
Japan's parliament, which must approve an emergency economic package.
It is likely to call a former prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, to give
evidence about his alleged dealings with gangsters.
Mr Takeshita is the patron of Mr Obuchi, and if the former prime minister
comes under extreme pressure, it could further destabilise the leading
faction and the LDP, which has been paralysed since the factional struggle
began two weeks ago.
The LDP has yet to settle a dispute with opposition parties over whether Mr
Takeshita will give evidence under oath, and these parties could delay the
passage of the emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) economic package to
revitalise the flagging economy if their demands for an oath-taking are not
met.
The parliamentary session could also serve to focus public attention on Mr
Takeshita, who has become the main target for criticism since the
resignation two weeks ago of Mr Shin Kanemaru, who had been leader of the
party's largest faction.
Mr Kanemaru had violated political funding laws and was also condemned for
his dealings with gangsters.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Malaysia hell-bent on maintaining rapid growth: The problems
of success for one of the world's fastest-expanding economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, launched what was
described as the single largest property development in the world - a new
city centre for Kuala Lumpur, with two 85-storey office towers as the main
feature.
The development, the initial phase of which will cost MDollars 3bn (Pounds
730m) in its initial phase, is seen by some as a symbol of Malaysia's
new-found economic confidence.
But to others it is a questionable prestige project - another sign that
Malaysia is bedazzled by its own economic success.
Today Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian finance minister, delivers his 1993
budget to parliament. Mr Anwar is in a position that most finance ministers
would envy: Malaysia has one of the world's fastest growing economies.
For a sixth year, the economy will grow by more than 8 per cent in 1992 -
government projections suggest 8.5 per cent for 1992 and 8 per cent for next
year. Though export growth has slowed as a result of the downturn in
Malaysia's main markets in Europe, the US and Japan, exports are still
likely to grow by nearly 11 per cent this year.
The country is industrialising fast. In the early 1970s more than 80 per
cent of exports were commodities - mainly rubber, tin and petroleum
products. In 1992 nearly 70 per cent of exports will be manufactured goods.
According to government projections, per capita GNP will rise 11 per cent
this year to MDollars 7,554. Unemployment problems of a few years ago have
given way to serious labour shortages.
Managing economic success is the main problem facing Mr Anwar.
The government says it has been restraining economic growth to prevent
overheating. But serious infrastructural and other strains are increasingly
evident, raising doubts about the government's growth management policies.
Kuala Lumpur's traffic jams are rapidly becoming as bad as those in Bangkok
or Manila. There are growing power shortages and supply disruptions.
A power failure in September blacked out most of peninsular Malaysia for
several hours.
A fire at Kuala Lumpur airport earlier this month disrupted air traffic for
more than two weeks.
'The government has been a bit cavalier in going for growth above everything
else,' said one economist. 'It refers to 'happy problems' of inflation and
labour shortages. But these are very real and have to be tackled
effectively. If not future growth will be threatened.'
Last year Mr Anwar, newly appointed and seen as the likely successor to Dr
Mahathir as prime minister, surprised many by delivering a mildly
expansionary budget.
Finance officials insist they have not been reckless but some government
projections have gone seriously awry.
At the beginning of last year the ministry of finance forecast a current
account deficit of MDollars 4bn for the year. By the end of 1991 the deficit
had reached MDollars 12bn.
The government now concedes that the current account deficit is of concern.
Various government measures taken in the second half of 1991 and early 1992
have resulted in a substantial drop in imports. However, a growing deficit
in services, which includes 'invisibles' such as substantial profit
repatriations by foreign companies, will result in a projected MDollars
7.9bn current account deficit this year.
Inflation is another problem. Earlier projections were for an inflation rate
of below 4 per cent this year.
Despite various monetary measures, including high interest rates which in
turn have driven up the value of the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, the
final inflation figure for the year is likely to be close to 5 per cent.
Sharp rises in food prices have hurt the poorer sections of the community
the most.
Malaysia's competitiveness as a manufacturing base could be eroded by both
further increases in the ringgit's value and wage rises. Wages in the
manufacturing sector rose 9.6 per cent in the first half of 1992 against 6
per cent a year earlier. In the public sector wages are rising by between 8
and 10 per cent this year.
While Malaysia continues to be a favourite destination for foreign
investors, the economic slowdown in much of the industrialised world has
caused a drop in inward investment.
Government officials predict a fall of 7 per cent in foreign investments
this year to MDollars 10.4bn.
A degree of belt tightening is likely in today's budget.
Some incentives for foreign investors might be withdrawn and a drop in
corporate tax rates is likely. Hints have been made that Mr Anwar may
announce the phased introduction of value added tax.
Cutbacks in some areas of government spending are likely to be announced but
the government is committed to an increase in development expenditure next
year - to MDollars 10.1bn from MDollars 8.6bn in 1992.
The range of projects being undertaken in the coming years is extremely
ambitious.
Between MDollars 8 and MDollars 12bn will be spent on a new international
airport outside Kuala Lumpur.
Malaysia Airlines, which is more than 50 per cent owned by the government,
is purchasing MDollars 10.6bn worth of new aircraft.
Infrastructural facilities are being built in preparation for the
Commonwealth Games, to be held in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. Plans are being
finalised for a second home-produced car manufacturing plant.
To meet projected economic growth targets - set at 7 per cent in each year
up to 2020 - there are plans to increase power supplies fourfold at an
estimated cost over the next 10 years of MDollars 40bn.
The government realises it cannot possibly bear the cost of all these
projects. Financial backing from the private sector, both domestic and
foreign, is vital.
In the past Malaysia has confounded those who accused it of running too
fast.
There is very little talk of any slowdown or notice being taken of the chill
economic winds blowing from elsewhere.
And the construction crews are already at work building those new symbols of
success in central Kuala Lumpur.

<TEXT>
ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK, the Australian-owned group involved in the Bombay stock
market scandal, has admitted its Indian subsidiary broke regulatory
guidelines.
But the bank's executives, appearing before a parliamentary committee
investigating the affair, said they had followed 'normal market practice' in
the fast-growing and loosely-supervised inter-bank securities market.
The Rs35bn (Pounds 800m) scandal, which erupted in April, has resulted in 15
arrests, the liquidation of two small Indian banks and heavy losses at other
financial institutions, including Standard Chartered Bank of the UK.
Grindlays was summoned by MPs probing the affair because it was active in
the securities market and because it had done business with Mr Harshad
Mehta, a leading Bombay stockbroker accused of fraud.
According to Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, the parliamentary committee chairman,
Grindlays executives admitted the bank had broken Reserve Bank of India
guidelines by engaging in forward trading in non-government securities when
such trades were permitted only in government bonds.
Mr Mirdha said Grindlays also admitted infringing regulations on the
investment of funds placed by clients in portfolio management schemes. These
rules said funds should be deposited for at least a year, there should be no
guaranteed return and a separate account for every client.
Mr Mirdha said the Grindlays team had admitted crediting cheques with a
value of Rs5.34bn to Mr Mehta's account even though they had been made
payable to Grindlays itself. Grindlays executives said the bank had acted in
accordance with 'oral instructions' from Mr Mehta. This, Grindlays said, had
been in line with market practice.
Most of the cheques were issued by the National Housing Bank, a central bank
subsidiary which suffered heavy losses in the scandal and is now demanding
the return of Rs5.06bn from Grindlays.
Grindlays, which claims it has not suffered any significant losses, has been
ordered by the central bank to repay National Housing Bank. Grindlays is
resisting and wants the dispute settled through arbitration.

FT  30 OCT 92 / UN chief accepts resignation of Somalia envoy

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday accepted the
resignation of his outspoken special envoy in Somalia, Mr Mohammad Sahnoun,
further complicating already difficult international peace-making efforts
there.
Mr Ismat Kittani, a retired official from Iraq, is the secretary-general's
nominee to replace Mr Sahnoun, diplomats disclosed last night following a
closed meeting of the Security Council.
A Kurd, Mr Kittani is a former president of the UN General Assembly who
served earlier in his long diplomatic career as chief of staff in the UN
Secretariat under Mr Kurt Waldheim.
Mr Sahnoun, a highly regarded former Algerian ambassador to Washington and
Paris, incurred the UN chief's displeasure for his critical remarks about
the alleged mishandling of the Somalia tragedy by the international
community.
In a recent television interview, he said the tardy UN response as Somali
children were dying by the thousands in a country racked by famine, anarchy
and civil war, should be the subject of a full-scale investigation.
UN relief officials protested at his remarks and Mr Boutros Ghali, who has
himself criticised the delays, was forced to reprimand his representative.
With the US, Britain and France, all admirers of Mr Sahnoun's political
skills, eager to defuse the row it had been hoped that he would withdraw his
resignation.
Mr Sahnoun confirmed his departure at a tearful news conference in Mogadishu
and left for Kenya after eight months as special representative.
Relief workers in Somalia mourned his departure and said he was a casualty
of the very bureaucracy he blamed for failing to save hundreds of thousands
of lives.
'It was no wish of mine to leave Somalia and all the wonderful people who
have given, and continue to give, at great risk to themselves, their time
and energy to save the lives of the starving populations of Somalia,' Mr
Sahnoun said on departure from Mogadishu.
He said he had vainly offered 'despite bitter experiences with the UN' to
stay on temporarily to help deployment of UN relief guards in Somalia and a
national reconciliation conference he was organising.
He said he would continue to work with private relief organisations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese labour ministry yesterday responded to Japan's deepening
industrial recession by offering financial help to 12 industries, including
electronics, which are suffering from overcapacity.
Subsidies will be used to encourage companies to make permanent cuts in
capacity by retraining workers and redeploying them. Up to 392,000 workers
will be covered by the scheme.
The subsidies, the cost of which is not known, can be awarded for up to a
year.
The subsidies are especially notable because they cover a range of suppliers
to Japan's most successful and internationally prominent manufacturing
industries, such as automobiles and electronics.
Those industries qualifying for subsidies from next month include makers of
printed circuit boards, condensers, resistors, connectors, switches,
magnetic heads, tuners, speaker and microphone parts and fuses. Also covered
are makers of a range of metal and wire manufacturing equipment for supply
to the automobile and electronics industries.
Companies in these industries are allowed to apply to the labour ministry
for subsidies of up to two-thirds of the salary of affected workers.
The ministry will allow subsidies when operations in a particular company
have been suspended, when workers are being retrained, or when workers are
redeployed.
Japan has a long history of using government subsidies to aid industrial
rationalisation, and has used subsidies to cut capacity in the shipbuilding
and steel industries. Japan's policies are often contrasted to Europe, where
subsidies have frequently been used to prop up ailing industries that have
become uneconomic.
Japan's willingness to use national resources to promote industrial change
is often cited as an underlying factor in the country's continued economic
success.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kim Woo-choong, chairman of South Korea's Daewoo business group,
yesterday abandoned plans to stand in December's presidential election.
The announcement came as a relief to Mr Kim Young-sam, candidate of the
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), who feared the Daewoo chairman's
candidacy could cost him the election.
Although the 56-year-old founder of the country's fourth biggest
conglomerate had little chance of being elected, his candidacy would have
reduced support for the DLP and possibly delivered the election to Mr Kim
Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party.
The withdrawal of Daewoo's Mr Kim, who indicated earlier this week that he
was interested in a presidential bid, may also be a fatal blow to a revolt
by dissatisfied DLP members against Mr Kim Young-sam, now the leading
candidate in the election.
The DLP dissidents last week formed the New Korea Party (NPK), but have had
difficulty in finding a credible presidential candidate. The Daewoo chairman
was considered one of the last available prominent figures to lead the
party.
Mr Kim Woo-choong said he decided not to enter the election because he
needed to concentrate on his business activities. But he may also have bowed
to pressure from President Roh Tae-woo, who publicly criticised Mr Kim's
planned election bid.
President Roh feared that the Daewoo chairman's entry would help swing the
election to Mr Kim Dae-jung.
Daewoo has enjoyed close ties with the Roh administration. Political
opponents have referred to the president as Roh Daewoo because of the
favouritism he has shown to the conglomerate.
Daewoo, for example, has been given special government support in developing
business contacts with North Korea.
There was concern that the government might try to stop Mr Kim's candidacy
by applying the same pressure to Daewoo that was meted out to Hyundai, the
nation's largest conglomerate, earlier this year when its chairman, Mr Chung
Ju-yung, decided to stand for president.
The government campaign against Hyundai, which ended in August without
forcing Mr Chung to abandon his campaign, involved state-sanctioned credit
squeezes and tax penalties.
Daewoo is believed to be less able to withstand credit restrictions than
Hyundai since debts among its 22 subsidiaries total Won7,000bn (Pounds 5bn).
Even if official retribution had not materialised, Daewoo would have been
weakened by the departure of Mr Kim, who has largely concentrated
decision-making in his hands throughout the group's 25-year history.
Investors reacted to Mr Kim's announcement yesterday by sending the share
prices of Daewoo companies climbing on the Seoul bourse.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Nissan to rationalise distribution in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second largest car maker, expects to make big savings on its
vehicle distribution operations in Europe by scrapping national distribution
centres. From next year, dealers in most continental European markets are to
receive their vehicles directly from one of two much larger distribution
centres, an existing facility in Amsterdam, or a new one being built in
Barcelona and due to begin operations next spring. A third may be added
later.
Under Nissan's traditional system, vehicles have been supplied from its main
import centre in Amsterdam to large compounds, some operated by independent
distributors, in each country, with each country's dealer network drawing on
this national 'pool'. By eliminating the compounds, Nissan expects to make
big inventory savings.
The new system is partly in operation in northern Europe, with dealers in
Germany, northern France, Switzerland and Holland supplied from Amsterdam.
Southern France will be supplied from Barcelona when the centre opens, with
Portugal and Greece brought into the system later.

ECUADOR plans to scrap foreign investment curbs and improve rules on

Pinto, industries minister, said the government wanted to give foreign
investors the same opportunities as national investors. Ecuador's economy
needed the new technologies they would bring.
Foreign ownership in nearly all areas of the economy would be allowed, and
state-owned industries be privatised. Foreign investors will no longer need

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Italy's tourist image loses shine - This
year's summer season was one of the worst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent sharp fall in the value of the lira should make Italy more
attractive to foreigners after one of the worst summer seasons on record.
But the country's travel agents warn the problems go well beyond an
overvalued currency.
Tourism is Italy's third biggest source of foreign income after machinery
and textiles and clothing. This summer's disappointing tourist receipts
could hardly have come at a worse time for an economy fighting off recession
and a severe deterioration in the balance of payments.
Earnings from foreigners help to compensate for the huge imports of energy
and raw materials needed to run the Italian economy, which is relatively
poor in natural resources. So the fall in tourist numbers has worsened a
steady deterioration in the balance of payments this year as a result of
declining export earnings caused by recession in many major markets.
In August, the latest month for which figures are available, the balance of
payments registered a deficit of L4,505bn, (Pounds 2.03bn), up from L906bn a
year earlier. The deficit for the first eight months of this year surged to
L29,064bn, against a surplus of L3,779bn in the same period in 1991.
Italy's foreign exchange reserves have fallen heavily as a result of lower
receipts and a costly campaign to defend the lira before its devaluation in
September.
Early data from Emilia Romagna, Italy's leading seaside resort region,
suggest visitors in the peak May-September holiday period fell by 8 per
cent. The overall drop hides a much sharper fall of at least 15 per cent in
visits by foreigners, who in 1991 made up 18 per cent of the region's 4.2m
visitors. Hopes that Italy's tourism industry might benefit from the switch
away from Yugoslavia because of the fighting there have proved ill-founded.
The fall in visitors is as marked in Florence, Venice and Rome as on the
Riviera. The Confcrescenti tourism organisation said the numbers visiting
Rome plunged by 30 per cent in the first two weeks of August, the peak
period, against the same period last year. Early returns for Venice suggest
a drop of 15 per cent.
Relatively high inflation, combined with limited scope for depreciation when
the lira was still in the exchange rate mechanism, lay at the heart of
Italy's pricing problem. As the country became more expensive for
foreigners, so local hotels and restaurants steadily lost ground against
Germany, Austria or Switzerland. Italy's hoteliers and travel agents blame
the overvalued lira as the main cause of this year's decline, but other
factors played a part. Recession in Germany, the main source of Italy's
tourists, was partly responsible. Popular German destinations such as Lake
Garda experienced uncommonly high vacancy rates.
Foreign perceptions of widespread crime in Italy have not helped. Tales of
stolen wallets abound, while Mafia murders and disclosures of corruption in
many cities have fuelled a general impression of lawlessness. Earlier this
month, Fiavet, Italy's travel agents' association, published a report
listing poor service, ageing hotels, bad manners and high prices as top
disincentives for foreigners visiting Italy.
Tourists complain about museums which are closed, or only open for limited
hours. A recent wave of public-sector strikes has not helped. Many visitors
object to paying stiff entrance fees to find half a famous venue off limits.
The lira's devaluation, now running at around 12 per cent against the
D-Mark, will mollify such feelings, but dealing with the problems which have
damaged Italy's image as a tourist paradise will take longer.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Russia bids for Pounds 2bn UK helicopter
order
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is bidding for the Pounds 2bn British Army attack helicopter
programme with its revolutionary Ka-50 aircraft. A preliminary bid has been
made to the UK defence ministry.
Group Vector, based in Geneva and Washington, and handling the bid by the
Russian manufacturer Kamov, is seeking a British prime contractor to lead
the bid.
Mr Steve Stylianoudis, Group Vector's UK president, told Jane's Defence
Weekly the company had approached GEC-Ferranti and Sikorsky. The Ka-50 was
cheap at Pounds 8m and '30 per cent cheaper to run than other competitors'.
The Ka-50, which has two sets of rotor blades, is expected to be powered by
Rolls-Royce/Turbomeca RTM 322 engines with sensors supplied by GEC-Ferranti.
The Apache AH-64, offered by Westland and McDonnell Douglas, is favoured by
the Army Air Corps to win the contract for 117 helicopters. The
Franco-German designed Tiger, offered by Eurocopter and British Aerospace,
is also strongly favoured. Other contenders are GEC Avionics, teamed with
Bell Helicopter Textron of the US, offering the Cobra Venom, and Boeing
Helicopters (the Comanche).

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Clinton cold on USAir stake for BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate in the US, has come
out against British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) investment
in USAir, arguing US airlines would get no reciprocal access to the UK
market if the deal were allowed.
This comes at a critical time for BA's controversial deal, now awaiting
approval by the US transportation department.
The transaction - opposed by American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta
Air Lines, the three biggest US carriers - hinges on the outcome of US-UK
talks on a new liberal aviation agreement between the two countries.
Signs yesterday indicated the UK was unlikely to agree to US demands for
immediate greater access for US carriers at London's Heathrow airport, in
exchange for US approval of the BA deal.
If the talks stay deadlocked, the BA-USAir deal is expected to collapse.
Supporters of the BA transaction in the US and UK yesterday warned this
risked severe consequences for the future of 'open skies', for jobs at
USAir, and for other foreign investments in financially-pressed US carriers.
The issue has been raised repeatedly in the last week, during the US
presidential campaign, coinciding with a new round of UK-US negotiations in
Washington to try to liberate air transport between the two countries.
In a TV debate with Mr Clinton and President George Bush last week, Mr Ross
Perot, the independent presidential candidate, fiercely criticised the
proposed BA acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir as 'terribly
destructive to the US airline industry'.
At the time, Mr Clinton avoided taking an outright position on the deal.
Later, though, he said he would not agree to it.
Mr Bush has said he cannot prejudge the issue until Mr Andrew Card,
transportation secretary, has made his decision.
'USAir workers are picketing me out here in the field when I land, wherever
there's any USAir. Standing next to them are the American Airline pickets,
all concerned about their jobs,' the president said earlier this week.
The big three US airlines remain highly critical of the package put forward
by British negotiators, arguing that the benefits to BA are immediate, while
those for the US carriers are promises that would come to fruition much
later.
The UK has proposed granting US carriers immediate open access to British
regional airports, but greater access at Heathrow would be phased in as long
as the US eased its current foreign ownership rules for US airlines.
The big three US airlines are opposed to any phasing-in of liberalisation.
They want immediate access at Heathrow and the necessary runway landing and
take-off slots to operate new services to and from London.
In addition, UK proposals for an elaborate disputes resolution mechanism are
viewed by the US airlines as a way to reimpose heavy government regulation.
US campaign officials thought it highly unlikely the Bush administration
would try to rush through a decision on such a sensitive deal before the
presidential election on Tuesday. If Mr Bush wins, he could press ahead; if
Mr Clinton wins, it is thought unlikely a lame-duck administration would try
to push the deal through before he took over on January 20.
The latter result would probably end the proposed BA-USAir transaction,
since BA is unlikely to extend the deadline for completion beyond December
24.

RUSSIA is bidding for the Pounds 2bn British Army attack helicopter
programme with its revolutionary Ka-50 aircraft, PA in London reports.
A widely-expected preliminary bid has been made to Britain's ministry of
defence. Group Vector, based in Geneva and Washington, which is handling the
bid by the Russian manufacturer Kamov, is seeking a British prime contractor
to lead the bid.
Mr Steve Stylianoudis, Group Vector's UK president, told Jane's Defence
Weekly the company had approached Edinburgh-based GEC-Ferranti and US
helicopter giant Sikorsky.
Cornerstone of the bid was that the Ka-50, which carries the Nato code-name
Hokum, was cheap at Pounds 8m, and 30 per cent cheaper to run than the other
competitors, he added.
It is expected the Ka-50, which has two sets of rotor blades placed above
each other, will be powered by Rolls-Royce/Turbomeca RTM 322 engines with
sensors supplied by GEC-Ferranti.
Mr Stylianoudis said the single-seat aircraft had distinct advantages for
the Army, such as its speed of 170 knots. However, there are concerns about
buying Russian equipment, given its poor reliability record and problems
with acquiring spares.
The Apache AH-64, offered by Westland and McDonnell Douglas, remains the
favourite with the Army Air Corps to win the contract for 117 helicopters. A
strong body of support exists for the Franco-German-designed Tiger, which is
being offered by Eurocopter and British Aerospace.
The other contenders are GEC Avionics, teamed with Bell Helicopter Textron

Ireland has been found to have violated human rights for banning two
pregnancy counselling clinics from providing information to women on how and
where to obtain abortions abroad, Tim Coone writes.
The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled yesterday that the
1988 ban, ordered by an Irish Supreme Court injunction, had violated a right
to receive and impart information, information which was in any case
available elsewhere from telephone directories or through contacts abroad.
The European Court awarded the two clinics a total of IPounds 194,000
(Pounds 208,000) in costs and damages.
Ireland has a constitutional ban on abortion dating back to 1983.

RUSSIA will require at least Dollars 22bn (Pounds 13.4bn) in official aid
next year to meet its balance of payment requirements, Mr Richard Erb,
deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said yesterday.
Even this huge figure assumed that the Russian government would
significantly tighten monetary and fiscal policies by the end of this year.
Mr Erb was speaking at a conference in Tokyo on assistance to 12 of the 15
states which were formerly part of the Soviet Union. The conference, which
concludes today, is the third and last in a series of multilateral meetings
that began in Washington in January.
Participants from the 70 nations at the conference expressed a strong desire
to move beyond the relatively ad hoc arrangements drawn up at the Washington
conference in which five working groups, covering food, medicine, energy,
shelter and technical assistance, co-ordinated aid to all the 12 republics.
The conference is today expected to endorse proposals aimed at giving the
World Bank responsibility for establishing consultative groups that will
help channel aid to individual countries.
Baroness Chalker, UK overseas development minister, addressing the
conference as president on behalf of the EC, said 'the pattern of World
Bank-chaired consultative groups provides one tried and tested method' of
aid.
While the aim of the conference was to establish structures through which to
channel long-term aid, there is also growing concern about shortages of
food, medicine, and housing this winter. Japan yesterday pledged Dollars
100m in new emergency aid, and the US said it would provide Dollars 260m in
grant food aid.
This coincided with a fresh warning in Moscow of imminent hyperinflation and
an announcement that millions of people would have to be evacuated from
Russia's Arctic north for lack of state subsidies to keep propping up
particularly inefficient enterprises there.

IRELAND faces the possibility of an imminent general election, following the
emergence of apparently irreconcilable differences between the leaders of
the two coalition parties in government.
Last Tuesday, Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, accused Mr Des
O'Malley, his industry minister and leader of the Progressive Democrat (PD)
party, the junior partner in the coalition, of being 'reckless,
irresponsible and dishonest' in giving evidence last June to a parliamentary
inquiry into the country's beef industry.
Mr Reynolds made the accusation during the inquiry, where he has been
defending his record as industry minister during 1987 and 1988, when he
authorised export insurance cover to a number of Irish companies for beef
exports to Iraq.
Mr O'Malley has not responded publicly to the accusation, but his party said
on Wednesday it had 'undermined the effectiveness of the government'.
Yesterday Ms Mary Harney, a PD deputy and a junior minister of state, said
shortly after speaking to Mr O'Malley: 'We cannot now pretend it is business
as usual and that everybody can go into a cabinet room as if nothing has
happened. That would be terribly dishonest and the government in those
circumstances just couldn't be effective.'
Under intense cross-examination yesterday by the counsel for Mr O'Malley at
the beef inquiry, Mr Reynolds stood by his allegation, although he had to be
pressed 10 times by the counsel and was finally instructed by the inquiry
chairman, Mr Justice Liam Hamilton, to 'just answer the question' to
identify exactly what part of Mr O'Malley's evidence he considered
dishonest.
Mr Reynolds said he considered a figure given by Mr O'Malley of a 'potential
liability' to the state of IPounds 170m (Pounds 182m), as a result of Mr
Reynolds' decisions in granting export insurance cover to Iraq, was
dishonest.
Relations between the two coalition partners have deteriorated sharply in
recent weeks, because of differences over the administration of industrial
development policy, and over the wording of an abortion referendum due in
December.
Neither party, however, wishes to be seen as the one which precipitates a
general election, so the political brinkmanship could continue for days or
weeks yet.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Baltic troop withdrawal suspended
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin signed an order yesterday suspending the withdrawal
of Russian troops from the Baltic states because of concern for the rights
of Russians living there, Itar-Tass news agency said, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
It said the pullout from the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania would resume only when agreements had been signed with all three
on its form and on the social rights of soldiers and their families.
'The president's decision is connected with his deep concern at numerous
violations of the rights of the Russian-speaking population in the above
states,' Tass said.
Mr Yeltsin's move was the strongest yet to counter what Moscow regards as
human rights infringements against the large Russian minorities,
particularly in Latvia and Estonia.
Tass said he instructed the Russian Foreign Ministry to draft an appeal to
the United Nations asking the world community to investigate human rights in
the Baltics.
Mr Yeltsin also ordered the Russian government to draft agreements with the
three states to safeguard 'social guarantees' for Russian soldiers on their
soil.
The Russian leader said Moscow would make economic agreements with the
Baltics dependent on observance of the soldiers' rights. All three rely
heavily on Russia for energy and other supplies.
Russia has reserved its heaviest recent criticism for Estonia, where
Russians and other minorities making up some 40 per cent of the population
were excluded from parliamentary and presidential elections last month
because they have no automatic right to Estonian citizenship.
Moscow formally protested to Estonia last week, warning that serious ethnic
conflict could erupt there.
The Russian Defence Ministry said last week the withdrawal of troops would
be temporarily suspended because of problems rehousing the soldiers in
Russia.
Russia's birth rate has fallen by 12 per cent this year, apparently due to
economic hardship and falling living standards, the National Statistics
Committee said yesterday.
With deaths outnumbering births in 41 of Russia's 77 regions, the country's
population fell by 72,000 in the first nine months of the year.

FT  30 OCT 92 / German inflation figures hit interest rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a quick and substantial cut in German interest rates receded
yesterday after the publication of consumer price inflation figures for
October which were worse than economists' expectations.
According to a provisional estimate made by the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden, annual consumer price inflation in October in the western part of
Germany was 3.8 per cent, an increase of 0.4 per cent from September.
Economists were expecting inflation of at most 3.6 per cent, the same as in
September.
The estimate, based on data from the states of Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg,
North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, defied expectations that the strengthening
of the D-Mark since the currency turbulence of last month would dampen
inflationary pressures. The D-Mark has appreciated by 8 per cent against
leading currencies since the beginning of the year.
The Bundesbank held its fortnightly council meeting yesterday and left its
key Lombard and discount rates unchanged, at 9.5 and 8.25 per cent
respectively.
Although the Bundesbank does not react to a single month's inflation
statistics, the increase means a cut in the internationally sensitive
Lombard rate and the key discount rate would be more difficult to justify,
however intense the pressure grows for further easing in the wake of
deteriorating economic conditions in Germany. This week, Germany's five
leading economic research institutes urged a rapid relaxation of rates and
said the west German economy was in a 'critical state'.
Recent speeches from influential members of the central bank's ruling
council have made clear that fighting inflation is the main objective of
monetary policy. The bank has taken pains to explain that it has reduced
interest rates sharply, in that money market rates have dropped by nearly a
full percentage point since early September.
The fall in money market rates - together with comments playing down the
importance of M3 monetary growth, traditionally one of the central bank's
most important anti-inflation targets - has led to expectations of
substantial rate cuts in coming months. But further cuts will be difficult,
if not impossible, to justify when prices are rising.
The inflation figure was driven up by inflation of 4 per cent in Hesse, by
3.6 per cent in North Rhine-Westphalia, 3.9 per cent in Bavaria and 3.3 per
cent in Baden-Wurttemberg.
The German government's budget deficit for 1993 seems certain to rise by
several billion D-Marks above the forecast DM38bn (Pounds 15.3bn), in spite
of strenuous efforts to find more savings, according to senior officials,
Quentin Peel writes from Bonn.
The partners in the coalition remain clearly divided about the extent to
which drastic cuts in spending must be found, and the extent to which the
deficit can be allowed to rise. The 1993 budget is for DM435.65bn, and the
DM38bn deficit is a slight reduction on this year's DM40bn.
Although all are talking of 'drastic and painful savings', there is no
consensus about where they should be made, or how great they should be.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself warned this week: 'There is a gap between
what we say and what we do.' While urging savings, he seemed to warn against
making excessive cuts in the biggest areas of state subsidies - agriculture,
coal mining and shipbuilding.

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has indicated that he would 'work seriously'
with the centrist Civic Union group, in a further apparent sign of his
willingness to moderate reforms before the forthcoming Congress of Peoples'
Deputies, at which an all-out attack on his government is planned.
Mr Arkady Volsky, the head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs,
which is closely associated with the Civic Union, and which has just
completed its programme to 'correct' the government's policies, said the
government and the Civic Union had been coming closer together in their
thinking.
At the same time, the National Salvation Front, the nationalist-communist
coalition which Mr Yeltsin banned earlier this week, decided to defy the
ban. Mr Ilya Konstantinov, a leader of the Front, said yesterday: 'This is
an anti-constitutional decree contrary to the legislation - we will not
recognise its legal force.'
Yet more ominously, Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Chernorikov, deputy chairman
of the Union of Officers, a nationalist grouping claiming 10,000 members,
said the group had appealed to officers to reconsider their loyalty to the
Russian authorities.
'The personal loyalty of the minister of defence to the president does not
mean that this corresponds to the interests of the country.'
According to Col Chernorikov, the army had received an order that all
weapons except those issued to guards must be locked up - an apparent
indication that the authorities feared an army revolt. Mr Yegor Gaidar,
acting prime minister, said when asked about the order that he knew nothing
of it, but would make inquiries of the Defence Ministry.
Mr Yeltsin said in an interview with the mass-circulation weekly Argumenty i
Facty that he would be 'tough with those who call for the overthrow of
constitutional power'.
But he dismissed those 'who shout a lot' as having no social base, saying
they could therefore not be called an opposition.
The Civic Union, however, could be called an opposition, but so far it had
only put up about a dozen slogans, which did not constitute a programme.
'When such a programme is unveiled, then we must work seriously with the
opposition,' he said.
One option apparently being considered by Mr Yeltsin is an agreement, tacit
or explicit, with the Civic Union - which would include some cabinet
changes, possibly even the removal of Mr Gaidar from his post as prime
minister.
However, Mr Gennady Burbulis, one of his closest aides, said in a separate
interview yesterday that things were becoming so unstable that presidential
rule 'must be considered'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Bonn budget deficit likely to soar past 1993 target

<TEXT>
THE German government's budget deficit for 1993 seems certain to rise by
several billion D-Marks above the forecast DM38bn (Pounds 15.3bn), in spite
of strenuous efforts to find more savings, according to senior officials.
The partners in the coalition remain clearly divided about the extent to
which drastic cuts in spending must be found, and the extent to which the
deficit can be allowed to rise. The 1993 budget is for DM435.65bn, and the
DM38bn deficit is a slight reduction on this year's DM40bn.
Although all are talking of 'drastic and painful savings', there is no
consensus about where they should be made, or how great they should be.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself warned on Wednesday that 'there is a gap
between what we say and what we do.' While urging savings, he seemed to warn
against making excessive cuts in the biggest areas of state subsidies -
agriculture, coal mining and shipbuilding.
Leaders of the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior coalition partner,
are calling for a savings package of at least DM10bn, and a regulation
enforcing across-the-board cuts to achieve it.
However Finance Ministry officials confirmed yesterday that Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister and leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union
(CSU), is only proposing cuts to pay for inevitable increased spending, and
not to take account of a certain drop in tax revenues.
'The savings package will be well below DM10bn,' one official said
yesterday. 'The reduced revenues caused by slower growth next year have yet
to be finally calculated, but they will be covered by an increase in the
deficit.'
Mr Kohl has warned that a 1 per cent drop in growth next year - already
forecast by the Economics Ministry - will cost DM10bn in lower revenues. Of
those, the central exchequer must bear the brunt of about half, the rest
reducing the income of the 16 federal states.
The Finance Ministry suggested yesterday that DM10bn would be the 'absolute
maximum' of any drop in revenues for the central government next year, which
would have to be added to the net borrowing requirement.
The forecast slowdown in growth in western Germany - now put by the
Economics Ministry at 1.0-1.5 per cent in 1993, and by the country's leading
economic institutes at only 0.5 per cent - is also a key factor behind the
increased spending pressure. Top political sources say the Federal Labour
Office alone, responsible for paying unemployment benefit, needs an extra
DM3bn.
On top of that, there are a series of urgent new measures planned for
boosting recovery in eastern Germany, due to be presented to the German
cabinet next week. They will also add several billion D-Marks on the
spending side.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mauno Koivisto yesterday said Finland would meet all its
obligations under the Maastricht treaty, including possible participation in
a common European defence force.
In contrast to Denmark's equivocations, including this week's demands for
opt-outs on a common currency and defence force, Mr Koivisto said Finns
intended to be 'honest members' of the European Community.
At the end of his trip to Brussels to talk about pending negotiations on
full EC membership, Mr Koivisto indirectly criticised Denmark for asking for
special treatment. 'It is not easy to say old members have more rights than
new members,' he said.
Mr Koivisto said yesterday that he expected negotiations on EC membership to
begin 'sometime next year'.
During a news conference, Mr Koivisto also hinted at Finnish interest in
joining Nato. He described talks with Mr Manfred Worner, Nato
secretary-general, as 'most interesting' and said Finland wanted to learn
more about the role of Nato and the West European Union (WEU) in Europe's
security.
However, the president stressed it was not 'timely' to discuss possible
Finnish membership of Nato.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Lamont holds out hopes of further interest rate cuts: Policy
making set to become more open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last night reinforced the government's new
commitment to growth and outlined a more open approach to policy making.
He also held out the prospect of further interest rate cuts. While he said
no risks would be taken with the long-term anti-inflation goal, the
government had 'no desire to see interest rates any higher than necessary'.
Mr John Major also promised, in a cryptic reference during his speech to the
Conservative 1922 committee last night, a 'package of measures' with next
month's Autumn Statement that would raise morale on the Tory backbenches.
While party officials refused to expand on Mr Major's words, his pledge
raised speculation that rate cuts might be imminent.
Mr Lamont used the traditional Mansion House speech - delivered last night
at Guildhall - to place capital spending programmes at the top of the
government's public expenditure priorities in 1993-94.
The chancellor also promised to take industry's interests into account as
part of a 'rebalancing' of policy 'to give greater weight to securing an
early resumption of growth'.
'We cannot press a button and see the economy spring to life,' he said. 'But
we can examine every development, every policy option, every idea and ask
ourselves - does this support industry? Will it help confidence? Will this
get the economy going? That is what we shall be doing in the weeks and
months ahead.'
Mr Lamont's speech marked a significant shift in Treasury rhetoric towards
the pro-growth policies outlined by Mr Major last week. But the chancellor
insisted the government had not 'gone soft on inflation' and reaffirmed its
target of keeping underlying inflation in a 1 to 4 per cent range during
this parliament.
The details of the government's spending plans and proposals to give the
private sector a bigger role in financing capital projects will be announced
in the Autumn Statement on November 12.
But, as one of a series of policy presentation reforms, Mr Lamont announced
that government accounts would be drawn up to make a 'proper distinction'
between current and capital transactions from the first unified Budget,
covering spending and revenue raising, in December 1993. This, he said,
would 'help to underpin the government's commitment to infrastructure
investment in the longer term'.
The chancellor's other steps to make the government's actions more
accountable and transparent followed the shift to more discretionary policy
making after Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.
In view of the Treasury's poor record of forecasting the economy, the
chancellor said he would set up an independent forecasting panel which would
help inform Treasury decisions.
He also said that in future:
The chancellor will publish a monthly monetary report following his regular
meetings with the governor of the Bank of England. Apart from 'certain
market-sensitive items' this would set out the information on which policy
judgments are based showing 'the bad news with the good'.
The Treasury will give reasons for interest rate changes after they are
made, as it did after the cut in base rates to 8 per cent on October 16.
The Bank will publish regular reports in its quarterly bulletin on how well
the government is meeting its inflation objective.
Mr Lamont made no changes to existing rules for funding the public sector
borrowing requirement. He disclosed that monetary policy will take
prospective rather than current inflation as its guide because monetary
changes take time to take effect.
He also made clear that the government would not ignore the sterling
exchange rate in judging policy following Britain's departure from the ERM.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, criticised Mr Lamont's speech for
containing no new measures to reverse the decline of the economy.
He said: 'Nothing less than a national recovery programme will be enough to
bring the economy successfully out of recession and to achieve sustainable
growth.' The plan should include an interest rate cut now, an emergency
employment programme, an effective industrial policy, and 'immediate
initiation of Europe-wide measures to expand the economy'.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Major bolsters support among Tory backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major significantly bolstered his support on the government's
backbenches last night by condemning internal Tory 'squabbling' over
Maastricht and issuing a powerful defence of his decision to press ahead
with ratification of the treaty.
In a plainly-put yet conciliatory performance that won compliments from all
sections of the party, Mr Major said he would not 'rat' on Britain's
commitment to its European partners to approve the accord.
However, it remains unclear whether the prime minister's personal appeal to
the loyalty of a packed meeting of the 1922 committee will prove enough to
ensure that Wednesday's vote can be won by the government.
Putting his integrity at the centre of the debate, Mr Major referred to the
continuing impasse in international trade talks as grounds for pushing on
with ratification.
'Why should we be able to tell France not to rat on Gatt, if we rat on
Maastricht?' he asked.
'Progress on the Maastricht bill is to build confidence in the economy and
strengthen the credibility and authority of Britain in Europe,' he said,
adding that it was not 'a glorious posture' for the UK to hide behind the
Danes.
His blunt call for the support of party rank and file was said by several
MPs to have re-established his leadership credentials and persuaded a number
of potential opponents in next Wednesday's crucial Maastricht debate to
swing behind him. Hardline Tory Euro-sceptics, however, said they would not
be budged by the appeal.
Mr Major said he would not try to 'ram' the Maastricht bill through the
Commons, stressed the need for party unity and insisted the government's
European policy was 'central' to achieving economic recovery.
Party backing was also vital to the government in tough negotiations to come
with Britain's European partners. 'There is an absolute necessity to remove
the uncertainty of the European issue,' he said. 'Let us put aside the
squabbling and get on with the discussing. We owe it to ourselves and we owe
it to millions.'
Mr Major also pledged that next month's Autumn Statement would include a
package of economic measures that would raise the morale of the Conservative
backbenches. He admitted to having learnt 'a salutary lesson' from the coal
debacle.
His speech came after the cabinet threw down the gauntlet to his
Conservative Euro-sceptic rebels by opting unanimously for a head-on
confrontation over the motion now set to be debated next week.
Earlier the anti-treaty faction claimed that some 60 backbenchers are ready
to defy the leadership and vote against the motion.
Before the meeting, Mr James Cran MP, an unofficial 'whip' for the
Euro-sceptics, warned: 'We are quietly confident that if the government is
not careful it is heading for defeat.'
Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, also returned to the fray, using a
speech to Henley Young Conservatives to call on the rebels to defeat the
government or force a postponement of ratification until after the Edinburgh
summit in December.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Smith New Court man tops economic forecasters survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S most accurate economic forecaster during the recession is Mr Paul
Turnbull, chief UK economist at stockbroker Smith New Court, according to a
Financial Times survey published today.
The Treasury only manages 19th place out of 41 forecasting groups in the
detailed FT analysis which measures the accuracy of growth projections
during the recession.
The FT's survey coincided with the announcement last night by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, that he is setting up a panel of independent
forecasters to help with official Treasury projections.
Invitations will go out shortly to people the Treasury would like on the
panel. The Treasury said last night it would look at the FT's survey with
interest.
The FT's assessment, which has taken in more than 3,000 individual
forecasts, is based on records of what individual economists said about the
economy on a monthly basis over the past three years.
It is the most comprehensive effort since the recession started to rank
economists according to accuracy of their growth projections.
While virtually all UK economists - including Mr Turnbull - have been
over-optimistic in their predictions, the Treasury's forecasting record is
significantly worse than that of other groups. Four of the top 10
forecasters are members of the 'Liverpool Six' group of monetarist
economists who warned early last year that the recession would be protracted
and that Britain might have to leave the European exchange rate mechanism.
Organisations at the bottom of the FT's list include City University
Business School, Nomura and Credit Suisse First Boston.
Mr Turnbull, 39, who has worked at Smith New Court since 1986, said
yesterday: 'It's no surprise I have come out top in the survey. My forecasts
have been bloody good.' His latest forecast for 1992 is that the economy
will contract by 1.1 per cent, followed by weak growth of 0.6 per cent next
year.
An outspoken monetarist, Mr Turnbull, said he was delighted Britain had left
the ERM and would like to see interest rates at 6 per cent to help a
recovery. He would also like the government to cut public spending and raise
taxes in next year's Budget to combat the deterioration in public sector
borrowing.
Of the 10 forecasters who have shown the greatest accuracy on growth
forecasts in the recession, five are leading monetarist economists who have
attacked government policies, in particular concerning ERM membership.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Tomkins joins battle for RHM with Pounds 935m bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GREG HUTCHINGS, the British conglomerate-builder who once said Lord
Hanson had taught him 'pretty much everything I know', yesterday trumped his
former mentor with a Pounds 935m takeover bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
UK milling, baking and grocery products group.
RHM, which already faces a hostile Pounds 790m offer from Hanson, the
Anglo-American industrial conglomerate, agreed to the counter-bid from
Tomkins, Mr Hutchings' company, and recommended that shareholders accept it.
Tomkins' move puts pressure on Hanson either to offer more or pull out. Lord
Hanson said he was 'very surprised' that RHM had refused to talk about
'whether we might be prepared to offer a greater value'.
He said he was 'astonished' that Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman and chief
executive of RHM, had said two weeks ago that a demerger of RHM was 'the
right path for us to take'. Mr Metcalfe was not commenting yesterday.
Tomkins, which makes Smith &amp; Wesson guns, Hayter lawnmowers and Murray
bicycles, had been looking at RHM for a year, Mr Hutchings said. He said
Tomkins' brand management skills would help RHM revitalise names such as
Mothers Pride bread and Bisto gravy.
Mr Hutchings, 45, spent three years working for Hanson as UK corporate
development director, before buying into Tomkins, then a tiny engineering
company, in 1983.
He said yesterday: 'We would not be bidding unless we had been there first.
That's not our style.' Of his 70-year-old former boss, Mr Hutchings said:
'Lord Hanson is far too experienced and shrewd to be anything other than
philosophical about it.'
Tomkins started buying RHM shares in May but bought only 14,000 shares in
1,000-share lots. Yesterday it was buying more shares in the market.
In mid-August, Mr Hutchings telephoned Mr Metcalfe and suggested talks. Mr
Metcalfe, who was about to go on holiday, arranged a meeting for September
16. At this meeting, Mr Hutchings put forward a bid proposal and Mr Metcalfe
invited him to present his ideas to a board meeting in mid-October.
Hanson's offer intervened on October 5, after which Mr Hutchings and Mr
Metcalfe met again, although talks on price did not start until later. It
was Mr Hutchings' turn to be surprised when RHM announced its demerger
proposal on October 16.
The purchase of RHM would represent a big jump in size for Tomkins, which
has a market value of Pounds 1.3bn. Tomkins is to raise Pounds 653m net of
expenses through a rights issue, and has net cash of Pounds 150m.
Although RHM's businesses are outside the usual scope of Tomkins activities,
Mr Hutchings said the offer was 'totally consistent with everything we've
done'.

DIGITAL Equipment, the struggling computer manufacturer, is to close two US
manufacturing operations with the loss of 670 jobs in its latest move to
reduce costs and stem losses.
Digital recently reported heavier than expected first-quarter losses of
Dollars 260.5m, following losses of Dollars 2.8bn for the fiscal year that
ended in June. Since 1989, Digital has cut 27,000 jobs.
The plants to be closed are in Springfield, Massachusetts, where Digital
assembles personal computers and Burlington, Vermont, a minicomputer systems
production site.
The plant closures are not expected to be the last for Digital. 'The
movement of computing power to semiconductors; the shift in demand to
high-volume, low-margin commodity products; and the decreased demand caused
by a soft worldwide economy has left Digital, and other companies in our
industry, with excess worldwide manufacturing capacity,' said Mr Edward
McDonough, vice-president for manufacturing and logisitics.
Digital has been restructuring its operations for the past three years to
reduce production capacity and eliminate redundancies.

A GROUP of US investors has bought 50 per cent of the shares in PWN,
Poland's leading academic publishing house, in the first privatisation in
the country's book publishing sector involving foreign capital.
The Luxembourg Cambridge Holding Group (LCHG) yesterday paid Dollars 1m for
its share in PWN, which reported a 12bn zloty (Dollars 803,000) net profit
last year and is expecting a net profit of more than 25bn zloty this year.
PWN's main source of income comes from sales of encyclopaedias and
dictionaries. It intends to move into school textbooks and medical

FT  30 OCT 92 / Colombia plagued by struggle for power: Why power cuts have
hit a country rich in energy resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBIA abounds in energy resources. It has oil, gas, coal and a large
choice of well-watered Andean valleys with hydro-electric potential. Its
8,600MW of electricity generating capacity should more than meet local
demand.
In spite of all this, power cuts averaging six hours a day have plagued the
country since April, knocking at least 1 per cent off economic growth this
year and damaging badly the government of President Cesar Gaviria.
Guerrilla attacks on power facilities, labour problems and a six-month
drought from last December all contributed to the electricity shortage. The
main cause howeverwas financial and administrative chaos in the electricity
companies.
A government-appointed commission concluded that 80 per cent of the
rationing could have been avoided with proper planning, information and
maintenance. Now, the sector faces radical restructuring.
Colombia is over-dependent on hydro-electric power. Thermal plants
contribute barely 22 per cent of the country's generating capacity, and at
the critical moment only about half of this was operable.
The government says that reservoirs were down to 54 per cent of capacity at
the start of the drought and the six regional electricity companies had
delayed bringing the thermal plants into service in an attempt to keep costs
down.
Things look unlikely to improve much soon. The reservoirs, now at an average
37 per cent of capacity, will start the dry season in December considerably
emptier than last year. The rainfall problem has been exacerbated by
deforestation and failure to manage the watersheds. Power rationing will
probably continue at least until April 1993.
Many of the sector's problems stem from the policies of the 1970s and early
1980s, when the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank were deeply
involved. The two banks loaned Dollars 3.6bn to the electricity companies
under government guarantee, equivalent to some 80 per cent of the capital
invested in expanding power supplies. Generating capacity quadrupled, the
number of subscribers tripled, and the sector's debt grew to more than
Dollars 5bn.
'The banks - they share responsibility for all this,' said Mr Rudolf Hommes,
the finance minister. Unusually, the World Bank agrees. The World Bank
evaluation, concluded in 1991, of its role in the Colombian power sector
found many faults.
It found a lack of vision and flexibility, inconsistencies between sectoral
policies and macro-economic policy, laxity on quality control and
performance standards. Furthermore, lending terms changed abruptly in the
late 1970s, so that capital repayments started before hydro-electric plants
came into operation. Exchange risks were never discussed and rapid currency
devaluation in the mid-1980s expanded the companies' debt burdens. The World
Bank and the government argued throughout over tariffs; the rates still
average out at 75 per cent of cost, with many residential users receiving 50
per cent subsidies.
The biggest embarrassment has been the ill-starred El Guavio project,
north-east of Bogota, five years overdue and absurdly over-budget at Dollars
2.5bn. The World Bank admits that when El Guavio was approved in 1981, the
wisdom of such big, expensive schemes should have been questioned. The
geological risks of tunnelling through the eastern Andean mountains were
also known - and proven during 10 years of construction.
If El Guavio had come on line as originally planned, rationing would not
have been necessary. As it is, the attorney-general's office is
investigating some 30 cases of negligence and irregularities in connection
with the project. Landslides, financial bottlenecks, land purchase problems,
contractual irregularities and bad management contributed to the delays.
After tortuous negotiations, the IADB has approved a Dollars 150m loan for
El Guavio and the national grid, a sum that will be matched by the
government, which will issue bonds to raise the funds. The government is
also taking over the debts of the bankrupt electricity companies and
recapitalising them. The aim is to give the companies more independence;
they could eventually bring in private investors.
The government's plans also include a programme to boost gas production and
distribution to homes. Residential consumption accounts for 50 per cent of
demand in Colombia, since electricity is widely used for cooking and
heating.
Mr Hommes also plans to reduce subsidies and make them transparent, and to
cut the high electricity losses. Twenty-one per cent of electricity is lost
or stolen, because of billing problems and piracy which follow from
inadequate distribution equipment and practices.
The emergency programme this year included repairs to thermal plants, the
construction of a link to Venezuela, speeding up El Guavio and bringing into
operation floating power-stations. Urra 1, a 340MW hydro scheme, near the
Caribbean coast, is also being built.
However, the programme is not going smoothly. The contract for the floating
power stations has been rescinded after the first barge, supposed to deliver
20MW, generated only a fraction of this after weeks of delay. Meanwhile,
electrical engineers are warning that El Guavio will not start up until
mid-1993, behind even its most recent schedule.
For the longer-term, the National Social and Economic Council, the
government's policy making body, has approved a new 2,500MW expansion plan,
and legislation to restructure the electricity sector is going through
congress.
The expansion plan, with an estimated Dollars 2.7bn cost, raises the share
of thermal power to 30 per cent, outlines many smaller, more flexible
projects, and stresses distribution, neglected in the past. The multilateral
banks are expected to resume lending to Colombia for some of these schemes.
However, financing the expansion plan is proving difficult and there could
be rationing again in 1995 and 2002 if the projects fall behind. On top of
that, the measures only partly address the long-standing lack of a coherent
energy framework with clear objectives.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL divisions in the usually fractious Italian parliament were blurred
yesterday as members united in anger against a judiciary they accused of
violating their rights in a series of corruption investigations, Reuter
reports from Rome.
The row pitting parliament against Italy's increasingly inquisitive judges
came to a head after Health Minister Francesco de Lorenzo said police had
tried to seize his personal archives, ignoring his immunity from
prosecution.
'We are living in a pre-coup climate,' said Mr Domenico Susi, a Socialist MP
who yesterday also denounced a judge's decision to impound his private
office. MPs from all parties condemned the two incidents, saying democracy
was in danger.
'The balance of power between the various branches of government is being
upset. Whenever this happens, we usually are on the eve of some of the least
glorious pages of our history,' said the Christian Democrats' chief whip, Mr
Gerardo Bianco.
The MPs were finally seeing their chance to hit back at the judges, who have
launched investigations hitting every sector of the political establishment
since the new parliament was elected last April.
'There is a climate of intimidation undermining the rights of MPs without
which this country is no longer a democracy,' said Mr Giusy La Ganga,
Socialist chief whip, urging the government to act against the judges.
Only since the April elections upset Italy's political balance have the
judges been spurred into action.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Bonn budget deficit soaring above target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government's budget deficit for 1993 seems certain to rise by
several billion D-Marks above the forecast DM38bn (Pounds 15.3bn), in spite
of strenuous efforts to find more savings, according to senior officials.
The partners in the coalition remain clearly divided about the extent to
which drastic cuts in spending must be found, and the extent to which the
deficit can be allowed to rise. The 1993 budget is for DM435.65bn, and the
DM38bn deficit is a slight reduction on this year's DM40bn.
Although all are talking of 'drastic and painful savings', there is no
consensus about where they should be made, or how great they should be.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself warned on Wednesday that 'there is a gap
between what we say and what we do.' While urging savings, he seemed to warn
against making excessive cuts in the biggest areas of state subsidies -
agriculture, coal mining and shipbuilding.
Leaders of the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior coalition partner,
are calling for a savings package of at least DM10bn, and a regulation
enforcing across-the-board cuts to achieve it.
However Finance Ministry officials confirmed yesterday that Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister and leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union
(CSU), is only proposing cuts to pay for inevitable increased spending, and
not to take account of a certain drop in tax revenues.
'The savings package will be well below DM10bn,' one official said
yesterday. 'The reduced revenues caused by slower growth next year have yet
to be finally calculated, but they will be covered by an increase in the
deficit.'
Mr Kohl has warned that a 1 per cent drop in growth next year - already
forecast by the Economics Ministry - will cost DM10bn in lower revenues. Of
those, the central exchequer must bear the brunt of about half, the rest
reducing the income of the 16 states.
The Finance Ministry suggested yesterday that DM10bn would be the 'absolute
maximum' of any drop in revenues for the central government next year, which
would have to be added to the net borrowing requirement.
The forecast slowdown in growth in western Germany - now put by the
Economics Ministry at 1.0-1.5 per cent in 1993, and by the country's leading
economic institutes at only 0.5 per cent - is also a key factor behind the
increased spending pressure. Top political sources say the Federal Labour
Office alone, responsible for paying unemployment benefit, needs an extra
DM3bn.
On top of that, there are a series of urgent new measures planned for
boosting recovery in eastern Germany, due to be presented to the German
cabinet next week. They will also add several billion D-Marks on the
spending side.

DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, said yesterday it is planning a
major restructuring of its textile organisation.
However, the Wilmington-based group failed to provide any details except to
announce a handful of mid-level management changes and to say that the
restructuring plan reflected 'the increasing size, scope and market focus of
the company's global textile business'.
A statement from Du Pont said that Mr Paul Gillease, head of the group's
textiles business, would move to Europe in order to take charge of
integrating the nylon fibre businesses of Du Pont and of Britain's Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI).
Du Pont recently received European Commission approv-al to go ahead with the
planned swap of its acrylics business for ICI's European nylons activities.
It is now waiting for US approval.
Du Pont's fibres division made Dollars 166m of after-tax operating income in
the third quarter of 1992, against Dollars 150m a year ago.

FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: UAL blames summer fare wars for
14% decline
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UAL, parent of United Airlines and one of the three biggest US carriers,
yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent decline in third-quarter net income.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, described the results as 'exceptionally poor for
what is traditionally the strongest quarter in the airline industry'.
For the three months to September 30, UAL had net earnings of Dollars 21.5m,
or 89 cents a share, against earnings of Dollars 25m, or Dollars 1.05 a year
earlier.
United's weak third-quarter earnings follow particularly poor third-quarter
performances from the other two US mega-carriers. AMR, parent of American
Airlines, posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 85m, its worst results for a
July-September period, and Delta reported a net deficit of Dollars 106.7m.
The fares wars over the summer hurt United's yields - passenger revenue per
mile flown - in spite of an increased load factor. System revenue passenger
yield fell 6.3 per cent in the quarter to 11.26 cents, while United's load
factor rose 4.1 per cent to 76.1 per cent.
Looking to the fourth quarter, Mr Wolf said: 'We are concerned with booking
levels, particularly in our Pacific division, where soft demand reflects
current Japanese economic conditions.'
In addition, UAL's yields remain under pressure, although Mr Wolf expects
them to firm considerably from their low, third-quarter levels.
At the operating level, UAL saw income advance 16.4 per cent to Dollars 68m
from Dollars 58m, while operating revenues rose 10.5 per cent to Dollars
3.24bn from Dollars 3.58bn. Operating costs were 10.4 per cent higher at
Dollars 3.51bn.
America West Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, posted a third-quarter
operating loss of Dollars 17.2m and said its results were hit hard by the
industry-wide summer discounts.
During the quarter, the company took restructuring charges of Dollars 31.3m
and incurred reorganisation expenses of Dollars 8.5m. A year earlier,
America West had reorganising charges of Dollars 43.4m.
Including these items, net loss narrowed to Dollars 70.8m, or Dollars 2.97,
from Dollars 85.2m, or Dollars 3.77, in the 1991 quarter.
Mr Michael Conway, chief executive, said passenger yields started to improve
in September and 'upcoming holiday bookings are strong. Accordingly, we are
anticipating a return to positive cash flow from our operations in the
fourth quarter'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes about 30 manufacturing operations to transform graphite, wood, glue
and paint into pencils. But where wood is in short supply, polymer pencils
could be an attractive alternative.
That is the view of Krupp Bellaform, a German manufacturer of extrusion
lines, which has developed a process for the continuous production of
pencils made of graphite, polymer compound and paint.
About 7,000 pencils 168mm long and 7.5mm in diameter can be produced an hour
using the new process - which is simpler than that for wood pencils -
leading to reduced production costs.
But it also opens up lucrative market opportunities, says Krupp, because the
polymer casing can be formed into all manner of shapes - grooved, serrated,
heart-shaped. Krupp Bellaform: Germany, 06132 7880.

MR BRANDON TARTIKOFF, a former senior executive at the NBC television
network who left NBC 16 months ago to become chairman of Paramount Pictures
in Hollywood, resigned from Paramount yesterday citing family obligations.
The 43-year-old Mr Tartikoff said he was leaving Paramount to spend more
time with his daughter, who was seriously injured in a car accident last
year and is undergoing therapy in New Orleans.
Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount Communications, the parent company
that also owns publishers Simon and Schuster, accepted the resignation after
saying he understood this 'had to be an extremely difficult decision for
Brandon to make'.
Mr Davis said he was naming Mr Stanley Jaffe, Paramount's chief operating
officer, as acting chairman of Paramount Pictures on an interim basis.
Although there have been rumours in Hollywood of friction between Mr
Tartikoff and Messrs Davis and Jaffe, Paramount yesterday heaped praise on
the departing studio head. The financial performance of the studio, which Mr
Tartikoff had worked to improve, has been considered lacklustre in recent
years.
Paramount's entertainment division has improved its earnings in recent
quarters, thanks to the box office success of films that Mr Tartikoff
oversaw such as The Addams Family and Star Trek VI.
For his part, Mr Tartikoff told senior executives at Paramount that he
needed to be out of Los Angeles for protracted periods to assist his wife in
New Orleans 'in this critical stage of my daughter's ongoing rehabilitation
from her head injury'.
Meanwhile, Paramount's parent company has been rumoured to be interested in
making a bid to acquire NBC Television, which is owned by General Electric.
Earlier this week it emerged that Mr Bill Cosby, the popular television
comedian who is friendly with Paramount's chairman, is keen to acquire NBC.

<TEXT>
MR MASATOSHI Ito, president of Ito-Yokado, the leading Japanese supermarket
retailer which controls Southland of the US, resigned yesterday in an
attempt to end a widening scandal involving illegal cash payments to
gangsters.
Ito-Yokado, hailed as a fast-growing retailer which rewarded investors with
high dividend payout ratios, had previously denied links with gangster, but
Mr Ito, the group's founder, yesterday announced his resignation, accepting
responsibility.
Ito-Yokado has looked for international expansion, and took a controlling
stake in Southland, the Dallas-based convenience store chain.
The resignation follows the arrest of three company officials last week for
breaking the commercial code by allegedly paying more than Y20m (Dollars
163,000) to gangsters to ensure order at the company's annual shareholders'
meeting last May. At the press conference, Mr Ito denied reports alleging
payments were made through a bank account belonging to his wife.
In Japan, disrupting shareholders' meetings is seen by gangsters as an easy
source of income with some companies paying them off in advance.
The resignation has also caused embarrassment for the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
which last month made an award to Ito-Yokado for increasing payouts to
individual investors. The company has raised its dividend for the past 10
consecutive years. Yesterday the exchange said it would not retract its
decision, but added the company would not be eligible for the award next
year.
His successor is Mr Toshifumi Suzuki, the 59-year-old vice-president and
president of Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain affiliated with
Ito-Yokado. Mr Ito will leave his posts as chairman at Seven-Eleven and
Denny's Japan, the restaurant unit.

<TEXT>
LA Generale des Eaux, France's largest water distribution and public
services group, managed to buck the sluggish trend in French industry during
the first half of the year by increasing net profits by 9.7 per cent to
FFr1.1bn (Dollars 211m) from FFr1bn.
The group, which said it was on course for further profits growth for the
full financial year, also confirmed plans to participate in the
recapitalisation of Lucia, a property company in which it is a 10 per cent
shareholder and which is linked to the interests of Mr Christian Pellerin,
the controversial French property developer.
La Generale plans to invest FFr150m in Lucia's recapital-isation.
Lucia has incurred heavy losses and has also been clouded by the controversy
over the BP Tower development in Paris because of its association with
Olipar, a Pellerin concern.
Despite its difficulties in the property sector industry, La Generale
increased interim turnover by 14 per cent from FFr62bn to FFr70bn and
operating profits from FFr1.9bn to FFr2.5bn.
The public works division saw turnover rise to FFr20.8bn from FFr19bn,
mainly because of growth in its foreign activities.
The group said it benefited from strong performances from its water, energy
and health care divisions.
However, it said that its property interests had suffered from the problems
of both the residential and commercial sectors.
La Generale said it anticipated net profits of FFr2.9bn for the full
financial year, which would represent an 11.5 per cent advance on the
FFr2.6bn it made in 1991.
The group also forecast a rise in turnover from FFr134.9bn in 1991 to
FFr144bn in 1992, on current exchange rates.
France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications group, yesterday
said it expected to make net profits of FFr3bn this year.
The group earlier revised its reported profit for 1991 from the original
figure of FFr1.3bn to FFr2.05bn because of a change in accounting
techniques.

Less than six months after being appointed managing director of Northern
Engineering Industries (NEI), part of Rolls-Royce, Richard Maudslay has been
promoted again.
From November 1, he will be managing director of Rolls-Royce Industrial
Power Group, reporting to the man he succeeds - Terry Harrison, the
newly-appointed chief executive of Rolls-Royce.
Maudslay, a 45-year-old engineer, began his career in 1969 with NEI Peebles
in Edinburgh. This May, after seven years as md of NEI Parsons, he was named
md at NEI.
His responsibilities will now include NEI, along with the Industrial Power
Group's three other main businesses, R-R Industrial &amp; Marine Gas Turbines,
R-R Nuclear Engineering and R-R Industries Canada. He also joins the
Rolls-Royce corporate executive committee.
Maudslay's move brings two further appointments. His successor as md at NEI
will be Andrew Perkins, md of R-R Nuclear Engineering since early 1992.
Perkins in turn is succeeded by Tony Roulstone, currently general manager
for performance and engineering systems at R-R Aerospace Group.

SIR Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, replied yesterday to
airlines that criticised British Airways' agreement to rescue Dan-Air, the
severely troubled British carrier.
He said Dan-Air would have folded completely by the end of last week had
British Airways not stepped in. Every other rescue plan for the airline had
been exhausted and there were no other interested buyers or investors.
The rescue has been bitterly attacked as anti-competitive by rivals such as
Virgin Atlantic and British Midland.
Virgin Atlantic, owned by Mr Richard Branson, abandoned its own attempt to
take over Dan-Air 10 days before British Airways finalised its deal.
Sir Colin said: 'It is interesting to note that the level of complaint
against our move appears to be in direct proportion to the amount of
disinterest shown in saving Dan-Air routes, aircraft and people by those who
attack us.'
Sir Colin, speaking at the international forum of the Scottish Council
Development and Industry at Gleneagles, Tayside, also attacked American,
Delta and United Airlines of the US for 'conspiring against' British
Airways' proposed acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in USAir, the
fourth-largest US carrier.
Britain wants the US authorities to accept BA's investment in USAir as part
of a scheme under which capacity and pricing constraints on transatlantic
services between Britain and the US would be sharply relaxed.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Broking firm fined under capital rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLLIFF and Partners, a stockbroking firm specialising in investment trusts,
and its directors have been fined a total of Pounds 46,000 by regulators for
disguising the fact that it did not have enough capital last November to
meet minimum regulatory standards.
It is the first time that any City firm has been reprimanded over its
declaration regarding capital adequacy.
The firm, which was recapitalised last May, has been 'severely reprimanded'
by the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body for
stockbrokers.
Under the new name of Scaleoption Plc, the firm has been ordered to pay
Pounds 25,000 to the SFA, while three of its directors have been fined
Pounds 7,000 each.
Of the three directors, Mr William Cole, finance director, has left the
firm. The other two, Mr Barry Olliff, managing director and Mr John Howson,
remain. Another executive director, Mr Peter Jones, former head of
institutional sales, has been reprimanded but not fined for failing to
inform regulators about the situation after he became aware of it.
With the recapitalisation a new company called Olliff and Partners has
become the owner of Scaleoption and it is continuing to trade under that
name.
Mr Rodney Yates, chief executive, declined to give details about the affair,
except to say that the firm had voluntarily reported the matter to
regulators and that clients' funds had not been put at risk.
He declined to give details of the recapitalisation except to say that
clients were made aware of it and that the firm now has enough capital to
meet regulatory requirements.
Market sources said the firm's financial difficulties stemmed from two
public offerings of investment trusts in November 1991 which Olliff was
unable to place with investors.
One of the issues was for Sphere Investment Trust and Olliff was said to
have been left with as much as 80 per cent of securities.
In both issues the firm carried the securities on its books at sale price
and failed to reflect the far lower market value in filings to the SFA.
Had the market value been accurately reflected regulators would have quickly
become aware that the firm had a capital shortfall and could have forced it
to stop trading.
The SFA said that the directors failed to notify it that false statements
had been submitted, in spite of professional advice to do so. When the
positions were revalued correctly, the SFA said, the firm had sufficient
regulatory capital.
Subsequent investigations showed that insufficient capital had obtained on
two previous occasions and in the month after the overvaluation.

TROOPS of the former rebel movement Unita blocked all entrances to Angola's
second city Huambo yesterday and shelled the nearby town of Caala throughout
the day, Portugal's TSF radio said, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Huambo airport was closed and local businesses shut down, the radio said in
a report from the Angolan capital Luanda. Civilians in Huambo were looking
for safe places in the event of possible fighting and some had gone to the
airport in the hope of leaving the city, it said.
Angolan state radio said the attack on Caala was part of a Unita attempt to
lay siege to Huambo 12 miles away.
The ruling MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) has accused
Unita of massing troops in the interior and occupying several towns since
last month's elections.
Unita, led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, lost last month's UN-supervised general
elections that were due to set the seal on a peace agreement last year
ending 16 years of civil war.
Talks between Unita and the MPLA to pave the way for a peace summit between
Mr Savimbi and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos have reached an impasse.

DSB, DENMARK'S state railway company, has placed an initial DKr600m (Pounds
61.7m) order with Linke-Hoffman-Busch/Siemens, a German consortium, for
eight trains for the Copenhagen suburban network.
The consortium now appears likely to provide trains for the whole DKr8bn
order for the network. The opposition Social Democrats had argued the
contracts should go to Denmark's ABB Skandia.
But yesterday, the opposition agreed it would be unable to stop DSB giving
the order to LHB/Siemens without breaking EC public tendering law. The first
trains are to be delivered in 1995. By 1997, DSB will decide whether to
order 120 trains, worth DKr8bn.
The German trains are lighter than ABB Skandia's. DSB says trains supplied
by the German consortium would be more fuel-efficient than Skandia's. But
Skandia claims the choice of new technology in the German trains means the
consortium may be unable to deliver on time.

<TEXT>
HELLENIC Aerospace Industry (HAI), a state-owned Greek facility, has signed
a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.2m) contract with Boeing Corporation, the US
aircraft manufacturer, for assembly work on the Boeing 757 passenger jet.
It is the first big contract HAI has won since Lockheed Aircraft Services
International, the service arm of Lockheed Corporation of the US, took over
management of the Greek company 18 months ago. HAI will make part of the
B757 airframe at its plant at Tanagra, central Greece, under an offset
agreement made when Olympic Airways, the Greek carrier, ordered six new
Boeing aircraft as part of its 1990s fleet renewal.
HAI officials say that, with the Boeing contract secured, the company is
well placed to win more civil aviation subcontracting work. Talks are under
way with both Northrop and Vought, two major Boeing subcontractors.
A smaller contract signed recently with Dornier, to make airframe parts
worth DM1.4m (Pounds 560,000) for the UH-1D helicopter used by the German
armed forces, is typical of HAI's scale of operation until now. The company,
set up by the state in the late 1970s to carry out repairs for the Greek air
force, does maintenance for several Middle East and Gulf air forces.
But the production side has been slow to develop despite a number of
opportunities for offset work linked with Greece's recent purchases, from
France and the US respectively, of the Mirage 2000 and F-16 combat aircraft.
Lockheed's task, under a two-year management contract, has been to
restructure the company, develop a business plan and boost productivity. If
HAI can make an operating profit over the next year, the Greek government
plans to offer up to 49 per cent of the company for sale under its
privatisation programme.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Peace prize puts Guatemala on spot: Nobel award is just one
more problem for President Serrano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE award this month of the Nobel Peace Prize to one of the most vociferous
opponents of the Guatemalan government has added to an array of problems
faced by President Jorge Serrano.
The government has been sharply criticised for its handling of the award to
Ms Rigoberta Menchu, a human rights activist and an energetic critic of
successive Guatemalan governments since she fled to Mexico in 1981,
following the death of her father, mother, and brother at the hands of the
armed forces.
The government, seemed tobe caught unprepared, and was quickly forced into
an embarrassing U-turn. Days after several prominent government officials
publicly stated their opposition to the award, President Serrano scrambled
to invite her for a meeting in the National Palace, minutes before she left
for Mexico where President Carlos Salinas had organised an official
celebration.
This is the latest in a series of difficulties for Mr Serrano, which has
left his government isolated and has pushed him closer to the powerful armed
forces.
Twenty-one months into his term, the president has failed to deliver the
peace he promised in his election campaign: to end 32 years of armed
conflict. Negotiations between the government and the left-wing National
Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity guerrillas (URNG) have stalled on the issue
of human rights, the first point of an 11-point agenda agreed in Oslo 18
months ago.
The president's initiative to recognise Belize, which the Guatemalan
constitution states is part of Guatemala, continues to be blocked pending a
Supreme Court decision on whether his action was constitutional.
While most Guatemalans have little interest in the Belize issue, most
leading newspapers have attacked the government for its handling of the
matter.
Two weeks earlier the human rights performance of the armed forces had been
criticised by a United Nations expert on Guatemala. A German professor,
Christian Tomushcat said that the presidential staff was 'totally
discredited' over its stance on the killing of Guatemalan anthropologist, Ms
Myrna Mack, whose death has become Guatemala's most prominent human rights
case. Ms Mack's sister has called for a case to be opened against General
Edgar Augusto Godoy, chief of presidential staff at the time of her sister's
death two years ago.
Mr Serrano has turned increasingly to the army for support, as an antidote
to an unreliable congress, and a coalition cabinet which has lost the
semblance of unity.
The influence of the army grew significantly after it took over security in
Guatemala City following a widespread bombing campaign in April and May,
believed to be the work of right-wing extremists and drug traffickers.
The Nobel prize is being seen by some as a chance to elicit change in the
attitude of a political and economic establishment which has largely
marginalised and repressed Guatemala's majority indigenous tribal
population.
'It was a shock to the upper crust of our society . . . which was needed for
people to finally realise some realities of this country,' Mr Edmond Mulet,
congress president, said.
For the indigenous population Ms Menchu's victory is being seen as a chance
for greater political participation and recognition of their culture.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA's ethnic Hungarians yesterday denied they wanted to secede from
Bucharest in a move aimed at defusing a political row created by a
declaration last weekend that they desired self-government, writes Virginia
Marsh from Bucharest.
The Democratic Union of Magyars in Romania (DUMR) said secession was in any
case impossible given that regions where Hungarians formed the majority were
in the centre of Romania.
Instead, they said that ethnic Hungarian communities only wished for greater
autonomy in order to preserve their religious and cultural identity, which
were granted by the constitution.
The DUMR's earlier declaration had fuelled Romania's nationalist parties
which in last month's general election won 22 per cent of the votes in
Transylvania, Romania's western province where most of the 1.7m ethnic
Hungarian minority live.
Romanian nationalists have interpreted the DUMR statement as further proof
that the party aims to restore Transylvania to Hungarian rule and accused
the DUMR of repratedly trying to destabilise the country.

The Stock Exchange yesterday suspended dealings in DG Durham, the insurance
broker, after the company announced that it was in discussions with a
potential buyer.
The USM-quoted shares were suspended at 4p, compared to a 1992 high of 11p,
giving the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 800,000.
'The company has entered discussions which may lead to an offer being made
for the shares of the company and/or to a subscription into its major
operating subsidiaries.'
Durham reported that pre-tax losses came to Pounds 220,000 in the six months
ending June 30 1991.
This compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 765,000 in 1990.
At the time it said the downturn was due partially to difficult trading
conditions in the travel insurance business, in which it is a market leader.
Its Lloyd's broking subsidiary was sold earlier this year.
A further announcement accompanied by preliminary results for the period to
March 31 1992 will be made 'as soon as possible'.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome chief's strategy to assure
continued growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN ROBB, Wellcome's chief executive, yesterday outlined his strategy to
assure his group's continued profits growth.
He warned that underlying results might be affected in the long term by
political change, and in particular world-wide pressure on prices. The
pricing situation was not getting any easier, he said. In Japan and parts of
Europe it was draconian and he expected further price changes in European
markets.
In the US, Mr Robb said he had no doubt that pricing pressure would become
more difficult, no matter which party won the coming presidential elections.
Payments to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care scheme for poor
families, were Pounds 8m in the year to August 29 1992 and would rise to
Pounds 40m this financial year. Wellcome's future depended upon its ability
to generate volume growth, said Mr Robb.
The main driving force last year was Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes, chicken pox
and shingles drug. Sales increased 24 per cent to Pounds 586m, twice the
figure achieved three years ago and nearly a third of overall sales.
Mr Robb said Zovirax's potential was by no means exhausted. The group had
gained approval to sell the drug over the counter without a prescription in
New Zealand and Germany, where its patents expire next year.
Meanwhile, Wellcome is in a race with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American
group, to develop a second generation anti-herpes compound. Wellcome has two
molecules, called 256U and 882C, nearing the completion of their
development. These are due for launch in 1995 and 1996, while SmithKline
Beecham expects to bring Famciclovir, its new treatment, to market in 1995.
Sales of Retrovir, the HIV-treatment also known as AZT, increased 22 per
cent to Pounds 213m, following a disappointing previous year, said Mr Robb.
He warned, however, that Retrovir was now in a competitive environment,
battling against DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, and DDC which is
marketed by Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche.
Mr Robb said sales would continue to grow as Retrovir was used increasingly
in combination with such drugs.
Sales of newer drugs, such as Tracrium, Wellbutrin, Wellferon, Exosurf and
Lamictil, generated Pounds 200m.
Further growth is expected to come from Wellcome's over the counter
operations (OTC), which increased 17 per cent to Pounds 237m.
Mr Robb said Wellcome was seeking ways to expand its OTC business. The
company wanted to gain critical mass in the US and the Continent, but he did
not want to make an acquisition that would dilute earnings, even in the
first year.
Mr Robb said the UK business had been hit by poor penetration of Zovirax and
a high incidence of parallel imports. The organisation had been shaken up,
he said.
US sales rose 16 per cent to Pounds 737m, thanks to a strong performance
from the anti-viral and OTC businesses. European sales increased 20 per cent
to Pounds 590m.
Japanese revenues were up 18 per cent to Pounds 128m, following the
introduction of Zovirax as a treatment for shingles. Other international
sales increased 17 per cent to Pounds 188m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the 12 months ended September 30 net asset value of Majedie Investments
fell from 348p to 338p.
However, on the revenue side earnings improved.
Directors said their generally cautious approach proved to be advantageous
in a period of volatility in the currency and securities markets.
Investment income came to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 4.53m) and earnings per share
worked through at 10.07p (9.81p).
The final dividend is 7p, for a total of 9.5p (9p) and a 1-for-1 scrip issue
is proposed.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Allied Radio posts Pounds 1m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Radio, which operates local stations in Surrey, West Sussex and
Hampshire, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.01m, against Pounds 954,000,
for the nine months to June 30.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 3.41m (Pounds 3.67m).
The figures were issued to comply with Stock Exchange regulations following
a change of year-end to September 30 to match the quoted radio sector.
Despite difficult trading conditions, operating losses were reduced by 33.5
per cent from Pounds 683,000 to Pounds 454,000. The operating loss for radio
activities alone was reduced from Pounds 406,000 to Pounds 127,000, on
turnover of Pounds 2.31m against Pounds 2.45m.
Losses per share were 2.20p (2.89p). No dividend is declared.

<TEXT>
Over the six months to September 30 net asset value at Securities Trust of
Scotland rose by 0.4 per cent, from 70.1p to 70.4p.
On September 30 the year before it stood at 77p.
Of the portfolio 66 per cent was held in the UK, 8 per cent on the
Continent, 17.5 in the US, and 7 per cent in the Pacific Basin.
Gross revenue totalled Pounds 8.91m (Pounds 8.96m), reflecting lower deposit
interest income as a result of reduced cash holdings and falling interest
rates.
Earnings per share were again 1.53p and the interim dividend is held at
1.08p.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals return Jackson to the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An exceptional credit put Jackson Group, the East Anglian construction and
industrial services company, back into profit.
In the first half of 1992 it made Pounds 386,000 pre-tax, after taking in
Pounds 874,000 exceptionals, being Pounds 1.37m from revaluation reserve on
the sale of an investment property less Pounds 500,000 against the value of
dealing property stock.
Before the exceptionals the loss was Pounds 488,000, compared with the
corresponding Pounds 292,000. Earnings per share came through at 1.8p
(losses 0.9p) but the interim dividend is omitted (1p).
Turnover was Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 26.4m) and generated a trading profit of
Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 658,000). Operations in all divisions have been
reviewed and measures taken to cope with on-going recession. That involved
extra costs but would effect 'substantial savings' in 1993.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths trims loss to Pounds 1.88m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An improvement in sales enabled the Goldsmiths Group of jewellery and watch
retailers to reduce pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.88m in the
half year to August 29.
Sales were Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 16.4m), a rise of 11 per cent overall and 4
per cent on a like-for-like basis. That stemmed from increased market share
but compared with poor trading in the corresponding period. Five new retail
outlets were opened and two relocated.
However, the interim dividend is passed (1.5p) after losses per share of
5.74p (6.38p). The loss would have been reduced by a further Pounds 200,000
but for a number of one-off charges.
There was still some consumer resistance at the top end of the market, but
the middle market in watches and jewellery continued to be strong.
The group was in a position to benefit from any upturn in the economy, and
also believed the excessive discounting of last year would not be repeated
over the Christmas period, so leading to improved sales and margins.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Falling rubber price leaves Bertam lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bertam Holdings, the rubber and oil palm producer and property dealer,
reported per-tax profits of Pounds 354,000 for the first half of 1992, down
15 per cent on the Pounds 418,000 achieved in the comparable period.
The company said that palm oil prices held up well during the period, but
rubber prices had been disappointing.
The completion of a MDollars 50m (Pounds 12.7m) land sale to Bertam
Properties, in which the group has a 40 per cent stake, meant that the
planned acquisition of three companies would take place in November. Further
joint ventures would be sought on plantation land with local Malaysian
partners.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 598,000 and operating profit was
Pounds 465,000 (Pounds 494,000). Earnings per share came to 1.07p (1.45p).

<TEXT>
BLYSTAD Group, the offshore oil services company, yesterday reported interim
pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.62m, compared with a profit of Pounds 579,000.
The loss reduces Blystad's net assets to Pounds 7.2m, below the value of the
unconditional bid from Abbot Holdings, Mr Alistair Locke's private group.
The deficit for the six months to June 30 included a Pounds 2.6m write-down
in the value of a semi-submersible drilling rig which is laid up in
Singapore, and an Pounds 878,000 provision covering the loss in value of a

Abbot said last week it had received acceptances of its preference share

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Babcock warns of difficult trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BABCOCK International, the engineering group, yesterday cut its interim
dividend and warned that difficult trading conditions in all its markets
would depress future profits.
The group brought forward the announcement by four weeks because of concern
over the volatility of its share price and market rumours about the trading
outlook.
The shares, which have fallen steeply from May's peak of 69p, yesterday
closed  1/2 p lower at 29 1/2 p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 fell from Pounds 23.7m to
Pounds 16.6m on turnover down from Pounds 415.3m to Pounds 399.7m.
The group blamed the drop in profits on the late impact of recession and the
need to make provisions for certain under-performing contracts.
The biggest related to costs of Pounds 5m associated with difficulties at
the combined-cycle power station at Killingholme, Humberside, although the
group said its other combined-cycle contracts were proceeding to programme.
Lord King, chairman, said the board's realistic assessment of current
trading conditions was that results for the second half were at best likely
to be only marginally better than the first half. The last full-year figure
was Pounds 50.1m.
In view of the importance of conserving cash, the interim dividend is
reduced from 1.25p to 1p, payable from earnings of 2.02p (3.32p) per share.
The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that the group's shared contract to
run the Rosyth Naval Dockyard in Scotland will be extended by at least a
year until April 1995, and probably a year thereafter.
Babcock was also awaiting a government decision, expected by the year-end,
on whether it can complete new docks for Trident nuclear submarines at
Rosyth, which employs 4,000 people.
The group said the London Underground contract for the refurbishment of
coaches, being undertaken at Rosyth, had involved higher initial costs than
anticipated, but encouraging performance levels were now being achieved and
prospects were encouraging.
Babcock Energy suffered from a shortfall in orders, exacerbated by the
deferment of a Pounds 100m Hampshire waste-to-water plant. However, the
group said a number of sizeable export projects were expected to be
finalised in the next few months.
In the construction and process plant division, order books had been under
pressure and turnover was down.
However, the group said there were increasing opportunities outside the UK
and contracts in the oil and gas sector had been secured in Malaysia and the
Middle East, with further opportunities still likely to be secured.
COMMENT
There is no doubt that Babcock has gone through a very rough patch - the
harder question to answer is whether the market's recent reaction has been
too extreme. Sceptics say that when things start going wrong in the
contracting business, they tend to continue going wrong - and, being late in
the cycle, Babcock is likely to have it tough for at least another couple of
years. The counter-argument points to the high quality of the management,
who seemed anxious to make full provision for the recent pain, and the
likely impact of devaluation in securing much needed export orders. Forecast
full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m put the shares on a prospective
multiple of 7.4 - a 48 per cent discount to the market. Assuming a full-year
dividend of 2p, they are on an 85 per cent yield premium. For once, the
gloom may have been overdone.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Standards now more complex - The new profit
and loss account requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW financial reporting standard on the profit and loss account unveiled
yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board may come as little surprise to
the cognoscenti, but it will make considerable extra demands on both
preparers and users.
Those who have been following the development of FRS 3 will not be surprised
by the new document. In many ways it reflects FRED 1, the consultation
exposure draft issued at the end of last year.
FRS 3 is the culmination of two years work, and is likely to stand for two
years before being revised. It is the ASB's first fully home-grown standard,
since FRS 1 on cash flows was a remnant from its predecessor body, and FRS 2
on consolidated accounts was driven by company legislation.
A number of significant changes have been introduced as a result of the
public consultation - and notably comments from companies. The principal
ones are:
dropping the requirement for disclosure of 'revenue investment' such as
advertising and training expenses
a statement reconciling movements in shareholders' funds, derived from
profit, dividends, other gains and losses, new share capital and goodwill
removing a specific 'exceptional item' category for most elements in favour
of including material, unusual profits or losses in the income or expense
heading to which they relate
retaining as separately disclosed exceptional three items: the costs of a
fundamental reorganisation or restructuring, and profits or losses on
disposal of fixed assets or a business
Meanwhile, many of the changes already mooted in FRED 1 represent important
advances. These include a new financial statement of total recognised gains
and losses, which Tweedie calls a 'world first' which he expects other
accounting standards-setters overseas to follow.
It includes an item on foreign currency translations, the significance of
which many failed to spot in the accounts of Polly Peck International. It
will also be possible to see the effect of property and other asset
revaluations compared with their historic cost with a new note to the
accounts.
Prior knowledge of what was coming does not mean users will be ready for the
changes and able to easily cope with the newly-constituted accounts. That is
part of the ASB's intention.
Mr David Tweedie, the ASB's chairman, is convinced that accounts users are
obsessed with a single number - earnings per share.
By extension - as well as by virtue of the common link between
performance-related pay and earnings - company managements come under
pressure to manipulate that figure.
The thrust of FRS 3 is to replace this 'headline number' with the so-called
'information-set' approach. Readers kept on their toes because they are
forced to pick and choose numbers to find the data on corporate performance
that they seek.
By bringing everything above the line into pre-tax profits, the new earnings
figure will become less stable, predictable or comparable - either between
companies or over time. That will force analysts and others to rely less on
the bottom line figure and come up with their own - different - methods.
'We're saying that if you don't like the way the figures are presented, all
you've got to do is take your pencil out and recalculate,' says Tweedie.
FRS 3 does include some information which was not previously in accounts,
notably splitting out the contribution to results from acquisitions,
continuing and discontinued operations.
Most is already available, but often buried in the notes. The introduction
of the new format should put an end to companies hiding behind 'reserve
accounting' in which changes are concealed to all but the most meticulous.
But that raises a paradox. The new standard is making accounts far more
complex, introducing new notes and statements, and adding additional figures
to the face of the profit and loss account.
Tweedie admits that FRS 3 will not be easy for the 'ordinary user' of
accounts to digest. Yet arguably those who are more qualified are already
able to hunt for concealed numbers; others will be more confused than ever.
An unusual aspect of FRS 3 is the inclusion of a dissenting statement from
one of the nine ASB members, Mr Bob Bradfield of Cazenove, the securities
house. He says disposals should not be above the line because gain or loss
on sale is based on historic case not comparable with trading profits.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley share offer success

<DATELINE>
   TWO recently floated companies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the international publishing group, and JD
Wetherspoon, the chain of 44 Greater London pubs - yesterday announced the
results of their offers to financial intermediaries.
The 7m Dorling Kindersley shares offered to the public at 165p were six
times subscribed. Strong demand for the shares had already caused the amount
on offer through intermediates to be increased from 25 to 36.3 per cent of
the issue, valuing the group at Pounds 101.7m.
In the JD Wetherspoon flotation, which valued the group at Pounds 45.6m,
applications were received for 79.4 per cent of the 5.3m shares offered to
intermediaries. The remainder of the 14.68m shares on offer have been placed
with institutions, raising a total of Pounds 24m.
Dorling Kindersley said investors who had applied for 5m or more shares
would receive 10 per cent of the number sought; those who applied for
between 2m and 4.99m would receive 15 per cent and those who sought fewer
than 2m would be allocated 21.95 per cent, rounded to the nearest 100
shares.
A further 12.15m shares were firmly placed with institutions last Friday.
The flotation raised Pounds 31.6m, of which Pounds 25m was new money for the
company.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Retail side behind 74% fall at Blacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKS LEISURE, the camping goods and sportswear company, reported a 74 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits in the six months to August 29 after its retail
division incurred its first ever loss.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 580,000 on sales ahead to
Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 33.8m).
The interim dividend is cut to 0.75p (1.1p), payable from earnings of 1.68p
(6.41p) per share. Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said the
decision reflected uncertain expectations of the second half. The company
intends to maintain the dividend at its new level.
The shares, which have slid slowly from a peak of 130p last November,
yesterday fell another 7p to 32p.
A lack of consumer confidence and competitive price cutting adversely
affected the retail operation which incurred a deficit before interest and
tax of Pounds 89,000 compared with profits of Pounds 1.1m.
The outcome included an exceptional profit of Pounds 185,000 related to the
sale of the High Wycombe site.
Mr Bentley warned that the effective devaluation of sterling would make
things worse because the division imports much of its sports footwear.
The distribution operation saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.35m to
Pounds 1.72m. Mr Bentley said the decline in consumer spending was mainly
responsible for the fall.
S Eker, the textile converting and merchanting operation, was closed and
shown as an extraordinary charge of Pounds 8.8m, including Pounds 7.7m of
goodwill already written off.
Gearing fell from 37 per cent to 31 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Directors avoid dismissal at Alliance arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors at a subsidiary of Alliance Resources, the struggling oil and gas
company put into receivership on Tuesday, narrowly avoided dismissal after
filing for protection under US bankruptcy laws.
Alliance Resources USA filed for Chapter 11 late Tuesday night following a
demand for repayment of Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 920,000) by First National Bank
of Commerce, its largest creditor.
The move came just hours after Manx Petroleum, the unlisted oil and gas
company chaired by entrepreneur Mr Algy Cluff, appointed administrative
receivers to the Louisiana-based company's USM-quoted parent.
Mr John O'Brien, managing director of Manx and former chairman of Alliance,
said the receivers had intended to dismiss the directors of the US
subsidiary.
The action has also thwarted, for the time being, Manx's ambitions to manage
Alliance while it is in receivership. The Chapter 11 action leaves little
but a shell in London with shares in the US subsidiary.
Mr O'Brien, who became Alliance chairman in May, was ousted just two weeks
ago following his claims that the company's assets at flotation were
incorrectly stated.
Manx appointed receivers when talks to reinstate him failed. Manx is
claiming Alliance defaulted on the management agreement, which set out terms
for a Dollars 200,000 loan and management fees of Pounds 10,000 a month. The
total debt claimed by Manx, including Mr O'Brien's expenses and a proportion
of the 2 1/2 p rise in the share price to 9 1/2 p since he took over, comes
to Dollars 770,000.
Manx also said receivers had been called in light of the winding up petition
lodged by Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott.

FT  29 OCT 92 / What future for coal?:  Coal chief sees little hope of
saving more pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chances of saving more coal pits are slim unless there is 'a radical
change' in the UK energy market, Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman of British
Coal, told the trade and industry committee of backbench MPs yesterday.
He said that it was doubtful whether even British Coal's tentative agreement
to sell 30m-40m tonnes a year to the electricity industry over the next five
years could be maintained, because of pressures from competing fuels.
He warned that if British Coal failed to confirm these contracts - which
would account for 80 per cent of its output - the most the company would get
would be 'a nominal tonnage' at world prices which would be below those
currently being negotiated.
Even if British Coal managed to raise its market share this would not
necessarily save a large number of pits because of the productivity gains
being achieved in the pits being kept open.
Mr Clarke also gave a gloomy long-term prognosis for coal in the UK.
He warned that although reserves were sufficient for several hundred years,
the UK coal industry would only survive for 20 to 40 years at present coal
prices.
Mr Clarke said the mines had been placed into three categories according to
their physical characteristics, their financial position, their ability to
serve market needs, their employment position and risk factors.
Ten pits fell into the top category of mines which had solid prospects.
These were all being kept open.
Eleven had lesser prospects and would probably have to close, though four of
them were strong enough to warrant mothballing. The remaining 27 were
unlikely to survive.
MPs sought assurances from Mr Clarke that British Coal would do nothing to
damage the prospects of any pits until the review had been completed. Mr
Clarke said he had already given that assurance to the courts, where miners'
unions are mounting a legal challenge to the closure plan.
Mr Clarke said British Coal had sought 'enhanced' redundancy payments for
miners laid off by the pit closures, but had been unable to persuade the
government to agree to them.
The cross-party employment committee of MPs has joined the trade and
industry committee and the public accounts committee in deciding to
investigate British Coal's pit closure programme.
The committee yesterday agreed to examine the implications for jobs of the
plans to shut 31 mines and make 30 000 miners redundant. Mr Neil Clarke, the
British Coal chairman, will give evidence to the committee next Wednesday.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Lamont's chance to set things straight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, rises to deliver the annual Mansion
House speech tonight, he will have an opportunity to restore his tarnished
image in the financial markets. He is also expected to talk about a new
spirit of openness at the Treasury.
Addressing bankers and City representatives Mr Lamont will try to end
confusion about the government's economic policy and dispel the gloom about
the UK economy which has recently knocked the pound and depressed the stock
market.
While he is likely to provide more details about new thinking at the
Treasury, to explain more fully the way in which economic policy is
operated, he is not expected to outline significant initiatives on monetary
policy or changes in the rules for funding the public sector borrowing
requirement.
Nor is he likely to do more than touch briefly on the framework for public
spending over the next few years, or on measures to entice private-sector
cash into infrastructure projects. Both subjects will probably be covered in
detail in his Commons address on November 12, part of the Treasury's Autumn
Statement.
The chancellor's biggest task is to reduce the uncertainty about economic
policy that has emerged in the wake of sterling's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday and recent indications that
Britain's longest recession for 50 years is worsening.
Financial markets have been unsettled by apparent differences in emphasis on
economic policy between Downing Street and the Treasury that have emerged
recently.
While Mr John Major, the prime minister, has talked about Britain putting
economic growth at the top of its policy objectives, the Treasury has
continued to reiterate the government's desire to bear down on inflation and
worry about the level of sterling.
Mr Lamont will try to link the two sets of policy statements, emphasising
that the government's objective remains long-term, stable growth within a
framework of permanently low inflation.
There is a fairly remote possibility that Mr Lamont will announce changes to
the way in which the government's deficit, or the public sector borrowing
requirement, is funded.
The Mansion House speech is almost always preceded by calls for a change in
the funding rule and every year expectations are disappointed. But this
year, says Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at SG Warburg securities, the
arguments for change have become 'more persuasive than ever'.
The full-fund rule requires the authorities to fund the PSBR by sales of
government bonds, or gilts, outside the banking and building societies
sectors.
Since gilts bought by banks or building societies do not count as funding,
the Bank of England has to sell even more gilts to meet the requirements of
the PSBR.
Many economists expect the PSBR to grow to more than Pounds 40bn in the next
financial year. One way of reducing it at a single stroke would be to count
purchases of gilts by banks and building societies as funding. This could
cut next year's PSBR by as much as Pounds 6bn.
As well as easing the funding burden, a break from the full-fund rule could
have other beneficial effects on the economy.
Since the authorities would have to raise less cash from the public, the
supply of money circulating in the economy would be increased. Conversely,
if more gilts were sold to the public than were required to finance the
government's borrowing, money would be soaked up and the economy left less
liquid.
Economists also say that a smaller volume of sales of gilts would raise
prices and lower yields, encouraging investment by companies as it would let
them raise fixed-rate finance more cheaply.
Underfunding the PSBR could also boost equity prices, thereby cheapening the
cost of equity capital and encouraging rights issues.
For all this, the authorities appear reluctant to tinker with the funding
rules.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu, and long an advocate
of underfunding, says: 'There still seems to be a view in the Treasury that
such a move would be pointless.'

FT  29 OCT 92 / Slight fall in repossessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOME repossessions in England and Wales fell slightly in the three months to
the end of September, according to figures released yesterday by the Lord
Chancellor's office.
Mr Tony Baldry, housing minister, said the figures showed a 'welcome
decline' and added: 'Mortgage counselling for those in difficulties is now
widespread and shows that lenders want to help people out of their
difficulties.'
The Building Societies Association was more cautious in its welcome for the
figures. It said the fall was caused by a widespread policy of 'forbearance'
by lenders, rather than by any reduction in the scale of mortgage arrears.
The figures do not include voluntary repossessions - where occupants
surrender the keys to their home without a contest - and so are only a
preliminary indication.
In the third quarter of this year 34,474 repossession actions were entered,
down 32 per cent from 51,037 in the same quarter last year, and 30,661
repossession orders were made, 23 per cent down from the corresponding
period last year.
Repossession orders for the first nine months of the year, at 99,592, show a
6 per cent fall from the corresponding period last year.
Shelter, the housing group, urged the Lord Chancellor to recommend that
lenders were not granted possession orders unless debt counselling had been
offered.
It said long-term mortgage arrears had more than doubled by the end of July
compared with the same point last year.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Civil engineers' confidence is 'shot'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFIDENCE of civil engineering companies is 'shot to pieces', according
to a report published today which shows a further fall in the industry's
workload and jobs.
Hopes for new orders and employment in civil engineering had shown a 'sharp
deterioration', according to the latest quarterly survey by the Federation
of Civil Engineering Contractors.
Mr John Hackett, the federation's director-general, said the fall in
confidence was due to the absence of new orders and repeated warnings of
cuts in government spending on infrastructure projects.
He conceded that much of the survey had been carried out before the recent
switch in economic policy which put the emphasis on stimulating growth. He
said, however, he doubted this 'could have made up for months of
discouraging indications'.
On a more positive note, the survey found costs increasingly under control.
Some 77 per cent of companies reported costs unchanged or lower than 12
months ago, up from 54 per cent. This beat the record 67 per cent in July
last year.
For the ninth successive survey, four out of five companies said margins
were lower than a year previously. Some 55 per cent, compared with 49 per
cent at the time of the last quarterly survey in July, reported
'unsatisfactory levels of plant utilisation'.
The short-term outlook was that order books were still shrinking, although
fewer companies reported a falling number of invitations to tender.
Looking ahead 12 months, companies surveyed were more pessimistic than at
any time in the current recession. None of the 145 companies which responded
anticipated recruiting more staff and 57 per cent expected to reduce levels.
The sample covered about 9 per cent of the total construction output in the
UK.

THE Trades Union Congress yesterday said that it will organise a series of
rallies in the five regions which contain the 10 pits left on British Coal's
closure list, Jimmy Burns writes.
The rallies will aim to draw on the broadest possible coalition of political
and church groups.
The next stage of the TUC's campaign, aimed at keeping up the pressure on
the government and garnering public support on the coal issue, will
culminate in a lobby of parliament in January to coincide with the end of
the review.
Meanwhile Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has agreed to meet TUC officials
on Tuesday to discuss ideas for promoting economic growth.
Agreement to the meeting comes five months after the government announced it
was winding up the tripartite National Economic Council.
A High Court hearing of an injuction application by the National Union of
Mineworkers against British Coal has been postponed until Tuesday.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Brazil makes history with impeachment trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PORTO ALEGRE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN America's first impeachment trial gets fully under way today with the
questioning of President Fernando Collor's lawyers before the Brazilian
Senate.
Mr Collor, the first directly elected president of Brazil for 30 years, was
suspended from office a month ago after a popular movement and landslide
Congressional vote in favour of his impeachment trial over allegations that
he had masterminded a multi-million-dollar corruption scheme.
Brazil now has an acting president, Mr Itamar Franco, who has stepped up
from the vice-presidency, but Mr Collor, if absolved of the charges against
him, could return to power. The national television news reports the
activities of both men.
Brazilian cartoonists depict Mr Collor as a phantom haunting the
presidential palace. Still living in the capital, he seems to hope Mr
Franco's government will be so disastrous that the public will clamour for
his return. As he left office on October 2, Mr Collor told jeering crowds:
'I will return.'
Those close to him say he still cannot believe his downfall. Demands for a
helicopter and a large staff of aides and security guards have provoked
charges that he is trying to mount a parallel government.
Mr Collor has almost no chance of escaping victorious from the senate trial.
The 81-member senate has always been heavily weighted against him and one
senator described the forthcoming trial as 'like being thrown to the lions'.
The Senate has six months to conclude the trial. Mr Collor is not expected
to appear personally but will send lawyers, who are said to have been paid
Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 307,000) to handle the case.
In his 96-page defence, presented this week, the strategy is to blame
everything on Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's former friend and campaign
treasurer, who is alleged to have run the corruption scheme. The document
argues a lack of proof to link Mr Collor to Mr Farias.
However, the latter's lawyers say he will not allow himself to be made the
scapegoat. A 'corruption manual' (in the form of a computer disc seized by
the police from Mr Farias's office) known as 'the PC doctrine' is reported
to show the president's clear involvement.
Mr Aristides Junqueira, attorney-general, said: 'The fact that Collor has
transferred all blame for possible crimes to PC (Mr Farias) does not make
him innocent.' Mr Junqueira will decide by November 6 whether to recommend
criminal charges, though he has already said it is unlikely that Mr Collor
will go to jail.
The defence claims that the equivalent of Dollars 6.5m found by
investigations to have been spent by Mr Collor on such things as his wife's
wardrobe and a grandiose landscaping scheme was, in fact, the remains of a
Dollars 5m loan raised in Uruguay for his electoral campaign. This so-called
Uruguay operation is widely seen as discredited, and the original contract
has never been unearthed.
The Senate has demanded access to his bank accounts and telephone records,
and will hear 17 witnesses, including Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, former
economy minister, called by Mr Collor.
The Senate's verdict is expected by mid-January. If found guilty, Mr Collor
will be prevented from holding public office for eight years.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Argentine exports favoured in policy switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA last night announced a sweeping revision of its foreign trade
policies, in the face of recession, a growing trade deficit and rising
political opposition to the government of President Carlos Menem.
To defend local output from foreign competition, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy
minister, said Argentina will raise 'temporarily', to 10 per cent from 3 per
cent, a flat-rate tax charged on all imports and known as the 'statistics'
duty. 'We are doing this because import prices are very low on world
markets. There is a lot of recession out there and, therefore, prices are
very low,' he argued.
'These measures have been designed to avoid any impact on price indices. On
one hand, they will improve the prices of some exports; on the other hand,
they will produce a fall in fuel prices and transport costs,' the minister
added in his televised speech.
He said that, as of next week, the goverment will refund Argentine exporters
all taxes they pay in producing their goods, including VAT, gross income
tax, fuel and electricity duties, and taxes on assets, wages and raw
materials.
Mr Cavallo also announced new import tariffs, which were based on the degree
of value added to goods and the incidence of taxes in their production.
However, the top import tariff was cut to 20 per cent from 35 per cent, and
will be imposed on such consumer goods as clothing, home appliances and
motorcars.
The minister scrapped domestic taxes on gas oil, fuel oil and kerosene.
Mr Cavallo acknowledged in his speech that Argentina would probably finish
1992 with a trade deficit larger than Dollars 1bn, against a Dollars 3.7bn
surplus last year, but said these measures and fiscal austerity would help
the country balance its trade account more evenly in 1993.
Analysts expected the measures would offset an increasingly overvalued
currency which has crippled exports and triggered a flood of imports.
The announcement was prompted by alarm over Argentina's trade deficit, which
independent analysts put at Dollars 2bn. Industrialists blame the deficit on
Brazilian goods dumped in Argentina.
Concern is also growing over a decline in capital inflows. Central bank hard
currency purchases - a barometer of capital flows - fell to Dollars 260m
this month, the lowest rate this year and 21 per cent below that of
September.
The measures are part of a broader government attempt to recover the
political initiative, maintain growth and pave the way for Mr Menem's
controversial bid to amend the constitution so as to clear the way for
himself to stand for re-election when his term ends in 1995.
Mr Jorge Avila, an economic analyst, said the measures would amount to an
indirect devaluation. Instead of making companies more efficient, they would
encourage lobbies and corruption, but only delay an inevitable recession and
price deflation. Persistent inflation, excessive demand and a fixed exchange
rate were driving Argentina to recession, he added.
Mr Menem has also demanded an emergency package for pensioners, whose
regular weekly protests have become an embarrassment. The plight of
Argentina's 3.5m pensioners, many of whom survive on token benefits, has
become a symbol of government indifference to social problems created by its
strict free-market policies.
The docile trade unions have called a one-day general strike for November 9
to protest over low wages and government plans to attack their privileges.

 -proposed three candidates to succeed Austria and Belgium, leaving the

As expected, Spain easily gained the required two-thirds majority in the
first ballot. New Zealand was a surprise winner in a third ballot,

FT  29 OCT 92 / Bush seizes on apparent growth as good news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush claimed yesterday that the US economy was now
outperforming the rest of the industrialised world, Governor Bill Clinton
argued that the third-quarter improvement in national output could not
disguise a long-term downward trend, and Mr Ross Perot was preparing to give
a speech in Denver when he was expected, but not guaranteed, to concentrate
on the need for economic reform.
Mr Bush also claimed, in Ohio, that the Democrats 'can feel it (the
presidential election next week) slipping away' now that the economic news
was more encouraging. Last night, the latest tracking poll from CNN/USA
Today gave some substance to this, finding that the gap had shrunk to just
two points, with Mr Clinton on 40 per cent, Mr Bush 38 per cent and Mr Perot
16 per cent.
But another tracking poll, from ABC News, reported last night that Mr
Clinton still had a seven-point lead, unchanged in the last 24 hours. Mr
Stan Greenberg, Mr Clinton's pollster, said he gave his man a seven to
nine-point lead.
A compilation of state polls by the Hotline newsletter had Mr Clinton ahead
in 39 states with 413 electoral college votes, and Mr Bush up in 11 with 93,
one state (Texas) being tied.
In 26 of these, with 296 electors, Mr Clinton's lead was outside the usual
polling margin of error, whereas the president had such an edge in only two
states with 10 college votes. But the Bush campaign said late yesterday its
polls had their man leading in 14 or 15 states, with 140-plus votes, another
15 states being very competitive.
A total of 270 votes is needed for election.
Mr Bush and Mr Clinton appeared simultaneously on different breakfast TV
shows yesterday to give their very different views about the single, main
issue to confront the US electorate next Tuesday. They both spoke before the
mixed economic news was announced in Washington that last month durable
goods order had fallen and personal income and spending had gone up.
'It is inarguable,' Mr Bush said, 'that we are not in a recession' -
contrary to popular perception. 'Our economy is doing better than the world
economy,' he insisted. 'We have six (successive) quarters of growth, we have
unemployment going down, we have interest down, inflation down.
'A guy who's out of work' might think the US was still in recession, 'but 93
per cent are working.' The US being poised for a big recovery, it would be
wrong to follow the Democratic 'tax-and-spend philosophy that brought us
into a terrible recession.'
Mr Clinton's simultaneous response was much more analytical. The larger than
expected third-quarter growth, while 'good news,' was typical 'of the ups
and downs in the economy over the last ten years,' and could not disguise
the overall failure of 'trickle-down economics.'
He noted that 20 per cent of the expansion was accounted for by arms sales,
announced by Mr Bush 'in an election flurry' in September. Another 25 per
cent came from people's savings as they made necessary purchases at this
time of year for such as school uniforms. 'People can't deplete their
savings by 20 per cent a month,' Mr Clinton asserted.
The third element in the GNP improvement, which he said should be 'seriously
questioned,' was that the statistics included an estimate for foreign trade
in September - 'and most people don't think our trade performance in
September will be that good.'
In summation, Mr Clinton said 'you can't evaluate anybody based on three
months' performance, when you know more than half of it is based on one-time
developments.'
More relevant were the long-term trends - 'declining incomes, more and more
part-time employment, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance,
other countries growing more rapidly than we are.'

FT  29 OCT 92 / Economic growth remains sluggish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MIXED bag of economic reports yesterday signalled sluggish growth for the
US economy.
Orders in September for durable goods fell for the third consecutive month,
while increases in personal incomes and consumption overstated the economy's
underlying strength, according to Commerce Department reports.
New orders for durable goods fell 0.4 per cent last month, surprising most
analysts, who had forecast a modest rebound after declines of 0.4 per cent
and 2.7 per cent in August and July respectively.
However, the weakness last month mainly reflected sharp declines in the
volatile sectors of defence and aerospace. Excluding defence, orders rose
0.5 per cent; excluding transport, they rose 2.1 per cent.
Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts - the
figure generally regarded as the best guide to trends in civilian investment
 -rose a sharp 5.5 per cent in September.
Personal income and consumption both rose 0.7 per cent - larger increases
than expected. But the income figures were distorted by a rebound after
Hurricane Andrew in August, and by subsidy payments to farmers.
Excluding distortions, personal incomes rose only 0.1 per cent last month
after a 0.6 per cent increase in August.
Official figures indicated that the apparent rebound in consumption last
month principally reflected price changes. After allowing for inflation,
personal consumption spending rose 0.1 per cent, after remaining constant in
August.
The figures were consistent with other recent data indicating the underlying
pace of economic growth is about 1.5 to 2 per cent, rather than the 2.7 per
cent reported this week by the Commerce Department.

It is not proposed that additional permanent members would have the power of

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has informed the US that it will resume economic aid to Vietnam
shortly after the US presidential election next Tuesday, the Washington Post
said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
The Japanese decision would open a big new breach in the US-led economic
embargo against Vietnam.
The Post quoted US administration officials as having said that the Japanese
decision might be announced about November 6.
The Japanese had postponed, at the request of the US, resumption of aid to
Vietnam, which they were intending to start in August.
The newspaper quoted a US State Department official as having said that the
Japanese had been most co-operative with US policies toward Vietnam. This
response suggests that US reaction to the new Japanese decision would be
muted.
The US is involved in a review of its relationship with Vietnam, the
Vietnamese having provided access to extensive archives dealing with the
fate of US prisoners of war and missing servicemen.
The Bush administration has delayed any improvement in relations, however,
because of lack of progress in determining the fate of 2,265 Americans who
were involved in the Vietnam war.
The future of the trade embargo and normalisation of diplomatic relations
are issues under review by the US administration, following the opening of
Vietnamese records that include 4,800 photographs of American war dead and
prisoners.
According to figures provided to the Washington Post by the Vietnamese State
Committee for Co-operation and Investment, at least 37 nations are trading
with or investing in Vietnam, including such friends of the US as South
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Britain, France, Germany, Australia and Canada.
The Japanese decision will make the embargo even less effective, according
to economic analysts quoted by the Post.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Playing dirty to win the Senate prize in New York state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are few places in the US where political campaigns are more nasty and
brutish than in New York state.
This autumn, however, the mud is being slung with more than usual abandon in
the race for the Senate seat held by Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a right-wing
Republican from suburban Long Island who has survived a series of ethics
investigations over the years.
His challenger is Mr Robert Abrams, a traditional liberal Democrat who has
done a respectable job for the last 13 years as state attorney-general. He
is a decent man with little charisma and 26 years of public service. He won
his party's nomination after a harrowing primary battle against Ms Geraldine
Ferraro, vice-presidential candidate in 1984.
The primary contest, with smears to the fore, was termed 'gutter politics'
by Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. The battle between Mr Abrams and Mr
D'Amato is in some ways even worse. The former recently became so rattled
that he called Senator D'Amato a fascist, only to apologise later after
alienating Italian-American voters.
The investigations faced by Mr D'Amato, a two-term senator, include a Senate
ethics committee probe that cleared him of 13 charges. However, it had
insufficient or no evidence of three other accusations - that he was
involved in a New York housing scandal, that he had channelled federal funds
to campaign contributors, and that he had helped his brother to lobby the
federal government for defence contracts.
The brother has been indicted on 24 counts of mail fraud.
It has also not helped Mr D'Amato's reputation in the present campaign that
several of the 120 witnesses questioned in the ethics probe used the US
constitution's fifth amendment, letting them refuse to answer questions on
the grounds that they might incriminate themselves.
The Senate investigation, although it did not find any charge proved,
concluded that Mr D'Amato had 'conducted the business of his office in an
improper and inappropriate manner'. In its endorsement of Mr Abrams last
week, the New York Times noted that the senator had often had to defend his
honesty - 'his explanations have often been unsatisfactory.'
Mr D'Amato, though, is a great campaigner who takes much pride in conducting
business that helps constituents to win federal funds. He has taken credit
for so many public works projects in New York, including some which would
have flowed to the state without his intervention, that he has earned the
nickname of 'Senator Pothole'.
The figure he cuts is both tough and street-wise - a staunch defender of the
military and an early proponent of bombing Baghdad, he knows how to play on
the fears of his constituents by calling for the death penalty and warning
that Mr Abrams is out to cut defence jobs.
Although Mr D'Amato has moved to distance himself from President George Bush
 -a recent cartoon showed him racing off the Titanic with an army of rats -
he has clung to some of the Bush campaign's more extreme anti-abortion,
anti-homosexual and anti-civil rights positions. He has no qualms about
being so strongly anti-abortion that, as well as running on the Republican
ticket, he is also the Right to Life party's senatorial candidate.
Mr Abrams, by contrast, is an old-fashioned New York Democrat, and is
hopelessly outgunned by Mr D'Amato when it comes to funding for
all-important television adverts. In the circumstances, Mr Abrams, an
otherwise honourable man, seems to have decided he must conduct a negative
campaign - on television and at rallies - just as low as that of Mr D'Amato.
The impact of the incumbent's heavy spending on negative television
commercials, plus the residual effects of Mr Abrams's unfortunate use of the
word fascist, have toppled the Democrat from his lead in the polls. The
latest New York Times survey showed the candidates running neck and neck
yesterday.

Police said Mr Munoz Mosquera, 33, was wanted on numerous charges of
terrorism and murder, and was considered the right-hand man of Mr Pablo
Escobar, the cartel chief. The government had offered the equivalent of
Dollars 143,000 for information leading to his arrest.
Unlike Mr Escobar and his lieutenants, Mr Munoz Mosquera never took
advantage of a government offer of lenient treatment in return for
surrender. He has been on the run since a spectacular escape from the
Medelln jail of Bella Vista in 1988.
Police said the killing of Mr Munoz Mosquera made it most unlikely that Mr
Escobar, who escaped from jail in July only 13 months after he had turned
himself in, would surrender for a second time.
Seven of the nine lieutenants who fled with Mr Escobar from the La Catedral
jail near Medelln have surrendered in the past two months. Press reports
have predicted that Mr Escobar also would turn himself in again soon.
Meanwhile, seven soldiers have been found guilty of helping Mr Escobar
escape from prison and will be sentenced next week.
Three former army officers also are accused of aiding the escape. Col
Hernando Navas was fired as national prisons director. Col Homero Rodrguez,
former director of the prison, and Col Jorge Rodrguez, former assistant
director, both resigned after the escape.
The three face civilian trials.

THE TWO leading candidates in the gubernatorial election in Puerto Rico next
week are locked in a very close race, with opinion polls suggesting a dead
heat.
Mr Pedro Rosello of the New Progressive Party has 43 per cent of popular
support, according to the most recent polls, against 41 per cent for his
main rival, Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza of the Popular Democratic Party.
The polls claim a 3.5 per cent margin of error.
The winner will be new to the governor's office on the Caribbean island,
which is a US possession. Mr Rafael Hernandez Colon, the incumbent, is not
standing for another term.
The third candidate, Mr Fernando Martn of the Puerto Rican Independence
Party, has the support of 5 per cent of the electorate, according to the
polls.
The outcome of the election will affect Puerto Rican attitudes in a
continuing debate on the island's political status.
The 3m people of the island are considering whether they want to remain a
Commonwealth of the US, become a state of the US, or seek political
independence.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: NEC sees upturn in market for
chips
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday sounded an
optimistic note on the outlook for the sector in the months ahead following
a period of weak demand and intense price competition that has eroded
profits throughout the electronics industry.
Mr Hajime Sasaki, senior vice-president, said that while the Japanese market
would be flat until the spring of next year, the industry would enjoy strong
demand from elsewhere. This is good news for Japanese industry, which is in
a deep recession and looking for signs of recovery.
Mr Sasaki said that the worst for the semiconductor industry was over. A
turning point was a decision by the US in August to levy anti-dumping duties
on dynamic random access memory chips imported from Korea.
This had caused American chip-users to place more orders with Japanese
suppliers and had placed a firm bottom on memory chip prices.
Mr Sasaki cited three other factors supporting the market: the shift of the
market away from one-megabit D-rams to four-megabit D-rams as the industry
standard; increased sales of personal computer boards and hard disk drives
because of the price war in the US; and restoration of balance between
supply and demand caused by restraint among producers.
Mr Sasaki was also optimistic about the outlook for demand for 16-megabit
chips. NEC now produces 100,000 of the chips a month, and may raise this to
500,000 a month by March next year.
NEC produced Y380bn (Dollars 3.1bn) worth of semiconductor devices in the
half-year to September, a 1 per cent rise from a year ago. It now expects to
product Y780bn for the entire fiscal year, or 3 per cent more than last
year.
NEC's pre-tax parent company pre-tax profits fell by 71 per cent to Y15.1bn
in the interim period.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest producer of
semi-conductor devices, yesterday announced plans to begin offering its
products to external customers.
Until now, IBM's huge chip plants in Europe, Japan and the US have served
only the company's internal needs.
The new focus of IBM's semi-conductor operations is the latest in a series
of sweeping changes within the company over the past year.
Last December, Mr John Akers, chairman, announced plans to transform IBM
into a 'federation of free-standing businesses.'
Unlike IBM's end-user product divisions, such as its personal computer
operation, the technology products division - which includes IBM's
semi-conductor production operations - has been largely hidden from public
view.
However, technology products generate annual revenue of about Dollars 8bn,
said Mr Michael Attardo, IBM vice-president and general manager of
technology products.
IBM's strategy in the semi-conductor market will be to compete as a supplier
of sub-systems, said Mr Attardo. 'This is because for some time most of the
chips that we have been delivering to internal customers are in the form of
sub-systems,' he said. 'We will focus on the information technology market
because those applications are IBM core competencies. Clearly, computers and
peripherals will be our initial market focus.'
IBM will be a significant new competitor for established semi-conductor
manufacturers.
However, Mr Attardo said that by entering the semi-conductor market place
now, at a point where US manufacturers are gaining ground in the world
market, will strengthen the US micro-electronics industry.

reflect recession

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-biggest US steel group, yesterday blamed
continuing recession and intense competition for increased third-quarter
losses.
The company posted a net loss of Dollars 72m, or 92 cents a share, on sales
which fell 9.8 per cent to Dollars 1.01bn. A year earlier, it had a deficit
of Dollars 60.6m, or 88 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.12bn.
Although the results were at the low end of expectations, shares in
Bethlehem Steel added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 in New York yesterday.
Bethlehem said its wider third-quarter deficit reflected lower realised
steel prices, an unfavourable change in product mix and higher employment
costs.
Mr Walter Williams, chairman, said: 'We expect that (the) intensely
competitive market will continue over the near-term and that we will not
return to profitability in the fourth quarter.' Mr Williams is retiring this
week and will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive by Mr Curtis
Barnette.
Third-quarter results from LTV, the US steel group which has been operating
for five years under the protection of bankruptcy courts, were also hurt by
depressed steel prices and higher employment costs. The company turned in an
underlying third-quarter net loss of Dollars 9.2m.
During the quarter, LTV posted a Dollars 625m gain on the sale of its
missiles and aircraft businesses to a group made up of Loral, Carlyle Group
and Northrop. This helped LTV report net income of Dollars 615.8m for the
three months to September 30.
A year earlier, LTV had net income of Dollars 115.5m, including an income
tax refund of Dollars 129.7m.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Occupancy rates up at London's top hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCUPANCY at London's higher-priced hotels is rising, but business elsewhere
in England is flat and the outlook remains depressed, according to a survey
by Horwath, the leisure consultancy, Michael Skapinker writes.
London hotels which charge more than Pounds 85 a night saw room occupancy
rise from 60 per cent in July last year to 69 per cent in July this year.
However, the capital's luxury hotels yesterday warned against reading too
much into July's improved figures. Mr Ramon Pajares, general-manager of the
Inn on the Park, said the market was too volatile for any hotel to say it
could see an improving trend.
He added that September had been a good month because of the Farnborough Air
Show, but October had been worse than last year. However, he said the
weakening of the pound against the dollar could result in an upturn in US
business after the presidential election.
The Savoy Group agreed it was too early to say the market had revived: 'To
say that we are cautiously optimistic would be jumping the gun.'
Medium-priced and cheap London hotels showed only marginal improvement.
Overall, room occupancy in London was 67 per cent in July, compared with 65
per cent last year. Room occupancy for the whole of England fell 2
percentage points to 60 per cent. Hoteliers saw little prospect of
improvement.
Respondents describing themselves as pessimistic or very pessimistic rose to
47 per cent, compared with 34.1 per cent three months previously. Asked if
the downturn in the industry had ended, 87 per cent said no, against 61.8
per cent three months previously. Only 6 per cent believed the industry
would recover fully over the next year.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Prince urges lessons in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCE of Wales yesterday said that Britain had much to learn from
France and Germany in education and training, and should do that rather than
'blame them for our problems'.
He said at a Business in the Community conference in Manchester: 'We do
ourselves no justice if we ignore that greater value is attached to
technical and vocational training, staying-on rates are higher, and better
apprenticeship arrangements prevail in some of our European partner
countries.'
He added: 'It is probably fair to say that, as a nation, we have not always
given education the priority it deserves.'
The Prince highlighted better vocational education as the main challenge.
Noting that the present resession was 'causing pain and difficulty' he
added: 'It has been particularly demoralising for those who have raised
their sights and been successful in further and higher education, only to
find that employment opportunities are still depressingly scarce.'
The Prince called for a concerted campaign to win the 'hearts and minds' of
business people, teachers, trainers, politicians and parents to the
importance of staying-on and achieving worthwhile qualifications.
He added, however, that the country needed 'the right package of support
measures: attainable but credible qualifications, appropriate courses, good
schools, and enlightened partnerships' between business, schools and the
community.
The Prince welcomed the new range of vocational qualifications coming on
stream, which are the government's answer to the problems he highlighted -
but he also stressed the importance of history, literature, art and drama to
'education for life'.

THE president of El Salvador has committed his government to follow the UN

secretary-general, said last night, AP reports from New York and San
Salvador.
The statement followed reports that President Alfredo Cristiani had sent a
long and confusing letter to Mr Boutros Ghali, giving qualified approval to
the UN peace plan.
The UN chief said the president had given a commitment that the government
will continue to implement its obligations under the UN agreements, subject
to continuing consultations on one unspecified point, and that it will do
nothing which could obstruct the objective of ending the armed conflict as
quickly as possible.
However, reports from El Salvador said that Mr Cristiani's letter objected
to reduction of the Salvadorean armed forces so as to purge officers
identified as death squad members or human rights abusers. plan.
Mr Cristiani is under intense pressure from extreme-right elements in his
country to reject the UN peace plan.
Salvadorean left-wing rebels announced yesterday they would demobilise on
Saturday another 1,700 fighters, as a show of support for the UN plan to
advance the peace process.
About 3,400 rebels, or 40 percent of them, would remain armed past the
weekend.

MR Gustavo Loyola, a 39-year-old economist, has been nominated as the new

Mr Loyola has spent the last 15 years in the Central Bank.
He succeeds Mr Francisco Gros, an internationally respected banker, who many
were hoping would remain. Despite lobbying for Mr Gros by the economy and
planning ministers, Mr Franco insisted that he was too closely associated
with the previous government's policy of high interest rates.
The departure of Mr Gros could signal a relaxation of monetary policy.

FT  29 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sun sells L &amp; M holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE assurance group London &amp; Manchester (L &amp; M) was the market's heaviest
traded stock after Sun Alliance, the big composite insurance company, sold
most of its long-standing near 9 per cent stake in the life group.
The deal was executed via a 'bought deal' carried out jointly by Cazenove
and SG Warburg Securities. Cazenove/Warburg paid 252p a share for the 9.5m L
&amp; M shares and placed them with institutions at 255p a share, indicating a
profit of Pounds 285,000 for the two brokers. L &amp; M eased 6 to 264p as news
of the placing circulated. Turnover reached 23m shares.
The Cazenove/Warburg Securities alliance has been very active in most recent
insurance sector deals. The two broking firms jointly carried out the
placing of 60m shares in Commercial Union for Sun Alliance in September,
also via a bought deal, while Cazenove singly placed a Canadian Refuge's 10
per cent stake in Refuge Assurance earlier this month. In another joint
bought deal this month the pair netted a profit of more than Pounds 1.3m by
buying and selling a 9 per cent stake in Anglian Water previously held by
Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Sun Alliance has held the L &amp; M stake in its non-life fund since 1965 and is
thought to have retained a block of about 1m shares in L &amp; M shares in its
life assurance fund. Sun Alliance shares edged up to 317p on turnover of
1.6m.
Marks disappoints
A sense of disappointment pervaded the market as it assessed interim results
from Marks and Spencer and marked the shares back in heavy trading of 11m.
While the high street retailer turned in commendable figures largely in line
with market expectations, it was the continued gloomy outlook for consumer
spending that depressed many analysts. This is likely to pin back the
group's prospects significantly, as its margin increase shows signs of
decline and sales growth is pushed to the fore.
There was also a view that the shares were on too high a rating, having run
ahead in recent weeks ahead of yesterday's results. This, together with the
market's cautious view on Marks' sales prospects, left the shares adrift 15
1/2 at 327 1/2 p, amid a flurry of downgrades and, in some cases, a change
of sentiment. Among these, Nomura, moving from a hold to a sell, chopped its
full-year forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 735m, while Smith New Court
slashed it by Pounds 20m to Pounds 710m.
Pearson setback
Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson suffered a double hit yesterday
as two influential securities houses pre-empted visits to the company and
voiced concern over trading prospects. Agency broker James Capel cut
forecasts while Smith New Court reinforced its sell stance.
When the shares began to fall in the morning there was speculation that
Pearson's broker, Cazenove, was behind the weakness. Cazenove never comments
publicly on market rumour.
However, James Capel cut its 1992 forecast by Pounds 14m to Pounds 144m, not
the bottom of the range but well below the consensus. Capel says the group's
oil services division continues to suffer, and that it expects no good news
from the regional newspaper arm which it will visit today. Meanwhile, Smith
said it was reviewing its estimate and suggested it would be coming down to
between Pounds 140m and Pounds 145m. Pearson shares fell 31 to 342p with
1.8m traded.
A volatile day's trading saw British Aerospace shares close steady at 138p
as contrary rumours buffeted the embattled electronics to engineering group.
The shares were off 11 in early trading as fresh doubts were reported via
the Continental press concerning the future of the European Fighter Aircraft
project. They then recovered on reports that an official Saudi Arabian news
agency quoted a government source as being positive about the future of the
lucrative Al-Yamamah contract.
Turnover was a chunky 11m, with most of this accounted for by two large
trades of 4.3m shares each, one at 133p a share and the other at 134p.
Food equipment manufacturer APV was the subject of downgrades from two
brokers and the shares retreated 5 1/2 to 78p. Delta too was hit by a
revision, this time by Kleinwort Benson. The shares fell 24 to 389p.
HSBC were extremely active again in the banking sector, closing a net 4 off
at 500p, on turnover of 8.6m that included a trade of 3m shares at 500p.
A recent broker's buy recommendation continued to drive the insurance
broking sector higher. Lloyd Thompson was the star performer in the sector,
adding 15 more to 238p while Lowndes Lambert rose 6 to 277p.
The water/electricity utilities continued to move up strongly, responding
still to the positive note issued by County NatWest and belief that these
sectors were oversold during last week's surge of demand towards the
cyclical stocks.
County said it expected the water sector to outperform the electricity
stocks because of the more attractive interim/final dividend split and the
fact that the water companies' interim season starts next week, before an
electricity sector that is still facing scrutiny from the industry
regulator.
Thames, biggest of the water companies by market capitalisation, jumped 13
to 480p on 1.4m traded, Anglian 10 to 449p on 1m, and Severn Trent 9 to
433p. Southern Electric, the only regional electricity stock in the Footsie
100, put on 9 to 396p on turnover of 1.9m.
British Airways fell 14 1/2 to 281p as Kleinworth Benson chopped its
forecast combined with worries over the possibility of a rights issue to
fund the Dan-Air takeover.
BT 'old' shares slipped 4 more to 364 1/2 p on 4.5m traded and the 'new' 3
down at 260 1/2 p, on 3.8m, still unsettled by worries that the UK
Government may move to sell its remaining 21 per cent stake in the company
next year.
A good set of figures from Wellcome was not enough to lift the share price,
which fell 15 to 985p. The full-year profit was in the middle of the range
of forecasts.
Glaxo experienced very heavy turnover boosted by the arrival of one investor
offloading 2.8m shares at 776 1/2 p, well below the market price. The shares
closed 4 off at 799p on total turnover of 12m.
Pharmaceuticals and chemicals company ICI shed 23 at 1050p as County NatWest
reinforced pessimism over prospects ahead of third-quarter results due
today. County expects ICI profits to drop by nearly a half to Pounds 105m
and those for the year so far to be down by 25 per cent at Pounds 525m.
Chemicals group BOC fell 9 to 694p as Credit Lyonnais Laing issued a sell
recommendation and shaved its 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds
385m.
Specialist chemicals group Croda put on 7 at 217p. Analysts said the company
had been seeing shareholders.
In the drinks sector, Guinness tumbled 16 to 533p on weak third-quarter
figures from French group LVMH, which has a 24 per cent cross-holding.
Reuters Holdings lost 22 at 1198p as BZW dropped its profit forecast for
next year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 440m.
Analyst Mr Paul Norris said revenue growth would be flat at 5 per cent and
the group would be affected by continuing weakness in Japan and the UK. He
added that although Reuters was still in good shape, the shares were not
worth buying until they fell to 1150p.
Bank note printer De La Rue fell 23 to 636p on low turnover as at least one
big securities house advised clients that the shares had moved up too far.

FT  29 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit downgrades hurt share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate optimism was discouraged both in Frankfurt and London
yesterday, and the UK stock market backed away ahead of tonight's important
policy speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the
exchequer.
The downward slide accelerated following a spate of profit downgradings by
securities analysts, with ICI hit hard by predictions that today's trading
statement will disclose a fall of about one quarter in earnings for the
first nine months of this year.
The renewed cutback in profit forecasts came across the range of the
industrial share sectors and reflected the perception that the recession in
the UK may plumb new depths. One of the leading UK investment banks regards
this week's heavy cutback in production by British Steel as a warning for
the markets.
Share prices opened lower and losses were quickly extended after hopes of a
rapid cut in German interest rates were dashed by the unchanged minimum
lending rates at this week's Bundesbank repurchase tender. The Bank of
England's policies in the London money markets appeared to emphasise its
message of the previous day - that no cut in UK rates was in the offing. The
implications of this check to City hopes of another early cut in domestic
interest rates was underlined by an interim trading statement from Marks and
Spencer, one of Britain's leading high street clothing and food retailers.
Although Marks' interim profits were higher, the board warned that consumer
confidence remains low and that the second half of the year will be
overshadowed by the effects on retail spending of persisting high
unemployment levels in the UK.
At least two trading programmes were identified in the market, with the
first one clearly weighted towards the sell side but the second apparently
more evenly balanced. However, once the bad news was in the market, shares
steadied in London, helped both by a much-improved performance from sterling
and also by a calm opening to the new session on Wall Street. At the close,
the FT-SE Index stood at 2,650.4 for a final loss on the day of 19.4 points.
Seaq volume of 517.2m shares, taking in at least one large share placing,
compared with 551m in the previous session when retail business was worth
Pounds 1bn, a return to the high volume levels of recent days.
The stock market is effectively on hold ahead of tonight's Mansion House
speech from the UK chancellor, in which he is expected to outline the
government's economic policies in the wake of Britain's departure from the
ERM network. But the stock market perceives that the chief test for
government strategies will not come until next week when the Maastricht
proposals will be debated in parliament.
However, few City analysts expect Mr Lamont to announce a cut in UK base
rates tonight; most believe that the next reduction in base rates will be
held back until the autumn economic statement. Yesterday's recovery in
sterling, which fell sharply at the beginning of the week, is likely to
provide a suitable stage for a reduction in UK base rates.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES dealers hung fire ahead of the chancellor of the exchequer's
keynote speech tonight, writes Peter John.
One trader summed up the general view with the comment: 'Everyone knows the
market is going to move but nobody can decide which way.'
The FT-SE 100 index contract for December delivery saw interest in the
morning but activity petered out and, by the official close, only 6,653 lots
had been dealt.
December opened marginally off and was subsequently sold down to 2,680, its
low of the day. By the 4.10pm close it had rallied to 2,683, a net fall of
27 on the day. The premium above fair value (currently around 20) narrowed
to 12.
The polarisation of views on the short-term future of the economy was
reflected in the day's business. Dealers optimistic for a rate cut were
matched by those who argue that lower interest rates have been factored into
the market and, without a cut, the market will focus on political
uncertainty and fall sharply.
Business was brisker in traded options, where more than 31,000 contracts
were traded, a big increase over the past two days once extraordinary
individual trades are deducted. J. Sainsbury, a very good performer in the
underlying market and now at the top of its trading range, was the top stock
option with nearly 2,500 lots dealt.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Body blow surprises and Monopoly for real - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRYING GAME Neil Jordan
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS James Foley
UNLAWFUL ENTRY Jonathan Caplan
BOOMERANG Reginale Hudlin
MON PERE CE HEROS Gerard Lauzier
In the cinema true surprises are rare, formulary plot twists ten-a-penny. We
all know the standards: the political conspiracy romp in which the nice old
senator proves to be an assassins' ringleader; or the spy movie in which Our
Man turns out to be Their Man; or, in this week's films, the cop thriller
with the handsome policeman unmasked as a fiend in blue (Unlawful Entry) and
the romantic comedy (Boomerang) with the girl next door beating the upmarket
glamourpuss to Eddie Murphy's affections.
Neil Jordan's The Crying Game has a surprise that truly surprises - a
body-blow surprise - and we critics are asked not to reveal it. Problem: the
film is unreviewable without doing so. Solution: you the reader, if planning
to see the film, should jump this review until you have done so. You Have
Been Warned.
In Ireland a black British soldier (Forest Whitaker) kidnapped by IRA
terrorists strikes up a nervous friendship with his guard (Stephen Rea). The
soldier recalls his girlfriend in London and asks the guard to look after
her if he dies. When the soldier does die the IRA man debunks to keep the
tryst. An initially chaste romance begins, disturbed only when the
girlfriend (Jaye Davidson) is revealed to be no girl at all. One night the
camera pans down the disrobing body to show the shock-horror evidence.
The message of The Crying Game seems clear. Nothing is what it appears to
be; nobody is glibly reducible to type. In war preconceptions are the
currency of cruelty. (By simplifying your enemy's identity, how much easier
to dispose of him). And in love sexuality has a runaway habit of defying
expectation and categorisation.
No recent film has boasted more intriguing themes and Jordan sets up his
story with skill. The rancid glitter of the fairground where the soldier is
captured; the sun-pierced forest where the IRA's unmerry men bait their
captive; the nervous swap-shop of stories and confidences between Rea and
Whitaker.
Early on, the story's minutiae as well as its main lines are luminously
precise: from the surreal tenderness of Whitaker's cricket-sweatered
flashback images of his beloved to the poignancy of the prisoner's hood that
conceals his face but amplifies his sorrow.
But when the film reaches London it becomes wrapped in a motivational
miasma. Either side of his pivotal surprise, Jordan's weakness for enigma
fogs the story and characters. How does our IRA terrorist turn so fast from
nerveless freedom-fighter to romantic softie? And how is it we know so
little about the emotions of Dil (the girl-boy), including his exact
reaction to an ex-lover's death?
Jordan either underdirected or overcast newcomer Jaye Davidson, who drifts
through his role's androgyne mysteries in a bewildered monotone. He might be
in a different movie from Miranda Richardson as the hero's IRA nemesis, a
high-gloss Mata O'Hari sweeping in from Ireland to play the film's devil ex
machina. And both might be in a different movie from Adrian Dunbar's
chilling low-key terrorist leader, born in the grainy intimism of an IRA
docudrama.
A film about the many-facetedness of human life ends up too many-faceted for
its own artistic life. The Crying Game reaches its climax in a flurry of gun
play and multiplying corpses. But long before that we have been lost in the
crossfire between mystery thriller and message movie, between Antonioni
enigma and mean-streets melodrama.
I never saw David Mamet's play Glengarry Glen Ross on stage, but on screen
it goes off like several dozen Fourth of July rockets. Each rocket cluster
is played by a famous actor - Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed
Harris, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce - and director James Foley goes around
lighting the blue touchpapers. Meanwhile the set, the offices of a
semi-crooked Chicago real estate firm, is lit from outside by hellish city
lights plus the odd storm.
This is Death Of A Salesman for the dying blaze of yuppie glorification: a
satire on confidence-trickster consumerism, with six characters in search of
the telephone deal of their lives. Can they con Mr and Mrs Middle America
into buying their half-developed slabs of land? And can they earn the
incentive prizes promised by the boss. First prize, a Cadillac. Second
prize, a set of steak knives. Third prize, 'You're fired.'
The talk is non-stop, yet the film is never non-filmic. If movie performing
is about acting between the lines, we gasps at the skill shown here by
actors inserting the swiftest visual subtexts into millisecond pauses.
Pacino is a human lizard batting reptile eyelids and hissing virtuoso
cadenzas of scorn. Lemmon is a modern Willy Loman, a crumpled jacket with a
crumbling ego gesturing somewhere inside. And the ensemble around them play
Mamet's game of Monopoly-for-real as if their lives depended on it.
'Being a policeman is all about helping people' says patrolman Ray Liotta in
Unlawful Entry. Ah yes. We the audience, of course, know better. We know
that if Mr Liotta is a helpful policeman Ross Perot is the next President of
the United States. Mr L has been investigating the case of the black prowler
who attacked pretty housewife Madeline Stowe before fleeing into the night.
One evening Liotta takes Stowe's husband Kurt Russell along for a patrol
ride and whom should they run into but the culprit? Liotta stands by with a
sweet smile and tells an unhappy Russell to beat the fellow up.
Things get worse. Liotta is soon chasing Miss Stowe, sabotaging Russell's
career and reviewing such extracurricular possibilities as rape and murder.
Jonathan Kaplan (The Accused) directed and Lewis Colick wrote this suave
little screamer, which only disintegrates into tin-whistle noises at the end
when too many coincidences are invoked to get Stowe, Liotta and a loaded gun
together in the same room.
Boomerang, the new Eddie Murphy comedy, has a plot that flies out
promisingly into the firmament and then returns to knock out the entire
cast. We are asked to believe that Mr Murphy, playing a marketing exec for a
cosmetics firm, is black America's most wanted man: wanted by man-eating
model Grace Jones, here resembling a sex-starved Easter Island statue, and
by Eartha Kitt, here resembling a caricature of Eartha Kitt. He is even
wanted, for the film's central on-off romance, by gorgeous but capricious
tycoon Robin Givens.
This trio of femme fatales keeps the film airborne for about half an hour.
Then the jokes run out and Mr Murphy is given flight descent instructions by
Hollywood romantic protocol. He must fall for the girl next-door, or
next-office (Halle Berry), and the film must fall headlong with him.
Reginald Hudlin, late of the shoestring comedy hit House Party, directed:
which only shows that enlarged budgets and enlarged stars guarantee no
enlargement of wit or invention.
What week would be complete without Gerard Depardieu? Having just discovered
America, the beefy star is back in Gerard Lauzier's Mon Pere Ce Heros. The
story is nugatory. A divorced father takes his teenage daughter (Marie
Gillain) to a Pacific holiday resort and watches her grow up, swarmed around
by boys. But all you need to turn a routine French comedy into a
near-masterpiece is to roll out the human barrel. Here he is, lank of hair,
fat as a malmsey butt, exuding charm, wit and passionate nonchalance. No
other movie actor today can so regularly turn the humdrum into the
humdinging.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Montreal's exciting 'Musici' - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 14-strong string orchestra, I Musici de Montreal, is new on the
international scene - inaugurated in 1983 but only now launched on its
first-ever European tour. After a brief visit to its home city last April
David Murray relayed his enthusiasm for the band to FT readers. Tuesday's
concert at St John's, Smith Square, allowed us to share that enthusiasm: it
was a big, heartening success.
The name may be silly and pretentious (why the Italo-French mixture?) but
everything else about the orchestra leaves an impression of remarkable
directness, authority and distinct personality. The performances, all
strongly defined, gain their particular character from an unstinting
vitality in the fat-free corporate sound and the urgent involvement of every
player in producing that sound.
I Musici de Montreal were formed by the Russian emigre cellist Yuly
Turovsky, who conducts with a baton when not playing as cello soloist. He is
a passionately excitable musician: he encouraged his players to deliver
Schoenberg's string sextet Verklarte Nacht (in its orchestral expansion)
across a dramatically wide dynamic range - from all-but-inaudible soft
phrases to vibrant loud - and with a full-frontal boldness of attack that
most British groups would find hard to equal.
It was all a touch swoony and splurgy, lacking both the soft-grained warmth
and the unforced approach to musical unfolding that we tend to think of as
natively Viennese; but, taken on its own terms, it afforded a thrilling
experience. The account of the Tchaikovsky Souvenirs de Florence can be
similarly described - the slow-movement dialogue between solo violin
(Eleonora Turovsky, wife of the conductor and leader of the orchestra) and
cello was squeezed out with stop-start pacing and throbbingly intense tone,
but here the style seemed much more naturally idiomatic.
Three arrangements of Bloch pieces (by whom?) for cello solo and strings, in
which the rapport between Turovsky and his accompanists was beautifully
demonstrated, and a trimly cut Adagio and Rondo by the Canadian Jacques Hetu
rounded out an excellently varied programme.
European tour of I Musici de Montreal assisted by the Government of Canada
and the Culutral Affairs Ministry of the Province of Quebec; St John's,
Smith Square concert supported by Teleglobe)

ITV brings yet another batch of Rumpole Of The Bailey, one of the most
memorable characters ever created specifically for television. However, much
as we all wish him to carry on, would it not be a good idea if, once in a
while, creator John Mortimer could produce a script which did not rely upon
coincidental themes at work and at home? Today there is collusion to replace
Rumpole in chambers while at home Hilda suspects she is about to be replaced
by another woman (9.00).
BBC2's sequence of documentaries about life in Britain today, Present
Imperfect (9.30), turns to that peculiar British institution, the transport
'caff'. What with motorway service stations and Little Chefs, 'caffs' are
becoming fewer and further between, and a good thing too, some will say.
Channel 4 is showing three short American TV dramas, Women And Men which,
for reasons best known to themselves, they have collectively labelled a
'film' (10.00). The scripts are adapted from stories by Mary McCarthy,
Dorothy Parker and Ernest Hemingway, and the directors are Frederic Raphael,
Ken Russell, and Tony Richardson (yes, all British).

FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Tara Arts, where East meets West - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How very satisfying to find Tara Arts staging a co-production with the
Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Tara Arts, lest you need reminding, is the
British Asian theatre company whose versions of Tartuffe and The Little Clay
Cart has played so happily at the National Theatre and elsewhere; and the
Theatre Royal, Stratford East, has one of the liveliest, and most culturally
mixed, audiences in Britain. Part of the fun in watching Heer Ranjha, their
latest Tara production, at Stratford East is to see how well the company's
vivid performing style works here, and to hear the speed and ease with which
many of its viewers respond.
If Tara Arts is new to you, Heer Ranjha is a good primer in their style,
which commutes so fluently between Western and Asian elements that it fuses
them into one. This particular staging also commutes loveably between high
drama and low comedy, between noble utterance ('Suffer me to kiss your hand
and foot') and colloquial talk. And - never underrate this, you highbrows -
it has a good story, about how the deep love between Heer and her father's
cowherd Ranjha is threatened by her family, which successfully manages to
part the two lovers with one catastrophe after another. One of the two
musicians keeps up a lively, varied supply of music on Indian drums and
guitar.
If you have seen some previous Tara productions, you may well find Heer
Ranjha touching, entertaining, but occasionally disappointing. Let me attend
now to the disappointments. There is too much mugging and cuteness from
secondary characters; and there are moments when some of them suddenly
switch into broad London accents to make rude remarks about other characters
('What are you waiting for - bloody Christmas?'): too cheap, too
inconsistent a ploy. The music sometimes makes it hard to hear the words;
and the synthesised sound effects that one musician produces from his
electronic keyboard add a horridly unspontaneous aura to events. Some of the
Indian accents here, exaggerated for comic effect, reach the point of
impenetrability. David KS Tse, playing Ranjha, is a lightweight who works
too forcefully to compensate for his lack of heroism.
All in all, though, this show is endearing. Shelley King, with her sharp,
lined, wicked face and her sly, low voice, is an unlikely type to play the
heroine Heer; but she is a commanding figure, and becomes the embodiment of
dignity and devotion. Nirmal Chandra Pandey plays the river Chenab and other
roles with beautiful authority. Magdalen Rubalcava's designs are always
picturesque and evocative. Jatinder Verma and Christopher Shackle have
turned the original 1759 Varis Shah text into a marvellous English theatre
piece, constantly changing in mood. Verma, who is also the founder and
artistic director of Tara Arts, also directs. Thanks to his flair for true
entertainment, the Tara spell seldom falters.
At the Theatre Royal, Stratford East till November 21.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Ballet Teatro Espanol - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programme which introduces Rafael Aguilar's Ballet Teatro Espanol to us
begins well. Aguilar's gloss on The House of Bernarda Alba is austerely set:
six black-costumed women (Dragon-Mama and her five daughters) placed in a
shadowy setting, with a crucifix and three skeletal doorways. The action, no
less severe, stresses the mother's dominant presence (Manuela Aguilar like a
particularly tough wardress) which governs every step made by the daughters.
Gregorian chant alternates with guitar and voice, as the chatter of feet and
constrained gestures establish the social barriers that hem this household
in. The women, with some subtlety, expose their tensions and unhappiness.
Only Eva Morena as the rebel daughter is allowed an extended and frankly
stated solo as exploration of her sexual frustration - to which Miss Morena
give a bold physical edge. The piece is pungent, well danced.
What, then, to make of the succeeding Bolero, where Mr Aguilar uses Ravel's
detestable exercise in orchestration as a basis for something to excite a
coach-party on the Costa del Cheapo? It is a down-market version of Bejart's
exercise in erotic kitsch - something to set the mind reeling - performed by
a disgruntled chorus attendant upon the central figure of Victor Muro. Mr
Muro is bare-chested, gets very heated emotionally and physically, and is
given to pelvic thrusts which suggest that he has a Crown Derby tea-service
lodged somewhere about his person. Were the whole thing not so awful, and so
inept, it might be funny. Ideally it should be re-staged with Julian Clary
as the soloist: he would know what to do with this rancid paella.
The programme, which I saw on Tuesday, ends with the statutory outburst of
Flamenco gaiety. All very predictable in its flaring temperaments - manic
depression must be a career among the gypsy tribes - it boasts two fine
guitarists (Juan Soto; Paco Arriaga) and a lovely girl, whom I cannot alas
identify, her shawl-draped body rising in ravishing curves from the froth of
her ruffled train in a mysterious Peteneras. But the real, rough,
burn-the-throat flamenco draught is poured by the singer Rosario Ortiz,
keening with a force to shatter glass, and stamping and strutting with a raw
bravado that could shatter the stage. Uncompromising and uncompromised
stuff, and tremendous.
Ballet Teatro Espanol is at Sadler's Wells until October 31.

FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities firmer after late
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices firmed yesterday afternoon in spite of some bad economic
news and disappointing earnings reports, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 15.67 to close at 3,251.40, with most
of the gains coming in the last minutes of trading. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also higher, up 1.64 at 420.13, while the Amex
composite was up 2.35 at 379.00 and the Nasdaq composite 4.44 firmer at
601.39. Turnover on the NYSE was 203m shares as rises outpaced declines by
1012 to 713.
The morning's economic releases were mostly negative: while consumer
spending and personal income both rose 0.7 per cent last month, special
factors, partly related to Hurricane Andrew, distorted the figures. Some
analysts said that the overall picture was one of continued weakness.
The 0.4 per cent fall in durable goods orders in September was also worrying
as the market had been expecting a small rise.
Some of the earnings reports were equally unsettling. Ford dropped Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 38 1/8 in turnover of nearly 2m shares after announcing a
loss of Dollars 159m, or 43 cents a share, in the third quarter. The figures
were well below analysts' estimates of around 25 cents a share, and the
company also warned that the losses could continue into the fourth quarter.
Borden fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 after announcing a net loss for the
quarter of Dollars 376.8m, a marked deterioration from the Dollars 98m
profit earned a year earlier. The loss was incurred, however, after the
company took a Dollars 450m restructuring charge that will help pay for the
closure of some packaging plants in Europe and the withdrawal from some
North American snacks operations.
Better news was forthcoming from USF&amp;G, which rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
12 1/4 after the insurance group unveiled consolidated net income of Dollars
5m in the third quarter, an improvement on the Dollars 25m loss at the same
stage in 1991. The company also reported a continued improvement in its core
property/casualty operations.
Tandem Computers climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in after Morgan
Stanley, the securities house, responded to the recent good earnings figures
by raising its profit forecast for Tandem's current fiscal year and
upgrading its rating on the stock.
Life Re enjoyed a strong debut. More than 10m shares of the reinsurer were
floated at Dollars 22 each, and reached Dollars 24 7/8 at the end of the
day.
Airlines remained strong, in spite of further competitive price-cutting.
AMR, parent of American, rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 64 1/4 and UAL held
steady at Dollars 121 3/8 although Delta slid Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 58 3/8
, reversing its morning gains.
Canada
TORONTO stocks rallied to end sharply higher as uncertainty surrounding
Canada's constitution fades and investors focus on the economy and potential
declines in interest rates.
Volume on the TSE index swelled to its highest level since December 15,
1988, ending up 48.3 points at 3,334.7 on turnover of 48.3m valued at
CDollars 495.5m.
Advancing issues led those declining 370 to 194 while 262 remained
unchanged.

FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Threat of dividend cuts haunts
chemicals sector - The European companies at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Continued difficulties in the global chemicals industry have increased the
possibility of a round of dividend cuts among European chemicals companies
this year. Those with the greatest exposure to bulk chemicals, such as
Germany's BASF and DSM of the Netherlands, appear to be most at risk.
A gloomy announcement from the German chemical industry association earlier
this month led to a rash of broker downgrades of earnings and dividend
forecasts.
Mr Wolfgang Hilger, the association's president and also the head of
Germany's Hoechst, said that profits of German chemical companies plunged by
more than 30 per cent in the first nine months of 1992, and that there were
still no signs of improvement in the sector.
Most chemicals analysts had been cautious about the sector since the
beginning of the year, but Mr Hilger's statement was pitched below even
their low expectations, and confirmed their fears that dividends would have
to be cut.
BASF, whose earnings are the most vulnerable of the three German majors
because of the severity of the commodity chemical downturn, is widely
expected to cut its dividend again this year. The company's plans to reduce
its employee bonuses and cut 9 per cent of the workforce at its troubled
magnetic recording division were both taken as indications that a cut was in
the offing.
Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt and Goldman Sachs in London expect BASF
to cut its dividend to DM9 from last year's DM12. CSFB and Robert Fleming
are forecasting a DM2 reduction to DM10, while Hoare Govett is more
optimistic with its forecast of DM11.
Regarding Bayer and Hoechst, DB Research expects a fall of DM2 for both
companies to DM11 and DM10 respectively. UK brokers polled are expecting
Bayer to hold its payout steady or only to drop it by DM1, owing to the
defensive qualities of its pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals divisions.
However, for Hoechst, which has the biggest exposure to the US of the three,
a fall of up to DM2 is predicted.
The German stock market has already started to discount the possibility of
dividend cuts in the chemical sector, athough the companies themselves are
unlikely to announce the 1992 payout until early 1993.
This has been reflected in the shares of all three, which fell back to their
lows for the year in late September. Analysts say that the dividend issue is
likely to grow in importance if the companies' third-quarter results, due in
the second half of November, are weaker than expected.
Although the sector's outlook remains bleak, some analysts believe that the
downside risk of shares in BASF, Hoechst and Bayer is limited to 10 per
cent, since the prospect of lower interest rates in Germany will make their
dividend yields that much more attractive to investors, especially domestic
holders who benefit from a tax credit. Indeed, their shares recovered
recently on signs that the Bundesbank was about to ease money market rates.
The axe is also hanging over the dividend of Holland's DSM, although at a
recent analysts' meeting the management indicated strongly that it would
like to maintain the dividend if at all possible. CSFB believes that the
company might well do so, although it remains a close call and would mean
paying an uncovered dividend in 1993.
Robert Fleming warns that if DSM keeps its dividend at last year's Fl 8, its
payout ratio will rise to a high 84 per cent of earnings. This, and the
company's vulnerability to the petrochemicals cycle, has prompted the broker
to reduce its dividend forecast for DSM to Fl 5, which would bring the ratio
down to 53 per cent.
Akzo, on the other hand, is expected to keep its 1992 dividend steady at Fl
6.50, and CSFB, Robert Fleming and Goldman Sachs expect the company to raise
it to Fl 7 next year if it achieves an increase in earnings.
Akzo's pharmaceutical operations, as well as its specialty chemicals,
coatings and fibres activities, give it a higher gearing to an economic
upturn than DSM. Similarly defensive qualities have made the share price of
Henkel, the German consumer-oriented, applied chemicals company, one of the
best performers in the sector this year. Consequently, Henkel may be the
only one to raise its dividend.

FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Downturn in futures
sends Nikkei lower
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE equities fell back in late-afternoon trading as enthusiasm waned
after a fall in the futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 116.85 to 17,068.41, having risen to the day's high
of 17,306.02 on buying by dealers on the first day of trading for November
accounts. Higher bond prices also fuelled hopes of lower interest rates,
prompting buying by investment trusts.
However, a downturn in futures prices prompted position unwinding, and the
index fell to the day's low of 17,068.30 just before the close.
Volume improved marginally to 200m shares from 150m. Declines led advances
by 491 to 410, with 200 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
sections fell 5.14 to 1,292.39 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
3.21 to 1042.37.
Traders said that while overall buying interest among investors remained
low, hopes of lower interest rates were still providing underlying support.
Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said that lower interest rates towards the
end of the year could prompt a rally among interest rate-sensitive issues,
especially non-life insurers, which have remained low relative to the
Nikkei.
Dealers bought theme stocks for quick profits, but the lack of interest
among investors triggered a sell-off towards the end of the day. Aisin
Seiki, the day's most active issue, fell Y10 to Y1,150 and Nikken Chemicals
lost Y40 to Y1,120.
Some investors sought 'defensive' food stocks, which are unaffected by
currency movements. Traders said that the recent trend for businessmen to
eat at home would push up demand for foodstuffs. Kagome, the ketchup maker,
gained Y30 to Y1,050 and Nichirei Y16 to Y674.
Housing stocks rose on reports of a 28.3 per cent increase in mortgage loans
for individuals by the Housing Loan Corporation in the third quarter. Misawa
Homes rose Y90 to Y1,100 and Taisei Prefab gained Y40 to Y2,040.
Gajoen Kanko, the hotel operator, failed to trade owing to the lack of
buyers and closed at an offered price of Y201, down from Monday's close of
Y281. The issue was suspended on Tuesday following reports of alleged window
dressing of its financial account for the year to February 1992. Investors
ignored the company's denials and rushed to place sell orders.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 27.50 to 18,771.43 in volume of 11.6m
shares. Small-lot buying by dealers pushed up the index despite the decline
in Tokyo.
Roundup
THE region's markets were mixed yesterday.
HONG KONG slid in the afternoon ahead of a statement by the governor, Mr
Chris Patten. The Hang Seng index fell 91.03 to 6,126.98 in low turnover of
HLDollars 2.5bn. After the close, Mr Patten denied that there had been an
agreement between London and Beijing in 1990 on the future of democracy in
the colony.
Sentiment was further un-settled by rumours of imminent share placements by
Citic Pacific and New World following Bank of East Asia's HKDollars 3.79bn
placement on Tuesday. Citic Pacific fell to HKDollars 13.40 before closing
unchanged at HKDollars 13.60.
SEOUL saw late institutional buying help the composite index to a gain of
1.24 at 585.34. Brokers commented that the market had earlier lost ground on
rumours, later denied, that the government was investigating whether Daewoo
group companies had subsidised the group chairman's political ambitions.
All 19 of Daewoo's listed shares went limit-down, with Daewoo Corporation
and Daewoo Heavy Industries both losing Won400 to Won8,700 and Won9,000
respectively.
BOMBAY was dragged down by heavy speculative selling ahead of the end of
account today. The BSE index fell 110.51 or 3.7 per cent to 2,876.70.
Brokers said carry-forward charges for the business done in the last three
weeks would rise to 3.5 per cent a month from 2 per cent because of a cash
shortage.
SINGAPORE saw Singapore Airlines foreign shares rise 80 cents at SDollars
15.10 despite reporting lower interim earnings. The Straits Times Industrial
index rose 0.97 to 1,391.88 in volume of 103.3m shares.
AUSTRALIA failed to get support from good inflation data as sentiment was
depressed by a weak domestic dollar. The All Ordinaries index fell 18.2 to
1,418.2 in turnover of ADollars 265.9m.
NEW ZEALAND was depressed by a statement from Fletcher Challenge that it
would find it difficult to match last year's profits. The NZSE-40 lost 2.66
to 1,380.78 in turnover of NZDollars 19m as Fletcher Challenge fell to an
all-time low, down 3 cents at NZDollars 1.73.

FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Company earnings woes upset
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about corporate earnings, combined with fading hopes on interest
rate cuts, depressed bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was hit by disappointing news from the luxury goods group LVMH and the
insurer UAP, and disappointment on the interest rate front. The CAC-40 index
fell 24.62 or 1.4 per cent to 1,749.86 in modest turnover of FFr2bn.
LVMH fell FFr231 or 6.1 per cent to FFr3,570 on news that sales in the third
quarter fell 7 per cent, and the company's forecast that 1992 net profit
would be close to 1991 due to a slowdown in growth in key markets and the
recent currency turmoil.
UAP dropped FFr19.50 or 4.8 per cent to FFr388 on news of a 59.5 per cent
fall in first-half net attributable profit. The shares were also depressed
by news that UAP would inject more than FFr1bn, the top end of market
forecasts, into its Banque Worms unit.
UAP's results upset Axa, which is due to report today. Its shares fell FFr31
to FFr780. Paribas fell another FFr6.50 to FFr324 as analysts downgraded
their 1992 earnings forecasts following Tuesday's news of the bank's
decision to knock FFr500m off the sale price of Ciments Francais.
FRANKFURT took the view that the Bundesbank will not cut interest rates at
today's council meeting and then fell sharply in late trading on rumours of
dividend cuts and downgrades in the banking sector. The DAX index closed
down 23.47, or 1.5 per cent at 1,510.30 as turnover rose to DM5.9bn from
DM4.6bn.
Although the market believed that there would be no cut in the Lombard rate
this week, after the Bundesbank left the securities repurchase tender
unchanged, some analysts held out for a cut by mid-November.
Rumours that Deutsche Bank might cut its dividend this year took its shares
down by DM17.30 to DM657.00. Dresdner Bank slipped DM12 to DM357 on rumours
that it planned a rights issue and that its earnings prospects had been
downgraded. Commerzbank was off DM7.00 at DM245.50.
Linotype went against the trend, rising DM23 to DM359, after saying that it
expected to pay a dividend and would show an operating profit this year.
MILAN rose in active trading, encouraged by the bigger-than-expected fall in
yields at the BOT auction. Stet and Sme, re-admitted to trading after
Tuesday's suspension, attracted the most attention. The Comit index rose
8.16 to 427.05 in turnover estimated at more than L200bn after L139.8bn.
Sme rose L111 or 2.3 per cent to L4,849. Dealers said the stock was in
demand on persistent hopes that Iri would sell its controlling stake, in
spite of recent denials, and that minority shareholders would be bought out.
Stet, which had recently fallen on news of its purchase of Finsiel, jumped
L120 or 9 per cent to L1,440. Its strength raised worries among some dealers
that the company might be preparing the ground for a rights issue.
Savings shares in Italmobiliare were temporarily delayed from trading for
excessive gains while the ordinary shares rose L1,770 or 5.3 per cent to
L35,300 after Tuesday's news on Ciments Francais.
ZURICH weakened, with chemicals depressed by an earnings downgrade on
Ciba-Geigy on Tuesday. The SMI index closed 18.4 lower at 1,909.0.
Ciba-Geigy registered shares lost SFr9 to SFr604 while the bearers were SFr7
lower at SFr620.
Nestle, rumoured to be interested in bidding for Sme of Italy, saw its
bearers down SFr10 at SFr1,010 while bearers in UBS, which reports
third-quarter figures today, lost SFr6 to SFr829.
AMSTERDAM reversed Tuesday's rise with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of
0.2 to 104.6. Philips, down 60 cents at Fl 19.60, began to be affected about
worries of disappointing third-quarter earnings next week. DSM, which
releases its interim figures today, rose 30 cents to Fl 85.00: expectations
are for third-quarter net profit of between Fl 70-80m, down from Fl 102m in
the same 1991 period.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.2 to 726.1. Turnover fell to
SKr302m from SKr402m. COPENHAGEN's all share index fell to a new year's low,
down 0.51 at 250.42 as the banking sector came under presure, writes Hilary
Barnes.
BRUSSELS, however, was lifted by banking stocks which rose on optimism about
interest rates. The Bel-20 index closed 5.25 higher at 1,135.21 in turnover
of BFr1bn.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Technology: The clones march on - The latest round in the PC
price battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid rise of 'no-name' personal computer manufacturers, with neither
reputation nor track record, has crystallised for most established
manufacturers the chaotic nature of the computer business today.
No-name manufacturers, mostly based in the Far East, make IBM PC clones.
Their systems are based on powerful components easily available from a broad
range of suppliers, but they are produced, in some cases, in garages and
bedrooms.
The products are basic but the prices are rock bottom in a market that is
driven by price alone. Already no-name manufacturers have more than 40 per
cent of the market, forcing larger and better-established makers to take
defensive action. The critical question is how to identify a viable market
segment and position both company and product to exploit it.
Pentium, the latest chip from Intel, America's leading microprocessor maker,
will make its debut next year, signalling yet another round in these
debilitating PC price wars. Intel has given its new microprocessor a name
rather than a number (it would be '586' if it followed strict sequence) to
prevent competing makers passing off ersatz copies of its chip as the real
thing.
In the PC business, however, the important numbers are concerned with
Intel's pricing policy. The slump in PC prices over the past 12 months is in
large part due to the way Intel has cut the cost of the microprocessor at
the heart of IBM-compatible PC systems.
A year ago a 33 megahertz 386DX chip cost Dollars 202 in quantities of
1,000; today, the same chip costs Dollars 118 in the same volume. Last year
a leading-edge 33 megahertz 486DX chip cost Dollars 445 in 1,000 part lots;
today the price is Dollars 328.
For some, the heat has already proved too great. Nippon Steel, the world's
largest steel producer, last month decided to pull out of the notebook
computer business in a reversal which underlines the savagery of the PC
price war now raging across Europe.
Seeking opportunities outside its traditional business, the Japanese company
last year announced controversial plans to market notebooks under the name
'Librex' in Europe and the US.
It was a move which illustrated how low barriers to the PC business have
become. Nippon focused on notebooks because it was the fastest-growing
market sector, and concentrated on the US and Europe because of the
dominance of NEC in the Japanese PC business.
Sales, however, have been poor - only 10,000 systems in just over a year.
Announcing a 'phased withdrawal' timed to end early next year, Nippon blamed
the depression, the downturn in the Japanese economy and the collapse in PC
prices for unsustainable losses.
Takashi Iwamoto, Nippon president, said the company had designed features
into its systems for which the market was not prepared to pay: 'The sector
of the market we wanted to enter disappeared,' he complained.
Some companies are putting their faith in customer services not available
from the clone manufacturers. Opus Technology, a privately owned UK company
which turned over Pounds 31m in 1991, builds IBM compatible computers - but
only to order. Its own research shows that of those customers who
experienced problems with their suppliers, almost 80 per cent complained of
a shortfall in service.
Adam Harris, managing director, says Opus's strategy is aimed at
guaranteeing customer satisfaction. He says the delay between receipt of an
order and delivery of a machine has been cut from four weeks to 10 days. The
company has a five-year licensing agreement with IBM giving Opus the legal
right to build and ship computers using IBM patented technology.
At the other end of the size spectrum, IBM is taking a blanket approach to
the market. It is offering four ranges under its own name and a fourth, in
Europe alone, under the trade name of Ambra. There is lively discussion
among dealers and distributors over whether IBM has confused or enlightened
the market through this strategy.
At the top end it offers its PS/2 premium range as the system of choice for
companies downsizing from mainframes to distributed and client server
systems.
Next there is the PS/Valuepoint range, designed to be competitive with
lower-priced Compaq, Dell and Olivetti machines. At about the same price is
the PS/1 range, aimed at the home and home office user.
Priced at least 10 per cent lower than any of these systems is the Ambra
range, marketed by a wholly-owned IBM subsidiary, Individual Computer
Products International; sourced from a variety of locations worldwide, these
machines compete directly with clones.
Giuseppe Giuliani, Ambra's managing director, says the company has already
shipped about 12,000 units since June to resellers in France and the UK and
should ship 50,000 units to resellers by the end of the year.
Giuliani is a realist, however, and accepts that nobody can predict how
further price reductions will affect the market over the next few months.
The important question is whether there are multiple segments in the
European market or only a premium level and the rest. 'If IBM and Compaq
come down to the third-tier price level in six months then we will
disappear,' Giuliani says.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Technology: Waging war against the paper chase - How a US
defence initiative could help the commercial sector trim development times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every working day, another billion pages are added to the piles of paper
stored in US businesses, which keep more than 95 per cent of their estimated
3,000bn documents in paper form.
Keeping on top of paper-based information can be a nightmare which, if it
turns into a paper chase, can seriously delay a new project's development as
time is wasted locating information and keeping up with design changes.
In the US Army the problem surfaced more than a decade ago when the
programme manager for the M-1 tank complained that a flood of paperwork and
unco-ordi-nated computer programs were crippling its development.
That prompted the US Defence Department to decide in 1985 that all new
weapon systems should be designed digitally. The decision looks likely to
have implications that go beyond the military sector.
Building a modern weapon system, or the aircraft in which it is fitted, is a
challenge that will be familiar to many commercial manufacturers. It
involves correlating hundreds of thousands of physical parts, units of
information and bits of paper to build specialised equipment in the quickest
and most efficient way, and control the materials needed for its
construction.
In January, California-based Computer Sciences Corporation, one of the
computer industry's largest independent professional services companies, was
awarded a contract from the Defence Department to develop a system that aims
to end the paper chase.
The system, known as Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistic Support
(J-Cals), is valued at Dollars 744m over 12 years if the US government
exercises all its options, and will link 245 military sites across the US.
CSC says it will enable the department to build, maintain and support weapon
systems without the traditional 'paper-laden' tools such as technical
manuals and engineering drawings.
The spin-off effect for the commercial and industrial sector is not lost on
I. Gary Bard, president of CSC's integrated systems division. 'The benefits
could be enormous,' he says. For every dollar spent on J-Cals, there could
be a return of five or six to one, and more if its implementation leads to a
re-engineering of the production process.
CSC's brief is to design a system which can access very different types of
data, from technical manuals to computer graphics, and capture and store the
information on an integrated database. 'Our job is to put everything
together,' says Bard. 'Already we have integrated 42 software packages.'
Bard sees five main features of J-Cals: first, it establishes a global data
management system, and has the ability to access data from different
'islands of automation' via a global data dictionary, and make it available
to engineers, designers and other staff concurrently.
Second, the system establishes a management system that allocates the tools
required to perform a function and works out priorities in a paperless
environment.
The other three characteristics are particularly important in defence, but
could be applied elsewhere, says Bard: acquisition, or bringing together all
the data for bidding and purchasing; providing a single source of technical
information and thus ensuring that everyone has access to changes; and
logistic support, a process of describing what happens to a part during its
lifetime, thus enabling a logistics analyst to decide where to put his
priorities.
The J-Cals solution is a sophisticated architecture based on open system
standards, and blends by a number of separate 'enabling technologies' -
everything from Cadcam to data compression and optical character
recognition.
Two of the most important are imaging and distributed database technologies,
to convert paper documents to electronic images and then make them widely
available via a nationwide network.
Among the benefits Bard sees from J-Cals are immense reductions in time  -
the data acquisition process for bidding and purchasing could be reduced to
a week from anything between four months and a year; fewer mistakes, because
the system is configured to ensure that parts are supplied to the right
equipment; and better-quality data.
There is an inevitable non-defence spin-off for CSC as the Defence
Department's 300,000 contractors will soon be required to deliver their
technical data in a format compatible with J-Cals, and many of these
companies have a separate industrial client base.
Already, CSC has won two important contracts in the US following its J-Cals
work - one for a big, unnamed defence contractor and the other with
Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment group.

Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, will have made no
friends for himself in South Africa's townships with his announcement this
week that he wants to appoint Lee Kuan Yew as an economic adviser to the
ANC. Singapore's former prime minister, now on a visit to the country, would
find few kindred spirits among the ANC's other economic advisers, many of
whom are Marxists - not to mention in the townships where the 'workers'
still expect to inherit the earth with the help of the ANC.
The choice reveals Mandela at his pragmatic best. He says openly that the
state of the South African economy, in its fourth year of recession,
frightens him silly. If it takes Lee Kuan Yew to get growth back on track,
so be it.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Observer: Bleeding hearts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When a letter pleading for funds dropped on the mat last week from Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, many US Republicans assumed that
the self-styled 'bleeding heart conservative' was cutting loose from the
sinking Bush ship to launch his own bid for 1996.
But the missive turns out to be a carefully disguised gesture of loyalty
towards a president who has repeatedly spurned Kemp's efforts to push a more
aggressive domestic policy. What it does show is the depth of the
Republicans' money troubles - which are further blighting a seemingly
hopeless campaign.
The Republican finance committee has apparently given up using Bush's name
to haul in the loot. While Kemp's letter repeatedly warns how disastrous it
would be for the Democrats to win, it mentions Bush just once, and then in
the past tense.
In the past two months, the normally flush Republicans have seen funds
dwindle to a trickle; donors have started to hedge their bets by giving to
the Clinton cause.
Although the Republicans have raised Dollars 10m more than the Democrats
since the beginning of 1991, they are now running so far short of previous
totals that campaign managers are still having to schedule fund-raising
appearances for Dan Quayle, who ought to be beating the bushes for votes,
not money.
Of course, if Bush loses, no-one could blame Kemp. . .

FT  29 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Time for helicopters and holes in the
ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something futile about a depression. Real economic problems arise
from rival and clamorous claims on scarce resources. Other problems arise
from reducing the inflation rate, which can have a heavy transitional cost.
But depression - defined as too little spending to secure trend economic
growth even when inflation is low - seems a paradoxical sort of evil.
To put down a few numbers. A reasonable growth rate for the UK national
income in money terms (nominal gross domestic product), consistent with low
inflation and a very gradual emergence from recession, might be 5 per cent
per annum or just above. The present underlying growth rate of the money
national income is probably about 2 or 3 per cent per annum or less. This
means that even with core inflation down to about 3 or 4 per cent, output
continues to fall, adding to recessionary pressures in an already depressed
economy.
Worst of all the depression is contributing to a mood of acute xenophobia
combined with hostility to market solutions which I can only call
national(istic) socialism and is particularly vociferous among some of the
so-called Tory Euro-sceptics.
I doubt the widespread view that the depression is due to political fears.
The severity of the first dip was often attributed to the Gulf war in 1991.
When the end of the war failed to set off a recovery, the second dip was
attributed to election fears. Now the third dip is being attributed to the
trials of a weak government. These are late rationalisations.
Yet for all the gloom there are few people who cannot think of ways of
spending more money so long as they have enough of it. Milton Friedman has
spoken of a helicopter dropping dollar bills. Keynes wrote about burying
pound notes in holes in the ground.
What are the objections to some dressed-up version of the helicopter or the
hole?
A serious objection is that governments could overestimate the amount of
unused capacity or unemployed labour that could be brought back into use by
injecting more demand. In that case too much of the stimulus would take the
form of more inflation rather than genuine growth. In addition the consumer
response could be unmanageably jerky: to begin with very little, and then a
sudden and unexpected upward jerk in spending which would be difficult to
pull back. Above all, there is the danger of generating a fall in sterling
which would increase the inflationary component of any given stimulus.
Demand management is and will remain an imperfect art, but allowing a
cumulative downward cycle to develop is itself dangerous. The domestic risks
can be reduced if demand management is moved a step away from the political
process, so that - for instance - base rate changes cannot be timed to help
the government out of a parliamentary difficulty. Just as important is
commitment to a nominal objective which puts a limit to the inflationary
potential if things go wrong. The little word 'nominal' is not just a
gesture to monetarists, but the heart of the exercise.
The inflationary impact of sterling's recent depreciation could be spread
over a longer period than that of previous devaluations and therefore have a
smaller impact on the per annum inflation rate.
Keith Skeoch of James Capel has shown that sterling is historically
extremely competitive against the D-Mark and once again quite competitive
against the dollar, following the latter's recovery. The CBI October survey
also records the sharpest turnround from pessimism to optimism about export
prospects since 1987, even though the world slowdown will delay the impact.
The shock horror effect from the CBI survey comes from domestic questions,
above all from the highly psychological one which does reflect the political
factor but which is also extremely volatile. However, as I tried to show in
an article in the FT on October 12 (Sense on Sterling) these gains will turn
into inflationary dross if the pound continues to sink. We are already in
the danger area and should be looking for some recovery.
The moral is that any further stimulus should take a fiscal form rather than
the cuts in base rates about which John Major talks so much to the lobby.
The common-sense reason for not cutting, and even adding to, public capital
projects, is that it is best to undertake them when the construction
industry is slack and it is easier to get value for money. And when
confidence is important, why not put these projects below some line on a
piece of paper so that accountants can say that they form a 'capital
budget'?
But there are no grounds for cutting social security payments, which feed
straight through into consumer spending, other than to prevent abuses which
should be tackled irrespective of the economic temperature. Nor are there
any grounds for laying off public sector workers other than genuine
over-manning. And it would be hair shirt stupidity to raise taxes. But a
tight public sector pay limit makes a lot of sense.
The objection that a looser fiscal policy would drive up interest rates is
badly flawed. As the chart shows, a soaring public sector borrowing
requirement has in the past couple of years been accompanied by tumbling
interest rates at both the short and the long end. Even in earlier years
there is little systematic relationship between budget deficits and interest
rates.
The error that is made is to treat the UK as a closed economy in which the
government can borrow more only by 'printing money' or by bidding up
interest rates. In a free world capital market there is a going rate for
funds; and borrowing governments pay an interest penalty if their currencies
are expected to depreciate or if they are judged to be default risks. A
little bit of 'printing money' in the shape of underfunding the budget
deficit could well be tried - the equivalent to a few rotations of the
helicopter's blades.
In the end it may be cost-effective to take a more unorthodox approach. If
central bankers, led by Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Fed,
could 10 years ago assemble first aid packages for developing countries,
there seems no reason why governments and central banks should not
domestically offer to take over from building societies and banks a slice of
the debt of households with negative equity - or alternatively to make some
direct contribution to interest costs. These operations would - like the US
savings and loan rescues - be put in a category of their own outside the
normal budget, which would then really have to balance once economic
activity got back to trend.
Taking risks with sterling and interest rates, while making gestures to
fiscal orthodoxy, seems to be the prevailing policy mix. It is the opposite
of what is required; but it is what we shall get.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: Concern over US transfer pricing proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T A SYMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Earlier this year the US Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued
new draft transfer pricing regulations. These could have far reaching - and
dramatic - implications for foreign multinationals in the US. Price
Waterhouse has closely consulted representatives of British industry and
made detailed representations to the US tax authorities to urge that the
worst excesses of the proposed rules are avoided.
As drafted, the regulations overturn the internationally accepted
arm's-length standard for transfer pricing. Instead, they elevate one method
frequently used by tax authorities as a way of checking the reasonableness
of transfer prices (ie comparing a company's results with those of its
competitors) to virtually the sole determinant of prices, with little
flexibility for adjusting results for differences in economic circumstances.
The draft regulations also seem to require companies to recalculate royalty
rates charged for the use of patents or trademarks every few years.
If these new rules are adopted, conflict between taxpayers and tax
authorities - and between tax authorities - is expected to increase. The use
of the recently introduced Advance Pricing Agreement procedure is likely to
be of limited assistance in overcoming this problem.
Fortunately, in response to detailed criticisms the IRS at last appears to
be modifying its original approach. It has recently indicated that the
comparison of results pricing method may have a lower priority than
originally planned and there may also be more flexibility in relation to
intangibles and in other areas.
However, because of the high profile of the issue in the US, there must be
concern that the rules could change again. It is to be hoped that Britain's
tax authorities continue to make strenuous representations so that
potentially serious damage is averted.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER J BAILEY

<TEXT>
Sir, You quote Ms Colette Flesch, the head of the information directorate,
as wishing to bring about an emotional link with the Community and the
positive things it has brought about ('Brussels tries to plug an information
gap', October 26).
This demonstrates where the Commission's information programme is going
wrong. It is unequivocal facts about the Commission's aspirations and
activities that should be communicated, not emotions of the Berlaymont
residents.
Earlier this year, I had the unrewarding experience of acting as media
relations adviser to President Delors' cabinet office in promoting their
association with the Winter Olympics. The officials' preoccupations turned
out to be:
a) avoiding firm statements about the Ecu10m being invested in this
'corporate sponsorship' of winter and summer Olympics;
b) ensuring that all material was issued in either three or nine languages,
approval for which had to be sanctioned by a Brussels Committee.
The result was that 'news' issued was bland and out of date by the time it
was approved for release. If President Delors is serious about closing the
information gap, he should ensure that the decision chain for releasing
material is short, effective and responsive to the external market.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: More a criticism of British management than of
quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Economist Intelligence Unit report, Lessons from Europe's Leading
Companies, and Paul Taylor's article, 'Why customers must come first'
(Management, October 26), are much more a criticism of British management
than of quality management.
They implicitly reveal the reason for much of the failure of British
management; its almost insatiable desire for the miracle cure, the latest
fad and the quick fix. These 'star dust' or 'flavour of the month'
approaches are introduced into the organisation by a senior manager in the
hope that it will instantly cure all his problems, while he continues 'to
get on with running the business' in exactly the same way that he always
did. When, not surprisingly, the cure is treated with cynicism by the
employees and does not deliver, the manager merely goes on to the next
panacea.
Total quality management (TQM) has fallen into this 'instant cure' category
in the minds of many managers. Their damaging misconception has been
pandered to and reinforced by many so-called management consultants who
peddle easy, quick and glossy packages called 'TQM' which are claimed to
achieve remarkable results almost without effort. As the report points out,
they don't work.
Total quality management is not quick nor is it effortless. The concepts are
easy to understand and to explain but it takes continuous and personal
commitment by managers to implement them. TQM is the effective and efficient
way of running an organisation to satisfy all its customers and shareholders
continuously, on the basis of continuous improvement. Successful
implementation of such a continuous improvement process is not only
possible, it is the prerequisite of being viable in the international
market. It is a very sad reflection on British management that this
minimalist requirement does, in fact, offer a major competitive edge in our
home market.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: Continuous improvement important to sustaining
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article, 'Why customers come first' (Management, October 26),
you included a chart on the impact of relative quality on rates of return,
quoting PIMS Associates as the source. Permit me to make the following
observations on the use of our data.
Our measure of quality - on which the evidence is based - is customer
perceived relative quality. As your article rightly says, it is customers'
views which count when it comes to assessing the impact of quality on
business profits, not the internal systems on which many TQ programmes are
focused.
But another point from our evidence needs to be clearly understood: the only
worthwhile measures of quality are relative. They must reflect the choices
which customers have to make.
Quality in competitive markets can never be an absolute. Offering a good
product or service is not enough - what matters is whether it is better or
worse than the competition. This is why continuous improvement and
benchmarking are so important to sustain business profits.
The most successful companies we see are not those which set quality
strategies in tablets of stone. They are those which focus outwards, at both
customers and competitors, making sure that the advantage they had yesterday
will still be there tomorrow.

Well, it's one way to add names to the shareholder register.
When Hendon fruiterer Harold Isaaman recently went into the Midland branch
opposite his shop to change a tenner into one pound coins, the cashier
offered him just eight pounds. She explained that she was deducting a fee of
two pounds for this simple little service.
'Oh, Mr Isaaman,' sighed a bank spokesman, when Observer rang to discuss the
policy on small change. 'He's not even a customer of the bank.' Midland then
explained that, if you don't bank there, you can expect a charge of 2 per
cent, with a Pounds 2 minimum - levied at the discretion of the local
manager.
Nor is it just the listening bank. Lloyds says that for non-customers
changing money on a regular basis it will expect to collect Pounds 3 per
transaction. Barclays goes one better and explains: 'We'd rather they (non
customers) didn't come to us at all. We might suggest they go somewhere
else.'
So an incensed Isaaman went out this week and bought two shares in Midland's
new owners, the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. Now he can turn up
at the next agm to see if his fellow shareholders think this is the way for
recession-bound institutions to create goodwill and expand their customer
base.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of searching, Liffe has finally found a replacement for its
retiring chief executive Michael Jenkins.
The prestigious job has already been spurned by one candidate. A high-flyer
within the finance department of Hanson is thought to have turned down the
position, which was last year paying just short of Pounds 200,000.
Now it emerges that the futures and options exchange has again looked
outside the narrow confines of the City, this time coming up with Daniel
Hodson, deputy chief executive and group finance director of Nationwide
Building Society.
While both Jenkins and exchange chairman Nick Durlacher were not around
yesterday to explain their choice, it is clear that 48-year-old Hodson has
had a varied career.
An old Etonian and graduate of Merton College, Oxford, Hodson says his
'profession' - he cringes slightly at the word - is treasury management.
After a number of years at Chase, he moved to Unigate, where he was made
finance director in 1981. In the late 1980s he spent two years, as chief
executive and then chairman, at Davidson Pearce before the advertising
agency was taken over, at which point he moved to Nationwide.
A well-known figure in corporate treasury circles, he is one of the founder
members, and now president, of the Association of Corporate Treasurers.
Meanwhile Liffe, which has just celebrated its tenth anniversary in grand
style, should be assured of entertainment at future parties. Hodson,
governor of the Yehudi Menuhin school in his spare time, does not play the
violin but does describe himself, with characteristic understatement, as 'a
rather indifferent singer'.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (1): In search of security - In spite of
continuing hardship, steady progress has been made on the economic front.
But with stability at risk as the far right reawakens ethnic rivalries, much
now depends on patience and restraint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATES and peoples of east and central Europe are re-discovering the
historical, cultural and economic forces which shaped their identities.
The old search for reasonable prosperity, a modus vivendi between ethnically
and culturally different neighbours and an acceptable degree of social
fairness and liberty was never easy. Seeking a more secure future, through
market reforms and full integration into a democratic and prosperous Europe
is proving no easier.
Hungary has come closer than most to the point of self-sustaining economic
growth and irreversible political and institutional reform. But this
perception appears to be more widespread among foreigners, who have invested
more than Dollars 4.1bn over the past three years, than among Hungarians,
many of whom have seen their living standards drop and social security
eroded.
Although 10m Hungarians are still governed by the same conservative
coalition elected in 1990 - a record of stability unsurpassed in the region
 -its achievements have failed to impress an electorate disenchanted by the
sacrifices demanded and rendered nervous by the disintegration of
neighbouring Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.
With Serbia, Slovakia and Romania in the hands of former communists thinly
disguised as nationalists, the re-awakening of ethnic intolerance has
underlined the potential vulnerability of 3.5m ethnic Hungarians, and other
minorities, in the neighbouring states.
Inside Hungary itself, the government's encouragement of foreign investment,
its desire for integration into Europe and its willingness to submit to IMF
disciplines have also aroused growls of protest from nationalist
conservatives.
Two months ago Mr Istvan Csurka, the writer who is one of six
vice-presidents of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), warned
fellow Hungarians to beware of 'a Paris, New York, Tel Aviv' plot and
complained that control by the IMF was equivalent to that by the Red Army.
At the most harmless level Mr Csurka expresses the outrage of an older
generation having to come to terms with the alien consumerism of McDonalds
hamburger joints and 'finger-lickin' chicken' bars. At a deeper level he has
brought to the surface deep-rooted xenophobia and anti-semitism in sections
of a country which retains the largest and most influential Jewish community
in the region.
Most Hungarian Jews, and those who escaped from other, Nazi-occupied areas,
were spared the fate of Jews elsewhere in the region until 1944 when Hitler,
afraid his Hungarian allies would defect as Italy had, imposed direct Nazi
control.
Mr Csurka has re-opened resentment against prominent Jews in the former
communist regime and aired the new envy of Jews as successful bankers and
businessmen in post-communist Hungary. Even the motives of Jewish
benefactors, such as Mr George Soros, have been called into question,
prompting an open protest letter from the latter to Mr Jozsef Antall, the
beleaguered prime minister, who has played down the Csurka affair in the
interests of party unity.
With his HDF party trailing badly in opinion polls and elections due in
1994, Mr Antall, who is not in good health, faces defeat unless he retains
the loyalty of the nationalist wing of the HDF, to whom Mr Csurka appeals,
and unless the hoped for economic recovery materialises.
As time runs out for the economy to come to Mr Antall's rescue, he faces a
challenge both from the Hungarian Socialist party, made up largely by former
communists seeking new credentials as social democrats and Fidesz, the youth
party led by Mr Viktor Orban.
The party's members and leaders are all under-35-year-olds untainted by
participation in public life under the old regime. They are inspired by
hopes of repeating the successful leap across an entire political generation
achieved by the Spanish socialists under Mr Felipe Gonzalez a decade ago.
The Free Democrat (SDS) party, which leads the opposition in parliament,
appears to lack a clear identity, sits uneasily between old style liberalism
and social democracy and seems unlikely to retain its present electoral
strength.
But, if western Europe, and especially Germany, avoids a full-fledged
recession over the next two years, there is a chance that the economy may
oblige Mr Antall by pulling out of three years of overall decline.
The decline has masked underlying changes which reflect domestic reform and
the activities of foreign investors who have chosen Hungary for more than
half the Dollars 7bn total investment pumped into east and central Europe
over the past three years. Underlining their vote of confidence in Hungary's
future is evidence that over 60 per cent of this has gone into industrial
investments which will require a 15-year cycle before they are likely to be
fully justified. Apart from the dozen or so large investments by US and
European multinationals, Hungary now has 13,000 joint ventures with foreign
companies. More than 10 per cent of exports come from companies with a
turnover of less than Dollars 1m, the activities of which are frequently
neither reported in official statistics nor effectively taxed.
As a result, the private sector of the Hungarian economy - much of it in the
hands of young, well educated people with strong faith in Hungary's future -
is richer and more dynamic than recorded. But this is at the expense of the
state budget.
Delay in implementing the new income and VAT tax systems, and slower than
expected privatisation, means that the treasury is deprived of new tax
income at precisely the moment when the profits of state companies and the
banking system - the main traditional sources of tax revenue - are in sharp
decline. At the same time expenditure on unemployment pay, modernisation of
the structure of government and other costs linked to structural reform, is
proving difficult to control.
The need to keep next year's budget deficit to around 6 per cent of GDP in
order to comply with IMF loan conditions is likely to be the main constraint
on economic policymakers next year. Against this has to be balanced the
prospect for further vigorous growth in exports.
The net result of strong capital inflows, coupled with a successful shift
from eastern to western markets following the collapse of Comecon trade, has
been to lay a solid basis for future export-led economic growth. By the same
token Hungary has also improved its ability to service its declining foreign
debt.
Foreign investment has been crucial in facilitating structural change in the
economy. Within the short span of three years, for example, Hungary - which
was forced by the old Comecon division of labour to concentrate on producing
rugged buses for the entire region has put itself in a position to become a
leading producer and exporter of GM cars and engines, as well as up to
60,000 Suzuki cars a year and motor components made by Ford and other
multinationals with new plants in the country.
Blessed with fertile land and a tradition of good farming which largely
survived collectivisation, Hungary has also attracted investment from food
and consumer goods multinationals such as Ferruzzi, Unilever and Philip
Morris. Unlike Poland, with its many thousands of small peasant plots, most
Hungarian farms are already on the large scale demanded by modern farming.
With so much achieved, and so much on the brink of achievement, success
depends on the patience, restraint and common decency of ordinary Hungarians
in the face of siren songs from the past.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Genetics takes the strain out
of being a pig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIG BREEDERS look set to eradicate the gene for stress from their herds. The
Pig Improvement Company based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, using a genetic test
developed by scientists at the University of Toronto, has succeeded in
removing the gene for porcine stress syndrome from its basic breeding herds
and anticipates offering pig farmers a choice of PSS-free or PSS carrier
lines by 1995.
PSS is a source of considerable economic loss to the pig industry because it
leads to sudden death of pigs subjected to stress, during transport or
mating for example, and to poor meat quality.
Before the development of the new test, called the HAL 1843 halothane test,
only pigs carrying two copies of the defective gene could be identified, and
then only when they fortuitously reacted adversely during studies on the
effects of the anaesthetic halothane. It is these pigs that suffer PSS.
Pigs with only one copy of the defective gene, known as carriers and
unaffected by PSS, could not be distinguished from those free of the defect.
Consequently, carriers passed the gene on to their progeny, thereby
preventing its elimination through conventional breeding programmes.
The new test enables scientists to identify the number of PSS genes in any
pig.
'The development of a DNA test for porcine stress syndrome is the first real
breakthrough in DNA biotechnology to have major implications for the pig
breeder,' said Mr Hein van der Steen, PIC's UK technical manager. 'Our
competitors will be in trouble if they don't start testing too.'
Carriers are not only free from PSS but also have an enhanced feed
conversion performance, producing more pork per kilogram of food than pigs
completely lacking the defect. Therefore, it was important to develop
breeding lines with known genetic backgrounds.
The elimination of PSS is likely to be worth between Pounds 1.50 and Pounds
3 per slaughter pig - quite a tidy profit for PIC's customers, who produce
over 40m pigs a year from PIC's breeding stock.

of zinc-lead mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent

<TEXT>
AFTER zinc fell to its lowest price for 9 1/2 months in London yesterday,
Curragh Resources said low prices were forcing it to close the Faro
zinc-lead complex in the Yukon for 16 days over the Christmas period.
The Canadian mining group said this would cut output by about 25,000 tonnes,
two-thirds of which is zinc, and affect about 300 staff. It said it was
setting budgets for 1993 and Faro, with an annual output of about 500,000
tonnes of metal, might have to shut down some capacity next year.
Analysts suggested Curragh's action was unlikely to raise zinc prices. 'This
won't turn the market,' said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of
the Westpac banking group. 'Zinc will need a much bigger shock than this.
Production cutbacks so far have been pretty tentative but this price of
about 50 cents a lb will force producers to make more cuts.'
However, he said the market should note that labour contract negotiations
were in progress at three big zinc smelters - Cominco's Trail and Sullivan
smelters (245,000 and 190,000 tonnes a year respectively) and Noranda's
Valleyfield (220,000 tonnes). 'But the ball is not exactly in the union's
court at the moment.'
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out that the zinc market was likely to
experience another supply surplus this year - of about 150,000 tonnes
following one of 85,000 tonnes in 1991.
On the London Metal Exchange yesterday, zinc for delivery in three months
touched Dollars 1,110 a tonne at one point.
This sparked some consumer interest and the price recovered to close at
Dollars 1,118.50 a tonne, down Dollars 14 from Tuesday's close.
London Metal Exchange stock figures were misleading because not all the
metal was immediately available, Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's marketing
director pointed out yesterday.
Unlike producers' stocks, those in LME warehouses had been bought by someone
for some good reason and the owner might not be a ready seller. He said
metals producers and consumers were carrying minimal stocks so any recovery
in industrial activity was likely to see LME stocks evaporating quickly.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: A silk purse for the pig
breeders - The creation of a Chinese-European super-sow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEISHAN pig from the Lake Taihu region of north-west China looks as if
it belongs in a zoo. It has a hide reminiscent of a rhinoceros, a face like
a basset-hound with a snout, and eyes that disappear behind ridges of fat.
Pig breeders, however, have long admired Meishans for their astonishingly
high reproduction rate. A Meishan sow has up to 20 teats, compared with 12
to 14 in a British breed, and regularly delivers 16 piglets. She can also
come into puberty in as little as 2 1/2 to 3 months compared with 6 months
for a European pig. But when fully grown the Chinese pig is all fat and
bone, with little lean meat - hence the Chinese passion for suckling pigs.
Now one of the leading UK pig breeding companies has succeeded in capturing
the prolificity of the Meishan in a pig with lean meat. Far from being in a
zoo, the Meishan is at the centre of a high-tech breeding programme aimed at
transforming the productivity and profitability of the pig industry.
The National Pig Development Company of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was one
of five breeding companies that formed a consortium to import the first
Meishans into the UK in 1987. Until then political problems had prevented
the Chinese from exporting.
The first animals went to the Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetic
Research in Edinburgh for research into the genes carrying prolificity. When
the numbers were sufficient, animals were released to the five breeders.
Mr Stephen Curtis, managing director for production at NPD, believes that
his company was the first to breed a commercial hybrid because of its drive
over the last 20 years to produce pigs with a high lean meat content. He
proudly points out that for eight years the company has come out top in
tests conducted by the Meat and Livestock Commission. 'Because we are that
much leaner, by systematically crossing our pigs with the Chinese pig we've
been able to produce a hybrid with an acceptable carcass that is only
slightly fatter than a standard hybrid,' he says.
NPD was founded in 1969 by Mr John Curtis, who was anxious for his two sons
to be able to earn their living from farming. He decided to concentrate on
pigs as he felt poultry were being overproduced and cattle and sheep were
too long-term.
He remains chairman of the company, which now has an annual turnover of
about Pounds 20m, some 250 employees and what he believes are the best
computerised records in the industry. 'The pig development industry is only
25 years old - by many standards this is rather new,' says his other son
David, who runs the marketing division. 'We are becoming more and more
sophisticated.' The pigmen at NPD need to know as much about computers as
they do about buckets of swill.
Each pig at the company's 24 farms and the thousands of farms it supplies
with breeding stock is tattooed with an individual number and has its own
computer record.
The computer programme stores a complete medical record for 150,000 breeding
sows, and knows exactly how productive each animal is. Stephen Curtis
believes use of the computer has increased the accuracy of breeding
selection by 15 per cent and put the company three to four years ahead of
the opposition.
The new hybrid, known as the Manor Meishan, was launched in some style at
the Cafe Royal in London last May. Next year the company plans to sell 6,000
breeding gilts, worth Pounds 225 each, in the UK. But David Curtis also has
ambitious plans for the US market.
Last year it signed a franchise agreement with Smithfield-Carroll, a large
pork company based in Virginia, which is taking NPD's breeding stock. Every
six weeks a jumbo jet carrying 800 pigs flies to the US to build up a
breeding stock that is expected to reach 1m sows by the year 2000.
However, the Manor Meishan will not be sent to the US until the UK market is
satisfied. 'We have always taken the view that you need to be strong at home
to give a springboard for work abroad,' says John Curtis. At present NPD
claims 20 per cent of the UK gilts market.
Eventually some Manor Meishans could even find their way back to their
ancestral homeland. Scientists from China's Guizhou Province this summer
visited NPD as part of a programme to improve production of pork, which
makes up 90 per cent of the meat consumed in the province.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: First private sector copper
smelter to be built in India
</HEADLINE>

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S FIRST private-sector copper smelter is to be built near Bombay in
collaboration with MIM Holdings of Australia.
Copper smelting, reserved for the public sector, was deregulated last year
as part of an overall industrial liberalisation policy. Now Sterlite
Industries, producer of copper rods, has announced that it is setting up a
smelter to produce 60,000 tonnes of copper cathodes a year from imported
concentrates, probably from Zambia or Chile.
India has a 47,500-tonne smelter, which is operating at half of its
capacity, and most of the local requirements are met by imports.
Few copper smelters have been built in industrial countries in recent years,
partly because of the introduction of new methods of producing copper and
partly because of strict environmental laws.
Thailand and Indonesia, which also have planned copper smelters, are talking
to MIM about buying the technology.
Every year as by-products, the Sterlite copper smelter will produce seven
tonnes of gold, which will be higher than India's present total gold
production of five tonnes, and some 20 tonnes of silver.
Mr Anil Agarwal, chairman, says annual demand for copper in India is
expected to rise from the present 150,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes in 1995.
He claims the smelter will be competitive internationally because it will
use latest technology.

gold

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday proposed that 'financial' gold, held by or
in central banks, should be exempt from value added tax throughout the
European Community, reports Reuter from Brussels.
Industrial gold, used in jewellery, electronics and industrial processes,
should bear VAT, which would be collected from the purchaser rather than
from the seller, it said.
'This is a practical proposition that adapts (VAT) in a concrete manner to
the complex reality of the gold market,' Ms Christianne Scrivener, the EC
tax commissioner, said.
'We want to reduce the risks of fraud and the parallel markets which
currently exist in the community due to the diversity of national tax
systems,' she explained.
The Commission held back from proposing any specific VAT rate on industrial
gold, preferring to leave it up to individual countries to set their own
levels of tax.
Mr Dick Gazmararian, chairman of the London Bullion Market Association, said
last night that the association had been in close touch with the Commission
about the proposals so the outcome was of no surprise.
'The impact on the London bullion market will be minimal,' he said.
'Basically we are happy with the Commission's proposals.'

LONDON'S robusta coffee and cocoa futures closed easier but mostly off the
day's lows in quiet trade. Dealers said the COFFEE price fall, which left
the January position Dollars 8 down at Dollars 916 a tonne, was influenced
by profit-taking following Tuesday's Dollars 33 rise. They said business was
quiet and the market needed to consolidate around these levels.
Profit-taking was also a factor in the COCOA market fall, dealers said. The
March position closed at Pounds 718 a tonne, down Pounds 6 on the day. One
dealer said the market had broken through chart points in Tuesday's
currency-inspired rally but had not managed to stay at those levels. At the
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices moved irregularly in the afternoon as
Comex opened strongly then fell back and sterling surged, and then eased,
against the dollar, traders said. Fears of a Chilean miners' strike waned
after union leaders said they were encouraged by their government's response
to calls for talks on privatisation of the industry.

JAMAICA'S bauxite (alumin-ium ore) production in the third quarter of this
year was 2.87m tonnes, 6.2 per cent less than in the corresponding quarter
of 1991.
The Jamaica Bauxite Institute, the state agency that monitors the industry,
said export of crude bauxite in the third quarter was 1.09m tonnes, 10 per
cent less than in the third quarter of 1991. Third-quarter exports of
alumina (aluminium oxide) fell 1.7 per cent to 728,781 tonnes.
The declines in production and exports were caused mainly by the termination
late last year of a contract to supply 1m tonnes of ore a year to the former
Soviet Union.

Prices at auction are continuing to drift very gradually and erratically
into lower ground, although there is no all-round decline and there are
instances of a firmer tendency at times. The Australian Wool Corporation's
market indicator reached a new low point for the season of 498 on October
28, but this is only 8 cents lower than a week earlier. Hope of reviving
Russian demand for wool have subsided even in New Zealand, where attempts by
the Wool Board to resume trade directly have been aborted after problems
with payment and accelerating depreciation of the rouble.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: BCCI conclusions leave audit questions
unanswered - Andrew Jack examines the lessons to be drawn in the light of
the Bingham and Kerry reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one thing which unites the contents of the two reports published
this month into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, it
is their lack of completeness. Nowhere is that more the case than on the
role of the auditors.
The two reports could not be more different. The US Senate sub-committee
investigation into BCCI, chaired by John Kerry, offers little not previously
reported, and is written in highly inflammatory terms. Some of its
conclusions based on the evidence presented are extremely tenuous.
Overall, it appears to be soft on those who co-operated with the inquiry and
sympathetic to their views, while being fiercely critical of those - such as
the Bank of England and Price Waterhouse - which refused to help for
whatever reason.
For example, much of the chapter on BCCI's accountants bemoans the lack of
help offered by Price Waterhouse in London - in contrast to the greater
co-operation from the US firm, which said it was party to very little
information on the bank.
PW in London did not appear before the committee, principally because it is
required to maintain confidentiality under UK banking laws. It did offer to
meet Kerry's staff in the UK, but apparently Senate rules prevented anyone
from travelling abroad. The report's conclusions are correspondingly
side-tracked to concentrate on how to force improved disclosure by
international accountancy firms to US regulators and investigators.
By contrast, one section uncritically refers to the role of Mr Masihur
Rahman, BCCI's chief financial officer in London. In testimony to the Kerry
committee, he said he did not have access to any of the underlying loan
information and related files at BCCI's field offices, and therefore relied
on the work of the external auditors to review its records and ensure their
truth and accuracy.
That says more about the nature of lines of internal control and
responsibility within the bank than it does about the role of the auditors.
That auditors' responsibilities should be extended is certainly open to
debate; that they should know more than the internal management of the
company on which they are reporting seems at the very least bizarre.
These very issues are raised by the Institute of Internal Auditors in the UK
this week, which called for tougher, more independent internal audit
controls in response to BCCI.
Kerry's report provides tantalising information for those attempting to
understand the roles of Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney in the audit of
BCCI, if only by virtue of its kitchen-sink approach: it is 780 pages long.
The result is unfocused and highly fragmentary, but it does include a number
of extracts from auditors' internal working papers not before publicly
disclosed.
They highlight a series of concerns being raised by PW at least as far back
as 1983, including a high concentration of risk in substantial loans to
clients, no documentation to support security against loans, and inadequate
information on both the nature of the loans and the credit-worthiness and
identity of the borrowers. Kerry claims that these comments led to little
reform by BCCI's management.
Mr Graham Stacy, the technical partner at Price Waterhouse now co-ordinating
the firm's BCCI work, indignantly dismisses the significance of these
details. 'Of course we knew there were weaknesses. They are found in many
banks. It is irresponsible to take a few documents and try to reconstruct
the audit from them. We are still absolutely satisfied that we issued proper
audit reports.'
Readers might expect to find a more sober and informed assessment in the
report by Lord Justice Bingham, given the less overtly political operation
of the inquiry and its far greater access to documents and individuals.
Those looking for comprehensiveness in the Bingham report will still be
disappointed. That is not a reflection on the conduct of the inquiry so much
as on its limited terms, which were to examine the supervision of BCCI. That
meant focusing primarily on the Bank of England, with less emphasis on the
auditors.
There are certainly some thought-provoking conclusions for auditors. Bingham
suggests that use of a single well-qualified audit firm for a complex
international banking group would normally be best; that existing
professional guidelines need to be tightened with legislation requiring
auditors detecting fraud to notify the supervisory bodies of regulated
industries; and that there is no difficulty over the existing guidelines on
conflicts of interest when appointing the auditor as investigator.
One of the most significant passages in Bingham focuses on the vexed
question of whether the 1989 BCCI audit report should have been qualified.
He says the Bank of England and the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois - the
Luxembourg bank supervisors - wanted the accounts to be published 'with an
unqualified opinion as soon as possible'. The regulators were keen for the
firm to remain as auditors. There was concern that resignation or a
qualified opinion would inevitably cause the bank to collapse.
PW, says Bingham, believed the accounts did show a true and fair view and
that BCCI would be a going concern with a Dollars 400m subscription of
shares by the government of Abu Dhabi and a series of assurances about
management improvements.
Mr Stacy adds that the majority shareholder's knowledge of the position of
the bank far exceeded the information shown in the accounts, and was a
factor in preparing the unqualified audit opinion.
Bingham says the the firm made reference to the capital injection in a
footnote to the accounts, and drafted an audit opinion which said the
accounts had been drawn up on the basis described in the note. The next
paragraph began: 'On this basis the consolidated accounts give a true and
fair view . . .' Under pressure from BCCI management, 'on this basis' was
changed to 'in our opinion'.
Bingham says the picture 'was in reality even worse' than that painted by
the accounts. He says it seems 'undesirable' that ordinary readers of
accounts should not have had known of information such as the continuing
uncertainty of some of the major BCCI loans, and that the adverse
consequences of disclosure cannot be a reason for not making it. Yet he is
unconvinced that existing principles and practice cover the situation of
BCCI, and concludes: 'I rather doubt if other auditors, similarly placed,
would have acted very differently'.
Bingham's comment is not repeated in the conclusion to the report. Instead,
he raises the wider question of whether an auditor should report and owe a
duty directly to depositors.
He argues that such a duty would would not necessarily make auditors more
diligent. But he hints that while BCCI does not provide him with the
material to recommend any change, there may be a case for it, which would
allow compensation to depositors who have lost money as a result of
carelessness.
This is intriguing given he was one of the House of Lords judges in the
Caparo case in 1990, which ruled that an auditor's responsibilities are
limited to a client company and to the whole body of shareholders.
He does not directly address how greater information should be provided to
ordinary readers of accounts. Nor does he discuss whether there is a tension
or conflict of interest between audit guidelines and the demands of bank
regulators in the preparation of audit opinions.
It will be several years before the BCCI legal action gets to court, if it
gets that far. Meanwhile, there is certainly a case for re-addressing
whether auditors' responsibilities should extend beyond those laid down in
Caparo, and the extent to which bank audit guidelines should be revised.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Money Markets: German policy tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling cash market continued to ease yesterday as dealers
waited to see whether the chancellor will signal a cut in base rates to
coincide with tonight's Mansion House speech, writes James Blitz.
However, Euromark futures were pushed lower as hopes vanished of an official
rate cut at today's Bundesbank meeting. The Bundesbank dashed hopes of an
easing by allocating 'repo' funds to the cash market at a minimum interest
rate of 8.75 per cent, a level that was unchanged from last week.
Sterling markets continue to be the most bullish in Europe. Many people
assume that another base rate cut is in the offing. That expectation was
reflected in dealers' unwillingness to offer bills to the Bank of England
yesterday. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m at the start of
yesterday's operations, but, in the morning, the authorities only bought
Pounds 124m in a repurchase agreement at the established rate of 7 15/16 per
cent. Dealers had probably offered to sell bills at lower rates, but were
turned down.
Later, the market relaxed, and Pounds 715m of liquidity was added in the
afternoon after the Bank increased the shortage to Pounds 850m. One-month
money, at which a lot of banks do their market borrowing, closed at around 8
3/8 per cent from a previous close of 8 per cent. The 3-month rate dropped
from around 7 13/16 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent, the lowest it has been since
the last base rate cut.
Some dealers were expecting conditions to be much tighter today. There may
be heavier speculation on a rate cut, and assets will not be sold easily.
The Bundesbank signalled in its money market operations that there will be
no official rate change after it refrained from engineering a reduction in
short-term rates in the weekly round of securities repurchase agreements.
Mr Hermann Rempsberger, chief economist at BHF bank in Frankfurt, was quoted
as saying that he would be very surprised if there was a change in official
policy today. 'The repo rates will have to move first,' he said. The
December Euromark contract closed down 7 basis points from its opening level
at 91.73, suggesting that 3-month money will be at 8.27 per cent by
Christmas. December French franc futures closed unchanged at 90.91.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar demand is restrained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR edged higher against the D-Mark in late European trading
yesterday, but its progress was undermined by another hint from the
Bundesbank that official interest rates will be left unchanged at today's
council meeting, writes James Blitz.
The US currency is being bought by investors who believe that it will rise
sharply once the US election is over, the political uncertainties in the US
disappear and the Mr Bill Clinton, if elected, embarks on a policy of fiscal
expansion.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew,
has a very striking view of the possible upturn. He believes that the US
currency is on the verge of one of the three great strategic moves of the
free-floating era. The first two were the dollar's rise and fall in the
1980s. Now, he says, the currency could be on the verge of a long-term move
upwards, as the US economy is fiscally boosted and the Bundesbank cuts rates
as the German economy stagnates. However, Germany's rate-cutting is coming
more slowly than the market expects. For the second time this week, the
Bundesbank left dealers believing that a cut in official rates was unlikely
to take place at its council meeting today, after injecting funds into the
German money market at the prevailing rate of 8.75 per cent.
Now that the direction of German rate moves appears to be on the downside,
the market's focus is on the official rate floor, the Discount rate,
currently at 8.25 per cent. Market rates remain a good 50 basis points above
that level, and that is not deemed a small enough gap to pressure a
reduction in the lower official rate.
Mr Chertkow points out that the Bundesbank's last experience of rate-cutting
came in the recession of 1981-2, when the discount rate lost 350 basis
points in the space of 8 months. However, that was at a time when the fiscal
deficit was at around 3 1/2 per cent of GDP, compared to today's level of
around 6 per cent - and the policy easing may take longer this time round.
Lingering worries about the US economy may also delay the great dollar turn.
September's US durable goods orders compounded short-term uncertainty
yesterday, falling 0.4 percentage points, against forecasts of a 0.3
percentage point gain. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of
America, says that the Federal Reserve is still biased towrads easing policy
rather than tightening it.
In the thick of these events, the dollar edged higher in late European
trade, closing at Dollars 1.5390, up  1/2 a pfennig on the day. Short-term
profit taking pushed sterling up to a high of DM2.4355, but the currency
slid back to a London close of DM2.4280, a net rise of 1/2 a pfennig on the
day.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (11): A spanner in the works / Profile of
Istvan Csurka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY now has its own hobgoblin. His name is Istvan Csurka and he believes
in things such as the 'Paris, New York, Tel Aviv' conspiracy. His goal is to
defend what he sees as true Magyars from the machinations of international
bankers, former communists, liberals and Jews.
Mr Csurka, a slow-moving, portly writer, with a mane of grey hair swept
straight up from his forehead, is one of six vice-presidents of the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, the leading member of Hungary's three party
coalition government.
On August 20, he threw a fire-cracker into the outwardly placid Hungarian
political pond with the publication of his political manifesto.
It was a rambling tract of 18,000 words, the political musings of what
fellow-writers see as a talented but essentially irresponsible man steeped
in Hungarian lore and traditions but ignorant of foreign languages and
places.
A solitary figure, fond of horse racing and gambling, Mr Csurka appeals to
racial bigots, those who fear for the survival of this small nation with its
distinctive language and those alienated by the dramatic social and economic
changes unleashed by the opening up of the economy to large scale foreign
investment.
Having inherited right wing, nationalist views from his father, a journalist
close to the wartime Arrow Cross fascist movement, Mr Csurka was subjected
to periods of enforced silence by the former communist regime. However,
under the same regime he also received several prestigious literary prizes.
His plays and novels have received critical and popular acclaim while his
weekly radio programme, broadcast every Sunday, is widely listened to. For
good or ill, Mr Csurka is a force to be reckoned with in Hungarian affairs.
His decision to stir up Hungary's political waters was ostensibly motivated
by the ill health of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, and the need to
designate an eventual successor and redefine the role and policies of the
HDF. In so doing he has staked out his position as the ideologue of the
right wing nationalist faction of the HDF.
Mr Csurka sees plots and enemies on all sides and he vehemently attacked Mr
Arpad Goencz, the Hungarian president (and fellow writer) for his refusal to
sign a government decree sacking the heads of Hungarian state radio and TV.
But what set alarm bells ringing was his attacks on gypsies, Jews, bankers,
communists and foreigners and his proposal to enlist 'healthy' young
Hungarians in the recovery of a wider Lebensraum for the the Christian
Magyar people.
Ironically this xenophobic populism, with fascist undertones, makes him
closer to former communists such as Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia, Ion
Iliescu, the newly re-elected president of Romania or Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia than to the free market-orientated democrats of his own party or the
liberal Hungarian opposition.
The communist-nationalist leaders in surrounding states are making Hungarian
and other minorities scapegoats for economic and political difficulties in
areas which once were once totally or partially included in the greater
Hungary that disappeared with the 1920 Trianon treaty. Against this
background, Mr Csurka looks like the classic man in a glasshouse throwing
stones.
With Serbia threatening to destabilise the ethnic Hungarian areas of
Vojvodina by resettling Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, and ethnic
Hungarians in Slovakia worried about their fate under Mr Meciar, Mr Csurka's
brand of national intolerance and support for Hungarian irredentism risks
leading to a dangerous escalation of provocations and abuse throughout the
region.
That might confirm Mr Csurka as a prophet in his own country. But such an
outcome would inevitably draw Hungary ever deeper into the intrigue and
instability for which Balkan politics has long been famous.
It would be incompatible with the image of contemporary Hungary, a country
striving for democracy with prosperity, and full integration into the
European Community and the wider world.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (9): A fragile peace - Foreign policy
makers see stability in the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE post-Maastricht disarray in western Europe is viewed with a mixture of
foreboding and disbelief in Hungary, where full membership of a strong
European Community is the one policy goal which is shared by all political
parties.
With over 3.5m ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states since the
1920 Trianon Treaty cut the country to one third of its former size, Hungary
looks towards the Community not only as inspiration for its own social and
economic progress but also as the ultimate protector of the rights of
minorities in this part of Europe.
Confidence in the EC's ability to effectively defend these rights has been
dented by events in Yugoslavia. For the Community to help preserve the
fragile new democracies, Hungarian foreign policy makers believe it needs
both a strong Commission and an extensive body of binding EC law.
It also needs the political will to demand compliance with Community
standards on human rights as the pre-condition for trade, aid and other
concessions.
The idea that widening the community to include the newly sovereign east and
central European states would weaken efforts to 'deepen' the community and
its institutions finds little echo in Budapest. 'We have no desire to dilute
the powers of the European Commission.
'We think that the stronger and more united the EC is, the easier it will be
to join,' said a senior official of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum.
Neither does Hungary share the concern about long-term prospects of a new
German hegemony in Europe felt by other countries in the region which were
occupied during the war.
Having worked closely with Austria during the last decades of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and as an ally of Nazi Germany in the last war,
Hungarians have fewer hang-ups about Germany than the former 'subject
nations' of the Hapsburg Empire who suffered most from Nazi occupation 50
years ago.
At the same time, however, Budapest is acutely aware of the historical
resentments against Hungarians in surrounding states such as Slovakia and in
Transylvania where Hungarians were the rulers and are now the ruled.
Ugly scenes at a recent football match in Bratislava when Slovak riot
police, faces hidden by Balaclava helmets, were let loose against Hungarian
supporters showed how easily passions can be aroused.
After years of increasingly fraught discussions over the fate of the
Gabcikovo dam, originally conceived as a joint, communist-era
Hungarian-Czechoslovak power project on the Danube, the EC finally stepped
in earlier this month by inviting both Hungarian and Slovak delegates to
Brussels in a last minute search for a compromise.
Until now the Hungarian government has refused to be provoked and tried to
settle problems - including the future of the Gabcikovo dam and those
connected with refugees from the fighting in Croatia and over-flights by
Yugoslav aircraft - through diplomatic channels.
But this has opened up the government to charges of weakness by Hungarian
nationalists who complain, for example, at the government's inability to
restrain Mr Gheorghe Funar, the Romanian nationalist mayor of the
Transylvanian city of Cluj from banning Hungarian street names, a gratuitous
insult to its large ethnic Hungarian minority.
With fragile coalition governments in power throughout the region, the
temptation to revive latent ethnic animosities as a diversion from the
problems of implementing meaningful reforms is high and probably rising.
Much depends on the strength of the Hungarian government's will to prevent
incidents escalating into full scale international crises.
Hungarian traders meanwhile are in the forefront of attempts to forge a new
economic and political relationship with the former Soviet republics.
With over 80,000 Ikarus buses throughout the former Soviet Union needing
spare parts and oil and gas enterprises short of pipes and machinery,
Hungarian traders have created new direct trade and barter links with energy
producing areas such as Tatarstan and Bashkiria.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (10): Who's who in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tamas Szabo, privatisation minister: in Mr Szabo, western investment bankers
have the 'heavy hitter' that some think the great sell-off needs. Aware that
public support is crucial to success, he has brought a political touch to
privatisation. Mr Szabo is of that rare breed of Hungarian politician who
tries to clear a day a week to visit his constituency.
Andras Simor, head of CA Securities, the Hungarian brokerage and investment
banking subsidiary of Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank: Mr Simor has helped
carve out for CA a large share of the small to medium-sized deals which the
larger international advisers disdain but which have proved easiest
conclude. Sandor Rudnay, partner at Price Waterhouse in Budapest: one of the
most respected auditors in the business. Several of his clients decided to
follow him from KPMG to PW when he defected recently.
Rudnay is a name which crops up frequently in Hungarian business life.
Sandor's brother Janos, who also left Hungary with the family in 1956 and
has now returned, is one of the most influential western executives, heading
Philips's Hungarian operations and the new multinational lobbying
association.
Andras Kereszty, editor-in-chief of Nepszabadsag: Mr Kereszty has managed
the formidable task of taking the much-hated former communist party
newspaper and turning it into Hungary's most respected daily. The masthead
remains the same - the name means 'people-freedom' - but the coverage has
become increasingly objective.
Gabor Varszegi, entrepreneur: Mr Varszegi has built up the Fotex retailing
group into Hungary's largest homegrown private company. In the process he
has acquired a reputation for shrewdness and ruthlessness. He was a rock
star until the early 1980s and then spent a few years in the diamond trade
in New York. George Lang, restauranteur: Mr Lang is the man who has brought
power-lunching to Budapest.
Creator of the Four Seasons and Cafe des Artistes in New York, he has
brought his skills and money back to his birthplace of Hungary to revamp the
country's most famous restaurant, the Gundel.
George Lang and his partner, Ronald Lauder of the cosmetics dynasty, paid
Dollars 8m and invested at least that much again in the Gundel to bring it
back to its pre-war standards. That is more than most Hungarian industrial
plants are worth.
Les Nemethy, deputy managing director in charge of transactions of the State
Property Agency, the privatisation authority: 'Made in Hungary, born in
Canada,' Mr Nemethy likes to say of himself. His parents left during the
1956 revolution and he was born soon afterwards. After a career in mergers
and acquisitions in Canada, he is now back to the place of his conception.
Mr Nemethy has already brought some western efficiency to the SPA and
investment bankers almost universally welcome his presence. 'He speaks the
same language,' says one.
Lajos Bokros, managing director of Budapest Bank: Mr Bokros has proved
surprisingly effective as managing director, pursuing a tough write-off
policy, bringing in new management and preparing the large state bank for
privatisation.
Mr Bokros, an economist by training, rose to head the National Bank of
Hungary's capital markets department. But, in the great Hungarian tradition
of second jobs, he also freelanced as president of the Budapest Stock
Exchange (which he remains), a member of the State Property Agency board as
well as an occasional lecturer.
Miklos Nemeth, vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development: No one in eastern Europe can have had a better transition than
Mr Nemeth, Hungary's last communist prime minister.
After a decent interval, Mr Nemeth, whose government attracts more nostalgia
as the economic recession drags on, could quite plausibly re-enter Hungarian
politics. Peter Magyar, partner at Baker &amp; McKenzie, the longest-established
western law firm, crops up in so many deals that people joke that he is the
only lawyer in Budapest. George Soros, Hungarian-American fund manager, has
given approaching Dollars 100m out of his immense personal fortune to
eastern Europe and large bit of that to Hungary through the Soros
Foundation.
Not all Hungarians are grateful, however. Government MPs have mounted
increasingly vitriolic attacks on Mr Soros, who is Jewish and is perceived
to support opposition liberals. Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the
agriculture ministry: is a rare example of a professional civil servant. His
responsibilities for Hungary's agricultural sector also give him a big say
in privatisation, which has been especially concentrated in the food
industry.
Mr Rasko, a refreshingly frank man, admits that he is in a difficult
position, buffetted on the one side by foreign investors with strong
bargaining positions and on the other by government MPs who are increasingly
demanding domestic participation in privatisation.
George Varga, chief executive at GE-Tungsram, General Electric's Hungarian
subsidiary. Mr Varga, doyen of the western multinationals who took over in
1990 as chief executive, has radically restructured the company and lobbied
fruitlessly against the Hungarian government's strong currency policy.
Gyorgy Jaksity, director of Lupis Brokerhaz, one of Hungary's largest
independent broker. The 25-year-old Mr Jaksity does not think his age
matters to clients.
'Financial analysis in Hungary dates back to 1990; no one has any more
experience than two years,' he says.
Mr Jaksity is also a novelist. His first published work about Socrates
reborn in eastern Europe was a failure, however. For the time being he is
sticking to the financial world, where he is rather more successful.
Marc Holtzman, a director of EurAmerica Capital Corporation, an investment
bank supported by the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund: Mr Holtzman has
proved that networking recognises no boundaries.
When he organised a Budapest charity dinner for Romanian orphans he brought
out the whole post-communist establishment: multinational executives, local
entrepreneurs politicians from the president down, cardinals and
ambassadors.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Read Kohl's lips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN economy is in increasing difficulties. Yet Chancellor Helmut Kohl
appears unable to comprehend the risks his country and his continent now
face, let alone act to forestall them. Germany and Europe cry out for better
leadership.
Mr Kohl has already reneged on his no-new-taxes pledge. But last year's
solidarity tax and next year's rise in value-added tax are much too small to
finance the vast rise in government spending that the collapse of the east
German economy has necessitated. The economic slowdown may be exaggerating
the size of the deficit, but the long-term demands of reconstruction of the
east imply a structural budget deficit and a general government debt running
out of control.
Germany is paying for Mr Kohl's past inaction. The Bundesbank refuses to
ease policy while fiscal policy remains loose. But Mr Kohl's inability to
cut a budget deal has kept German interest rates much too high.
The result has been stagflation: inflationary pressures in the subsidised
service sector, alongside an approaching recession in the traded goods
sector. Tight monetary policy risks pulling the German economy into
recession, as the report from Germany's five leading economic research
institutes makes clear. They expect west German gross national product to
keep growing next year: but only if interest rates fall rapidly.
The Bundesbank may eventually be forced to ease monetary policy anyway.
Cutting official interest rates while the fiscal deficit remains so large,
especially before monetary growth drops back into its target range, will
undermine its credibility. But keeping interest rates so high will become
incredible too, as the UK has learned.
It is not in the interests of either Germany or Europe that the Bundesbank
is forced to back down, with its tail between its legs. A partial retreat
makes sense: its overly rigid commitment to a distorted broad money target
has proved a mistake. But the Bundesbank cannot afford to ease policy until
it is confident that fiscal policy will be tightened and wage inflation
fall.
Mr Kohl must act quickly. His coalition government must agree a credible
package of tax increases and cuts in capital subsidies, the latter coming
into effect at once, although the tax rise might be staged over the next two
years. The solidarity talks with employers and unions also need to agree a
real wage freeze in the west. Convergence of labour costs in the east and
western Lander must be halted, preferably through a system of temporary wage
subsidies.
Then the Bundesbank will be able to cut interest rates aggressively, while
retaining credibility. Only such boldness will enable Mr Kohl to restore his
battered reputation as the great chancellor of German unity.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: In search of an energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS panicked response to the furore over its plans to close 31 coal
mines, the government has opened what amounts to a review of its entire
energy policy. Simultaneously, the Commons trade and industry committee will
also conduct an equally wide-ranging inquiry of its own.
Both these investigations are intended to be complete by the end of the
year, a timescale which can only be described as optimistic, given the
variety of views they will have to consider. The threat to 30,000 miners'
jobs has stimulated calls, some from surprising political quarters, for what
amounts to a planned economy in energy. So far, the government has made a
poor fist of setting out the market-led alternative.
It would be helpful if the committee and the government were to establish a
few ground rules. The first should be that there is no question of going
back to state ownership of the gas and electricity industries. No one should
forget that it was under state control that Britain made a series of
unforced blunders about nuclear energy, about overall capacity in
electricity generation and in coal, whose future was repeatedly misjudged.
This is not to say that the privatised alternative provides a complete
answer. Privatisation of both gas and electricity was badly executed,
resulting in a private monopoly in gas, now the subject of a monopolies
commission investigation, and a duopoly in national electric power
generation, buttressed by regional monopolies in supply.
Even those who believe that these problems are best addressed by increasing
competition must acknowledge that they will always fall far short of perfect
markets. Gas and electricity will probably always need a regulator.
The immediate cause of the coal debacle, apart from the presentational
errors, is the fact that gas and electricity regulation has not evolved
rapidly enough for anyone to be confident that generators are making
economically optimal decisions in favour of gas-fired power stations.
Since, in addition, electricity consumers are required to subsidise nuclear
power and other non-fossil fuels, it is clear that the case against the 31
coalmines has been inadequately made. This is so even though it is also true
that there is no commercially viable market for the threatened pits' output
if the national generators wish to slash their coal-burn in new contracts
from next April.
Mr Heseltine has revealed that he considered intervening in these contract
negotiations to require higher coal consumption but that this was against
the law. This is not a law the government would be wise to change so long as
it wishes to retain credibility for its privatisation strategy. What is
clear, however, is that the regulatory mechanism in these industries,
especially in electricity, is not yet working sufficiently well for people
to be confident that prices and investments are being decided in as rational
a fashion as is possible.
Only when regulation of this quality has been achieved will customers and
shareholders know whether they are being treated fairly and the generators
themselves have a sound basis for determining their fuel purchase and
investment strategies.
Also, without such information, government will be unable to calculate the
cost of subsidising any given fuel, for social, technological or
environmental reasons. It would be sensible for both inquiries to focus upon
this complex but essential matter.

<TEXT>
HAROLD WILSON By Ben Pimlott HarperCollins, Pounds 20, 811 pages
Harold Wilson has been lucky in the timing of this book, the nearest to an
official biography published so far. His stock, as a prime minister due for
revaluation, has been rising steadily in recent months. Ben Pimlott, the
author, has been fortunate, too. Some of the similarities between parts of
the Wilson period and the turmoils that John Major has been going through in
the past few weeks are uncanny. Since the parallels may be temporary, and
therefore superficial, the best thing to do is to read the book now while it
is still hot.
Red hot, or as Wilson himself might have put it, white hot. There are two
factors which marred the Wilson administrations which are with us still. One
was the weakness of the British economy, which had a corresponding effect on
the exchange rate. The other was Europe: in or out or somewhere in between?
For the historian, the question is whether Wilson did a reasonable job in
the circumstances, or whether he could have done better. The case for the
former has risen, as successive prime ministers have failed to come to terms
with Europe and the economy.
Wilson had a long experience of devaluation. As the youngest member of the
cabinet since 1806, he lived through the agonies that led to the devaluation
of 1949. Although it may have been necessary, it brought no immediate
solution to the country's economic problems. For Wilson, Pimlott notes, it
was an experience never to be repeated.
That comment says a lot about Wilson's approach when he became prime
minister in 1964. Hindsight has it that all might have been better if the
new Labour government had devalued straightaway. In fact, the formal
devaluation was staved off until late 1967, and even then it did not end the
succession of sterling crises and the need to curb public expenditure. Some
people who claim to have said that the case for a quick change in the
exchange rate was obvious did not say so at the time. In all that, we may
catch a foretaste of the present government grappling with sterling and the
ERM this autumn.
On Europe Wilson was initially an agnostic. Subsequently, when prime
minister, he was a convert. When reverting to leader of the opposition, he
was a waverer. Finally, when prime minister again, he became a believer in
putting the choice to the people. He picked up the idea of a popular vote
from Tony Benn, and for a while the referendum in 1975 seemed to have
settled the issue once and for all. Wilson was criticised for those
tergiversations, but at least he could claim that he held the party, and to
some extent the country, together.
In this respect, Pimlott is perceptive. He notes that the more Wilson seemed
committed to Europe, the more sterling seemed suspect on the foreign
exchange markets. The markets did not believe that Britain was ready to
accept all the disciplines of even the early Community.
There are, of course, differences between Wilson and his successors as prime
minister. Only Wilson had to deal with the tantrums of George Brown, who, as
deputy leader of the party, was a brilliant and popular man in his way, but
erratic and desperately worried about losing his seat in the 1970 general
election.
Far more important was Vietnam. The Americans wanted British support for the
war, which - to put it mildly - the Labour movement was reluctant to give.
On the other hand, Britain wanted American help to prop up sterling. It was
an uneasy compromise. Wilson fudged his way through, but there was a price.
Vietnam as much as anything led to the development of a hard, and to some
extent extra-parliamentary, left which was to plague the party for at least
the next 15 years.
Those around at the time can recall the enthusiasm which surrounded Wilson's
first victory in 1964. He seemed the voice of the new Britain; classless,
interested in technology, planning and economic growth. Pimlott explains
this in terms of big ideas: the National Plan and the new Department of
Economic Affairs. When economic growth proved a chimera, the plan collapsed
and so did Wilsonism. Thereafter he became a prime minister under siege or,
as Wilson later put it himself, someone primarily interested in keeping the
ship afloat. Hindsight suggests that we should be more kind to him than were
some of his contemporaries. Only Margaret Thatcher has subsequently done
better, and even her achievements are subject to review.
Pimlott's book is not perfect, partly because he has not finally formed his
own judgment. He is sometimes too hostile to the ambitious young Wilson,
then unduly sympathetic to the prime minister in his dog days. Yet without
the ambition Wilson would never have arrived in the first place.
The book is also uneasily poised between journalism and history: too much on
scandals like Profumo, not enough detached assessment. Although 811 pages
may seem long, too much is missed out: it is not a chronicle of the time.
But it does contain new detail, like Wilson's alliance with Enoch Powell
during the 1974 election. And it reminds us of some marvellous quotes, such
as Wilson being asked what he would miss most on leaving 10 Downing Street
in 1970: 'Mainly the job.'

FT  29 OCT 92 / Perilous ascent from the pit: After last month's economic
battering, the Amato government is coming to grips with Italy's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quite suddenly the government of Prof Giuliano Amato has recovered its nerve
after being so rudely battered by last month's lira devaluation.
The language of disaster has receded as the floating lira has stabilised
amid calmer foreign exchange markets. The 1993 budget, essential for the
government's international credibility and commitment to tackle Italy's
public finances, has passed its stiffest test in parliament, and the fragile
four-party government coalition is holding. In response, the Bank of Italy
lowered the discount rate 1 percentage point to 14 per cent on Monday, and
the exceptionally high rates charged by the banks to industry have begun to
ease.
'We have been right at the bottom of the pit,' says Mr Piero Barucci, the
Italian Treasury minister. 'Now we are grappling our way out and are just
holding onto the edge.'
As a professional banker, he is too cautious to believe Italy's financial
crisis has been resolved. The overall economic backdrop of Italy struggling
to meet the targets of convergence laid down by the Maastricht treaty
remains uncertain. No date has been fixed for the lira's re-entry into the
European Monetary System; the inflationary effects of the September
devaluation (at present 15 per cent against the D-Mark) will take time to
filter through the economy; and the worst of recession may still come.
However, an important turning point has been reached. The 54-year-old
Socialist prime minister has devoted all his energy during his four months
in office to formulating economic policy and getting it accepted by
parliament. The emphasis now shifts towards the execution of this policy,
while fleshing out the complex details of the government's ambitious
privatisation programme. This may be a more leisurely challenge, but no less
difficult.
All the more so because both the government and the political establishment
have to address the three other priority areas outlined by Prof Amato when
he took office - electoral and institutional reform, cleaning up public
morality and the fight against organised crime.
While attention has focused on Italy's financial crisis, the country has
been going through some profound changes. The postwar structure of political
parties is breaking up and new alliances are in the air. The Christian
Democrats and Socialists, the two principal partners of the present
four-party coalition, risk disintegration if they fail to re-establish their
credibility. The unity of the Italian state is being challenged by a revolt
in the north, championed by the populist Lombard League which opposes paying
taxes to support what it views as corrupt government in Rome and an
unproductive south.
At the same time, the role of the state is set to undergo a sea-change:
welfare benefits are being cut while the public sector is about to be
slimmed down, partly through privatisation, and removed from the ravages of
political patronage.
'Economic reform is moving faster in this turbulence than political change.
This is because everyone has been forced to confront the problem of our
national debt,' observes a leading Italian economist. Indeed, debt has been
at the root of the current turmoil. At more than 10.5 per cent of GDP, it is
nearly three times the European Community average. Interest charges this
year will be the equivalent of the entire 1992 budget deficit, now projected
at L160,000bn (Pounds 74bn).
From the outset Prof Amato has said bluntly that there is no alternative to
austerity and a fundamental shake-up of public spending, whatever the
complexion of the government. His message has sunk home. The political
consensus on the broad lines of economic and financial policy is much
greater than might appear from the statements of those outside the
government. The absence of credible alternatives has enabled an otherwise
weak government to survive with a 16-seat majority in the lower house of
parliament. Proposals to reform pensions, health, local administration and
the civil service were approved last week in record time.
Although the government resorted to votes of confidence to accelerate the
debate, the opposition was centred far more on the limits placed on the
legislative role of parliament than on the content of the reforms. Together,
these reforms will provide a third of the extra L93,000bn needed to hold the
public sector deficit in 1993 at its current level. According to Prof Franco
Reviglio, the budget minister, this is the first attempt to incorporate
structural changes in spending into the annual budget.
The success of the reforms will depend on an improvement in Italy's poorly
motivated and exceptionally bureaucratic civil service. More immediate will
be the impact of increased income, corporate and property taxes, spending
cuts and the freeze on public sector employment expected to be approved by
parliament within the next two weeks. These measures will account for the
bulk of the remaining revenue in the 1993 budget.
The most controversial reform is the government's move to crack down on tax
evasion by the 6.1m people classified as self-employed by taxing them on
computerised estimates of real earnings. The move would, on average, double
the earnings on which the self-employed would be liable for tax.
To make the point, the Finance Ministry has leaked details of a study of
62,000 tax returns of which 90 per cent were shown to be unacceptably low.
One-third declared taxable income of less than L7.2m. The proposed 'minimum
tax' has provoked outraged protest from those affected. But wider public
sympathy could be limited at a time when everyone is being asked to make
sacrifices.
The revolt against the minimum tax has thrown a further unpredictable
element into the fortunes of the two main parties in government, the
Christian Democrats and Socialists. The degree of their public discredit and
internal division is profound and accelerating.
The worst damage has been done by the eight-month-old investigations of
Milan magistrates into municipal corruption on public works contracts, which
has sparked a countrywide drive to uncover illegal funding of political
parties. Now at least 70 members of parliament, mainly Christian Democrat
and Socialist but also members of the former Communist party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) and Republicans, are under investigation for
corruption and bribe-taking.
The picture which is emerging is that of systematic corruption at the local,
regional and national levels, whereby a high percentage of all public works
contracts over the past decade were handed out on the basis of rigged deals,
with 5 per cent commissions going into the pockets of the main political
parties. Political commentators estimate that L4,000bn a year is being
raised in this fashion, supporting some 80,000 bureaucrats in the
infrastructure of the main parties.
The corruption investigations will increase pressure on the parties to find
more transparent forms of finance, to reduce radically the numbers on their
payroll and to curb patronage politics at the state's expense. Equally
important has been the confirmation by Palermo magistrates of what has long
been suspected - the Christian Democrats have enjoyed close links with the
mafia, tacitly permitting organised crime to flourish in southern Italy in
return for votes.
The discredited nomenklatura of the Christian Democrat party, epitomised by
stalwarts such as Mr Arnaldo Forlani and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former
prime minister and supreme deal-maker for three decades, has been forced to
the side lines this month. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the new secretary-general,
has promised to clean the stables and find a new direction. But the party's
perennial appeal as an anti-communist front has evaporated with the end of
the cold war.
Mr Bettino Craxi still clings to the leadership of the Socialists but he has
been seriously weakened by the corruption scandal in his fiefdom of Milan.
He is being challenged by Mr Claudio Martelli, the ambitious justice
minister and Craxi's former protege. The party could split at any moment.
Both parties were savaged by voters in last month's regional elections in
the northern city of Mantua. Voters there gave more than a third of their
support to Mr Bossi's Lombard League. The league is still riding the wave of
anti-Rome sentiment in the north despite some erratic gestures, including an
unsuccessful call for its supporters to boycott the purchase of Treasury
bills, which the party sees as financing irresponsible public spending.
Some politicians such as Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small Republican
party, believe the only way to counter the Lombard's appeal in the north and
centre of the country is to form a new alliance or alliances across the
traditional parties. This is already beginning to take shape in talks
involving Mr Mario Segni, the reformist Christian Democrat, Mr Martelli and
his Socialist supporters, elements in the PDS and the Republicans. Mr Segni
and Mr La Malfa, both sons of prominent politicians, are among the most
visible of the new generation of Italian politicians. Their claims to lead
the next government depend in good measure on the success or failure of Prof
Amato.
Once the 1993 budget is finalised next month, the extent to which political
alliances have shifted could become clearer. But the real problem
confronting Italy's politicians is how long the present government, which
relies on two discredited parties, should be allowed to remain in office. On
his own admission, Prof Amato sees his as a transitional administration with
a twofold task: to establish a framework for restoring Italy's finances,
allowing convergence with the rest of the EC; and to initiate reform of the
unworkable system of proportional representation.
A 60-strong commission, made up of members of the two houses of parliament,
has begun working on proposals for electoral reform, but these will not be
ready before next April. The pace is being forced by the prospect of a
series of referenda on electoral reforms which will go ahead next year if
approved by the constitutional court.
To hold elections before the reforms are in place makes little sense.
Equally, the parties have no funds at present to fight elections. However,
the longer the Amato government stays in power, the more it risks seeing the
base of its political support - the Christian Democrats and Socialists -
fragmenting. For this reason there is likely to be an increasing emphasis on
political change in the coming weeks.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Eastern vision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT THE European Community desperately needs is what Mr George Bush
labelled the 'vision thing'. It is not coming from the politicians. But a
spark has come from Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. What the leaders of the Czech and Slovak
republics, Hungary and Poland, in London yesterday for their first joint
summit meeting with the EC, need is action on one of Mr Attali's ideas: that
for a Continental common market.
The economic and political destiny of eastern and central Europe lies with
the west. As is noted in the European Bank's latest Quarterly Economic
Review, several countries in the region have already seen the share of the
EC markets in their exports rise from 20 to 30 per cent in 1989 to more than
50 per cent. But if eastern and central Europe must look to the west, the
west cannot afford to ignore the east. Eastern Europe now needs what the
west obtained after the second world war: integration through multilateral
trade.
Mr Attali rightly condemns the so-called 'Europe Agreements' between the EC
on one side and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, on the other. These, he
has argued, appear designed to 'restrict their access to key western markets
rather than to integrate them'. Not only are the agreements restrictive,
they are also bilateral. What is needed, instead, is a multilateral
framework binding eastern and central Europe both to western Europe and to
one another.
The EC leaders should propose a European free trade agreement or customs
union of which the European Economic Area, incorporating the EC, would be
the core. The agreement should be open to any European country committed to
the market economy and to democracy. It would offer free access to the
markets of western Europe for manufactures and movement towards free trade
in agricultural products and services. Meanwhile, safeguard mechanisms, such
as anti-dumping, should be made subject to multilateral surveillance.
This is a vision worthy of discussion at the Edinburgh summit. The EC exists
to stabilise Europe. If it tries to promote western stability while ignoring
eastern chaos, it will fail.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (7): Far right stirs up trouble -
Instability too close for comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIANS have watched ethnic war in the old Yugoslav republics, race riots
in eastern Germany, fascist pamphleting in Romania and political instability
in Poland - and thanked their lucky stars that their own country was
different.
On the surface the country remains an island of stability. But Hungary's
extreme right has risen from its slumber, bringing anti-semitism and
territorial ambition, long traditions buried under taboo, back into public
discourse.
It took little to summon up echoes from the darker side of Hungary's past:
one ranting essay damning communists for being Jews and Jews for being
communists in the party newspaper of the ruling conservatives, the Hungarian
Democratic Forum.
But the far right manifesto - turned out to be more than a laughable
throwback to the rhetoric of Hungary's fascist era. The author was Mr Istvan
Csurka, populist writer, vice-president and bad conscience of the Forum.
Support among frustrated ruling party activists for Mr Csurka's call for a
purge of the enemies of the nation is so strong as to make him well-nigh
unassailable, government officials admit.
Tellingly, the Forum's ethical committee has investigated, not Mr Csurka,
but the colleague who dared to write that the manifesto was the basis of a
complete Nazi ideology. Mr Csurka remains in place.
As for Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate prime minister and president of the
Forum, when pressed to take a stand on the article, he could muster little
more than the adjectives 'mistaken and damaging'.
Little wonder. Mr Antall, whose government has managed to push through vital
legislation needed to transform Hungary's economy and institutions, has too
many battles on other fronts to invite another.
The prime minister faces open disaffection among the Forum's liberals, few
though they are, and from his fractious coalition partners, the more loyal
of which last month declared itself the opposition within.
Voters are turning against the Forum in the opinion polls and by-elections.
After 45 years of communism, Hungary needs time to build up a middle class
and broader civil society large and confident enough to provide a secure
base for democratic government.
The liberal professional class came out on to the streets in a peaceful
protest against Mr Csurka and his friends, and western opinion, in which the
government has often sought consolation, has also shown dismay at the
government's appeasement of the far right.
Even some of the prime minister's closest aides, who liked to boast that
Hungary had a natural conservatism that would keep them in power for
decades, now privately resign themselves to defeat at the next elections in
1994.
The perceived state of the economy is another reason for Hungarian
democracy's 'feelbad factor'. Output from the large state enterprises has
declined by a fifth over the past three years, and rising unemployment has
made people cut back on consumption.
For others - and the government's supporters number heavily among them  -
the sharper frustration is that former communists are not sharing the
economic suffering, but turning adeptly into capitalists and prospering.
'They have forgotten Marx and only remember Das Capital,' the prime minister
likes to jibe.
To understand the gall, go to the provinces, says a prime ministerial aide,
and see 'the smiling, self-satisfied faces' of those communists who have
made the transition. A lot of Hungarians want to wipe away that smile. They
voted in the government to do that; it has failed them, and they are angry.
Mr Csurka articulated that feeling - and much more.
The government could push for satisfying purges but only by jeopardising the
stability Mr Antall needs, and undermining vital economic recovery in the
process.
The unpalatable truth is that Hungary's communists were by the final decade
communist only in name and careerists in practice. They have acquired by
default a wealth of experience, and the economy can ill do without them.
The prime minister's circle puts the dilemma as a choice between efficiency
and justice, and by and large it is justice that has fallen by the wayside.
The trouble is that the government is not looking very efficient either. Nor
is it likely to, with the recession postponing recovery to 1993 and beyond.
'Next year is already too close to the elections,' admits one adviser close
to the prime minister. 'Even if there is GDP growth, it will be too slow and
easy to dispute.'
One prime-ministerial aide says that the 'national versus cosmopolitan'
issue will inevitably be one of the main factors in the political fight over
the next 18 months. In itself, that would not be enough to save the Forum
government. It would probably need what one official close to the government
described as the 'Falklands factor', recalling how Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
the former UK Prime Minister, swept to electoral victory on a wave of
patriotic fervour after the Falklands war.
The prime minister is anything but the sabre-rattling type, but there are
others in his party who would not be so squeamish about playing the
nationalist card to save their political careers.
With every far right outburst and regional crisis, Mr Antall's dilemma
tightens. The fates of his party, his government and his country, which Mr
Antall often seemed to consider one and the same, are increasingly out of
line; and the time is coming closer when the prime minister will have to
choose.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (8): Running into resistance - Privatisers
find the going tougher with fewer deals taking place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S slog to free its economy from smothering state ownership, never an
easy one at the best of times, is coming to a vexing juncture.
Privatisation started earlier and has gone faster and further than anywhere
else in eastern Europe, but now it is decelerating, with the government a
way off from its goals of pulling half of the economy out from under the
state by 1994 and creating a Hungarian property-owning class to underpin
political stability.
Few deals have grabbed the headlines since the spring when the State
Property Agency, the privatisation authority, sold NMV, the vegetable oil
and detergent company, to Ferruzzi and Unilever for Dollars 110m.
Moreover, the finance ministry forecasts that privatisation proceeds, which
usually lag announcements by several months and reached a record rate of
Ft55.8bn in the first eight months of this year, will now decline.
The uncomfortable truth is that, after disposing of only about a tenth of
the state's commercial holdings, privatisation is suffering from exhaustion.
The authorities are running low on those rare jewels of the state sector
that sell themselves, on cash investors to buy the rest and, most critically
of all, on support from the population for the whole business.
Hungary's privatisers are finding the going harder because they started with
the best of their portfolio and are now working downwards. So Tungsram, the
light bulb maker and one of the few Hungarian industrial companies with
market share in western Europe, was the first large company to go, to
General Electric of the US in 1990.
Since then western multinationals have driven Hungarian privatisation by
snapping up consumer goods businesses with a franchise on the market they
prize far more than production facilities. Cigarettes, distilling, brewing,
vegetable oil, sugar, confectionary and bread industries are largely 'done',
as the investment bankers put it.
The consumer goods companies that remain are perishable and perishing
quickly. Firstly, western multinationals are in a hurry to carve out market
share before their competitors and lose interest. Secondly, a state
company's market share - and thus its value - generally wilts quickly under
western competition.
One casualty of this phenomenon has been Caola, the Hungarian personal-care
products company, which has failed to attract a western bidder since
Colgate-Palmolive withdrew out of impatience last year.
It is as if privatisation was separating out the Hungarian economy: the
dregs are collecting at the bottom. Western investors take over the best
companies in a sector, make them stronger both technically and financially,
and force the weakest competitors against the wall. The middle ground,
companies which have neither been privatised nor bankrupted, gets narrower
all the time, and so the room for privatisation.
There remain good buys such as Matav, the telecommunications company, and
the regional gas distributors, which have western investors swarming around.
But the utilities take time to privatise because thorough regulation is a
prerequisite.
There are, at the same time as fewer companies to sell, also fewer bidders.
Western multinationals, their earnings under pressure in an international
slowdown, are not in an acquisitive mood. The SPA says that is reflected
more in the number of bidders than in the price.
But that is a problem too, because privatisation officials are obliged to
sell under competitive conditions and transactions are much more difficult
to justify if there is just one serious offer.
Nor have Hungarians, in the middle of economic depression, taken up the
running. Both institutional investors, what few exist, and small investors
have steered clear of equity.
The irony is that, just as the western interest which has driven Hungarian
privatisation is slackening, resentment of foreign economic domination is
stirring.
Polls show that the margin of support for privatisation is dangerously thin
and the view that Hungary is selling itself out is gaining circulation.
The surprise should be that it has taken so long. After all, privatisation
is associated, however unfairly, with lay-offs which have taken unemployment
to 11.4 per cent and foreign buyers account for about 85 per cent of
privatisation sales.
The 160 of Hungary's 2,000 state companies which have gone to foreigners
have a higher profile - shoppers confront their brands every day on the
shelves - and higher value than the simple numbers suggest.
Moreover, Hungary's conservative government is ever more sensitive to
popular feeling on privatisation as it approaches elections in 1994 which
the polls say it would lose. Mr Vaclav Klaus's victory in the Czech election
on the back of a popular privatisation programme has set Hungarian policy
makers thinking.
The challenge to the strategists at the State Property Agency (SPA) is to
refashion privatisation to go down better both with investors and voters.
Hungary needs a dose of popular, homegrown privatisation.
The SPA is taking a first stab by reviving public offerings with the launch
of Pick Salami, a prosperous producer of Hungary's spicy sausage. The issue
is likely to be priced low, at a price-earnings ratio of about six, and
small investors will receive added incentives.
But brokers say that cash demand for shares is so thin that a marketing
dream such as Pick is troubled. That reveals the danger that subsequent
share issues, which would not in any case be so appealing, could flop.
The hard core of the challenge remains how to sell companies with no worth
to investors with no spare cash.
The SPA's response is to hand out 'chips' so that local investors can play
the privatisation game, says Mr Les Nemethy, the SPA's deputy managing
director in charge of transactions. One part of this is to let investors
'buy on the installment plan'.
But many are beginning to realise that even this will not be enough and the
effect is to cause Hungarian policy makers to go back to basic principles.
Mass distribution of companies which linger in state control, an idea for
long rejected out of hand, is now at the top of the agenda.
The authorities plan to embark next year on a scheme owing much to
Czechoslovakia's voucher privatisation, says Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's
privatisation minister.
The new initiative represents a dramatic departure for Hungary's
privatisers, who have until now set themselves against distribution of state
property, so much so that the word 'voucher' remains taboo.
'We won't use the word voucher,' says Mr Szabo, admitting at the same time
that the new scheme would present 'a similar picture from the outside as the
Czech'. Hungary's preferred term is 'credit-note'.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (6): Reserves of strength - The external
accounts are in good shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE clearest indicator of Hungary's readiness to embark on a new path of
sustained economic growth is to be found in the strength of its foreign
reserves and the reduced burden of debt. Over the past two years Hungary,
once viewed as the most indebted of the post-communist states on a per
capita basis, has built up its reserves from Dollars 1.2bn in 1990 to nearly
Dollars 6bn.
Gross debt has stabilised at just under Dollars 23bn while the combination
of a Dollars 700m current surplus over the first seven months, and the
continuing strong inflow of foreign investment funds, has allowed a Dollars
1.1bn reduction in net foreign debt to around Dollars 15bn, according to Mr
Peter Bod, governor of the newly independent central bank, the Hungarian
National Bank.
As a result Hungary's gross debt service ratio has dropped from 63 per cent
in 1990 to around 38 per cent this year. It is forecast to drop to between
31/33 per cent in 1993.
This dramatic improvement in the external accounts is partly a reflection of
the collapse in rouble-denominated trade with the former Comecon area.
Although Hungary still imports most of its diminishing requirements of oil
and gas from the former Soviet Union at dollar prices, resources formerly
dedicated to rouble area exports are now more efficiently and profitably
deployed supplying OECD, and especially EC markets.
Hungary also no longer has to pay hard currency for components incorporated
into Hungarian goods sold on Comecon markets for roubles. This and the lower
real incomes of many poorer Hungarians, has contributed to slack import
demand.
Over the first seven months of this year exports to the EC rose by 21 per
cent compared with a 14 per cent increase in exports overall. In September,
according to Mr Bela Kadar, the foreign trade minister, exports to the EC
exceeded 50 per cent of the total for the first time. This, he points out,
already takes Hungary over the sought after 'integration threshold' which
has to be passed if aspirations for full EC membership before the turn of
the century, are to be realised.
Current levels of exports to the EC compare with the 14 per cent share of
Hungary's exports to the Community in the 1970's and a 25 per cent average
in the 1980's. Traditionally food exports have been high on the list of
exports to EC markets and freer access granted by the EC association
agreement signed earlier this year has helped to boost food exports by 10
per cent.
But with over 60 per cent of all foreign investment going into the
manufacturing and engineering sectors, Hungary looks well placed to increase
its penetration of EC industrial markets.
Thanks largely to its early start with semi-market reforms in the late
1960's, Hungary already managed to attract Dollars 570m in foreign
investment between 1972 and 1989. This experience facilitated its leap to
the top of the post-communist foreign investment league in 1990 when it
attracted Dollars 900m. The equity inflow into privatisation and greenfield
investment projects rose to Dollars 1.56bn in 1991 and amounted to Dollars
740m over the first half of this year. To date over half the total foreign
investment in post-communist east and central Europe has flowed into this
country.
For the average Hungarian, however, the bulging coffers of the National Bank
of Hungary are merely a tantalizing reflection of the scale of the sacrifice
of living standards demanded for future growth. This is politically
unsustainable and skirmishing is already mounting with 1994 elections in
view.
Export-led growth will remain the underlying priority. But Hungary no longer
needs to add to reserves and can afford a more expansive, domestic economic
policy. The IMF's requirement that the budget deficit is reduced to within 6
per cent of GDP will ensure that reflating the domestic economy starts
cautiously. But industrial output is already perking up after two traumatic
years for the old-style public sector economy.
Output from the dominant state sector dropped nearly 45 per cent from 1988
levels but hit bottom in May and is now showing tentative signs of recovery.
Output from the dynamic, but still largely unrecorded private sector, is
rising sharply but its growth is not yet strong enough to absorb
unemployment which has soared from one to 11.1 per cent over the past two
years.
Next year's expected rise in domestic output and consumption will raise
imports and probably reduce the strong current account surpluses of the past
two years. But reserves and exports are now strong enough to sustain a
politically necessary rise in domestic output and income.
This year has already seen the first clear benefit from foreign investment.
Mr Kadar estimates that around 15 per cent of Hungarian exports over the
first half of this year came from newly established foreign companies such
as General Electric and Elektrolux and many other smaller companies among
the 13,000 foreign joint ventures formed to date. This proportion is
expected to rise smartly as export production builds up at the car and
engine plants built by General Motors, and the other investments such as
Suzuki and Ford.
Foreign companies have invested over Dollars 4bn and are playing a crucial
role in bringing Hungary's productive capacity up to world standards. But
they are also looking forward to rising domestic incomes and demand. Only
when this starts rising will the newcomers benefit, as suppliers to the
growing domestic market and as exporters from this stable and low cost base.

<TEXT>
KANEB-Furmanite, the German subsidiary of Kaneb Services of the US, has
acquired KAB, the east Berlin-based power engineering company, in return for
a pledge to invest a minimum of DM20m (Dollars 13.10m) in the group over the

It has also agreed with the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the
privatisation of former East German industry, to retain KAB's 1,300
employees and to expand its range of products to include power conversion
equipment.
Kaneb will also offer decontamination technology to tap the lucrative market
for cleaning up polluted east German industrial sites as well as recently
shut-down nuclear electricity stations.
The Berlin-based company is to provide these services to east European
countries which face growing international pressure to close down their
Soviet-designed nuclear reactors.
Kaneb Services maintains pipelines in the US and eastern Europe.
Through the Furmanite group, employing 2,500 people, Kaneb provides
engineering and services for the nuclear and conventional power generating
industry, as well as the chemicals and petrochemicals industries.
Furmanite's German subsidiary has 800 employees, of whom 600 are based in
east Germany.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nestle shows interest in buying
parts of SME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss-based multinational foods group, yesterday gave the first
clear signal of interest in acquiring parts of SME, Italy's state-controlled
foods, retailing and catering concern.
Mr Francois Xavier Perroud, a Nestle spokesman, said: 'We are watching this
with undisguised interest. I can't exclude some parts of SME could fit well
with our existing activities'.
However, he declined to comment on whether negotiations were taking place.
Rumours of a purchase by Nestle, or other leading European foods groups,
have driven up shares in SME, which is 62 per cent owned the IRI state
holding company, in Milan in recent days.
The stock, which has surged by 40 per cent in the past two months, yesterday
climbed by 2.35 per cent to L4,849. On Tuesday, SME was suspended for the
day after Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, demanded
information from IRI about its plans.
SME is one of Italy's biggest food producers, with sales of L2,323bn
(Dollars 1.74bn) last year. The remaining turnover derives from retailing -
L2,478bn in 1991 - mainly through the GS supermarket chain, while catering
sales amounted to L1,01bn.
Any acquirer would probably concentrate on SME's branded foods. Its Bertolli
vegetable oils and Cirio canned vegetables brands are household names in
Italy.
Cirio and associated companies are undisputed leaders in the L1,100bn
Italian tomato products market, with a share of almost 28 per cent.
SME has also consolidated its position abroad. It claims over 24 per cent of
the L370bn US olive oil market and substantial presences in France and Spain
for processed tomato products.
In replies to Consob, IRI and SME both denied negotiations on the sale of
all or part of the group. However, IRI's severe debt problems have spurred
speculation about a possible disposal. This week, Ferruzzi, the Italian
agro-industrial group, confirmed its interest in SME, while spokesmen for Mr
Raul Gardini, the former Ferruzzi head now building an independent foods
empire, indicated he may also be interested in expanding his activities.
By contrast, Ifil, the investment concern controlled by Fiat's Agnelli
family, which has been expanding its food activities, yesterday denied any
interest in SME, as did BSN, the French foods group.

UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's largest insurance group,
yesterday announced an unexpectedly steep 59 per cent fall in interim
profits and a FFr1bn recapitalisation of Banque Worms, its troubled banking
subsidiary.
The combination of the sharp fall in profits - from FFr2.34bn in the first
six months of 1991 to FFr948m (Dollars 184.07m) in the same period this year
 -and the announcement of the terms of Banque Worms' recapitalisation
depressed UAP's shares.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, added to the gloom by saying that he did not
anticipate an improvement for the second half.
The announcement comes only a few weeks after Assurances Generales de
France, another large insurer, announced that its profits had fallen in the
first half. French insurers have been affected by intense competition and
the impact of the economic slowdown on industrial investments and property
holdings.
UAP was also hit by the performance of Banque Worms, which posted an interim
loss of FFr350m. The group announced in July that it planned to recapitalise
Banque Worms, which has suffered from a fall in the value of its property
portfolio and investments, but analysts had anticipated a smaller injection
of perhaps FFr600m to FFr700m.
Mr Peyrelevade said UAP was cutting overheads and broadening its business
base in an attempt to return to profits growth. The group increased turnover
by 22 per cent from FFr53.8bn to FFr65.6bn in the first half, but this was
largely due to the contribution from Sun Life in the UK.

prices

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, saw profits fall to NKr2.2bn
(Dollars 352.56m) from NKr3.5bn due to lower oil prices, weak refinery
margins and depressed prices.
It warned that profits for the year would be lower than last year unless
prices for the group's main products improved significantly, or the dollar
strengthened against the krone.
Last year, the group reported a net profit of NKr4.2bn, compared with
NKr4.3bn in 1990.
Third-quarter net profit was halved to NKr535m from NKr1.1bn last year,
despite a rise in operating revenue to NKr20.7bn from NKr19.7bn.
Third-quarter pre-tax profit fell to NKr2.5bn from NKr3.6bn.
Statoil was forced to charge accounts with a NKr1.2bn loss compared with a
NKr476m financial charge last year.
The charge resulted partly from a NKr489m loss incurred by swapping free
shares in Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, for
A-shares. Statoil holds a 9.4 per cent stake in Saga.
Operating revenue rose to NKr61bn from NKr57.8bn as operating costs
increased to NKr46.5bn from NKr42.5bn.
Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive, warned the company may be forced to
intensify efforts to reduce costs if market conditions do not improve. He
said Statoil was considering delaying investments and divesting some of its
North Sea assets, but gave no further details.
Operating profit fell by NKr1.1bn to NKr10bn in the nine-month period.
Statoil said weak markets had been party offset by higher oil and gas
production and increased revenue from pipeline transport. Production rose to
115m barrels from 105m last year, but oil prices fell in the period to an
average Dollars 19.36 a barrel from Dollars 19.82 last year.
Group pre-tax profit fell to NKr8.9bn from NKr10.7bn last year.
For Statoil's individual business operations, exploration and production
suffered a decline in operating profit to NKr6.6bn from NKr7.3bn last year,
mainly because of weaker oil prices.
The natural gas division, a bright spot, saw operating profit in the period
rise to NKr3bn from NKr2.6bn last year due to an increase in volumes of
transported gas.
Refining and marketing saw operating profit nearly halved to NKr563m from
NKr1bn last year, due to lower refinery margins and weaker rates in the
marine transport business. Statoil operates more than 30 oil tankers.
Petrochemicals and plastics plunged into an operating loss of NKr265m from a
profit of NKr144m last year.
'The weak result so far this year reflects the deep recession affecting the
petrochemicals industry and particularly the plastics sector,' Statoil said.

nine months

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, sank to a
SKr361m (Dollars 62.56m) loss in the first nine months.
The result, which compares with a SKr85m profit a year ago and is worse than
expected, reflects a sharp deterioration in third-quarter sales in the
group's main European markets and a big loss at Ovako, the special steels
operation which it bought last year.
It means the group will make a sizeable loss this year, with continued
losses forecast for the final three months, upsetting the prediction of a
1992 profit which it made at the six-month stage.
As a result, SKF will intensify its efforts to reduce costs, with a further
3,000 job losses projected in 1993 on top of the 10,000 which have been cut
since 1990.
Group sales in the first nine months fell to SKr19.99bn from SKr20.07bn a
year ago. The company said sales to the European car industry, which had
shown a positive trend for more than a year, deteriorated. 'All forecasts
for the European car and truck industry point to a further reduction in
sales during 1993,' it added.
With Europe accounting for 60 per cent of sales, it was little consolation
that the group had better sales performances in the North American and
Asia-Pacific regions.
Ovako recorded a SKr407m loss over the nine months on sales of SKr2.30bn.
Its result reflected falling volumes and lower steel prices. A year ago,
Ovako was reported as an associate company.
'The prospects for the fourth quarter and for 1993 are grim,' said Mr John
Longhurst, European capital goods analyst at James Capel, which now expects
SKF to make a 1992 pre-tax loss of up to SKr600m, excluding redundancy
provisions. This compares with a SKr221m loss last year.

SHARES in LVMH, the French luxury goods group, fell by FFr231 to FFr3,570
(Dollars 693.20) on the Paris stock market yesterday after the company
announced static sales for the first three quarters of the year and forecast
stable profits.
The group, which owns a string of prestigious brand names, said it had been
affected by the increasingly 'difficult and uncertain' economic environment
and the instability of exchange rates.
Sales rose by less than 1 per cent to FFr14.7bn, from FFr14.66bn in the same
period of 1991. The only division to show growth was perfume and beauty
products, which lifted sales from FFr3.86bn to FFr3.36bn. Sales of wines and
spirits fell to FFr6.9bn to FFr7.45bn, reflecting the depressed state of the
champagne market. Luggage sales suffered a negligible fall to FFr3.39bn from
FFr3.42bn.
However, LVMH said its 1992 results 'should be close' to those of 1991, when
it made net profits of FFr3.74bn on sales of FFr22.04bn.

<TEXT>
TURNOVER at BMW, the German luxury car maker, is set to climb between 5 and
6 per cent to DM25.5bn (Dollars 16.70bn) in the 10 months to the end of
October, the company's chief executive said yesterday.
Speaking at BMW's Munich headquarters, Mr Eberhard von Kunheim said that the
group had managed to defy the difficult conditions afflicting world car
markets, and would continue to do so.
Unit sales were set to reach 500,000 for the 10-month period, an increase of
8 to 9 per cent on last year.
This compared with a 8 to 9 per cent drop in unit sales in Germany, the
company's most important market, over the same period.
However, Mr von Kunheim warned that the appreciation of the D-Mark over
recent weeks would inevitably affect the company's prospects.
The real effects of a stronger D-Mark would be felt in the next few months
and they are likely to have a strong impact, he said.
Mr von Kunheim would not quantify the likely effects of currency movements.
However, Mr Bolker Doppelfeld, finance director, said that but for currency
variations, profits for this year would have been 'superb'.
Mr von Kunheim said only that profits would be 'satisfactory' this year.
Last year, net profits were DM782.7m, up from DM695.9m in 1991.
The production total for the year is likely to approach 560,000 to 580,000
units. models.
Sales in the US are likely to rise to 65,000, an increase of 20 per cent
since last year.
Between January and September, deliveries in the German market rose by 8 per
cent to 190,300.
In the US, deliveries rose by 27 per cent to 49,200, and in the UK by 9 per
cent to 33,700. In Italy they rose 21 per cent to 29,600.
Total worldwide deliveries rose 9 per cent to 450,700.

PORSCHE, the German sports car manufacturer, has fallen into the red for the
year to July 31, reflecting the worldwide difficulties in the luxury car
market, AP-DJ reports from Stuttgart.
The company yesterday announced a net loss of DM65.8m (Dollars 42.89m)
compared with a profit of DM17.1m in the previous 12 months. Group sales
slid 13 per cent from DM2.7bn from DM3.1bn.
Vehicle sales declined at the same rate to 23,060 units from 26,486 units.
Sales in the domestic market rose 9.2 per cent to 11,404 cars while exports
slumped 26 per cent to 11,656.
The loss was attributed to high-priced incentives needed to sell its cars
and the costs of cutting jobs. After shedding 850 workers in the 1992 fiscal
year another 1,000 job losses are planned in the current fiscal year.
Such cuts represent heavy layoffs for the company, which employed little
more than 9,000 workers a year ago.
The world economic slow-down and the weak car sector in particular were
cited behind the company's falling earnings, revenue and vehicle sales.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (2): Prospects still attractive - In spite
of the bad news, the economy has underlying strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE light of a return to steady economic growth is still visible at the end
of the Hungarian tunnel. But earlier hopes that 1992 would mark the point
where export growth and stronger domestic demand would counteract
contraction of the traditional state controlled enterprises have dimmed.
Official GDP estimates point to another 5 per cent decline this year,
although the under-recording of activity in the dynamic private sector, and
higher savings, indicates that real incomes have not fallen as sharply.
The sharp rise in personal savings is a reflection both of unemployment
fears and wider income differentials.
Higher savings mean lower domestic consumption, which is reflected in lower
imports, slack domestic demand and concentration on exports, the main
success story of the past three years.
The question now is whether Hungarian, and other central European exporters,
will be able to keep up the good performance on EC and other markets in the
face of the slowdown in economic activity in important markets such as
Germany.
That growth in western markets remains in double digits but appears to be
slowing.
Deterioration in the international economic climate threatens however to
limit the pace of privatisation and foreign investment. Many of the best
companies have already been privatised and hard-pressed western
multinationals are in a less acquisitive frame of mind, confronting
Hungary's privatisers with a dearth of buyers.
Adding risk to reluctance is war in the Yugoslav successor states, cited for
instance by Kaufring, the German department store group, when it recently
withdrew an offer for Centrum Department Stores.
The greatest turbulence in Hungary's small and open economy, however, is of
the country's own making. Hungary's own reforms have moved into higher gear
this year - with some unexpectedly perverse effects.
The government unwittingly planted a time-bomb when it passed vital new laws
on banking and bankruptcy late last year. Privatisation, the crucial
centerpiece which was put into place two years ago, has a downside too.
State companies have been delaying investment and other decisions until the
uncertainty over ownership is resolved and have been busy shedding assets
and activities before new owners move in.
Price liberalisation too, though now largely complete, has left a legacy of
inflationary expectations requiring firm, monetary policy to control.
Assaulted by this battery of hard hitting reforms, the still predominant
state sector of the economy has suffered grievously. Mr Mihaly Kupa, the
finance minister, initially forecast that the economy would regain its 1988
level of output in 1993.
But after the latest shocks, the official GDP in 1993 will still be a full
17 per cent below the level at which it stood five years ago - and even that
depends on the government's latest forecast of gentle growth of up to 3 per
cent next year being borne out.
Fortunately official statistics tell only part of the story. They only cover
enterprises employing more than 50 people and overstate the depth of the
recession by failing to register fully the growth of small businesses and
the dynamism of the private sector.
Electricity consumption, for example, remains high, despite the closure or
scaling back of big energy intensive industries like steel, aluminium and
chemicals. Basic structural changes have taken place to raise the underlying
productivity and efficiency of the economy. The changing pattern of trade
away from the old emphasis on rigid state planning has also meant great
gains in efficiency.
Imports of machinery for example grew 68 per cent in the first half of 1992
as investment stabilised and industrial output ticked upwards in the summer.
These new machines are being installed mainly in the new joint venture or
privately owned factories. In the past much of the expensive machinery or
components imported from the west for hard currency was then incorporated in
exports to the Comecon countries sold for soft roubles. This left Hungary
with hard currency debt and useless soft currency surpluses.
But business still suffers from a lack of confidence, which extends from
economists to most ordinary Hungarians, and is self-fulfilling. Lay-offs
which have pushed unemployment past 10 per cent have shattered consumers'
fragile confidence. Hungarians have turned to saving against all their
spendthrift traditions and economists' expectations. Net household savings -
negligible when communism guaranteed everyone a secure if mediocre existence
 -have shot up to 10 per cent of GDP.
On the positive side this has allowed the government to finance its deficit
without reversing the fall in interest rates, at least so far. But low
spending has hit Hungarian companies when they were still reeling from the
first shock of the recession and the disappearance of east European
business.
The gloom is almost certainly overstated. The economy - at a much lower
level of activity - has achieved a substantial degree of financial
stability.
The recession, and its attendant unemployment, has borne down hard on
inflation. Manufacturers and retailers have to price keenly to attract
price-conscious consumers. Employees cannot afford to press pay demands
above inflation when there are few jobs on offer, even less so when the
trade unions are divided into three squabbling organisations.
So shop windows are plastered with discount advertisements, consumer price
inflation has halved from its peak to around 20 per cent and producer prices
are rising at about half that rate. Externally, the current account shows an
improvement of over 6 per cent of GDP over three years.
Western investors too, are still bullish about the future.
For Hungary has some great competitive advantages.
Foreign motor manufacturers and other big employers have found their staff
cheap, capable and flexible. Wage levels are a tenth of west Germany's but
basic educational standards are superior to Britain's; and the trade unions
are in one western executive's words, 'pussycats'.
As subcontractors set up locally and the local market finally takes off,
Hungary's competitive edge - unblunted by transport costs - could begin to
show.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (5): New ideas well received - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATURE has not been kind to central Europe this summer and Hungarian
agriculture in particular has suffered one of the worst droughts on record.
In spite of lower production, however, exports are expected to exceed last
year's record Dollars 2.7bn by around Dollars 200m, underlining the
importance of the farming sector to Hungary's overall economic performance.
The European Community is the main market for Hungarian food exports thanks
to lower production costs than Poland and and average export subsidy to
producers of around 20 per cent. Germany is the biggest single market but
the EC association agreement, which lowers levies and allows a 10 per cent
annual rise in export volumes, gives a framework for further steady
expansion in EC markets generally.
The aim of government policy is to make Hungarian agriculture
internationally competitive without subsidies, and it is this aim which
drives the large scale restructuring and privatisation of both land and the
broader agro-industrial complex now under way. The legal framework for the
transformation of the communist collectivised agriculture is in place and,
by the end of 1994, nearly 80 per cent of Hungary's 6.5m cropland hectares
should be in private hands.
After over four decades of collectivised farming, however, there is little
desire or ability to return to small scale peasant farming. Ownership of
most of the nearly 1,400 agricultural co-operatives will be transferred into
the hands of 270,000 active co-op members, 380,000 pensioners and 460,000
former members and former owners or their heirs.
The co-ops will lose their social obligations to local villages and many of
their agro-industrial activities will be hived off and privatised. They will
be re-laced by a mixture of private and family farms, farming associations
and new-type co-operatives based on shared ownership and market-related
production.
Most of the 130 state farms will also be privatised although 14 of the
largest and most technically advanced will remain in state hands to ensure
that valuable stock breeding, seed selection and other expertise is not
dissipated.
A typical example is the Babolna State Farm, created by the Habsburg state
in 1796 and with an international reputation as a breeder of Arab stallions.
Always a flagship of Hungarian agriculture, today Babolna runs a successful
joint venture chicken breeding operation with Arbor Acres of the US and
supplies beef and chicken hamburger patties to McDonalds, which is fast
expanding throughout Hungary. Several other foreign joint ventures are under
negotiation.
Babolna exports widely through the Middle East and Latin America as well as
Europe and retains links with the huge potential markets of the former
Soviet Union which it is re-developing on market-based principles.
Opening up Hungarian agriculture to new ownership, new methods and new
markets reflects awareness of the need for fresh capital and fresh ideas.
This approach has been welcomed by the multi-national food companies. Kraft,
Philip Morris, Tate &amp; Lyle, Knorr, Ferruzzi, Unilever and others have all
made substantial investments and are busy improving productivity, product
lines and packaging.
Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the ministry of agriculture, who is a
leading advocate of the need for foreign investment to increase the value
added to farm products, points to Phillip Morris as an example of the
benefits. Last year PM exported Dollars 20m worth of cigarettes to the
Ukraine from the newly acquired Eger tobacco factory which never exported
that amount during its 40 year existence as a state factory.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (4): Down on the farm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTINATIONALS are not alone in spotting the wider potential for developing
Hungary's agricultural assets. Earlier this year Danube Farms, a consortium
of UK food processors, retailers, farmers and leisure industry interests
acquired a 90-year lease on a former loss-making state farm south of
Budapest. It spreads across 22,000 acres of irrigated cropland and
traditional Hungarian puszta prairie.
Mr Mark Cherrington, the farm's managing director, is a 'hands-on' former UK
farmer and Mr Ian Chesterman, in charge of boosting vegetable production,
came from growing export vegetables in Zambia.
The six-man expatriate management team has the skill and experience to
develop the farm as a producer of high quality vegetables and dairy products
and as an industrial park for food processors. For potential investors in
these areas, says Mr Cherrington, the farm offers a 'hassle-free' entry into
the Hungarian market, with plenty of land for industrial development
available with less bureaucracy than through conventional channels such as
the State Property Agency.
The consortium also has property development and leisure industry experience
relevant to developing parts of the farm, especially around the protected
national park area of the puszta, as a rural resort.
The farm already attracts around 15,000 visitors annually for its daily
horse show and the new owners plan to expand from the existing small hotel
and traditional Hungarian horse riding centre. The consortium's plans to
develop clay pigeon shooting, golf driving facilities and a swimming pool
are expected to appeal to the growing expatriate community as well as
Hungarians.
Already, annualised output from the 1,000-strong herd of Holstein milking
cows has risen from 5,000 to around 6,500 litres per head and the cost of
winter feed has been lowered by early cropping and silaging of 24,000 tons
of maize which would have been worth much less if sold in grain form. But
the biggest changes are planned for the 10,000 arable acres where high value
niche market crops such as peas, sugar, fresh vegetables and soft fruits
will largely replace low value bulk crops such as wheat, maize and barley.
Only 200 of the original 360 workers are employed on the farm at present but
the vegetable farm alone will need about 300 workers in full operation. 'Our
main difficulty in three years' time will be finding enough workers', Mr
Cherrington says.

<DATELINE>
   LATE in 1991, the Budapest parliament passed three dry laws
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
on bankruptcy, banking and accountancy. The legislation looked so innocuous
that it slipped past without great controversy or even much consideration.
After all, the laws were taken straight from the west European book.
That missed the point. The laws have given the market economy critical mass
in Hungary and the result both shocking and sudden. 'The country is going
through a big bang,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, who was president of the
National Bank of Hungary when the laws were being drafted.
The irony is that Hungary's conservative government, which came to power on
a platform of gradual reform, appears to have sleep-walked into the big bang
that it always decried. 'It was an absolutely unintentional move - but a
good one,' says Mr Suranyi.
The bankruptcy act gave companies a legal duty to declare their insolvency
and shut down loss-making activities.
At the same time, the law on financial institutions obliged banks to make
provisions against doubtful loans, allowed them to write off the sums
against tax and set exacting international standards for capital adequacy.
The final piece was the new regulation of accounting practices which allowed
companies to depreciate investment far more rapidly than before.
This cocktail, whose plain ingredients disguised its punch, has brought the
balance sheet burdens of Hungarian banks and companies into the open - and
dumped them on the government's lap.
Gain there may be someday, but for the moment the finance ministry at least
is feeling the pain. The wave of bankruptcies that hit this spring has had a
direct effect on government tax revenues. More significant is the knock-on
effect of insolvency.
Banks have provisioned heavily against non-performing assets at the expense
of their taxable profits and the state budget. Policymakers reckon the
authorities will be lucky to collect an eighth of the Ft60bn planned for
1992 in revenue from banks. To make things worse, the new depreciation
allowances for companies have cut the yield from corporation tax.
The outcome: a budget deficit which soared past the 1992 target of Ft70bn
after just four months, broke Hungary's accord with the International
Monetary Fund, and is heading towards Ft200bn or 7 per cent of GDP by
year-end.
Even that figure is obtained only with an accounting trick which flatters
Hungary's state finances: the government pays interest at well below market
levels on funds it has borrowed from the central bank.
While stimulating domestic demand, the budget deficit has halted the fall in
interest rates and threatens to crowd out any substantial recovery in
investment.
In any case, the rates which apply to companies have proved sticky
downwards. The financial reforms come into play again here. Banks, desperate
to build up reserves, have brought down lending rates far more slowly than
deposit rates to the point that spreads approach 10 per cent.
That is when the banks lend at all. They are busy also reducing lending to
meet capital adequacy requirements and because they have been burnt by
bankruptcy among clients. Hungary is in the middle of a credit crunch that
puts the western variety to shame.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Sir Leon Brittan joins row
over capital standards - IOSCO Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, yesterday
became involved in the growing row between financial regulators over capital
requirements for banks and securities firms.
Sir Leon criticised remarks which Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, had made in an interview with the
Financial Times on Tuesday. Mr Breeden had warned that a recently-adopted EC
capital adequacy directive (or CAD) was unsafe. Sir Leon denied this last
night: 'It is certainly not as some have claimed unsafe.'
In a further attack on Mr Breeden's refusal to agree to Iosco's proposal for
a common international capital standard, Sir Leon said: 'In today's global
markets, no single national regulator . . . can expect to impose their
system on everyone else'.
Mr Breeden was also criticised by Mr Andrew Large, the chairman of the UK's
Securities and Investments Board, who said he did not think it was proper
for Mr Breeden to cast aspersions against the capital standards of other
countries.
His remarks were made after an emergency meeting of Iosco's technical
committee, which was called to discuss the widening gulf between the SEC and
other securities regulators on a new international standard which would
establish a minimum capital level to be maintained by securities firms.
Some regulators had been hopeful that three years of negotiations on the
capital standard might be close to conclusion. They had not been aware of Mr
Breeden's fundamental objections, they said.
However, the SEC said last night it was baffled by the reaction of other
regulators: 'We have been consistent for three years', an official said.
No agreement is possible without the consent of the SEC, since it is
regulator of the world's biggest securities market in the US.
The dispute between the SEC and other regulators centres on the amount of
capital which securities firms should hold to cover the risk of losses on
equity portfolios. The SEC wants a securities firms to maintain a high
minimum capital level, along the lines of rules in force in the US.
The SIB wants a formula which would encourage securities firms to hedge
their equity portfolios by using netting techniques. The SIB believes that
netting - in its simplest form offsetting a holding of shares with a
matching contract to sell other shares - reduces the risks faced by
securities firms.
It argues that the SEC's proposed amendments to the Iosco draft standard
would discourage securities firms from using netting techniques.
Mr Jean Saint-Geours, chairman of France's Commission des Operations de
Bourse, who takes over as head of Iosco's technical committee tomorrow,
suggested a new approach to capital adequacy discussions which could allow
different capital rules to apply to shares from different countries.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts spurred on by stronger sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds enjoyed a strong rally, spurred on by sterling's
firmness in the foreign exchanges, and gained up to a point at the long end.
The pound strengthened to DM2.4269, from DM2.4207 late on Tuesday in London.
Dealers said the market received a further lift in the afternoon following
comments from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England.
The governor stressed the need to aim for non-inflationary growth and said
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 1.0 per cent to 4.0 per cent target
range for inflation was likely to be met assuming Britain kept a tight
fiscal stance.
Dealers added that the calmer political climate also contributed to the
market's buoyant mood. The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 yesterday rose to 103
1/8 from 102 3/32 at Tuesday's close. In the futures market, the Liffe gilt
futures contract climbed from 100.17 to a high of 101.09 before ending at
101.04.
US Treasury prices eased slightly yesterday afternoon after firming in the
morning in the wake of Tuesday's gains.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  7/32 at 95 15/32 ,
yielding 7.631 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 27/32 ,
yielding 4.333 per cent.
The decline was attributed to profit-taking following the afternoon Treasury
auction of Dollars 10.75bn in five-year notes at a stop-out rate of 5.84 per
cent.
Dealers and investors were pleased with the market's resilience on Tuesday
in the face of a much better-than-expected third-quarter GDP report, and
follow-through buying in early trading yesterday kept prices firm. Analysts
said that Tuesday's performance suggested the market may have found a
temporary floor.
Sentiment was also buoyed by news of a 0.7 per cent rise in consumer
spending and personal income in September. Excluding special fators, the
figures were consistent with sluggish economic growth and pointed to
continued weakness during the final quarter.
DISAPPOINTMENT over the Bundesbank's decision to leave the repo rate
unchanged yesterday pushed German government bond prices lower in the
morning, but the market later recovered to end firmer on the day. The
central bank left the rate for securities repurchase agreements unchanged in
its latest money market operations, dashing hopes of a cut in the key
interest rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting.
The central bank injected DM11.4bn of liquidity at its allocation of 14-day
repos, leaving the lowest accepted repo rate unchanged at 8.75 per cent. The
Liffe bund futures contract rose from 91.48 to trade at around 91.61 by late
afternoon.
HOPES of an easing in interest rates lifted Japanese government bonds with
both the cash and futures markets reaching new highs.
The December futures contract rose from its opening of 107.25 to end at
107.36, the high of the day. In the cash market, the yield on the No 145
issue moved from 4.755 per cent at the opening to end at 4.725 per cent.
Dealers said investors were hoping to see an easing in interest rates this
week in conjunction with the quarterly meeting of the Bank of Japan's branch
managers.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Committee publishes
supervision principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE technical committee of the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (Iosco) yesterday published a set of principles for the
supervision of financial conglomerates, designed to focus greater attention
on the group as a whole rather than solely on the securities entity.
Securities regulators have traditionally concentrated on 'solo' regulation,
believing that securities firms can, if necessary, be wound down with
minimal risk to market stability and to investors.
However, the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the US securities firm, in
1990, triggered by problems within the holding company, focused regulators'
minds on the risk of contagion - that problems within one part of a company,
perhaps unregulated, can quickly spill over into other areas.
The shift towards group regulation is reflected in the EC's capital adequacy
directive, and bank regulators, under Basle Committee on banking
supervision, have also opted for an approach based on consolidation.
However, bank regulators favour a quantitative approach, which involves
measuring risk and applying a specific capital requirement accordingly.
Securities regulators tend to take a more qualitative approach, exemplified
by the US Securities and Exchange Commission's recently-introduced risk
assesment rules. However, the Iosco principles allow for the full spectrum
of supervision techniques.
The Iosco paper proposes greater sharing of information between regulators,
and suggests identifying a lead regulator, with primary responsibility for
group-based risk assessment. However, the guidelines stop short of proposing
any routine exchange of information.
While banking and securities regulators are moving in the same direction,
convergence with insurance regulators 'still remains some way off',
according to the report.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Swedish notes tap confidence in French
franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currencies dominated the international bond market yesterday, with
Sweden and Finland, as expected, tapping the markets in French francs and
D-Marks respectively. Investor confidence in the franc has been improved by
its survival of the recent trial by speculators.
Sweden issued a slightly larger than expected FFr6bn five-year Eurobond
bearing a coupon of 8 1/2 per cent and priced at 99.61 to yield 46 basis
points over comparable French government OAT. Traders described the pricing
as generous but noted that Sweden needs to keep investor interest alive if
it is to meet its heavy borrowing programme.
Finland's DM1bn five-year issue, arranged by Dresdner Bank and Morgan
Stanley, will be priced today to yield 62 to 66 basis points over German
government bonds. In contrast to Sweden, Finland is coming under criticism
for failing to price its deals sufficiently generously.
Although the paper is supposed to be aimed at international institutional
investors, local traders feel the maturity and pricing will make it just as
attractive to smaller domestic buyers. The issue adds to a recent string of
fixed-price offerings in the D-Mark sector as its international importance
grows.
British Gas launched its first deal since it was downgraded by the debt
rating agencies in August, a Pounds 200m five-year issue. Lead manager
Credit Suisse First Boston said that the speed with which the issue sold out
and was freed to trade shows that UK and continental European investors
still view British Gas as a top-quality credit and that sterling interest
rates are expected to fall further.
The launch spread of 44 basis points over the five-year gilt tightened to 40
basis points by the close of trading, reflecting strong demand for the
paper.
The African Development Bank returned to the Euroyen market for the first
time since early 1987, with a Y40bn five-year issued priced at 42 basis
points over the comparable Japanese government bond.
Deputy treasurer Mrs N'Diaye said the triple-A rated bank wanted its name
and credit to be better known to a wider investor base and to establish a
benchmark for future borrowings in the sector. The issue brings its total
borrowings so far this year to nearly Dollars 1bn.
The Asian Development Bank announced its second so-called dragon bond, a
Dollars 300m five-year issue, managed out of Hong Kong, aimed at building up
Asian capital markets.
With a launch spread of 44 basis points Nordic Investment Bank's Dollars
200m three-year bond was thought to be aggressively priced for an unusual
name.
A Dollars 150m five-year Eurobond for Empresas la Moderna, the Mexican
cigarette distributor, emerged with a coupon of 10 1/4 per cent and was
priced at 99.70 to yield a higher than expected 450 basis points over
Treasuries.
Moody's has placed Canada's triple-A rated foreign currency debt under
review for possible downgrade, reflecting the political and economic
uncertainty created by the rejection of the latest constitutional reform
package earlier this week. Canada lost its triple-A rating from Standard &amp;
Poor's two week's ago.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: UK rules on insider dealing
attacked - ISOCO Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's proposed legislation on insider dealing was attacked
yesterday at the International Organisation of Securities Commissions
(Iosco) conference by Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment
Management, writes Norma Cohen.
The directive, as proposed, defines inside information as any which 'may
affect a company's business prospects'. It is intended to correspond to a
more vaguely-worded European Community directive barring insider trading. Mr
Myners said that that proposal leaves far too ambiguous a definition to
enable fund managers and securities analysts to do their jobs.
'I believe that, unless these uncertainties are addressed by a more focused
definition, we are likely to make the job of the securities analyst and
portfolio manager almost impossible to perform,' he said. 'Uncertainties
about what constitutes insider dealing are unacceptable,' he added.
Mr Myners also pointed out several obstacles to a genuine cross-border
business in investment management, both within the EC and further afield.
First, inconsistencies in accounting conventions and access to information
have hampered genuine cross-border investments because analysts in one
country cannot easily understand the value of companies in others.
He noted that under UK accounting, pharmaceuticals company SmithKline
Beecham has negative net worth of Pounds 300m while under US accounting
rules its shareholder funds are Pounds 3.5bn. 'This is a nonsense and
something must be done about it,' he said. Also, French and German companies
regularly make use of provisions and extraordinary items to smooth earnings,
he added.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Continental firms pose threat
to UK brokers, study says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL European brokers are posing an increasing threat to London-based
brokerage houses when it comes to European equity research, according to a
survey of institutional investors published today
'Continental European brokers are rapidly winning respect among
institutional investors for the quality of their equity research,' says the
European Brokers &amp; Analysts Survey 1992, produced by Euromoney Publications.
The survey is based on the responses of 136 international institutional
investors, including large insurance companies, pension funds and other fund
managers responsible for managing a total of around Dollars 1,759bn.
Investment managers were asked for their views on the quality and execution
of European equity and bond research.
The main findings are:
Continental European brokers, which are pouring more of their resources into
their research activities, are increasingly posing a threat to established
London-based brokers.
Nearly 97 per cent of respondents said they dealt through local brokers,
74.2 per cent through London, 38.1 per cent through New York, and 27.8 per
cent through Tokyo.
The survey points out that local brokerage houses tend to derive strength
from 'an intimate knowledge of their local market coupled with very close
links at a senior level with the companies they track'.
While London-based houses have often emerged as winners in their coverage of
the European markets, Euromoney concludes that these preferences are
changing, particularly in markets such as Spain (where Madrid-based brokers
F&amp;G lead the field) and Germany (where Deutsche Bank is the clear leader).
The majority of investors prefer to receive individual company research,
rather than comparisons within a sector.
'The majority of institutional investors maintain an essentially bottom-up
approach,' says the survey, with individual company research followed by
demand for sector, individual country, and pan-European research.
Nearly three-quarters - 72.4 per cent - of respondents said they are
prepared to finance their own research, either to supplement or to replace
broker research. The larger the investor, the more likely it is to undertake
its own research: 82.6 per cent of respondents who manage Dollars 2bn or
more said they pursue their own company research.
The main reason for financing in-house research is investors' concern over
conflicts of interest at the leading brokers and investment banks.
Partly as a result of these concerns, over a third - 35.4 per cent - of
investors said they are using independent equity research to supplement
information supplied by the banks and brokers. However, they said the main
reason for turning to independent equity research outfits is quality.
Investors appear to be monitoring the research of fewer analysts now than in
the past, with over 43 per cent of respondents monitoring just three
analysts. Over half the investors said they are using fewer brokers than
before, particularly within the more mature markets.
With so many houses covering the UK and other Continental European markets
'a great deal of research which is expensively produced by the leading banks
and brokers goes to waste'.
Institutions which invest in the European bond markets said they looked
chiefly for accuracy in the research provided by the economic analysts,
followed by explanation, future risk assessment, consistency and an ability
to put the research within a global context.
Goldman Sachs emerged as the clear leader among the European economic
analysts, followed by USB Phillips &amp; Drew, Deutsche Bank, J. P. Morgan,
Enskilda Securities, S. G. Warburg, Morgan Stanley, BZW, Nomura and Midland
Montagu.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Sakura Bank to cut staff by
10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAKURA Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, plans to reduce its staff
by more than 10 per cent over the next three years as part of a streamlining
programme to boost long-term profitability.
The bank will also close or consolidate about 50 of its 620 branches, cut
advertising costs by 20 per cent and trim directors' salaries by 10 per cent
under the three-year programme, which was applauded by the Ministry of
Finance.
Japanese banks are generally attempting to streamline after excesses of the
late 1980s, but the task has been more difficult for Sakura, formerly Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank, which was formed in 1990 after a merger between Mitsui Bank
and Taiyo Kobe Bank.
Sakura said that it would not resort to sackings to cut the number of
employees from 23,000 to 20,000, but would sharply reduce the annual
graduate intake in the spring and would not replace staff who leave.
The ministry has urged the banking industry to increase profitability to
cope with the rising total of non-performing loans arising from the late
1980s.
The ministry is expected to announce shortly a new figure of around
Y12,000bn (Dollars 98bn) for the industry's non-performing loans, up from
the Y8,000bn at the end of March.
Japanese banks are in the final stages of drafting a proposal to establish a
company to purchase non-performing loans and land collateral from afflicted
banks in an attempt to reduce the bad debt burden and stimulate the property
market.
The banks, conscious of widespread opposition to the use of public funds to
support the new company, say they are not seeking special tax concessions
for the write-off of these loans, although they have negotiated with the
finance ministry about such concessions.
Hokuriku Bank, a leading regional institution, also announced a streamlining
plan yesterday which includes a 10 per cent cut in its workforce of 4,500 by
fiscal 1995 and a sharp reduction in new spending on computer systems.
The bank, like most others, has been entangled in the collapse of various
speculators, including Nanatomi, the stock and property group, which
collapsed early last year owing about Y300bn.

BANK of New Zealand (BNZ), a leading New Zealand private sector bank which
is subject to a takeover bid from National Australia Bank (NAB), yesterday
announced a 7 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 77.8m (USDollars
45.54m) for the six months to September 30 from NZDollars 72.73m a year
earlier.
The announcement came after a successful campaign by dissident BNZ
shareholders forced the New Zealand bank to hold an extraordinary general
meeting to consider the bid next Friday.
However, it is expected that the sale, which needs 90 per cent acceptance,
will be finalised early next month.
Mr Syd Pasley, BNZ chairman, said the result was consistent with the
information available to independent directors when they recommended
acceptance of the NAB offer.
Net operating profits before provisions and tax rose to NZDollars 149.5m
from NZDollars 144.69m, broadly in line with the performance over the
previous two six-monthly periods.
Operating expenses were NZDollars 294m, down 7 per cent on the second half
of last year. Mr Pasley said spending had been deferred because of
management time being diverted to cope with the proposed sale to the NAB.
Bad debt provisions amounted to NZDollars 32.5m, compared with NZDollars
40.01m, while total assets stood at NZDollars 20.42m against NZDollars
19.81m.
Recoveries from BNZ's Adbro portfolio - the so-called 'bad debt bank'
portfolio set up to handle the bank's bad and underperforming loans from
1986 to 1987 - were NZDollars 456m, down from the NZDollars 1.1bn that had
been expected. The dividend was passed again.
Mr Pasley said directors expected net operating profits after tax and
provisions of between NZDollars 135m and NZDollars 160m for the year to
March. Profits after tax and provisions for 1993-94 are pro-jected to be
between NZDollars 145m and NZDollars 190m.

BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's fourth-largest banking group, has raised
HKDollars 1.9bn (Dollars 245m) from a placement of new shares. The placement
was made on Tuesday night, following the Hong Kong stock market's 155-point
rebound.
The issue had been expected for some time, despite a company statement last
Friday claiming Bank of East Asia had 'no immediate plans to arrange any
placement'.
SBCI Finance Asia and Peregrine Capital underwrote the issue of 52.6m shares
at HKDollars 37.50, a 4 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHANGHAI has suffered another blow to its plans to develop a large and
respected capital market as the first rights issue to be launched on China's
fledgling stock markets looks set to collapse in disarray.
Shanghai Vacuum, which in February became the first company to offer shares
to foreigners since 1949, was attempting to raise Yn600m (Dollars 105m)
through a deeply-discounted share offer; but the subsequent crash in the
Shanghai stock market has made subscription an impossibility.
The rights issue had been controversial from the start. The new shares were
to be issued at the same price to both local and foreign investors because
their A and B shares rank pari passu.
At the time of the announcement, the offer price of Yn800 represented a 30
per cent discount to the A share price and a 120 per cent premium to the B
share price. Foreign shareholders were therefore excluded from the issue,
although the cash call remained an attractive source of low cost financing.
However, Shanghai's A shares have plunged, from a combination of the wholly
unrealistic share prices previously achieved and concerns over the impact of
several large scale flotations.
The Shanghai Vacuum share price reached a peak of Yn2,510, at the time the
rights issue proposals were first discussed, in May. It closed yesterday at
Yn500, a discount to the rights offer which will close on Friday.
Theoretically, the local portion of the issue was underwritten by Shanghai
Shenyin Securities and the issue could still proceed, with that brokerage
taking its full commitment. However, brokers expect the entire rights issue
to be cancelled.
This fiasco adds pressure for the authorities to streamline the trading and
settlement procedures at the exchange, and to develop a comprehensive
regulatory framework. At present, many foreign fund managers are barred from
purchasing Shanghai shares.

DESPITE a 32 per cent increase in provisions for bad debts, First National
Bank, South Africa's third-largest bank, increased earnings per share by
15.5 per cent in the year to September.
Net profits advanced by 23.5 per cent to R1.95bn (Dollars 661m) from
R1.58bn. Other operating income - mostly fee-based business - rose 16.8 per
cent to R1.3bn from R1.1bn, while other operating expen-diture rose by 13
per cent to R2.15bn from R1.9bn.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said a 32 per cent increase in bad debt
provisions to R347m from R263m was a function of the business climate
worsening throughout the year, contrary to earlier expectations of an upturn
in the second half, as well as the country's very severe drought. He said
the provisions were 'prudently conservative'. Bad debts were 0.79 per cent
of total advances.
He said FNB was pleased with the 14.2 per cent increase in total advances to
R33.2bn from R29.1bn, given that the rise came against a background of an
economy that shrank by about 1.5 per cent in the year to September. A large
portion of the increase came in the home loan field, where advances grew by
40 per cent over the year.
Mr Swart said FNB hoped to conclude the acquisition of Henry Ansbacher, the
UK merchant bank, within a few weeks. He said buying an existing business
with premises, people and profits was preferable to starting from scratch.
Earnings per share rose by 15.5 per cent to 611 cents from 529.3 cents.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Varity to launch public share
offer
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR confidence in Varity Corp, which came close to collapse in its
previous incarnation as Massey-Ferguson, has improved sufficiently for the
automotive, farm and industrial equipment maker to launch its first public
share offering in more than a decade.
Varity and its automotive parts subsidiary, Kelsey-Hayes, unveiled plans
yesterday to raise about Dollars 350m in equity and debt. The proceeds will
be used mainly to redeem high-cost borrowings and to finance expansion of
Kelsey-Hayes' fast-growing anti-lock braking systems business.
The company said the new funds could cut interest payments by as much as
Dollars 40m next year and reduce the debt-to-capital ratio from 56.2 per
cent to 38.6 per cent.
Varity, now based in Buffalo, New York, is a very different company to the
Canadian maker of tractors and diesel engines which was pushed to the brink
by the collapse in the farm machinery market in the early 1980s.
Thanks to the acquisition of Kelsey-Hayes three years ago, automotive
components contribute more than 40 per cent of sales and almost two-thirds
of earnings. Kelsey-Hayes has a commanding share of the market for two-wheel
anti-lock braking systems.
The parent company hopes to raise about Dollars 90m in equity by issuing
4.5m common shares, of which 3.6m will be in the US and Canada. The issue is
expected to be priced in early December. Varity's share price lost 63 cents
to Dollars 20.38 on the New York stock exchange before the close yesterday.
It also plans to spin off 50.2 per cent of Hayes Wheels International, one
of the world's largest manufacturers of car and truck wheels, in an initial
public offering of 8.2m shares. Varity said the issue would be priced at
between Dollars 15 and Dollars 18 per share, raising a total of between
Dollars 123m and Dollars 147m. Hayes Wheels is also issuing Dollars 105m of
10-year senior debt.
Varity's overall financial performance remains lacklustre. The company
suffered a Dollars 44m loss in the six months to July 31 on revenues of
Dollars 1.5bn, and cautioned recently that it saw little prospect for a
near-term recovery in its farm equipment and diesel engine business.
However, the wheel division, which is being taken public, posted operating
profits of Dollars 21m on sales of just over Dollars 200m. Demand for
anti-lock braking systems is expected to shoot up over the next few years as
they become standard equipment in new vehicles.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Borden to take Dollars 642m
restructuring charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORDEN, the US food and packaging company, announced yesterday that it was
taking a Dollars 642m extraordinary charge, before tax, to fund a
wide-ranging overhaul of its operations. The company said that around 3,000
jobs - out of 42,000 - were likely to be lost at about 10 plants over the
next three to six months.
The restructuring is designed to 'completely change the way Borden presents,
sells and distributes its products, making us one unified company instead of
a group of decentralised organisations and brands,' according to Mr Anthony
D'Amato, chairman.
It comes only three years after the company unveiled a similarly extensive
restructuring programme, designed to shrink the dairy business and
streamline other operations.
The latest overhaul will affect both domestic and international operations
at the New York-based company, which claims to be the world's largest pasta
manufacturer and the biggest dairy group in the US. On the domestic front,
Borden said it plans to withdraw from some of its unprofitable snack
businesses in North America, and restructure its sales force. Closures and
'operational relocations' will help consolidate both the snack and domestic
dairy businesses.
Outside the US, Borden said it planned to modernise its ice cream and cheese
businesses in Japan; step up attempts to integrate the sweet snacks and
specialty breads business in Germany and central Europe; and to consolidate
some of the packaging and industrial products operations, also in Europe.
Borden's latest charge means that it is posting an after-tax loss of Dollars
376.8m for the third quarter of 1992. This compares with a Dollars 98.8m
profit in the same period of 1991. Sales during the quarter totalled Dollars
1.86bn, virtually unchanged year-on-year. For the first nine months of 1992,
Borden's net loss stands at Dollars 468m, compared with a profit of Dollars
251.8m last time. The nine-month figure is depressed by Dollars 229m of
charges for accounting changes, as well as the restructuring charge.
Even without the restructuring charge, Borden said that third quarter net
income would have fallen 26 per cent.
However, Mr D'Amato said that the company was now aiming for an average
annual earnings increase of 18 per cent. This, he suggested, would put
earnings per share at around Dollars 3.30 in 1996. In 1991, after the
restructuring charge, the figure was Dollars 2. Mr D'Amato also suggested
that 1992 earnings could stand at around Dollars 1.70 per share, with the
1993 figure rising to around Dollars 2.10.
On Wall Street, some analysts welcomed the move, but others were mindful of
the 1989 restructuring, questioning whether the latest move was guaranteed
to generate the projected earnings gains. The shares fell Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 27 yesterday.

months

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPKOR, South Africa's largest retail group, reported a 25 per cent rise in
net profits for the six months to the end of August in spite of difficult
trading conditions and having to digest a large acquisition.
Following the purchase of Tradegro, whose main asset was the Checkers
supermarket chain, in October 1991, turnover rose by 172 per cent to R3.72bn
(Dollars 1.3bn) compared with R1.37bn a year earlier. Operating profits rose
by only 12 per cent, to R96.6m from R86.5m.
Mr Christo Wiese, chairman, said this was because the group had bought, with
Checkers, a large amount of turnover which was not profitable.
Profits before extraordinary items rose by 25 per cent to R45m from R35.9m.
A R262m rights issue in February put more equity instruments into
circulation, with the result that earnings per share rose by only 16 per
cent to 27.7 cents from 23.9 cents.
The directors are increasing the dividend by 13 per cent to 8 cents per
share from 7.1 cents.
Comparisons with the earlier period are complicated by the Tradegro
acquisition and other restructuring in the group.
Mr Wiese described trading conditions as the toughest he had seen in 27
years of business, reflected in the fact that profits at Pep, the group's
main clothing, footwear and household goods arm were virtually flat.

CHEVRON, one of the biggest US oil and gas groups, reported a 21 per cent
rise in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 378m, or Dollars 1.11 a share,
compared with Dollars 313m, or 90 cents, a year ago.
Stripping out special items and foreign exchange in both years, Chevron said
earnings doubled to Dollars 419m, or Dollars 1.23, from Dollars 210, or 60
cents. Revenues advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 11.1bn, from Dollars 10bn.
Chevron, like its competitors, said earnings were lifted by higher prices
for crude oil, US natural gas and US refined product. The results were also
helped by reorganisation and cost-cutting, which contributed to an 11 per
cent reduction in operating expenses from last year's third quarter.
However, the weak economy took a toll on profits from Chevron's chemicals
business and international refining and marketing. Domestic petroleum
operations were hurt by Hurricane Andrew in August and September.
Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive, said Chevron's fourth-quarter
results would include further cost reductions. The company also expected to
record an after-tax gain of about Dollars 375m from the stock-for-property
swap with Penzoil.
During the quarter, US exploration and production profits rose to Dollars
253m, including gains of Dollars 62m from special items, from only Dollars
29m last year, including one-time gains of Dollars 10m. Chevron's average
crude oil sales price rose 99 cents a barrel to Dollars 17.94, while average
natural gas prices climbed 40 per cent to Dollars 1.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Refining and marketing brought in earnings of Dollars 73m, including
one-time charges of Dollars 21m, compared with a loss of Dollars 10m a year
earlier, which included environmental provisions of Dollars 53m.
Chevron's chemicals business lost Dollars 7m in the quarter compared with
earnings of Dollars 44m last year. International refining and marketing lost
Dollars 4m in the quarter, compared with profits of Dollars 136m, which
included a favourable tax adjustment of Dollars 62m.

loss for quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, announced a
third-quarter loss of Dollars 15m after taking a Dollars 167m after-tax
charge to strengthen the wings of its controversial C-17 military transport,
which were damaged during stress tests at the start of this month.
The company announced a drop in revenues and profits at its commercial
aircraft division and an increase in the debt burden of the aerospace side
of the business.
The loss for the period would have been even larger without a Dollars 37m
gain from the sale of TeleCheck Services, a cheque acceptance service.
The Dollars 15m loss worked through at 39 cents a share, and compared with
profits of Dollars 77m, or Dollars 2.02, a year ago. Revenues dropped from
Dollars 4.45bn to Dollars 3.96bn.
The C-17, which McDonnell Douglas is developing for the US military, has
been dogged by delays and cost over-runs. The company said the quarter's
charge reflected the estimated cost of strengthening the wing, and the
growth of other costs in test, assembly and procurement. The charge also
provided increased reserves for remaining work on the programme.
Excluding the C-17, operating earnings in the company's military aerospace
business totalled Dollars 122m, up from Dollars 99m, thanks to increased
earnings from the F/A-18 Hornet, the AH-64 Apache and AV-8B Harrier
programmes.
The missiles and space business had Dollars 78m in operating earnings for
the quarter, compared with Dollars 18m a year ago.
But the commercial aircraft side saw earnings dip from Dollars 92m to
Dollars 52m, which the company said was due mainly to higher R and D
spending. It delivered 20 MD-80 twin jets during the quarter, against 40 a
year ago, and eight MD-11 trijets, up from six.

turned in third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 189m, or 58 cents a share,

Excluding one-time charges in both years, Kodak said underlying net earnings

cents. Sales in the quarter were up 5 per cent to Dollars 5.18bn from
Dollars 4.93bn.
Kodak warned this month that it would take a Dollars 140m, or 43 cents,
charge in the third quarter, when analysts expected a moderate charge of
Dollars 45m, or 14 cents.

<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday accused Campbell Soup, the
US food group, of misleading shareholders in pursuit of its ADollars 8.80
(USDollars 6.28) a share hostile takeover bid.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, released a letter to Mr David Johnson,
Campbell's chief executive, challenging Campbell's claims that it had
provided advanced technology to the Australian company since taking a 32.9
per cent shareholding in 1985.
Campbell is seeking a further 17.2 per cent shareholding, which would give
it control of Arnotts, at a cost of ADollars 209m. The bid, which is subject
to regulatory approval, values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn.
'Since Campbell Soup became a substantial shareholder in Arnotts, Campbell
has given us no technology or other benefits of material assistance to
Arnotts in its development either in Australia or internationally,' Mr Purdy
said.
Mr Purdy also dismissed Campbell's claims that Arnotts requires its
assistance to expand into Asia. He said Arnotts had appointed
representatives in three Asian countries, and was 'well advanced' in three
others.
'We could undertake our Asian strategy with a range of partners. We are
certainly not dependent upon Campbell Soup for our Asian strategy,' he said.
Campbell, which yesterday released its official takeover document, said it
intended to use Arnotts to penetrate Asian markets as part of its plans to
build a global biscuit business.
The group said it would assist the Australian company with technology,
marketing expertise and infra-structure.
The focus of the takeover battle shifts to a Sydney hotel today when Arnotts
holds its annual meeting.

Du Pont boost
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, said sharply higher polymers income
and its cost-cutting and productivity improvement plan contributed to an 18
per cent rise in underlying earnings in the third quarter.
The underlying profits rise was, however, based on stripping out
non-recurring extraordinary items, such as a net gain of Dollars 103m in the
third quarter of 1991.
Du Pont's net income level for the third quarter was Dollars 475m, or 70
cents per share, down from Dollars 504m, or 75 cents, in the same period of
last year.
Revenues in the quarter were Dollars 9.7bn, a 9 per cent rise year-on-year
after adjusting for a new coal venture. Combined sales for chemicals,
fibres, polymers and diversified businesses were 6 per cent better
year-on-year.
International sales were 7 per cent improved thanks partly to the weakness
of the US dollar. US sales were 3 per cent improved.
Du Pont is engaged in a reorganisation plan aimed at expanding European and
Asian business, disposing of non-core assets and curring US costs.
Part of its programme includes the recently-approved plan to swap Du Pont's
acrylics business for the European nylon interests of Imperial Chemical
Industries (ICI) of the UK.
Du Pont has also opened a new European composites development centre in Bad
Homburg, Germany. The idea is to stimulate more European business in the
advanced materials sector.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said the chemicals and polymers divisions
enjoyed a significant increase in sales volume despite generally weak
economic conditions in the company's main markets.
Du Pont's chemicals division earnings were up by 25 per cent to Dollars 86m,
its fibres business increased after-tax operating income by 11 per cent to
Dollars 166m and the polymers division achieved an impressive 81 per cent
leap in earnings, to Dollars 121m.
In the first nine months, Du Pont recorded net profits of Dollars 1.4bn,
down from Dollars 1.64bn year-on-year. Sales slipped to Dollars 28.7bn from
Dollars 28.9bn.
On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars
48 7/8.

USF&amp;G Corporation, the troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 5m in the third quarter of 1992, compared with
a net loss of Dollars 25m a year ago.
The small profit came despite an Dollars 80m bill for Hurricane Andrew, the
storm system which left a trail of destruction across southern Florida in
late-August.
The insurer also took a one-time restructuring charge of Dollars 51m as it
implemented changes to the field marketing and underwriting operations.
These moves, it said, should produce annual cost-savings of about Dollars
55m.
USF&amp;G said that excluding both the restructuring charge and realised gains
on investments, but including the hurricane losses, it would have produced a
loss of Dollars 80m.
This would have compared with a loss of Dollars 30m in the same period of
1991.
On the same basis, USF&amp;G would have posted a nine-month loss of Dollars 75m,
compared with losses of Dollars 115m in the first three quarters of 1991.
USF&amp;G shares were Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 12 1/4 when Wall Street
closed.

IMASCO, the tobacco, financial services and retailing group controlled by

Tobacco earnings were up 10 per cent in the quarter and 9 per cent in the

fears

GENERAL Motors, which is expected today to report third-quarter losses of up
to Dollars 850m, saw its stock slip for the second day running yesterday as
investors brushed off better results from two non-automotive subsidiaries
and focused on fears of a dividend cut.
The shares fell Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 31 3/8 , partly reversing the
rises which began last week when rumours first circulated that Mr Robert
Stempel, the chairman, would be forced to quit. Mr Stempel resigned on
Monday.
The GM board is expected to name Mr John Smale, leader of the non-executive
directors, as chairman on Monday when it holds its regular monthly meeting.
Analysts are speculating it might discuss cutting GM's dividend, which
stands at Dollars 1.60 a share, to preserve cash.
GM's three non-automotive subsidiaries yesterday reported third-quarter
figures. GM Hughes Electronics, the aerospace group, saw earnings rise to
Dollars 155.2m, or 41 cents a share, from Dollars 38.2m, or 10 cents, last
year on revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, up from Dollars 2.75bn.
Factors cited for improved earnings included cost controls, acquisition of a
missiles business from General Dynamics, a one-time gain from the
establishment of a joint venture and the absence of a special charge in
1991.
EDS, the data systems business, reported net income of Dollars 167.3m, up
from Dollars 145.5m, on revenues which rose Dollars 336m to Dollars 2.06bn.
It said this was spurred by strong growth in its non-General Motors
business.
General Motors Acceptance Corporation, GM's financial services arm, reported
net income of Dollars 301m, down from Dollars 346m a year ago.
Amid signs GM is preparing further cost-cutting, Mr John Rock, general
manager of the Oldsmobile division, said he was working on a plan which
could involve the disappearance of the Oldsmobile name and its replacement
with a new marque for the division.
However, Mr John Rock has conceded his plan had yet to be approved by top
management.
Separately, General Electric, the diversified industrial group, denied press
speculation Mr Jack Welch, its chairman, had held talks with GM about
joining the company.

'up for sale'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group which has been selling off large
parts of its businesses, has put its jet fighter division on the auction
block, according to union officials. Wall Street analysts believe it could
fetch Dollars 1bn or more.
The company declined to comment, but such a move would represent a
substantial change of strategy by the group's management, which had
identified fighter aircraft as one of four core businesses it intended to
retain.
Potential buyers are rumoured to include Northrop, the Los Angeles-based
defence group, and Lockheed, the California-based aerospace group.
The jet fighter division makes the F-16, a key component of the US defence
system but a programme which is now relatively mature. President George Bush
recently gave the division a fillip by authorising the sale of 150 of the

The division is also one of three contractors developing the air force's

The Pump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
REEBOK International, the US sports shoe maker, has been granted a patent
from the US Patent Office for its basic The Pump inflatable shoe technology,
Reuter reports.
Reebok said the patent covered athletic shoes featuring an inflatable
chamber and an on-board inflation mechanism.
A company spokesman said that with the patent it could address unlawful
copying of the concept by other companies in the athletic footwear industry.
Reebok said that as part of a first step in the company's enforcement
programme it filed a patent infringement lawsuit against LA Gear in the
District Court in Massachusetts.
Earlier this month, Reebok International, the US sports shoe maker, posted
disappointing third-quarter earnings.

FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford of Europe plunges into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD's European automotive operations plunged into a loss of Dollars 479m in
the third quarter after struggling back into profit in the first half of
1992.
The return to loss is a severe setback for Ford of Europe, which suffered a
record loss last year and which has slipped from fourth to fifth place in
the west European new car market in the first nine months this year.
Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, said the 'uncertainty resulting from the
instability in European currency markets has led to lower sales in most of
Ford's European markets and will continue to affect the operating
environment for the near-term'.
Ford's European car sales have declined by about 6 per cent in the first
nine months this year, which has depressed its market share to an estimated
11.6 per cent from 12.1 per cent a year ago.
Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary, suffered a loss of just over Dollars
100m in the third quarter, while Ford of Britain's financial performance
deteriorated sharply in the third quarter in the face of continuing weak UK
new car sales and further heavy discounting.
Jaguar lost around Dollars 300m in the first nine months this year, although
its deficit in the third quarter was slightly lower than in the
corresponding period a year ago.
The loss of Dollars 479m on Ford's European automotive operations in the
third quarter compares with a profit of Dollars 108m in the first six months
this year and a loss of Dollars 560m in the same quarter a year ago.
Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a net
loss in the whole of last year of Dollars 1.079bn from a net profit of
Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
In the first nine months this year, Ford's European automotive operations
lost Dollars 371m, against a loss of Dollars 765m in the corresponding
period a year ago.
Ford of Europe is being forced to cut production at most of its assembly
plants in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Spain, to reduce excessive stocks.

<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-Busch, the largest brewer in the US, yesterday unveiled an increase
in third-quarter profits, while sales to the wholesalers for the period rose
to a record 23.23m barrels from 23.12m barrels sold during the same year-ago
period, Reuter reports from St Louis.
The group reported third-quarter earnings of Dollars 318.0m, or Dollars 1.12
a share, up from Dollars 293m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, in 1991. Gross sales
rose to Dollars 3.54bn from Dollars 3.39bn.
The company attributed the improved results primarily to the higher
profitability of its beer, beer-related and entertainment segments and to
lower financing costs.
Anheuser-Busch said its volume gain of 1.3 per cent for the first nine
months favourably contrasted with a three-tenths of 1 per cent gain for the
brewing industry.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Strong City support belies Blenheim's
dilemma - Angus Foster examines deepseated fears that the show organiser has
grown too fast too quickly as new competitors hungrily eye its territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELIEVERS in the house of Blenheim beware. The rapidly growing organiser of
exhibitions, which has seen its market capitalisation increase from Pounds
65m towards Pounds 500m in the last two years, is begining to look
overvalued.
The company's support in the City remains robust. After UK operations
suffered from slack controls in the late 1980s, management is again widely
seen as effective. Its strategy of exploiting the previously unsophisticated
exhibition industry is credible. And it is financially sound, with net
borrowings below Pounds 40m and interest cover of 7 times.
But questions are being raised. Rapid growth, largely led by acquisitions in
France and the US, will be increasingly difficult to maintain. Most of the
big shows have already been bought by Blenheim and competitors like EMAP and
Reed International, and purchase prices in the US are now high. Plans to use
exhibition databases to move into trade magazines have yet to establish a
track record.
Yesterday's 5 per cent fall in the share price, down 29p to 504p, reflects
new caution following the company's announcement Tuesday that pre-tax
profits are up 31.8 per cent to Pounds 37.3m in the 12 months to August 31.
Some analysts say Blenheim's shares, which are trading respectively on 15
times and 13 times forecast earnings of Pounds 46m and Pounds 54m for 1993
and 1994, are set at least to consolidate as growth slows and the company
matures.
'My feeling is the City has not come to terms with Blenheim's medium term
prospects, and has yet to adjust accordingly,' according to one fund manager
with shares in the company.
Blenheim's success has been based on two pillars.
In the early 1980s in realised that exhibitions, mainly run by individual
entrepreneurs and trade associations, would be extremely profitable - with
margins of up to 50 per cent - if centrally managed by professionals.
After seizing the chance, it paid more than Pounds 300m in cash and shares
buying exhibitions in the US and Europe.
Although some purchases failed, and others in retrospect were too expensive,
Blenheim did acquire events like the building supply exhibition in Batimat,
France and computer shows in the US.
Blenheim needed its second pillar, a premium stock market rating, to acquire
overseas shows, often at 10-15 times earnings, without dilution.
This rating was earned by performance, but also by effective financial
public relations.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, is a former City fund manager adept at dealing
with institutions.
Blenheim is confident of continued above average growth from exhibitions.
The costs of hiring and staffing a stand at an exhibition are often three or
more times cheaper than advertising. According to Mr Phil Soar, group chief
executive, exhibitors only meet potential buyers.
'We provide an audience with no wastage,' Mr Soar said.
Blenheim is also improving yields. Exhibition space has traditionally been
sold at flat rates per square metre. But at some UK and German exhibitions,
Blenheim sells according to a stand's location and flow of visitors. This
boost margins.
At the same time, the company has concentrated on costs, reducing headcount
and rationalising offices.
The success rate for new exhibitions, which stood at about 20 per cent
between 1985-1990, has more than tripled as stricter launch criteria was
introduced.
In the period just ended, pre-tax margins increased 1 percentage point to
24.3 per cent, and profit per employee increased 38 per cent in the last two
years.
This was despite recession, which particularly affected UK exhibitions.
There are now fears of a downturn in France, which contributed 53 per cent
to profits last year. Blenheim hopes its market leadership, and companies'
preference to cut advertising ahead of exhibition costs, will provide
protection.
Exhibition databases are being used to provide new services and generate new
profit streams mainly from trade publishing, but also from seminars and
corporate training.
The aim, according to Mr Buch, is to reinforce exhibitions and maintain
regular contact with exhibitors.
In the next five years, the proportion of profits from exhibitions could
fall 10 per cent from 80 per cent as publishing profits grow.
The company now publishes 15 magazines with a similar number planned for
launch. Although circulation is small, some are extremely profitable.
Bobbin, an 8,500 copy per month US textile publication, makes Dollars 14
profit a copy - Dollars 1.4m a year.
Acquisitions will continue, but at a slower rate. The company is negotiating
to take a 50 per cent stake in running the City of Stockholm's exhibitions.
It is also looking at small acquisitions in Germany, Italy and Spain.
Despite Blenheim's confidence about the future, and its record of improved
margins, its strategy is not watertight.
Because of its size, it is increasingly vulnerable to competition.
Soon after paying Pounds 23.9m for the leading New York jewellery exhibition
last year, Blenheim discovered the main US jewellery magazine was launching
a rival show in Las Vegas. Mr Soar said the shows target different
exhibitors. But given the low launch costs for exhibitions, and potential
profits, other competitors are sure to follow.
Blenheim successfully acquired large shows like Batimat and computer
exhibitions in the US, partly because management was retained. After several
years of low growth at the bi-annual Batimat, pre-contracted revenues for
1993 have jumped 72 per cent to Pounds 22.4m as more space became available.
But with smaller exhibitions, which the company is being forced to look for,
the record is mixed. Mr Buch agrees Blenheim overpaid for several UK shows.
It has closed down its Belgian operations, which could not generate enough
volume, and Switzerland is believed to be performing poorly.
Blenheim has also suffered from lack of middle management continuity. Of
Blenheim's 25 managing directors in 1992, 11 have left. Mr Buch said this is
because the company grew so quickly and because training was overlooked
until recently. A lack of management resources, due to the company's rapid
growth, has left Blenheim virtually unrepresented in the Far East, source of
much of Reed Exhibitions' recent growth.
Lastly, the move into trade publishing is risky, despite Mr Soar's
background in the industry. Developing magazines, as the company itself
points out, takes more than five years. In that period, a once dominant
exhibition can be undermined by competitors. If an exhibition folds, the
losses are probably less than Pounds 50,000. If a magazine goes with it, the
accumulated losses could be several times that figure.
According to one of Blenheim's competitors with magazine and exhibition
interests, launching magazines to support events is a high cost and long
term venture. 'I'm not convinced they can do that without sacrificing their
high growth reputation, so far deserved, in the City,' he said.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Wellcome 25% increase in line with expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharma- ceuticals group, yesterday reported full-year
pre-tax profits in line with expectations, up 25 per cent from Pounds 402.9m
to Pounds 505m.
Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the results were excellent,
demonstrating good growth in sales, earnings per share and trading margins.
The progress was thanks to the twin strategy of being more focused and
market-orientated, he said.
Earnings per share increased 23 per cent to 36p.
Turnover was up 16.7 per cent to Pounds 1.7bn for continuing operations.
Excluding currency effects, underlying growth was up 18 per cent. Price
increases accounted for only 3 per cent of growth. Mr John Precious, finance
director, said given pressure on world pharmaceuticals prices, volume growth
was the key to performance.
Trading margins increased 3.1 percentage points to 27.7 per cent. For the
second six months, however, they were almost 29 per cent, near the group's
target of 30 per cent, said Mr Robb. Margins increased 9 per cent in the
past five years.
Disposals of low-margin businesses had been completed, said Mr Robb. Future
margin improvement would come from a better sales mix rather than further
cost control. However, some rationalisation at Wellcome's manufacturing
operations in the UK and Belgium would affect about 300 jobs.
Spending on research and development increased 10.9 per cent to Pounds 255m,
equivalent to about 14.4 per cent of sales. The group had a target of 15 per
cent, but Mr Robb said the R&amp;D directors believed this year's figure was
sufficient to maintain the required momentum.
Capital spending was Pounds 146m, Pounds 39m less than last year. Next year
it would be more than Pounds 190m.
Sales of Zovirax, Wellcome's best-selling herpes drug, were up 24 per cent
to Pounds 586m. Sales for Retrovir, the HIV treatment also known as AZT,
increased 22 per cent to Pounds 213m. Revenues from the over-the-counter
business increased 17 per cent to Pounds 237m.
The group earned Pounds 17m net interest during the year, said Mr Precious.
The final proposed dividend was 9p up from 7p. Wellcome's share price fell
15p to 985p.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Ford's Dollars 159m loss worse than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR of the US yesterday reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 159m
(Pounds 97.5m). It blamed weak markets in North America and overseas,
compounded by turmoil in European currency markets.
The losses were worse than Wall Street expected - in spite of being partly
offset by a surprisingly strong performance at Ford's financial services
business - and the shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 38 1/8 .
The results compare with a Dollars 202m profit earlier this month by
Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers, and a
loss of up to Dollars 850m expected to be announced today by General Motors.
Ford's figures, equivalent to losses of 43 cents a share, compared with
losses of Dollars 574m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, in last year's third
quarter when the US recession was particularly severe. Sales and revenues
rose from Dollars 21.1bn to Dollars 23.3bn.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman, said the remainder of 1992 and 1993 would be
'challenging'. The US economy, although improving, continued to grow slowly
while Europe was weakening. He warned that losses could extend into the
fourth quarter, if recovery in the US failed to accelerate.
Ford's motor operations lost Dollars 464m in the quarter, compared with
Dollars 751m a year ago. The US accounted for Dollars 153m of red ink, down
from Dollars 197m, while overseas operations lost Dollars 311m, down from
Dollars 554m.
However, the financial services subsidiary made Dollars 305m in the quarter,
a Dollars 128m improvement on last year, thanks to reduced credit losses and
improved interest margins.
In spite of the quarter's losses, Ford is considered the healthiest US motor
group, with the most efficient North American plants and a product range
gaining market share over the past year. This trend could be helped by the
turmoil at GM, whose chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, resigned on Monday.
Mr Poling said the company's combined car and truck market share in the US
had risen to 24.5 per cent this year, compared with 23 per cent in 1991.
He attributed the third-quarter loss to slow sales, and seasonal inventory
adjustments.
Currency uncertainty had led to lower sales in most of Ford's European
markets, he added.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Financial reporting standard issued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPANIES will be required radically to re-state their profit and loss
accounts and provide more information under a financial reporting standard
issued yesterday.
FRS 3, produced by the Accounting Standards Board, the UK standard-setter,
will virtually abolish extraordinary items and introduce several financial
tables into accounts. It follows the consultation draft, Fred 1. Mr David
Tweedie, chairman, said: 'FRS 3 is a landmark standard. It represents a
radical change in the profit and loss account and moves the emphasis away
from simple headline numbers.'
The standard becomes compulsory for companies for financial year-ends on or
after June 22 next year, but the ASB is encouraging earlier adoption.
It supersedes SSAP 6, the existing standard.
The biggest change is an attempt to divert readers' attention from earnings
per share and to place all business transactions above the line.
It will make the earnings figure more variable and require users of accounts
to carry out their own calculations to reach a figure they find useful.
The Institute for Investment Management and Research said yesterday it had
set up a sub-committee to derive a 'maintainable' earnings figure using FRS
3. It expects to have produced a formula within six months.
FRS 3 demands that companies split out results for acquisitions, and
separate continuing from discontinued businesses. Figures for
reorganisation, and sales of businesses and assets must be separately
disclosed.
It introduces a fourth primary financial statement - to accompany the profit
and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement - which will be
called the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Among other elements are:
impact of foreign currency translations
a note of historical cost profits and losses, reconciling pre-tax profits
with the effect of revaluation and depreciation of property which has been
sold.
a note reconciling movements in shareholders' funds
profit or loss on assets sold be shown as the difference between net sale
proceeds and the net carrying amount shown in the balance sheet.

FT  29 OCT 92 / O&amp;Y unveils revised debt shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York plans to divide its assets between four separate companies
under a revised debt-restructuring proposal unveiled in Toronto yesterday by
the ailing property developer.
The plan, includes selling two O&amp;Y buildings in Toronto and Calgary. It also
calls for bank lenders to extend a CDollars 50m (Pounds 24m) loan to help
the developer attract tenants to its flagship buildings in Toronto's
business district.
Creditors reacted cautiously to the plan, with some saying that the company
has yet to brief them on its details. But the representative of one group of
secured creditors said his group would probably be in a better position if
it seized the building pledged as collateral for the bonds.
The odds of O&amp;Y obtaining the unanimous approval of its creditors have been
lengthened however, by expanding the number of creditor groups from 27 to
34. Under an Ontario court order, O&amp;Y must bring its proposals to a vote by
the end of November. The court protection granted last May for O&amp;Y's
Canadian operations expires on December 30.
Under the plan, the Reichmanns would lose control of O&amp;Y's Canadian
properties, but would retain a 51 per cent interest in a new company holding
O&amp;Y's US interests. Unsecured and undersecured creditors holding about
CDollars 4bn in debt could end up owning 90 per cent of Olympia &amp; York
Developments, the present parent company, and 49 per cent of the new US
holding company, to be called OYRC Holdings. The Reichmanns' interests would
be consolidated in another new company to be known as Reichmann Holdings.
The group of international banks holding some CDollars 3bn in loans secured
by O&amp;Y's shares in Abitibi-Price, Gulf Canada and Trizec would accept
debt-service payments based on available cash flow.
Four Canadian bank lenders would convert CDollars 131m in loans to O&amp;Y
Developments into equity in the flagship Toronto buildings. Project lenders
to these properties would extend the maturities of their loans by five years
and agree to lower interest rates. But the banks would guarantee a minimum
interest rate of 5 per cent. The proposals, which cover two-thirds of O&amp;Y's
CDollars 13.5bn debt, are separate from Reichmanns' efforts to regain
control of Canary Wharf in London.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Low margins, high returns: How the group made more money
from level sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most striking aspect of Marks and Spencer's interim results yesterday
was its ability to raise profits on a static sales base.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive of Marks and Spencer,
gave four reasons:
Lower operating costs largely as a result of last year's redundancy
programme.
Substantial investments in information and operational systems resulting in
higher staff productivity.
Improved information systems giving the company better stock control,
thereby reducing the number of goods to be sold cheaper in end-of-season
sales. Emphasis on everyday low prices, generating consistent sales and
helping to ensure that a 'dramatically higher' proportion of goods was sold
at full price.
These greater operating efficiencies have enabled M and S to hold, and in
some cases reduce, the prices of its autumn clothing range without
sacrificing net profit.
'We are not conducting a once-and-for-all promotion. We intend to carry on
with it. We can run the business on this new lower gross margin and continue
to make a satisfactory profit,' Sir Richard said.
However, although the company's 18 per cent share of the clothing market
allows it to benefit from enormous economies of scale, it is not able to
repeat the trick to the same extent in foods where it only has a 3.5 per
cent market share and is coming under increasing pressure from highly
aggressive competitors.
'We cannot compete with Sainsbury's and Tesco. We are nothing more than a
large niche food retailer. Our foods business continues to be profitable and
more than pays its way. But where we are dominant in prepared and
high-quality fresh foods we are still doing very well,' Sir Richard said.
M and S's results provoked a mixed response in the City. Ms Kimlan Cook, at
County NatWest, said the company's share price had had a strong run over the
past year and at a 45 per cent premium to the market was 'starting to look
rather full'. 'Even quality has its price,' she said.
However, Mr Quintin Price, retailing analyst at stockbrokers James Capel,
said: 'I am amazed that the market has marked the shares down so far. In an
incredibly hostile environment M and S has raised earnings per share by more
than 20 per cent. It is a back-handed compliment that people expected more.'

FT  29 OCT 92 / Marks and Spencer profits rise 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer, the clothing and food retailer, yesterday demonstrated
its continued dominance of the UK high street by posting a 20 per cent
improvement in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 257.1m.
The rise was flattered by the absence of any exceptional charges, which
depressed the previous year's figure by Pounds 16.9m. But even excluding
this factor, profits were still 11 per cent up as the company squeezed
higher net profits from near-static sales.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are now
running the business more efficiently than we have for many years and
therefore need a lower gross margin, passing the benefits of that on to the
customer in terms of better-value goods.'
However, the City was worried by the company's flat UK sales and the
cautious stance on current trading. It was also disappointed with the 5 per
cent rise in the interim dividend to 2.2p when earnings per share rose 22
per cent to 6.2p. The shares fell 15.5p to 327 1/2 p.
Sir Richard described the dividend payment as an 'amber light' on current
trading. 'I do not think that our dividend is anything other than prudent.
The economy does not give me a lot of hope. There is still a long hard haul
ahead,' he said.
In the half year to September 26, group turnover fell 0.3 per cent to Pounds
2.64bn. Clothing sales in the UK rose 1 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn while food
sales were only 0.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.02bn.
Operating profits, however, were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 253.3m as the
company widened its net profit margin from 8.9 per cent to 9.6 per cent.
Interest income, up from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 10.1m, also boosted the
profits gain. The contribution from financial services rose from Pounds 9.5m
to Pounds 12.6m.
The group's international operations recorded a mixed trading performance.
In spite of heavy opening costs, the continental European stores increased
profits from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 6.6m on sales up 35 per cent at Pounds
97m. Sir Richard warned that sales were beginning to soften.
The company's trauma in Canada continued although losses were reduced from
Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 700,000. Kings Supermarkets and Brooks Brothers in the
US lifted profits by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 3.3m. The company's four Hong
Kong stores improved their contribution from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 3.4m
but Brooks Brothers in Japan reported a weakening of sales.

PROMOTERS OF the cause of European integration seem to be in trouble
everywhere - even in tiny Liechtenstein.
Last night it was the turn of Prince Hans-Adam, head of state in this
principality wedged between Austria and Switzerland, to suffer a humiliating
climbdown over a European issue after an extraordinary confrontation with
his 25-member parliament.
Early this week the Liechtenstein government, which is responsible to the
parliament, made a decision of which the prince disapproved. The prince, who
has responsibility for foreign policy under the constitution, responded by
threatening to dissolve parliament yesterday.
Behind this tussle - the timing of a referendum on ratifying the treaty
forming the European Economic Area - lies the dilemma of an affluent tax
haven coming to terms with the trend to greater European integration.
The EEA, a treaty that would bind the seven countries of the European Free
Trade Association in an economic union with the European Community from
January, is seen by most Efta countries as a mere step towards full EC
membership. But most people in Liechtenstein regard it as at best a
necessary evil.
The principality's prosperity derives largely from its role in helping rich
people hide their fortunes from tax collectors. Liechtensteiners fear this
will be compromised by closer ties with their neighbours.
However, the principality has a customs and currency union with Switzerland,
and since Switzerland has taken steps towards joining the EEA and ultimately
the EC, Liechtenstein has felt obliged to follow.
Until August, the plan was to wait until the Swiss held their referendum on
ratifying the EEA - now scheduled for December 6. But Prince Hans-Adam then
proposed that the principality hold its referendum before the Swiss had
theirs.
He believed the principality needed to keep its options open. If the people
rejected the EEA, the government might apply for full EC membership. But if
the rejection came in late December, it might be too late to join the other
Efta countries applying for EC membership.
Out of step with his people, the prince finally agreed last night that the
Liechtenstein referendum will follow the Swiss one.

PROPOSALS by Denmark to reverse its rejection of the Maastricht treaty on
European union were greeted with caution yesterday amid signs that there may
be a lengthy wrangle among Community members on accommodation of Danish
demands.
Diplomats and officials in Brussels were encouraged that the Danish
compromise, which calls for supplements to the treaty, meets a central
request of the 11 EC member states: no renegotiation of Maastricht.
But it remains unclear whether the principal Danish demands for opt-outs on
a single European currency and a putative European defence force - agreed on
Tuesday night by seven of Denmark's eight main political parties - can be
met without amending the treaty.
Another fear is that Denmark's demands to opt out on defence could upset
negotiations on enlargement with Finland, Austria and Sweden. President
Mauno Koivisto of Finland noted pointedly yesterday in Brussels that
Helsinki would accept 'its obligations' conferred by EC membership under the
Maastricht treaty.
Brussels diplomats said the true test would come when Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's foreign minister, visited EC capitals over the
next fortnight. Although the substance of Danish demands is well-known, it
would 'all come down to the wording', said one EC ambassador who stressed
that reaching agreement among all 11 states this year would not be easy.
In Denmark there were strong hopes that the compromise, if acceptable to the
rest of the Community, would enable the government to take the issue to the
electorate in a second referendum next year - and win.
The rejection by Danish voters of the treaty in June triggered the EC crisis
over economic and political union.
Dansk Markedsanalyse, an opinion polling institute, said yesterday that
research undertaken on Monday, ahead of the latest cross-party proposals,
found that 29 per cent of those who voted No in June had changed their
minds.
By adding these to the June Yes vote, the institute claims that 64 per cent
would vote in favour if a vote were held now.
The requests for special arrangements will receive the official approval of
the Folketing's European market affairs committee tomorrow before being
despatched to the other EC member governments.
One option gaining favour is for the 12 unanimously to adopt a new EC
directive which would be legally binding but which would fall short of a
treaty-amending protocol.
Such a directive could be accompanied by a political declaration on
subsidiarity - decision-making at the lowest appropriate Community level -
and transparency. Both could be appended to Maastricht and approved,
possibly, at December's EC summit in Edinburgh.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Tension over the future of Hong Kong deepens: UK-China
documents show difficult negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENSION between Britain and China over the future of Hong Kong deepened
yesterday with the publication by both governments of previously secret
diplomatic exchanges on the development of democracy in the colony.
Britain took the unusual step of publishing messages which passed in 1990
between Chinese officials and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to back up
its denial that Britain had broken a secret agreement, as was alleged in an
angry outburst from Beijing last week.
China released the documents after hearing London would. Official news
agency Xinhua said they showed Mr Patten's proposals on elections to be held
in 1995 'run counter to the understanding reached by the Chinese and British
sides through diplomatic consultations'.
The documents concern arrangements for Hong Kong's political structure as
China neared completion of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997
constitution. They provide an insight into the difficult negotiations on
Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Hurd's attempts to win an increase in the number of directly elected
seats to the Legislative Council, the colony's parliament, were met with
frosty replies from Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister - couched in the
language of diplomacy.
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, said: 'What they make abundantly
plain is that there was no secret deal on the future political development
of Hong Kong between the British government and the Chinese government.'
Beijing has warned of turmoil in Hong Kong if Mr Patten pushes ahead with
his proposal that a committee, due to appoint 10 members of the Legislative
Council in 1995, should itself be popularly elected. Mr Patten proposes
broadening the voting base for other indirectly elected seats, but has not
sought more directly elected seats.
It was on the composition of the election committee that Lu Ping, the senior
Beijing official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, alleged a secret
understanding. He threatened to reverse the measures and said they
contravene the Basic Law.
In one message, Mr Hurd says: 'I agree in principle with the arrangements
for an electoral committee, which could be established in 1995.'
British officials said the committee's composition was a side issue, that
the Basic Law did not include understandings on the subject as Britain had
hoped, and that the question of 1995 electoral arrangements remained open
after the exchanges.
The focus was on directly elected seats. To a request from Mr Hurd on an
increase in these, Qian said 'the Chinese side cannot bring itself to agree
to the foreign secretary's proposal.'
Mr Hurd said if changes were not made, there would be resignations from the
executive and legislative councils.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 59 per cent fall in UAP's first half profits looks a dreadful
performance even by the dismal standards of its peers. But the real lesson
of yesterday's figures - and those from GAN and AGF earlier in the month -
is that the company's previous results were flattered by unsustainably high
asset values. UAP is now showing some signs of getting to grips with pricing
and concentrating its attention on profits rather than market share. Premium
increases, though, have not gone nearly far enough. The whole sector is
vulnerable to recession-related claims of the kind which have plagued the UK
domestic market if the French economy takes another downward twist next
year. The real problem, though, is unlocking some of the unrealised capital
gains which give UAP its apparent financial strength and which have
underpinned profits in the past. Two thirds of the total is tied up in land
and buildings.

FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer's interim figures show starkly why it has bitten the
bullet on pricing in its autumn marketing campaign. While earnings per share
are up a very creditable 22 per cent, sales are flat. True, the earnings
rise is gilded because last year's figure was depressed by exceptional
items, but underlying profits growth is being fuelled by cost control and
cash management. That process must have a finite limit, however much this
recession teaches companies to find hidden fat. Hence Marks' need to get
sales moving. In these deflationary times price is the chosen weapon, and
the company is consciously hazarding margins to bring in extra sales.
The strategy of consistent low pricing will strengthen Marks' position in
the longer term. But with other retailers running near-permanent sales, it
may be difficult to get the message across meanwhile. If that proves to be
the case, Marks may not reap the extra sales to compensate for reduced
margins. The risks of losing margin and market share are just as strong in
food as they are in clothing. Like-for-like sales are under pressure at the
supermarket giants, and while Marks insists that its value-added food is not
losing out, pressure can only build as the recession continues and more
superstores open.
Despite the woes of the economy, investors should not lose sight of Marks'
fundamentally strong position. The freehold empire largely untroubled by
rental pressures, a cast iron balance sheet and a solid franchise all
support the company. The shares may dip as investors fret about the near
term outlook; the question is what kind of a premium they are prepared to
pay for such a core holding.

FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies and their auditors have a habit of squeezing through fresh gaps in
the accounting maze once old ones have been fenced off. But there are good
reasons to believe that the new standard known as FRS 3 will put an end to
many of the sleights of hand which confused investors in the past.
In future, for example, the impact of property write downs and currency
translation - this last so damaging to Polly Peck shareholders - will have
to be shown in a separate statement to the profit and loss account rather
than being buried away in the notes. The effect on companies' depreciation
policies where assets are revalued will also have to be highlighted. And the
turnover and profits totals will be usefully split into continuing and
discontinued operations.
From the market's point of view, though, the biggest challenge will be
grappling for a reliable measure of earnings per share. Quite rightly, the
Accounting Standards Board has given up the long and unequal struggle to
separate exceptionals from extraordinaries and has opted to throw everything
above the line. But the result may be a good deal of confusion as analysts
and investors strive to establish what they believe is the underlying trend.
There will be no single formula, but then that reflects the real world. You
would hardly strip out disposal profits for the likes of Hanson, but you
probably would exclude them in the case of a group which sells businesses
only once in a blue moon. No doubt companies, as well as publishing the
erratic figure which will flow from FRS 3, will try to massage the market
towards a number of their own. But at least they - and independent
commentators - will be arguing on the basis of fuller information. There
should be much less discretion for an auditor's judgment.

FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome's full-year results demonstrate why the market should not get
carried away with the threat of tougher government action on drug pricing in
the US or elsewhere. A company which can generate annual volume sales growth
of 15 per cent surely has little to fear from a Democratic president. The
market was a bit uncharitable, then, to send Wellcome's shares lower. July's
share sale gave investors every chance to pore over the books, so the
results can hardly have come as a surprise. One can only assume that
institutions which bought stock at 800p in the summer succumbed to the
temptation to take a 25 per cent profit.
With operating margins now only fractionally below its 30 per cent target,
though, the best of the efficiency gains from Wellcome have now been seen.
Retrovir, its much-hyped HIV treatment, now looks unlikely to reach
blockbuster status. Hence Wellcome will have to squeeze every ounce of
potential from Zovirax, its anti-herpes drug, if the rate of growth is to be
maintained. The threat of competition from the likes of SmithKline Beecham -
and patents which expire in mid-decade - underline the urgency. That said,
the important US patent for Zovirax does not expire until 1997. And Wellcome
has drugs in development which may be a match for the competition.
Wellcome must also decide how to spend surplus cash accumulating at an
annual rate of Pounds 200m. A net cash balance of over Pounds 400m is
already something of an embarrassment for a growth stock. There are no plans
to expand the research and development programme, so one can only assume
Wellcome has its eye on possible acquisitions. The cash would already buy a
useful position in the over-the-counter drugs market, for example, even at
today's dizzy multiples.

FT  29 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Great expectations
and low profits for agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If advertising agencies were not already suffused with gloom, the latest
annual profitability survey* by Touche Ross will dispel any doubts that they
are facing a structural crisis every bit as profound as that being
experienced by other once-powerful UK industries.
The Touche Ross survey, published tomorrow shows that average profit margins
 -operating profit as a percentage of turnover - have fallen for the third
year (from 1.9 per cent to 1.8 per cent), the lowest for seven years.
At the same time average staff costs per head increased by 6.6 per cent,
while average gross income per head grew by only 2.9 per cent. As agencies
have become less profitable, they have also become more indebted; long term
debt increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn. Interest costs now account
for 36 per cent of the potential pre-tax profits of the agencies, compared
with 26 per cent in the previous year's survey.
Pre-tax profits fell for all of the 13 publicly-quoted agencies, except the
media-buying CIA group; nine of those surveyed saw pre-tax profits fall by
35 per cent or more.
The survey compares the financial performances of 50 agency groups - public
and private, UK and foreign - covering December 1990 to November 1991.
Average pre-tax profits of the 50 agency groups surveyed remained unchanged,
at Pounds 3.2m; but excluding WPP - which accounted for 56 per cent of the
total pre-tax profits of all agencies in the survey - the remaining agencies
reported a fall in average pre-tax profits of 16 per cent.
The survey suggests that the larger fish - WPP, Saatchi and Saatchi, and the
Lowe Group - have increased in strength relative to some of the minnows.
Those three agencies accounted for 89 per cent of the total pre-tax profits
of the surveyed companies against 75 per cent previously.
One aspect which is bound to be closely studied is the section dealing with
aggregate operating profit per employee, down by 1 per cent to Pounds 4,882,
against an 11.5 per cent increase in 1991's survey; in 1988 the figure was
Pounds 6,029. Heading the table of gross income per employee - a key
indicator of agency strength - is Butterfield Day Devito Hockney, followed
by Geers Gross (since acquired by Publicis) and Edwards Martin Thornton.
David Miles of Touche Ross says 'a typical response among agencies (to their
financial problems) has been to reduce staff numbers but not overall levels
of reward. Expectations remain high in a sector where 'tightening one's
belt' still means something the mechanic does to the GTi convertible.'
Admittedly the survey is retrospective, but according to research**
published next week by Zenith Media, part of Saatchi and Saatchi, there is
nothing to comfort anxious agency heads in the run-up to Christmas. Instead
of the traditional rise in advertising expenditure in the final quarter,
Zenith forecasts a fall of 7 per cent in television advertising revenue.
What Zenith's forecasts appear to confirm is a double-dip in television
advertising revenues; the last quarter of 1990 registered a real decline of
10 per cent. Such advertising revenue collapses, precisely in the period
when companies normally spend the bulk of their advertising budgets, have
not been seen since 1974 (a last quarter real decline of 18 per cent) and
1969 (decline of 11 per cent).
Frank Harrison, who has carried out the research for Zenith, believes there
are two reasons for the collapse. 'Companies with foreign parents, reporting
profits in non-UK currencies, have seen their UK contribution significantly
reduced following the unforeseen withdrawal of the pound from the ERM and
its subsequent devaluation. And with the economic recession deeper and more
protracted than expected, many companies are finding it difficult to meet
profit targets for 1992 and have consequently cut back on advertising in
quarter four.'
Nor are agencies alone in their fear that the recession may now actually be
turning into slump. From January 1 1993, Channel 4 will be responsible for
selling its own air-time to advertisers; further down the road is the
projected Channel 5. Channel 4 is safeguarded to some extent: if advertising
revenues fall below 14 per cent of terrestrial net advertising revenue
(TNAR), then ITV must top up revenue to a maximum of 2 per cent of TNAR.
But without some return of consumer confidence - and willingness to spend -
advertisers will show little inclination to restore slashed marketing
budgets. The end result could be an even tighter squeeze, not just on
advertising agencies but on also some successful bidders in the ITV network,
who made their bids on very different anticipated advertising revenue
forecasts. *How Advertising Agencies Made Their Profits In 1991; available

FT  29 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Confounding the
image makers - The sudden bull market in US political advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has not been a predictable year for American political advertising. It
began much as it left off in 1988, as a mixture of fuzzy warmth and
below-the-belt assaults. Then along came Ross Perot and changed the rules by
taking to the 'free' television talk show circuit as, promptly, did Bill
Clinton and, much later, George Bush.
Perot disappeared for a few months and the desultory norm was renewed. Now
he is back again and paying for his own airtime at a phenomenal rate - and
at precisely the same time as the Clinton and Bush campaigns have themselves
shifted into top advertising gear.
What looked a month ago like a lean year for income from political
advertising, has now become a raging bull market. As of last week, the three
major commercial TV networks alone reported bookings of Dollars 40.9m
(Pounds 25m) from the campaigns, compared with a total of Dollars 38.5m
spent by Bush and Dukakis four years ago - and this was with the intensive
last two weeks of the campaign still to run.
Of this sum, Dollars 17.7m came from Bush, Dollars 5.5m from Clinton and
Dollars 17.3m from Perot. In one week alone, Perot bought Dollars 5.3m of
advertising time from ABC. Moreover, these figures are incomplete. They do
not include time bought on local and cable stations, where the more focused
Clinton effort has been concentrated, nor on radio, where the cheapest and
some of the dirtiest advertising has been. All told, figures of Dollars 100m
plus for spending are being talked of.
Money is not a problem. Figures this week suggest that Perot has spent about
Dollars 57m, the bulk on advertising, since he is doing virtually no
conventional campaigning, is flying in his private jet and is running only a
skeleton political organisation. According to the Federal Election
Commission last week, Clinton still had Dollars 25m cash in hand, while
Bush's reserves were even higher at Dollars 36m.
All of which would suggest that this election could turn out, even more than
four years ago, to hinge on the advertising messages being conveyed. In
reality, the notorious commercials which attacked Dukakis' supposed leniency
towards the convicted criminal Willie Horton probably only padded Bush's
margin of victory. But the lesson, practised in any number of mid-term
elections and carried over into this year, was that going for the jugular
paid dividends.
Curiously, and assuming that Perot's ad blitz does not land him in the White
House, the universal opinion is that, if anything, the reverse is true. The
most popular political programmes have been the candidate debates,
unvarnished as they are by the image makers. They attracted extraordinary
audiences of 70-95m, a testament to what may well be a serious re-awakening
of the American public's engagement in the political process.
Perot's first paid half hour 'infomercial' earlier this month, aired on one
network, was watched by no fewer than 15m people, the second most-watched
programme in its time slot, according to the ratings. Subsequent versions
have regularly out-drawn rival sitcoms. An 'infomercial' format is exactly
the same as a conventional TV programme but has the single purpose of
selling a product.
Perot's infomercial was a throwback to some ancient time of the single fixed
camera - showing just Perot at a desk, his charts and a pointer and lot of
homespun wisdom about how 'simple' solving the budget deficit can be. Other
half hours have been devoted to soft focus questioning about what a great
family man and patriot he is, an image which, by implication, would never be
conveyed by professional reporters, whom he detests.
Perot is also flooding the ether with conventional 30-second and one-minute
spots, in the first series of which he was seen in still photograph, but not
heard, letting a sonorous voice-over do the work. Later ones, blasting the
press, the pundits and the two main parties, have been directed to answering
the charge that a vote for Perot 'wasted'.
The second piece of evidence that good old attack advertising is not working
so well this year, comes from the public itself. In the second presidential
debate, in which only the public, not journalists, got to ask the questions,
the mood of the audience was crystal clear: we are fed up with smears and
character assassination and want to hear more about the issues which affect
our lives. Public opinion polls show a similar discontent.
This is a bit of a problem for the Bush campaign, with its unremittingly
negative advertisements directed at Clinton. Any British visitor remembering
the April election will quickly recognise some of them, such as the one
which portrays Clinton as a man with two blurred and 'untrustworthy' heads
and another which charges, with specific illustrations of 'ordinary' people,
that he will slap higher taxes on the middle class. A third claims that
Clinton is guilty of a 'pattern of deception,' which is now in Bush's
standard campaign speech, as is his denunciation of his opponent's record as
governor of Arkansas, which is also enshrined in a commercial.
New attack advertisements on Bush's behalf are coming out at a rapid rate.
One, aired on the morning after the second debate in St Louis, showed a
local eatery with the average Joe and Mary proclaiming that George Bush had
'won' the debate. It transpired that the location was genuine enough but
that all those giving their heartfelt opinions were local Republican
campaign workers.
The Clinton side has not been dilatory with the negative stuff, making many
a meal out of Bush's infamous pledge of 1988, 'Read my lips, no new taxes.'
Another recalls Bush saying, 'You will be better off four years from now
than you are today' and concludes, 'Well, its four years later. How're you
doing?' A third has Bush saying, 'I want a kinder, gentler . . .' and the
announcer cutting in and saying 'Uh-uh. We can't afford four more years.'
Another alleges Bush has used taxpayer money to shift US jobs to central
America. Subtle they are not.
But its reading of the public mood has also persuaded it to release more
'positive' advertising than has Bush to date. They may not be quite up to
the 'morning in America' material that was at the heart of the Reagan
re-election campaign in 1984, but they look forward to challenges with hope,
rather than backwards in anger. They never forget the economy.
Only the election will tell if all this has been money well spent. At the
start of the year many US news organisation assigned journalists to the ad
watch, on the assumption it would be influential. More now have to get up at
dawn and stay up all night for the news that is made on the talk shows.

Excerpts from the British and Chinese correspondence
Douglas Hurd to Qian Qichen, Jan 18, 1990
If you wished to provide for the establishment of a grand electoral college
in the Basic Law, and the arrangements for constituting this body were open
and fully representative, we would wish to see it initiated in 1995 through
consultations between our two sides.
Hurd to Qian, January 31, 1990
It will also be important that the details of the composition and
constitution of any grand electoral college are made clear to Hong Kong
people to reassure them about the nature of their proposed future political
system. We could then consider introducing similar arrangements in 1995,
thereby ensuring continuity.
UK paper handed to Chinese government, February 6, 1990
Main aspects on which we believe agreement would be necessary are  .. size
and composition of the election committee, delineation of each category of
membership and the selection of individual members from each category  ..
procedures for the nomination and election of candidates to the legislature
 .. the following principles could best form the framework for creating an
election committee  .. it should not itself be an institution of government
 .. composition should be designed, as far as possible, to avoid direct
duplication with the membership of other constituencies returning members of
the legislature   . committee should be as representative as possible  ..
procedure for nomination  .. should be simple, open and prescribed in the
electoral law  .. voting should be by secret ballot.
Chen Ziying, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, to British
ambassador in Beijing, February 8, 1990
With regard to the electoral committee, the Chinese side agrees with the
five principles concerning the committee proposed by the British side in the
document. However, the Chinese side maintains that the provisions on the
composition and ratio of the electoral committee as specified in  .. the
Basic Law (Draft) must be followed in terms of its proportional composition
 . China believes its provisions on composition and ratio are appropriate ..
Hurd to Qian, February 12, 1990
I agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for an
electoral committee ..

FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Europe's gas supply lies in troubled hands
 -The fears prompted by disputes between the former Soviet Republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 50 per cent drop in gas supplies from Russia to western Europe last week
has raised important questions about the security of Europe's supplies as it
increases its reliance on natural gas.
The temporary drop in supplies was because of a dispute over payments
between Russia and Ukraine. Russia temporarily turned off supplies to
Ukraine and Ukraine retaliated by taking gas from the export pipeline
destined for western Europe.
Gas analysts warn the incident may seriously damage European confidence in
Russia's reliability as a supplier and prompt a rethink about where future
gas supplies should come from. Europe's choices are limited.
Changing attitudes to natural gas have brought a big increase in western
European consumption. This is mainly because of environmental considerations
and improved gas power technology.
Consumption in western Europe last year was 287bn cubic metres, according to
figures from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the international energy
consultants. This is expected to increase by between 50 and 100 per cent by
2010.
Until the middle of the decade, Europe is likely to depend on imports from
four principal producers: Algeria, the Netherlands, Norway and the former
Soviet Union, primarily Russia.
Together these countries supply about 52 per cent of Europe's gas, but both
Norway and the Netherlands have little spare gas in the short term. That
makes Russia and Algeria the countries most likely to meet increases in
demand.
Russia already supplies more than 20 per cent of western Europe's gas needs.
It has by far the world's largest reserves - some 53,000bn cubic metres,
according to Mr Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of Gazprom, the gas industry
operator. A recent report by Moscow energy specialists predicted that gas,
even more than oil, would be the key to Russia's economic renaissance.
But those assumptions have been challenged by the recent supply problems.
One problem is that three big pipelines come together at Uzhgorod in the
Ukraine, from where the main export pipeline runs into western Europe,
giving Ukraine - which no longer enjoys the warmest of relations with
neighbouring Russia - the power to turn off supplies.
Analysts warn that any worsening of relations between the two countries  -
for example, over the disputed territory of the Crimea - could result in
Ukraine doing just that. However, Ukraine is unlikely to be able to hold
Russia to ransom for long, since it is a net importer of gas and receives
gas as payment in kind for transiting Russian gas.
A potentially more thorny problem is that the former Soviet Union's pipeline
network now spans 15 different republics, which have spent months locked in
dispute over questions such as pipeline ownership, maintenance and carriage
charges. Industrial action by any one of a number of republics or autonomous
republics and regions within Russia could damage Russia's ability to export
gas.
While attempts are being made to retain Gazprom as a Union-wide monopoly,
but as a joint-stock company in which almost all of the former Soviet
republics are likely to be partners, these may not be successful.
Mr James Ball, director of Gas Matters newsletter and a leading gas expert,
warns that 'the uncertainty about who will control gas exports in the longer
term may discourage foreign countries from signing new supply contracts.'
This could have a knock-on effect, by deterring western companies from
investing in Russia's upstream gas industry through fears they will be
unable to get the gas out.
With reserves of 3,300bn cubic metres, Algeria is in no position to
challenge Russia's role as principal external supplier to western Europe,
but last week's events might allow it to gain a somewhat larger share of the
market. Two factors work to Algeria's advantage. The first is that its
export routes go straight into European markets. The pipeline which carries
14bn cubic metres of gas annually to Italy, and whose capacity will double
by 1995, crosses Tunisia, a politically stable country, while 18bn cubic
metres travel by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ships.
The second is that the country's well-run oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach,
has already been through the process of deciding if and how foreign
companies are to work with it. Algeria has been lucky. The growth in demand
for its gas has exceeded Sonatrach's future capability, leading it to offer
far more rewarding terms for oil and gas exploration. This change of heart
in Algiers has led to the signing of a string of agreements with western
companies such as Total, Arco, Phillips Petroleum, Mobil, BP, Agip and
Cepsa. Current reserves figures are likely to prove conservative, given the
prolonged absence of internationally experienced explorers.
Meanwhile, the renovation and upgrading of existing LNG facilities is going
ahead, which will provide Sonatrach with extra capacity of 10bn cubic metres
at a cost of Dollars 2bn, which is substantially less than the cost of a
similar-size greenfield LNG project.
However, Sonatrach will still have a maximum annual export capacity of only
70bn cubic metres by 1997 and has indicated a desire to limit exports to
60bn cubic metres, 56bn of which is already sold. Strong market pressure
could encourage Algeria to sell all 70bn cubic metres.
There is another drawback: a political one. The Algerian government has been
mired in bloody confrontation with religious fundamentalists since it
cancelled last December's first ever multi-party elections. For Algeria's
buyers, there remains a fear of sabotage.

THE State Energy Commission of Western Australia said yesterday it would
consider a revised proposal from Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss/Swedish
engineering group, to develop a ADollars 2bn (Pounds 840m) power station,
writes Kevin Brown from Sydney.
The project appeared close to collapse two weeks ago after the state
government indicated that it would not accept ABB's proposed electricity
prices, or its attempts to win state-government financial support. The
commission said a revised bid would be considered by a special board meeting
next week.

Daewoo Motor said yesterday it planned to produce a modified Korean version
of Honda's luxury car Legend by the end of 1993, writes John Burton from
Seoul.
Mr Kim Woo-choong, Daewoo chairman, met Honda officials this week in Tokyo
to discuss details about the possible production of the Legend for the
Korean market. Daewoo said yesterday it could not confirm whether a
licensing agreement had yet been signed.
Daewoo, South Korea's third largest car maker, would become the third
competitor in the country's luxury car market.
Daewoo, an unlisted company, recorded an estimated loss of Won50bn (Pounds
37m) in the first half of this year and has an enormous debt/equity ratio of
over 2,000 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US poised to announce oilseeds sanctions
after election
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US could announce punitive tariffs on European Community goods as early
as November 4, the day after the US presidential election, the US indicated
yesterday.
Most sanctions, in retaliation over EC oilseed subsidies, would initially
target French and German goods. If the US goes ahead the move could trigger
a global trade war.
Retaliation would mark an end to protracted efforts by US and EC negotiators
to resolve disputes on subsidised farm trade. It could jeopardise hopes for
a wider agreement on trade liberalisation as part of the Uruguay Round. The
EC has been told that a date has been set for imposition of sanctions.
Telephone conversations between US and EC negotiators, since talks broke off
last week, have produced little progress, the US says.
Both sides have confirmed that the US has offered to move towards the
implicit EC oilseeds production ceiling of 9.5m tonnes. But EC negotiators
have refused to meet US demands for binding restrictions on oilseeds output
 -at least none above the mechanisms in the reformed Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP).
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's farm commissioner, said the EC was willing to
carry into international agreement the CAP reform provisions on restraining
oilseeds and cereal output, which are already Community law. 'I don't know
what other assurances they need,' Mr MacSharry added.
A senior US official said: 'We have sent proposal after proposal to Europe,
but we don't see a lot happening. We see proposals coming back in forms they
know are unacceptable to us.'
Mr MacSharry was standing by to fly to the US, but Mr Edward Madigan, his US
counterpart, was understood to have no plans to meet him, because the EC was
'still in a backsliding mode'.
The EC has told the US that it cannot step outside what the 12 agreed
unanimously in the new CAP, which sets severe targets for price and
production cuts. Only in this way can France, the main opponent of a Gatt
deal, be held to its undertakings.
Within the US administration it has been agreed to aim a first 'tranche' of
sanctions - prohibitive tariffs on roughly Dollars 300-350m worth of
products - against the French, who are seen as the primary cause of the row,
and the Germans, who are viewed as aiding and abetting them. The
administration is likely to wait 30 days before putting the sanctions into
effect.
US officials still hope that the EC might recognise that they are firmly
committed to proceeding with sanctions.
The White House decided to delay sanctions until after the presidential
election to demonstrate in Europe that they were not designed to boost the
president's popularity among US farmers. US officials say the administration
will proceed whether or not Mr Bush wins the election.
The administration's will has been stiffened by the US farm lobby, which has
vowed to fight any Uruguay Round deal in Congress if the president 'caved
in' on oilseeds.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, yesterday seemed to be
preparing for US sanctions 'in a matter of days' but hoping to limit the
dispute to prevent a full-scale transatlantic trade war.
Framing her argument in purely legal terms, she talked of the 'litigation'
in which the US had brought and won two complaints about EC oilseeds to
Gatt, and she referred to the EC as a 'defendant' which had lost.
'We face having a judgment without payment on that judgment,' she said. 'But
we are not igniting a trade war if we can find no settlement to the judgment
we have lawfully been rendered not once but twice. It is only appropriate
that we withdraw concessions earlier given.'
For the EC to counter-retaliate would be 'totally Gatt illegal,' she said,
and would seriously erode the credibility of the Gatt dispute settlement
mechanism.
As for the French, who have blocked a deal, they 'must consider whether
their destiny is as an agrarian nation or otherwise ..if, as the second
largest provider of services worldwide, they do not see the benefits that
come from reducing trade barriers.'

MR Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French trade and industry minister, yesterday
sought to defend the government over allegations that Paris is holding up a
settlement of the Uruguay Round, writes William Dawkins from Paris.
He rejected criticisms that France was using complaints over the fall in the
dollar's value to hold up a world trade agreement for internal political
reasons. France wanted a Gatt accord, especially on farming. However, it
could not impose sacrifices on European agriculture beyond that already
agreed in the recent reforms of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),
he said. It would be 'unacceptable' for EC farm exports to depend on US
monetary policy, he added.

Daewoo, South Korea's third largest car maker, would become the third

Hyundai has produced its top-of-the-range Grandeur since 1986, in
conjunction with Mitsubishi of Japan, while Kia Motors in May launched the
Potentia, which was developed in co-operation with Mazda, to compete against
the Grandeur.
Daewoo, an unlisted company, recorded an estimated loss of Won50bn (Pounds
37m) in the first half of this year and has an enormous debt/equity ratio of
over 2,000 per cent.
Daewoo last week formally ended its joint venture with General Motors by
buying the US carmaker's 50 per cent shareholding in the company for Dollars
170m. The joint venture ended because GM was concerned about Daewoo's
profitability.
Honda, Nissan and Suzuki of Japan have been mentioned as possible partners
with Daewoo in joint ventures. Daewoo already has a technical licensing
agreement with Nissan on compact cars.

THE State Energy Commission of Western Australia said yesterday it would
consider a revised proposal from Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss/Swedish
engineering group, to develop a ADollars 2bn (Pounds 840m) power station.
ABB was commissioned in June to build and operate Australia's first
privately owned and funded power station at Collie, near a coalfield in
south-west Western Australia.
However, the project appeared close to collapse two weeks ago after the
state government indicated that it would not accept ABB's proposed
electricity prices, or its attempts to win state-government financial
support.
The group is believed to have reapproached the commission last week in a bid
to retain its sole-bidder status for the project.
The commission said the revised bid would be considered by a special board
meeting next week. However, it was not clear whether prices had been reduced
to a level acceptable to the state government.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK tries to defuse China's claim of secret HK deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE release yesterday of British correspondence with China over arrangements
for Hong Kong elections in 1995 is the latest twist in an increasingly
bitter confrontation between London and Beijing.
Mr Lu Ping, the Chinese official concerned with Hong Kong affairs, accused
Governor Chris Patten on Friday of breaking an understanding between China
and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Lu's furious assault was China's
response to Mr Patten's proposals to make the 1995 Legislative Council
elections more democratic, only two years before Hong Kong comes under
Chinese control.
Beijing's accusations of bad faith over the future of Hong Kong were
dangerous to Britain because they threatened to undermine popular support in
Hong Kong for the robust and open approach of Mr Patten. That support is Mr
Patten's biggest weapon in his confrontation with Beijing.
China's communists, determined to hang on to power and maintain political
stability, do not want to inherit 6m disgruntled people, upset at having
recently acquired democratic rights reversed, as China is threatening to
dowhen it assumes control.
British officials say Lu, in less than cordial talks with Mr Patten last
week in Beijing, suggested Britain publish the documents which, he said,
revealed agreement over the composition of an election committee due to
elect 10 seats to the Legislative Council in 1995.
He is unlikely to have expected that Britain would rise to the challenge.
The decision to publish them is clearly an attempt by London to maintain the
diplomatic advantage created by Mr Patten's announcement of the proposals.
The documents, all from January and February 1990, show Mr Hurd repeatedly
pressing China to increase the number of directly elected seats to the
Legislative Council and making little progress except for a Chinese proposal
which, according to the Chinese, was a significant concession.
Mr Hurd's recommendations are backed up to a large extent by his assessments
of popular feeling in Hong Kong as to what would be acceptable. If the
number of directly elected members in 1997 were 24, or 40 per cent of the
total, Mr Hurd says, 'we would then be enabled to give active support to
those provisions.'
China rejected this, insisting that the number should be 20, but agreed to
Mr Hurd's suggestion that the number directly elected in 1991 should be 18
instead of 15 suggested previously by the Chinese.
When Mr Hurd repeated his position, Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign
minister, responded with a terse message regretting that Britain had 'failed
to make any concession on the relevant specific proposals, at which I cannot
but feel very much disappointed.'
He rejected Mr Hurd's offer to send a senior official for further talks and
coldly remarked: 'I believe the Foreign Secretary is well aware of the fact
that the drafting of the Basic Law is entirely China's internal affair.' The
Basic Law will provide Hong Kong's constitution after 1997.
The election committee at the heart of the current dispute was, British
officials say, a minor issue at the time by comparison with that of direct
elections.
Mr Patten now proposes that the committee should be elected and a widening
of the franchise of some of the 'functional constituencies' which elect
additional seats. He says this makes the election more democratic without
contravening the Basic Law.
Though the documents show a measure of agreement on the election committee,
the exchange on this topic is inconclusive. They do not provide evidence of
anything that could be called a 'secret deal'.
British officials say the exchange has to be seen in the context of the
unsuccessful attempt to agree on directly-elected seats and on the overall
Basic Law.
The Basic Law, when published, made no mention of the 'five principles'
apparently agreed, and specifically excluded the Legislative Council of 1997
 -which will be elected in 1995 - from its stipulations about the
composition of an election committee which will not only appoint Legislative
Council members but also the territory's chief executive.
British officials have no explanation for this exclusion. But they say China
has made it clear in subsequent statements that it did not believe that the
composition of the 1995 election committee had been agreed. In September, Lu
told visiting Legislative Council members in Beijing that China had not yet
reached a decision on the composition.
Britain hopes that publication of the exchanges will neutralise Chinese
allegations of a secret deal and encourage Beijing to discuss Mr Patten's
proposals more constructively. There is no sign yet that it will do so. A
complete failure to discuss them would put Mr Patten, despite his bravado,
in a difficult position.
