FT  27 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Planning on a good
impression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most business plans are not very good, says Brian Finch, in the introduction
to his guide* to the subject of making business proposals.
This is hardly surprising since most business people will usually produce
only one or two in their careers.
Start with a short, preferably one-page introduction, Finch suggests. You
have only a few minutes to make a good impression and by the time the reader
has finished the summary, you have either won or lost.
The summary should be written after you have written the rest of the
business plan because it must tell the whole story of what you are
proposing. Establish why you are writing the plan. Is it to raise finance,
to help sell the business or as a general management aid?
Never use jargon. Your plan may be passed on to non-specialists and even the
expert appreciates ideas being expressed in plain English.
Make it easy to read, says Finch, a corporate finance associate with
London-based accountants Blackstone Franks. The plan may be the most
important thing in your life but it does not have the same importance for
your potential readers. So if the plan is more than three or four pages long
put in an index. Number the pages and use a clear type face with plentiful
spacing.
Remember you are telling a story so the narrative must flow. Do not devote
too much time to particular aspects such as the history of the company or
your personal details in the main text. But at the same time do not assume
the reader knows how your company or its market place work.
Your readers will expect that you have put a positive gloss on your
achievements but do not try to deceive them by forgetting to mention, say,
pending litigation. Any deal will depend on trust so be careful not to
destroy that at the outset. Investors also have legal redress against
directors who misrepresent matters.
Do not leave it too late to present your business plan. Financial backers
tend to distrust people who want an immediate answer.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): UK dependency on
short-term finance - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small and medium-sized companies in the UK are far more dependent on
short-term finance than their continental European counterparts, according
to a survey* by 3i, the venture capital company, and Cranfield School of
Management.
Overdraft and short-term finance accounted for 76 per cent of the total
finance of British companies. Only 25 per cent of British companies had ever
used long-term loans compared with 64 per cent of German companies and
between 45 and 53 per cent of companies in France, Italy and Spain.
This dependence on short-term finance meant UK companies are badly placed to
weather the recession and explained cutbacks in investment said Paul Burns,
director of the 3i/Cranfield Enterprise Centre.
A total of 739 companies responded to the survey.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Partnerships not prepared
for death - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many business partnerships are unprepared for the problems which can arise
if a partner dies, falls ill or wants to retire, according to a survey* by
London Life, an assurance company.
Sixty three per cent of those interviewed said that in the event of a
partner's sudden death it would not be possible to replace their experience
quickly, although three-quarters believed the partnership could continue in
business.
Nearly two-thirds said their partnership would suffer if a partner became
seriously ill but, even so, 70 per cent had made no arrangements to insure
against such an event.
Forty per cent of partnerships had no formula to work out the amount of
capital which new partners would require to buy into the business, making it
more difficult for prospective partners to plan their finances.
The researchers spoke to 300 partnerships.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Technology: Time to act on careers in research - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE career structure for academic scientists in the UK has deteriorated
alarmingly over the past 15 years. Judged on a combination of factors,
including pay and security of employment, university research is now one of
the least appealing professions open to bright young graduates.
The root cause of the problem is the surge in short-term (two- or
three-year) research contracts, which has not been matched by any expansion
in permanent jobs. In 1978, 13,451 scientists and engineers had permanent or
long-term posts in British universities and 3,905 had short-term contracts.
By 1991, the number of long-term posts had fallen to 12,716, while the
short-term total more than doubled to 9,930.
In personal terms, these statistics mean that researchers have to stagger
through their late 20s and 30s - and sometimes even into their 40s - on a
succession of short-term contracts. The result is low morale and a lot of
time wasted worrying about where the next contract is going to come from,
instead of concentrating on the research itself.
However, there are encouraging signs that the UK research establishment is
preparing at last to tackle the academic career crisis. Senior figures are
speaking out about the need to look after people better.
Most outspoken is Bridget Ogilvie, new director of the Wellcome Trust. This
summer's sale of shares in Wellcome, the drug company, will double the
trust's research spending to more than Pounds 200m a year - not far short of
the government's Medical Research Council budget - and give her a powerful
influence over academic careers.
'It seems obvious that drastic action is needed to stabilise careers and
secure Britain's science base, particularly if the brain drain is to be
reversed. It is not fair to treat people as short-term disposable assets,
and it is unwise for the health and future of the nation,' she believes.
Although the Wellcome Trust is not big enough on its own to shift the whole
UK system to more long-term funding, Ogilvy is likely to find allies within
the state-funded research councils.
Another powerful call for change comes from the Royal Society, the country's
senior scientific body. Its report on the future of the UK science base,
published last month*, focuses particularly on the need to improve research
careers - and puts forward some excellent proposals for reform.
According to the Royal Society, it is reasonable for young researchers to
undertake one or two short-term contracts after completing their PhD
studies. But promising scientists should then be rewarded with long-term
support including 'benefits good enough to compete with careers in other
sectors'.
The support should take the form of a personal fellowship 'guaranteeing
salary and research expenses for at least five years'. The scientist could
use his or her funds to work at any approved institution - in contrast to
today's contracts which are tied to a particular project. One beneficial
side-effect would be to make universities compete more actively to attract
good researchers. Ideally, the fellowship would end with the scientist
finding a permanent research position.
At the same time, universities and funding agencies need to set up a system
for advising young researchers about their future. Many scientists find
today 'that they are funded by one organisation and employed by another,
with neither taking an interest in their careers,' as the Royal Society puts
it. People who turn out not to be suited for long-term careers in academic
research must be helped to transfer to different employment.
Reform along the lines suggested by the Royal Society would only work well
if it were taken up enthusiastically by the government, the research
councils and Universities Funding Council, as well as the Wellcome Trust and
smaller research charities.
Fortunately, the government has a chance to give the reform process real
momentum when it publishes the promised White Paper on Science and
Technology next year. Improving career patterns may not be the most exciting
issue on the agenda but it is one of the most important for the health of
British science.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow registers solid gains
after slow start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a slow start, US share prices posted solid gains yesterday, aided by a
strong showing from Procter &amp; Gamble and heavy demand for transportation
stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.47 at 3,244.11,
having spent all but the last two hours of the day only a few points above
opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 4.07
higher at 418.17, while the Amex composite closed up 1.92 at 376.16 and the
Nasdaq composite 1.61 higher at 598.91. Turnover on the NYSE was lighter
than in recent days at 188m shares.
Over the past week the markets have been busy and trading heavy as investors
repositioned their portfolios ahead of the November 3 election. That phase
appears to be over, and analysts said a new period of consolidation and
caution was likely to follow, with more investors moving to the sidelines as
election day nears.
The latest opinion polls, which showed Governor Bill Clinton's lead
narrowing after a surge in support for Mr Ross Perot, may have contributed
to yesterday's late gains, forcing those investors who had bet on a Clinton
victory to readjust their positions.
The absence of fresh economic news figures and the fact that the reporting
season is drawing to a close meant that trading was light compared to recent
weeks.
Among individual stocks, Procter &amp; Gamble jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53
1/2 in heavy trading after the consumer products group announced an 18 per
cent rise in first quarter net income to Dollars 631m before a special
Dollars 200m reserve related to the divestiture of its juice business.
General Motors firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 in turnover of 2.8m
after Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, announced his resignation. His
departure had been widely predicted, but the company did not immediately
name a new chairman.
The other two car manufacturers were both firmer, buoyed up by recent good
sales figures. Chrysler put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 7/8 , and Ford firmed
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 1/8 .
Paramount Communications fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 in active
trading after securities house Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock on concern
about entertainment group's the short-term earnings outlook. Phillips
Petroleum firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 25 5/8 after reporting third
quarter net income of 38 cents a share.
On the Nasdaq market, Somatix rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 after an
analyst at broking house Oppenheimer said that the company should benefit
from gene therapy that could possibly become commercially viable next year.
Radius dropped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 5 on disappointing fiscal fourth
quarter earnings.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended higher in active trading boosted by several blocks of
Sceptre Resources shares. According to preliminary data, the 300 Index
gained 29.23 points, or 0.90 per cent, to 3,275.99. Advances led declines
253 to 241.
Volume of 39.2m shares was above Friday's 30.7m, and trading value was
CDollars 244m against the previous CDollars 290.6m.
Monday's volume included three block trades in Sceptre Resources totalling
about 9m shares. In all, about 10.6m Sceptre shares changed hands.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at day's
low as trading volume falls
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices fell moderately in low activity, as investors remained inactive
ahead of the Bank of Japan's branch managers' meeting which starts today.
Volume fell to 130m shares, the lowest level since August 3, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 106.32 to close at the day's low of 17,011.33. The
index moved within a narrow range, briefly hitting the day's high of
17,153.76 in the afternoon session.
Declines led advances by 594 to 305 with 187 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks lost 7.99 to 1,288.70 and in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.21 to 1,036.35.
Traders said that while sentiment remained subdued, growing expectations of
a cut in the official discount rate prevented active selling. Market
participants hope that the central bank's meeting of regional managers will
shed some light on monetary policy. 'Lower interest rates will increase the
money flow, pushing up volume,' said Mr Takatoshi Okuyama, strategist at
Daiwa Securities.
However, a fund manager at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer, said that
he would not be in a hurry to buy even if interest rates declined. 'We would
have to see good profit figures, and an improvement in economic indicators
reflecting a recovery,' he said.
Investors remained on the sidelines ahead of this week's spate of corporate
earnings announcements. Leading electronics makers, such as Matsushita
Electric Industrial and NEC announce their interim profits today, while
ship-builders are scheduled to report half-year profits at the end of the
week.
Fears that the higher yen would hurt interim earnings at exporters prompted
light selling. Hitachi fell Y3 to Y710 and Fujitsu Y4 to Y553.
Dealers took profits on speculative issues which rose last week. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, which surged on Friday on reports of its success in
room-temperature nuclear fusion research, lost Y30,000 to Y567,000. Aisin
Seiki, which also gained on the same theme, was the most active issue of the
day, falling Y20 to Y1,140.
Issues related to Alzheimer's disease cures gained ground. Snow Brand Milk
advanced Y15 to Y795 and Takeda Chemical added Y10 to Y1,240.
Some dealers looked for quick profits in public works-related issues,
pushing up road stocks and bridge builders. Maeda Road Construction gained
Y50 to Y2,700 and Yokogawa Bridge Y40 to Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 22.29 to 18,725.81 in volume of 20m shares.
Roundup
SINGAPORE, Kuala Lumpur, Taiwan and New Zealand were all closed yesterday
for public holidays. Meanwhile, trading in Manila was cancelled after
Typhoon Colleen unleashed torrential rains on the capital.
HONG KONG ended sharply lower as investors took profits after Beijing
attacked Governor Chris Patten's plans to widen democracy in Hong Kong. The
Hang Seng Index closed 200.07 or 3.2 per cent lower at 6,062.47, having
fallen to the day's low of 6,012.94 at the opening.
HSBC Holdings, which topped the most active list, fell HKDollars 2 to
HKDollars 60 and its unit Hang Seng Bank also lost HKDollars 2 to close at
HKDollars 52.50. Cheung Kong eased HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 22.90 and
Hutchison Whampoa slid 80 cents to HKDollars 16.80.
SEOUL closed sharply higher on across-the-board buying inspired by news that
the Daewoo Group chairman had denied political aspirations. The composite
stock index jumped 24.88 to 582.74, as 684 shares went limit-up. Turnover
totalled Won423.7bn after Saturday's half-day Won325.82bn.
Daewoo Corp recorded the greatest turnover of 2.61m of the 36.41m shares
traded. It rose Won400 to close limit-up at Won9,500.
AUSTRALIA ended a four-day climb when it closed near its lows for the day in
uncertain trading. The All Ordinaries index ended 4.9 lower at 1,450.7 in
turnover of ADollars 151.8m.
The biggest loser was National Australia Bank which plunged 17 cents to
ADollars 6.95 amid rumours it was considering a paper bid for ANZ. NAB had
no comment and ANZ dropped 1 cent to ADollars 2.94.
BANGKOK's SET index gained 11.12 or 1.2 per cent to close at 913.88, its
highest close since August 17 1990, on the back of a strong baking sector.
Turnover was active at Bt13.11bn. Krung Thai Bank jumped Bt22 to Bt260.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Rate cut hopes lift European equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN equity markets, given further encouragement that Germany might cut
its Lombard rate by the end of the year, turned in good performances last
week.
In spite of some disappointment at the size of Tuesday's cut by the
Bundesbank of its key repurchase rate, a signal that interest rates may fall
in the short term, the European component of FT-Actuaries World Index rose
nearly 4 per cent in local currency terms, with only Denmark and Italy
showing slight falls.
It was Finland's turn to shine with a spectacularly good performance that
was almost matched by Sweden. Mr Peter Lawrence, Scandinavian analyst at
Kleinwort Benson, comments in a recent review that Finnish equities are now
showing the first signs of recovery, spurred by the second devaluation
within the year, a govern-ment savings package and a better than expected
set of eight-month figures.
However, the rise needs to be kept in context given the market's recent bad
performance: the HEX index remains some 26 per cent down on its February
high. Mr Lawrence adds that the next stimulus should come in the new year
when Finland finally lifts restrictions on foreign ownership of shares.
Sweden was also buoyed up by further cuts in overnight rates and the
stronger dollar, with genuine buying interest being seen by domestic
institutions. Even disappointing eight-month results from Skanska early in
the week failed to dent the rally as investors began to feel that sentiment
had started to improve.
Elsewhere, Mexico rallied with a rise of nearly 9 per cent in dollar terms
during the week. Latin American Securities comments that sentiment was
encouraged by the successful renegotiation of the annual wage and price
accord which removed uncertainty over exchange rate and interest rate
fluctuation.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank statements
encourage Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate prospects continued to dominate continental trading yesterday.
Vienna was closed for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT moved from a negative position in the pre-bourse to close higher
as weekend statements from some Bundesbank council members led the market to
believe that interest rates would be cut this week.
In spite of warnings from Mr Helmut Schlesinger yesterday that inflation
would rise next year and from Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the possibility of
early tax increases, the DAX index closed 15.67 higher at 1,542.49 as
turnover fell to DM4.7bn from DM5.2bn.
The positive mood was reflected in leading shares which showed strong
advances. But Daimler-Benz managed a gain of just 80 pfg to DM561.80 after
denying weekend press reports that its Mercedes-Benz division would show a
loss this year because of weaker car sales. Mercedes fell DM3 to DM423.
Other car manufacturers reflected the depressed state of the industry while
BMW's DM7 gain to DM492 may have been helped by the stronger dollar which
supported export-orientated companies.
Investors took little notice of a magazine report that Thyssen was thinking
of cutting its dividend this year to DM8 from DM10 and the shares rose DM5
to DM162.
PARIS made an unexciting start to the new trading account, which was
reflected in the modest turnover of FFr1.8bn. A lower Matif amid
disappointment that a  1/4 point cut in interest rates did not materialise
took the CAC-40 index off its day's high of 1,785.44 to end 4.33 higher at
1,770.74.
Sextant Avionique jumped FFr22.50 or 21.2 per cent to FFr128.50 following
statements from senior executives at its parent Thomson-CSF that the company
was expected to approach break-even by year-end.
Among other risers were Moulinex which rose FFr4.10 to FFr84 after its
recent, heavy fall and Euro Disney which added FFr2.40 to FFr78.95. Losers
included L'Oreal, down FFr17 to FFr977 and Saint-Gobain which fell FFr7.40
to FFr487.
AMSTERDAM began the week where it had left off, with continued interest in
Fokker. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 104.1.
The aircraft manufacturer's shares recovered some 13 per cent as the
government said that it would give details of the takeover terms with Dasa.
The expected announcement had still not come by the close and Fokker
finished Fl 2.40 higher at Fl 18.20.
DAF slipped to an all-time low of Fl 10 before recovering slightly to end 30
cents lower at Fl 10.50. The group said on Friday that it was to reduce
working hours because of the slowdown in new truck sales.
DSM was Fl 1.30 lower at Fl 85.40 ahead of Thursday's third-quarter figures
which are expected to confirm the depressed state of the chem-icals sector.
ZURICH noted interest in Volksbank after the group announced that it was to
change its status from a co-operative into a joint-stock company. After a
brief suspension, Volksbank bearers advanced SFr40 before closing SFr20
higher at SFr805. The SMI index gained 9.9 to 1,930.9.
Other banks also firmed as money market rates eased further: UBS bearers,
the day's most active issue, advanced SFr8 to SFr833.
Among the insurers Swiss Re bearers put on SFr20 to SFr2,520, while Zurich
certificates rose SFr6 to SFr956.
MILAN closed off the day's highs on profit-taking after Friday's interest
rate cut. Disappointment that the Bundesbank did not follow suit also
prompted some selling. The Comit index rose 2.51 to 419.70 in turnover
estimated at L160bn after Friday's relatively heavy L241bn.
The food group Sme attracted attention on continued hopes that it would soon
be privatised. The stock added L261 or 5.8 per cent to L4,738. By contrast,
shares in Nuovo Pignone, another privatisation stock, fell heavily and were
suspended towards the end of trading, having fixed L555 lower at L5,100.
Elsewhere, Stet jumped L47 or 3.7 per cent to L1,325 on bargain-hunting
after its recent weakness.
MADRID retreated marginally, the general index falling 1.16 to 200.02.
Telefonica, which said that it expects group revenue to increase by 16 per
cent from 1991, improved Pta6 to Pta956, although recent presentations in
London and Madrid have disappointed some analysts.
STOCKHOLM gathered momentum after the central bank cut interest rates but
fell back later on profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden index closed 1.0 higher
at 722.9 in turnover down to SKr357m from Friday's SKr616m.
The forestry sector showed a gain of some 1.3 per cent as exporters were
lifted by the stronger US currency.
OSLO saw Elkem's A shares tumble by more than 25 per cent after the group
reported bigger than expected interim losses on Friday. The A shares lost
NKr5.5 to NKr16.0 while the free shares shed NKr8 to NKr20. However,
strength elsewhere left the all-share index up 3.66 to 352.63 in turnover of
NKr274.5m.
BRUSSELS closed narrowly mixed in thin trading as further gains in Petrofina
offset declines among some industrial stocks. The Bel-20 Index inched 1.84
higher to 1,134.80 in turnover of BFr760m.
Petrofina closing BFr160 or 2.1 per cent higher at BFr7,750 while Solvay
dropped BFr75 to BFr11,625 and Electrabel fell BFr60 to BFr5,310.
HELSINKI continued to gain strongly on lower domestic interest rates and the
HEX index firmed 2.8 per cent to close at 709.6. Turnover amounted to
FM83.8m.

FT  27 OCT 92 / What Future For Coal?: Relative view of regeneration -
Ministers have pinned much on job creation plans for mining areas / A look
at how Consett has fared since the loss of steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUNBEAMS and showers flicker over the empty plain where the steelworks used
to belch its red dust and the sparrows reputedly woke up coughing. Consett,
the former steel town in County Durham, perched on a hilltop against a
background of rolling Pennine moorland, looks almost picturesque.
Gary Race, 29 and jobless nearly two years since his one-man business
folded, is pensive. In the Jobcentre he has just spotted an advertisement
for an abattoir meat packer with an applicants' age limit of 18.
His 57-year-old father Stewart scans the 700-acre site of the former works,
Europe's biggest reclamation project of the 1980s. It is earmarked for
Project Genesis, an environmentally friendly business, housing and leisure
redevelopment that has yet to happen.
Mr Race senior, unable to find a permanent job since the steel closure in
1980, is reconciled to not working again.
The steelworks, which created and dominated Consett, employed 6,500 in 1970.
When it closed, shedding its remaining 3,700 jobs, the town became a symbol
of the previous manufacturing recession.
Derwentside, with a population of 87,000, including Consett, was not
declared an enterprise zone, but it was swiftly granted Pounds 35m
government aid for land reclamation, factory building and road improvements.
Public investment in Derwentside since 1980 has risen to Pounds 50m.
The area's regeneration programme, backed by European and UK regional policy
grants, has frequently been cited by ministers as a shining example of
economic recovery. Many people in Consett see it rather differently.
Mr John Lee, the steelworks union leader, said: 'It's not an economic
miracle, it's an impossible task.'
Mr Gary Race said talk of regeneration was 'rubbish'. After spasmodic
building-site work dried up in the 1980s he started a mobile video hire
business, backed with an Pounds 8,000 loan. Then thieves stole his van with
all his videos, which he had decided he could not afford to insure. Two
years later, the family is still paying off the loan.
Consett's dramatically improved environment has been enlisted in 'positive
image' promotion. Incoming biotechnology and aerospace companies and
Consett-made tortilla chips have reinforced the transformation message.
'Ghost town' predictions have proved wrong - loyalty and roots run deep. Yet
the loss of the steelworks jobs and culture is still mourned.
Many locals do not support the assumption that today's dust-free,
diversified Consett must be better. 'If my father had still been at the
steelworks he could've got me in,' said Mr Gary Race.
Mr Lee said: 'The community doesn't die, but there's a spirit within it
which takes a bashing.' Many residents complain that the 'new' Consett means
low pay and insecurity.
Derwentside's unemployment, at 4,413 half its 1982 high of nearly 9,000,
remains above the national average at about 15 per cent. Intensive effort in
the 1980s generated an estimated 5,000 manufacturing jobs in Derwentside,
replacing the 5,000 lost in the 1980 closures of the steelworks and a local
ball bearing plant.
But the job haemorrhage started before the steelworks closed and continued
afterwards. Derwentside's manufacturing jobs total, which fell from 12,900
in 1977 to 4,800 in 1981, had risen to only 6,200 by 1989. The 1989 district
jobs total of 20,600, although 1,800 higher than 1981, was 2,000 down on
1987 due to agricultural and service-sector decline. The 1991 figure, not
yet available, is expected to be lower. Without the job creation drive,
Consett's economy would be forlorn.
This recession has bitten, too. Last year the Derwentside Industrial
Development Agency, the private-sector-led body spearheading regeneration,
announced that 5,300 jobs had been created since 1980. That has now fallen
to 5,015. The agency said it had helped 190 companies and had just announced
Consett's first overseas inward investment since 1986.
Mr Eddie Hutchinson, chief executive of the development agency, said: 'We've
seen in Derwentside a measure of success, but industrial regeneration is a
long job. You can measure it in decades.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / Fire cuts oil production at Sullom Voe terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRE at Europe's largest oil terminal, Sullom Voe in Shetland, yesterday
halved oil production and resulted in the suspension of gas processing.
No one was injured in the blaze.
The Pounds 400m terminal handles nearly half the UK's North Sea oil
production. British Petroleum, which owns the terminal, said the fire
merited a Stage Two response - requiring help to be brought in from outside
 -which categorises it as a serious incident. Stage Three response incidents
are the most serious.
The fire was discovered at about 12.20am in a drying unit in the gas
processing area but was brought under control before 1am by the terminal's
fire service, assisted by brigades from Brae and Lerwick. Firefighters then
controlled the fire and allowed it to continue burning until 8am to consume
excess gas.
BP launched an immediate investigation into the cause of the fire, but said
it was too early to reach any conclusions. The company said it was also too
early to assess the extent or likely cost of the damage, although some
buildings had been damaged.
Neither of the two oil pipelines into the terminal was damaged, but normal
oil production of almost 900,000 barrels a day was halved as a precaution.
BP said it expected production to return to normal by the end of yesterday.
The terminal is likely to have suffered a loss of production of about
250,000 barrels, with a market value of about Dollars 5m.
Gas production will be suspended until damaged equipment is repaired. BP
said most gas from the East Shetlands Basin goes to the St Fergus terminal
north of Aberdeen rather than to Sullom Voe.
Gas processed at Sullom Voe does not go into the national grid but is
compressed into liquefied petroleum gas. The terminal typically produces
about 1,000 tonnes of butane and 1,000 tonnes of propane a week.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Health authority spending criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS shortcomings in financial control in two National Health Service
regions - including the cost of leased houses in London for company
executives, aircraft hire and 'lavish entertainment' - are highlighted in a
critical report published today.
One of the cases covered in the National Audit Office's report - expenditure
by the West Midlands Regional Health Authority on consultancy services
intended to generate Pounds 50m savings through better purchasing
arrangements and administration - has already resulted in the government
sending Sir Roy Griffiths, deputy chairman of the NHS policy board, to
Birmingham to help strengthen the region's management.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, says that an auditor found
the consultancy costs amounted to some Pounds 2.5m, while the region's total
costs were likely to be closer to Pounds 4m. The auditor had concluded that,
in placing and managing the consultancy contract, the region's then director
of regionally managed services had 'not followed regional policy and had
shown a cavalier disregard for the standards of conduct expected from public
officers'.
Questionable costs included the consultants' expenses, which had amounted
over a year to some Pounds 350,000, 'and had contained such items as leased
houses in London for the firm's executives and their wives, the hire of
aircraft to come to work and lavish entertainment'. The regional authority
had paid invoices without always seeing supporting bills. The director
became redundant in June 1991 after some five years' service and, the report
says, was overpaid in redundancy and other payments by Pounds 41,500. Sir
John says the regional authority had not sought the health department's
approval before making the payments.
West Midlands region, the report says, is also concerned about a potential
Pounds 3.5m commitment for an integrated electronic trading system, and was
'reviewing the legal, contractual and financial position of this project'.
Sir John's report also addresses expenditure of Pounds 43m over six years on
an information system for Wessex region which, he says, was abandoned in
April 1990 'without any significant benefit having accrued to the region'.
An auditor had found that the transfer of part of the regional authority's
information technology function to private companies, staffed largely by
former employees, was not in the interests of the region. Misleading advice
had led to the purchase of a computer for Pounds 3.3m. It was not installed
until 18 months after delivery, by which time in had reduced in value to
about Pounds 1m.
Sir John says members of health authorities must ensure that their officials
do not exceed delegated powers; that NHS regulations for officers'
conditions of service are strictly applied and they they were 'fully
informed of all important matters'.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Outlook for machine tools improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNWARD trend in UK demand for machine tools will end next spring, but
recovery will be slow, according to a forecast for the Machine Tool
Technologies Association.
The forecast, prepared by Mr John Walker, chief economist of Oxford Economic
Forecasting, will bring some solace to the recession-hit machine tool
industry, which has seen employment fall by about 5,000 to between 17,000
and 18,000 jobs over the past three years.
Even so, demand in 1995 is still predicted to be below the 1990 level, and
meanwhile the industry's troubles are deepening. Industry leaders, who have
maintained a dialogue with the government throughout the recession, are
planning a more forthright campaigning strategy.
Demand for machine tools fell 21 per cent last year, and Mr Walker predicts
a further 12 per cent fall in consumption this year to Pounds 674m. That,
though, is distorted by imports worth between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m for
fitting out the new Japanese car plants.
As those amounts are not expected to be repeated, demand is forecast to fall
another 1 per cent next year. That is in spite of an expected recovery in
the economy as a whole from early next year, and a pick-up in invest-ment in
certain key sectors.
Further ahead, total consumption of machine tools is expected to reach
Pounds 958m in 1995. That is up 42 per cent on the expected figure for this
year, but still well below the most recent peak of Pounds 1.03bn in 1989,
even without removing the effects of inflation.
Mr Walker's forecasts for this year, made a year ago, proved to be
over-optimistic, because the expected recovery in the second half of the
year did not happen. The main risk with the latest forecasts concerns
government economic policy, the association says.
The forecasts assume that interest rates will stay at 8 per cent through
next year to 1994, when the UK is expected to re-enter the European exchange
rate mechanism; that sterling will settle at about DM2.55 to DM2.65 over the
next two years; that fiscal policy will remain tight; and that economic
growth next year will be about 2 per cent.
Over the past 18 months, the association has been lobbying behind the scenes
for tax incentives to aid investment in manufacturing equipment. It has been
careful to avoid public forecasts of gloom that might become self-fulfilling
prophecies as customers become wary of placing orders. Now it feels it has
nothing to lose by portraying things as they are.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Legal pressure on pit closures raised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE unions moved yesterday to build on public opposition to the pit
closures by preparing further legal action against British Coal and planning
protest demonstrations throughout the country.
The Trades Union Congress had its request for a meeting with Mr John Major
turned down, but the prime minister instead offered a meeting with Mr
Michael Heseltine to discuss pit closures and the wider employment
situation.
Lawyers representing the National Union of Mineworkers and the Nacods pit
supervisors' union said they would apply for an injunction against British
Coal unless senior management gave an undertaking by noon today confirming
that it would resume both production and development at all of the 10 pits
under immediate threat.
In a letter signed by the NUM's solicitors, Stephens Innocent, the union
states that the ceasing of production at the pits 'seriously prejudices and
indicates prejudgment in any consultative process'.
Lawyers argue that by ceasing production at seven of the 10 pits already and
allegedly putting pressure on miners to take redundancy, British Coal is
breaking an earlier undertaking given to the High Court.
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers has also threatened British Coal with an
injunction unless it gives a similar undertaking by noon today. The union
challenged the economics and legality of ceasing coal production in a
separate action begun at the end of last week.
Yesterday's legal moves came as TUC leaders in an emergency subcommittee
considered ways of capitalising on Sunday's mass rally in London against the
pit closures, which drew an estimated 200,000 protesters.
While the emphasis still seems to be on the economic case, some union
officials argued that the momentum of the campaign should not be lost. The
TUC is expected to organise a series of regional rallies in the coming weeks
to reinforce its role as a broadly based lobbying organisation.
British Coal said last night that hundreds of miners had agreed to take
voluntary redundancy but denied they had done so under pressure. It also
restated that nothing was being done to damage the fabric of the mines
irrevocably.

FT  27 OCT 92 / BNFL fights cancer test case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was accused in a civil lawsuit yesterday of causing or
contributing to the cancer that affected two children whose fathers worked
at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
The High Court test case, on which up to 40 other claims may depend,
includes allegations that nuclear radiation damaged the fathers' sperm or
the mothers' eggs and resulted in genetic injury.
BNFL is contesting the hearing, expected to last between six months and a
year.
In the first case, Mrs Elizabeth Reay of Hensingham, Cumbria, is claiming
damages over the death of her daughter Dorothy, aged 10 months, of leukaemia
in 1962. Subject to a final ruling on liability, her damages have been
agreed at Pounds 150,000. That includes compensation for loss of her
daughter and for anguish suffered by her and her husband George - a
Sellafield worker - who died of cancer in the 1980s.
The second claimant is Miss Vivien Hope, 27, who was successfully treated
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - re-lated to leukaemia - but was left parlty
disabled and infertile. Her father David also worked at the plant. Her
damages for personal injury have been agreed at Pounds 125,000.
The writs allege, among other things, that BNFL was in breach of its
statutory duty under the Nuclear Installations Act not to cause harm to
persons or property by radioactive emissions.
Mr Benet Hytner, counsel for Mrs Reay, said it was not necessary to prove
negligence against BNFL.
'The plaintiffs will succeed if they can prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that radiation from Sellafield was a material contributory
cause of the diseases contracted by Dorothy and Vivien,' said Mr Hytner.
BNFL denies any link between the levels of radioactivity at Sellafield -
formerly Windscale - and the incidences of childhood leukaemia.

A HEALTH authority in north-west England has told ancillary workers it will
not contract out their jobs if they agree to new skills-based contracts
outside the national pay and conditions system, Lisa Wood writes.
West Cumbria Health Authority, which received permission this month to
become a National Health Service trust, has told representatives of
domestics working in wards that it will not introduce competitive tendering
if they agree to competence-based national vocational qualifications.
Mr Ken Hutchinson, West Cumbria's personnel director, said: 'It sounds like
a bribe but it's not.' The authority would make the same offer to catering
staff whose contracts came up for renewal early next year.

FT  27 OCT 92 / BP Chemicals trims emissions at main plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE emissions from British Petroleum Chemicals' 10 largest plants fell
8 per cent from 171,000 tonnes to 158,000 tonnes last year.
The improvement consisted of a better environmental performance of 9,000
tonnes - equivalent to 5 per cent - and a reduction of 4,000 tonnes from
improved data collection and measurement.
The plants represented 80 per cent of BP Chemicals' production and 95 per
cent of its emissions. Figures for BP Oil and BP Explorations were not
given; nor were they given for individual sites.
The result was in spite of an rise in sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions to the air. Sulphur oxide emissions increased 11 per cent to
25,000 tonnes while nitrogen oxide rose 4 per cent to 12,137 tonnes.
Mr Mike LaGraff, manager for health, safety and the environment, said those
increases were because of higher production levels at a power plant located
in Baglan Bay, Wales.
Hydrocarbon emissions fell 16 per cent to 27,000 tonnes, which put the
company on target to reach its aim of halving them by 1997, Mr LaGraff said.
Water emissions remained static at 23,000 tonnes, although the group stayed
on target to cut those by two thirds by 1997. He said water treatment plants
would take time to build. Offsite disposal also fell 5.5 per cent.
The company said carbon dioxide emissions had fallen slightly, but it gave
no details.
Mr LaGraff said the figures would be published next year, together with data
on environmental running costs and expenditure on research and development.
Information on BP Chemicals' failure to comply with regulations would also
be provided.
The group is spending Pounds 100m a year on capital projects for
environmental protection over the next five years, although Mr LaGraff said
that towards 1997 expenditure might slow.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Shephard set to challenge employment spending plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, is to challenge the spending
proposals for her department put forward by the government's public
expenditure committee.
Mrs Shephard, who along with other ministers was summoned to appear before
the committee, is the first cabinet minister so far to disagree formally
with its recommendations.
The proposals will be considered by the cabinet this week for the first
time.
Other ministers who are likely to put their views to the cabinet are Mr
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.
The departmental budgets of all three are under particular pressure.
High-profile policies such as London Underground's possible Pounds 1.8bn
extension of the Jubilee Line and the introduction of the council tax next
year are likely to be subjects on which other senior ministers will want to
express views.
The largest part of the Department of Employment's budget is spending on
Youth Training and the adult long-term unemployed.
Training and Enterprise Councils are also playing a leading role in
co-ordinating the counselling and retraining of miners.
The cabinet is likely to have at least one other discussion of the spending
plans before Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announces the decisions of
his committee in the Autumn Statement on November 12.
As the cabinet agreed in July to stick to the Pounds 244.5bn planned level
of public spending for 1993-94, the discussions will be about the
distribution of government spending within that total rather than any rise

FT  27 OCT 92 / Graduate pay rise slowdown reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARTING salaries for this year's graduates rose by 4.6 per cent compared
with last year - the lowest rise since 1979, a survey says.
The average salary for new graduates in the nine months from November last
year to July this year was Pounds 12,397.
The salary survey, conducted by the Central Services Unit, the graduate
employment service, is based on 895 advertised vacancies in 18 issues of
Current Vacancies, the organisations' fortnightly journal, which goes to all
student careers services.
Average pay for graduates working in the public sector has risen far less
than the overall average, dragged down by salaries in local government,
education and health authorities - where graduates all learn less than
Pounds 11,350.
Engineering graduates registered above average, with salaries of Pounds
13,048, while science graduates were slightly below average at Pounds
12,214. Graduates working in management consultancy enjoy the highest
average salary at Pounds 16,352, while those in recruitment agencies do
worst on Pounds 10,000.

FT  27 OCT 92 / DTI plans business advice network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will next month announce a radical shake-up ofbusiness
support when it announces details of a planned network of 'one-stop shops'
to provide advice and counselling to businesses.
The advice centres are intended to lead to a streamlining of the range of
existing networks - which many people running small businesses find
confusing - and improve business support.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, plans a network of 200
centres around the country. He will ask the 82 Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales to co-ordinate bids from local
groupings composed of chambers of commerce, local-authority economic
development units, enterprise agencies and others to run between 10 and 15
pilot schemes.
The final deadline for bids is expected to be January and the centres will
begin operations in April. The centres will be set up in business parks or
on the premises of organisations such as the chambers. One of the names
being considered for the new centres is Business Point.
They will employ counsellors to provide detailed advice to businesses, but
their main task will be to help existing small and medium-sized businesses
to grow.
The counsellors will be trained to a high standard and the centres will be
expected to obtain accreditation to the BS5750 quality standard.
The Department of Trade and Industry said the aim was to create a
business-support network equal to or better than that provided by
continental European chambers.
UK chambers are concerned that centres offering free or very cheap advice
would undercut their services, while Tecs want to develop existing
partnerships rather than have a uniform format imposed.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Bankers voice fears on insider dealing reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bankers expressed concern yesterday that planned legislation to
prevent insider dealing and money laundering might place unreasonable
restrictions on staff in commercial banks.
The British Bankers Association said it was worried that measures in the
Criminal Justice Bill might expose senior managers with responsibilities for
different functions within commercial banks to the risk of acting in breach
of the law.
The association is concerned that when a bank is involved in restructuring a
troubled company, managers with overall responsibility for both banking and
securities may learn things that will be counted as inside information.
Lord Inchyra, association director-general, said banks were also concerned
at the potential effect of making junior staff legally responsible for
reporting unusual money transactions that might indicate money laundering.
The association feared that staff might be placed under a statutory
obligation to report cases of potential money laundering when they did not
know enough about the transactions to make an informed judgment about their
significance.
The Treasury has already attempted to deal with City concern over the bill
by re-drafting it, and issuing guidance notes on the interpretation of the
law.
Lord Inchyra said the presumption of confidentiality was 'an essential
feature' of banking. The circumstances in which it was breached should be
'tightly circumscribed'.
The association is examining the published bill and guidance notes and may
try to get amendments tabled in the House of Lords. The bill was introduced
in the Lords on Friday. It will bring the law into harmony with European
Community directives.

FT  27 OCT 92 / DTI effort wins more EC funds for software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of UK projects that have won funding from the European Community
increased strongly this year after a Department of Trade and Industry
initiative on R&amp;D in computer integrated software, Michiyo Nakamoto writes.
The success of projects involving UK groups in winning EC funding highlights
the significant difference government backing can make in the growth of an
industry.
Out of 235 proposals that were submitted to the EC's European Strategic
Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology (Esprit)
III programme on computer integrated manufacture and engineering (Cime), 14
projects led by UK organisations and 33 projects involving UK participants
were awarded funds by the programme. The total amount of funds awarded to
all UK participants was Ecu20m, or about 12 per cent of the total Ecu157.5m
available.
That represents a large increase over the five UK-led projects and 21
projects involving the UK that won funds from Esprit II in 1990.
The UK's greater success in winning Esprit funds came after the DTI
appointed PA Consulting Group to improve the number of successful
submissions from the UK to the Cime section of Esprit.
The UK has a lot of expertise in Cime but has not actively sought EC
funding, said Dr David Howard at PA Consulting. 'The DTI recognised this and
recognised the importance of Cime to UK industry.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / Lloyd's Names launch fresh legal challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S came under new legal pressure yesterday when five Names lodged a
complaint alleging breaches of European competition rules by the insurance
market in a move that might threaten the insurance market's ability to meet
claims.
A 100-page complaint about an alleged failure of self-regulation was lodged
with the European Community. It argues that Lloyd's immunity from suit or
judicial scrutiny runs contrary to the principles required by the EC treaty
of redress to a national court. It details arguments under articles 85 and
86 of the Treaty of Rome.
The five Names behind the action are pressing the EC to prevent Lloyd's
drawing down from their deposits pending a full investigation of their
complaint. The Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the
market - are members of the 172-strong Lloyd's Deposit Defence Group.
Lloyd's said yesterday that it took the action 'as seriously as any action
affecting the market's underlying security'.
Solicitors SJ Berwin, representing the Names, said they were not 'aiming to
harm the Lloyd's market'. However, one solicitor active in the litigation
that has dogged the market's fortunes for over two years, said that the
challenge was 'fairly fundamental'.
In its complaint, the group says Lloyd's immunity from suit or judicial
scrutiny runs contrary to the principles required by the EC treaty of
redress to a national court.
Mr Richard Platts, one of the Names backing the action, said: 'Lloyd's is
out of line. No other commercial body in Europe has similar immunity.'
The Names allege that Lloyd's has failed to supervise the market adequately
or ensure proper working practices. It questions the absence of solvency
rules for syndicates.
The complaint also alleges a conflict of interest between working Names  -
who have jobs with Lloyd's brokers or agents - and outside Names. It says
working Names are given the opportunity to participate in better syndicates.
If successful, the move to prevent drawdowns of the funds, which all Names
must deposit with Lloyd's or their agents when they join the market, may
threaten Lloyd's ability to meet insurance claims and might also lead to a
re-emergence of the liquidity shortages that threatened the market earlier
this year.
In April, Lloyd's defeated efforts by 820 Names to prevent payment of
drawdowns when the High Court ruled that cash calls against Names must go
ahead.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Ferry operators accused of pricing collusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-CHANNEL ferry operators have been accused by British hauliers of
colluding to profit from sterling's devaluation by imposing big currency
surcharges on cross-Channel freight tariffs.
The Freight Transport Association, a trade body representing freight
carriers, yesterday said it would almost certainly lodge complaints with the
Office of Fair Trading and the EC competition directorate if the surcharges
were not withdrawn.
Within the past few days, all three of the biggest cross-Channel ferry
operators - P&amp;O European Ferries, Sealink Stena Line and Brittany Ferries -
have announced freight surcharges for British carriers.
In letters to hauliers, the ferry companies have said the surcharges are
necessary because the value of sterling receipts has fallen relative to
costs incurred in foreign currencies.
From November 1, they plan to introduce a sliding scale of surcharges for
customers paying in sterling, varying from week to week according to the
exchange rate. At sterling's present level, the surcharge would be about 10
per cent.
British carriers say there is no justification for surcharges because at
least half the ferry operators' income comes from Continental carriers in
foreign currencies. That means their currency gains are at least equal to
their losses.
The carriers are also accusing the operators of collusion on the grounds
that the rates of the surcharges, where comparable, are identical; that they
all come into operation on the same date; and that the letters to the
hauliers are similarly worded.
Collusion between cross-Channel ferry operators is forbidden after the UK
government's refusal of repeated requests for permission to co-operate on
services and fares.
All three ferry operators yesterday denied acting together. Sealink said its
move had come first, while the other operators said they had followed suit
because they regarded the surcharges as justified.
The Road Haulage Association, representing hauliers, said it would lobby
minsters over the surcharges.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour's relaxed soft-shoe shuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS, as one shadow cabinet member put it yesterday, a soft-shoe shuffle.
But there can be little doubt as to the direction Labour is moving and that
is away from any action, however passive, that would help the Conservatives
in the ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Up until even the beginning of September, the obstructionist case was
largely a matter of parliamentary tactics. But Black Wednesday, turmoil in
the economy and, finally, the pit closures row has left Labour's
backbenchers baying for Tory blood.
The party leadership, though overwhelmingly pro-Maastricht as the best
treaty currently available, is well aware that it cannot ignore the mood.
Add to that the now widely held (if yet to be revoked) impression that the
prime minister is risking either a general election or his own head, and
even fiercely Europhile Labour MPs acknowledge that they must vote against
next Wednesday's 'paving' motion, whatever its wording.
For that reason, Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, was
speaking with the full backing of his colleagues yesterday morning when he
signalled that the opposition would oppose the resolution.
His ground for opposition - the need for Denmark to clarify its position
prior to a resumption of the ratification procedure in the Commons - is, in
fact, consistent with what Labour said shortly after the Danish referendum.
There is no doubt, though, that this is little more than a pretext -
somewhat thin camouflage - for Labour's twin goals: to maximise the
discomfiture of the government and to keep the party united.
As far back as May on the second reading of the bill, 61 MPs defied the
whips and voted against. After the Danish No vote in June, even that
passionate pro-European, Mr Roy Hattersley, felt obliged to give notice that
Labour might let the treaty through only if the government reversed its
opposition to the social chapter of workplace rights.
Yet the leadership is also acutely aware of the danger to its reputation in
Europe if it were to prove instrumental in killing the treaty. Its long game
has always been to abstain or, alternatively, allow a free vote on the
definitive third reading, thereby ensuring that the treaty goes through.
That may prove increasingly difficult, given the mounting resistance to any
compromise among Labour MPs.
Mr Giles Radice, one of the most prominent Labour Europhiles, has repeatedly
insisted that the party must be consistent to its pre-election position by
not blocking the bill at the crucial third reading.
Yesterday, however, he agreed that the context in which Downing Street has
cast the paving debate implies that it will amount to a vote of confidence
in Mr Major. 'They (the government) are so incompetent, they are making it
impossible for someone like me to support them,' he said.
A final decision on Labour's course of action will not be completely clear
until next Monday.
Given the government's recent propensity for U-turns, it is possible that
something might occur before then which could cause a change of heart.
But all the signs are that Labour is unlikely to reverse its stance. A
senior party official pointed out yesterday that even if the government
backtracks by turning the debate into a motion on the adjournment - a
technical device that avoids the need for a substantive text - Labour will
still feel obliged to treat it as a confidence vote.
'This is nothing to do with Maastricht or the EC,' he said. 'The debate was
never necessary. The government could simply have gone to the committee
stage. The prime minister has moved the goalposts and we can only assume
that he is treating it as a confidence issue.'
A shadow cabinet member agreed. 'The government have painted themselves into
a corner. If the prime minister loses he will be personally very, very
damaged,' he said. 'John Smith and Jack Cunningham are both lifelong
Europeans, but they are very relaxed about voting against.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure cooking in the Downing
Street kitchen / A look at the prime minister's main advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURVEYING the increasingly troubled predicament of his colleagues at 10
Downing Street, one cabinet minister's political aide mused yesterday: 'A
kitchen cabinet? It doesn't really exist in terms of chums kicking around
Number 10.'
There is no one list of chosen few whom Mr John Major would automatically
consult at times of crises. Unlike former prime minister Mrs Margaret
Thatcher's reliance on Mr Cecil Parkinson and Mr Norman Tebbit, or Mr Harold
Wilson's chummyness with Mr Joe Haines and Lady Falkender, there is no
coterie of like-minded friends to whom he will instinctively turn.
Rather - whether dealing with the collapse of sterling, Tory revolts over
pit closures, or tactics to thwart the Euro-sceptics - there are overlapping
and constantly evolving groups of political allies, ministerial colleagues,
personal friends and supposedly experienced hands.
It is a system that gives the impression of a prime minister willing to
consult widely. Some angry right-wing MPs, protesting at the handling of
Maastricht, have not known at whom to vent their ire, while others vaguely
target 'his advisers'.
But, as the traumatic political storms of the last few weeks have proved,
communications are prone to break down, early warning signals of trouble
ahead have not been sent.
Over the summer, Mr Major has lost immediate contact with Mr Chris Patten,
who became a close friend during his chairmanship of the Conservative party
but left to become governor of Hong Kong after the election. The two still
talk regularly, but Mr Patten's own difficulties with China and the time
difference mean conversations can, at best, be limited in scope. Mr David
Mellor, a former cabinet minister and another confidant, was forced to
resign.
Inside today's cabinet, an inner circle has begun to take a higher profile.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, were central to decisions
over the European exchange rate mechanism. But Mr Heseltine is scarcely a
political ally and his reputation for presentational finesse has been
damaged by the pit closures.
Mr Hurd has an avuncular role. His relationship with Mr Major is warm but he
is frequently out of the country.
Within parliament, more weight has been placed on Mr Richard Ryder, the
low-profile but tough-minded chief whip, responsible for cajoling - or often
bawling out - recalcitrant Tory MPs.
The experience of Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, in offering nimble
solutions to political difficulties is valued by the prime minister even if
he is associated politically with Lady Thatcher's style and politics. Sir
Norman Fowler has become a close personal friend, borne of hours together
during the election.
If Mr Major is looking for allies who will reflect his own thinking, he is
more likely to consult inside Downing Street. Mrs Sarah Hogg, a former
journalist and head of the policy unit, is a strong influence - particularly
on the ERM issue.
Mr Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary, is expert at
enunciating Mr Major's thinking to an increasingly sceptical press.
Another personal friend who maybe cheers the prime minister at difficult
times is the novelist Lord Archer. He is close to the prime minister but
perhaps not able to offer the most expert advice. 'Perhaps he is testing out
a new plot for a novel,' quipped one Tory MP.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Press adds to confusion as PM walks
treaty tightrope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS IF Mr John Major did not have enough troubles. Engulfed by unrest over
the economy and Europe, the prime minister found himself caught yesterday in
yet another crisis - this time over a fumbled attempt at news management.
The rash of reports that Mr Major was ready to call a general election if he
was defeated over the Maastricht treaty left his party, ministers and the
Whitehall information machine engaged in a desperate but
less-than-successful exercise in damage limitation.
Amid confusion and dismay even among pro-Maastricht Tory MPs, the exercise
left unanswered who in the government and why had decided to raise the
stakes so dramatically in the Conservatives' private war over Europe.
At the heart of the row were weekend press reports that Mr Major would
respond to a defeat during the Maastricht 'paving' debate on November 4 by
calling a general election. The debate is designed to allow the government
to bring back next month the legislation to ratify the treaty.
No one at Westminster doubts that the prime minister feels strongly about
the issue. He believes passionately that if the government and the
Conservative party were to turn their back now on the treaty, Britain would
be marginalised within the European Community. Mr Major has signalled more
than once that he would not want to lead the Tories in such circumstances.
But suggestions that a defeat on the timing rather than the substance of
ratification would send him hotfoot to Buckingham Palace to ask for the
dissolution of parliament were received by cabinet colleagues with
open-mouthed surprise.
The reports simultaneously outraged Conservative Euro-sceptics and persuaded
the Labour leadership that it had found an excuse to abandon its European
credentials to vote against the government.
The story first surfaced in reports from journalists accompanying Mr Major's
weekend trip to Egypt. It is common knowledge at Westminster that prime
ministers use such trips for informal briefing of the accompanying press
corps.
So when Sunday's front pages carried identical headlines about the election
threat, cabinet ministers were among those who drew the conclusion that Mr
Major was the source.
The prime minister reinforced that view by insisting during on-the-record
interviews that others could draw their own conclusions from his strong
support for the treaty. He seemed perfectly happy that Tory MPs would deduce
he was threatening them with a Labour government.
But as ministers and Tory MPs yesterday expressed horror at what one called
a threat of 'mass hara-kiri' another version of events was circulating at
Westminster - pointing to cock-up rather than conspiracy.
Some ministers were suggesting that Mr Major's officials - and in particular
Mr Gus O'Donnell, his press secretary - had stretched too far the logic of a
deal agreed at last week's cabinet meeting.
At that meeting, the cabinet agreed that the government needed to
demonstrate to its European partners that it was serious about ratifying the
treaty by bringing the legislation back to the House of Commons before the
Edinburgh summit in December. All signed up to the idea of a substantial
motion to that effect on November 4.
The suspicion was that Mr Major's officials had taken the accord a step
further by suggesting that the defeat in the Commons of such a decision
would lead to a general election.
The trouble is that it was impossible yesterday to find a Tory MP or
minister willing to agree with that logic. For its part, Downing Street
retreated into the argument that Mr Major was confident of winning on
November 4 so the issue did not arise. But officials refused pointblank to
withdraw the threat.
It may well turn out that Mr Major has judged the mood correctly and that
enough Tory MPs will be cowed to give him a majority, even against the
combination of Labour and the Euro-sceptics. But he has raised the stakes
dangerously and the judgment of his peers yesterday was that if the vote is
lost, the prime minister will be also.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs caution Major over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIGHTWING 92 group of MPs yesterday warned the party leadership to step
back from a confrontation with Tory MPs over Maastricht that could put Mr
John Major's leadership at risk and condemn the party to months of civil
war.
Senior members of the group said that the prime minister's best way 'off the
hook' was to avoid a substantive motion on the treaty and instead either
allow a free vote or table an adjournment motion - a technical device that
would muddy the waters.
An overwhelming majority of the 60-odd MPs attending the meeting argued for
indefinite postponement of ratification of the treaty at least until Denmark
had clarified its position.
In a clear warning shot to Downing Street, the group insisted that the
cabinet was out of touch with grassroots opinion in the party. Some 21 of
the 30 MPs who spoke made clear they opposed the government's decision to
press ahead with the treaty.
The meeting, called for yesterday evening to discuss the state of the party,
was arranged even before the latest difficulties over Europe and the
government's climbdown over the pit closure programme. Its conclusions were
relayed to Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip.
Sir George Gardiner, the veteran Thatcherite who leads the group, said
yesterday that Mr John Major should be wary of those among his colleagues
who were advising him to put his job as prime minister at stake over Europe.
Although Mr Major raised the stakes at the weekend, Euro-rebels remained
determined in their opposition, and their tone is unabashed.
The group of Euro-sceptics based on those who organised a motion calling for
a fresh start in the government's European policy after the Danish
referendum is planning to meet tomorrow to discuss tactics for next week.
One leading Euro-sceptic estimated there would be 40 to 50 'hard core'
rebels, even if some of those who signed the motion before the summer are
brought back into line.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister, is holding a series of
meetings with dissidents to try to answer their doubts. Some potential
rebels have already concluded that they can support the government because
their concerns about European economic and monetary union have been allayed
by its seeming such a distant prospect.
All groups at Westminster are now waiting to see the final form of the
motion.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd gives warning on Maastricht
Bill timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD yesterday underlined the government's determination to press
ahead quickly with detailed parliamentary consideration of the Maastricht
Bill, warning that any delay would increase the impression that the UK was
trying to 'wreck' the treaty.
Addressing MPs on the all-party European legislation select committee, the
foreign secretary said there were 'very strong arguments' for beginning the
committee stage of the bill before the Edinburgh summit of the European
Community in December.
That was because there were 'very strong arguments against this country
wrecking or giving the impression of wrecking a treaty which we entered into
in good faith'. That impression would 'grow', he suggested, the longer that
parliamentary consideration was delayed.
Mr Hurd refused to be drawn on Mr John Major's apparent weekend ultimatum
that he would call an early general election if he lost the debate next week
to pave the way for the return of the Maastricht bill.
'I am not going to add to speculation on what might happen if the government
were defeated on this issue,' Mr Hurd said. He left no room for doubt,
though, over the importance the government attached to the bill, saying it
was 'a central part of the government's programme and will be presented as
such'.
He described the Maastricht treaty as 'the only possible agreed framework'
under which the UK and its EC partners could pursue their objectives over
the next few years.
On the hurdle of Danish ratification, Mr Hurd said Britain would do what it
could up to and during the Edinburgh summit to provide a 'rough framework'
of additions and clarifications that - while not amending the text of the
treaty - would enable Denmark to move ahead.
Pointing out that Denmark was next to hold the EC presidency, he said it
would be 'absurd' for the country to be invalidated from taking office, as
some had suggested.
In response to a series of questions on subsidiarity, Mr Hurd claimed that
the views of those - like Britain - who were arguing against inexorable
centralisation were beginning to hold sway.
'The weather has changed,' he said. 'The type of Europe we have been arguing
for is now seen by people way beyond these shores as the right one; we must
take advantage of that.'
His comments appeared not to convince committee members such as Mr Tony
Marlow, Tory MP for Northampton North, who has emerged as a prominent critic
of the treaty. 'Dr Goebbels would have been proud of the government's
assertion that this is a de-centralising treaty,' Mr Marlow said.
In a separate speech last night, Mr Hurd reiterated his belief that the
decentralists were winning. Under Maastricht, joint European action would be
'the result of co-operation between governments, with the Commission present
but not dominant'.
The council of ministers was 'close to agreeing new procedures to check
legislation against the subsidiarity template', he said.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: John Major in crisis - The people
he turns to
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GUS O'DONNELL, 40, the prime minster's press secretary.  Injects advice
on policy presentation and news management.  Worked with Mr Major when he
was Chancellor.  Sees prime minster daily but has faced increasing
difficulties in justifying 'U turns' and apparent ministerial indecision.
LORD ARCHER, 52, Novelist and former deputy Conservative party chairman. Is
a personal friend of Mr Major but not a political heavyweight.  Can be over
gung-ho, without the political sensitivities of a former or current
government minister.  Takes prominent role in acting as cheerleader for
Conservative party.
MR CHRIS PATTEN, 47, governor of Hong Kong.  Once a daily confidant, close
friend and reliable political adviser.  Is regarded as a safe and
experienced pair of hands but now on other side of world and contactable
only by telephone.  This has not stopped the conversations continuing.
SIR NORMAN FOWLER, 54, party chairman.  Worked as minder for Mr Major during
the general election where he struck up a personal rapport.  Has eschewed
ministerial responsibilities so as to concentrate on strengthening Tory
campaigning efforts.  Sees the prime minister at least once a week.
MR DOUGLAS HURD, 62, foreign secretary.  Contested the Conservative party
leadership at the same time as Mr Major but now takes the role of an elder
statesman within the cabinet.  Is cautious and respected for his political
judgment.  But his work often means he is far from Westminster.
MRS SARAH HOGG, 46, head of Number 10 policy unit.  Regarded as a powerful
force withing Downing Stree but subject to increasing attacks from Tory
critics for lacking a sufficiently acute political nose that is able to
judge what will be possible in Westminster, as opposed to Whitehall.
LORD WAKEHAM, 60, leader of the Lords.  Supposed to be Mr Fix-it - a role he
developed during the last years of Lady Thatcher's reign.  Has experience as
former leader of the Commons and energy spokesman.  Is not a close political
ally of Mr Major but is trusted enough to be included on the cabinet public
spending committee.
MR RICHARD RYDER, 43, chief whip.  Has responsibility for controlling Tory
MPs and reporting on strength of feeling in Westminster.  Suffered from the
lack of contact with Conservatives over the long summer recess. Worked
frantically hard to save government over coal pit closures.

FT  27 OCT 92 / HK nervous as Chinese stick to tough line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S influential financial community has reacted nervously to the war
of words between China's rulers and Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor,
about his plans for Hong Kong's political development.
Share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange ended sharply lower yesterday,
with the Hang Seng Index closing 200.07 points, or 3.19 per cent, down at
6,062.47. The fall reversed much of the gains made during the past two
weeks.
Prices regained some ground in initial trading early today, however, as
bargain hunting helped lifted the index 73.97 points to 6,136.44 in the
first 20 minutes of trade.
Mr Patten's plans for greater democracy, which were unveiled on October 7,
have so far gained widespread public support. But there was evidence
yesterday that the financial community was either opposed to his plans or
felt they had little chance of success in the face of concerted opposition
from Beijing.
One senior merchant banker said: 'He has not been here long enough to
understand the nuances in Hong Kong. I think the governor has painted
himself into a corner and is overestimating public opinion.'
China has said it will reverse any changes Mr Patten makes to Hong Kong's
political structure if he fails to agree them first with Beijing.
It has also put an effective halt to the colony's plans to build a
multi-billion dollar airport and related projects by threatening to renege
on loans raised which span 1997 and to dishonour contracts.
Mr Anthony Belligan, of Peregrine Securities, said: 'Mr Patten has to make
up his mind whether he wants to go for more democracy at the expense of the
airport. I think the financial community would rather see bricks and mortar
rather than promises about political development which might be changed in
the future.'
Investor confidence is one of the most fragile qualities in Hong Kong and
has, in the past, been temporarily shattered by rows between London and
Beijing.
Maintenance of confidence is crucial to the success of Mr Patten's plans.
Many analysts also doubted whether Mr Patten could retain public support if
the economic outlook became clouded. Analysts said that if Hong Kong's
people faced the choice of more democracy and an uncertain future, or less
democracy but the ability to make money they would chose the latter.
'This is definitely the end game being played out now,' said one head of
research at a local brokerage.
'China wants to emasculate Mr Patten. In a way, it is a compliment to the
amount of public support he has been able to amass.'
China's hardline position was reinforced yesterday by Premier Li Peng, who
repeated Beijing's opposition to Mr Patten's plans. Li, in a meeting with a
British trade delegation, threw his own political weight behind the Chinese
threats.
During Mr Patten's visit last week, no meeting was arranged with Li,
effectively a sharp diplomatic snub.
An aide to the governor said last night that Mr Patten intended to push
ahead with his proposals. In the absence of any credible alternatives from
China the proposals would be put to the local legislature in the New Year.

FT  27 OCT 92 / LDP wriggles on the hook of political reform: Robert Thomson
meets a Japanese opposition MP who does not want to be a politician like the
others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM atop a truck in Tokyo's more fashionable shopping districts, Ms Yuriko
Koike has been damning with lavish praise the disgraced godfather of
Japanese politics, Mr Shin Kanemaru, whom she lauds for 'valuable
contributions' to reform of a scandal-tainted political system.
Ms Koike, a TV commentator turned politician, is the star of the Japan New
party, formed before a recent upper house election and rewarded with four
seats for its middle-of-the-road opposition to excesses of the ruling
Liberal Democratic party (LDP).
The resignation of Mr Kanemaru and the factional farce over the selection of
a successor have provided Ms Koike with an attentive audience for her
homegoroshi, or praising to death. She has praised the godfather for
generosity in distributing an illegal Y500m (Pounds 2.42m) donation to 60
LDP colleagues and thanked him profusely for stirring enough public anger to
put political reform back on the agenda.
'It is all a rather cheap drama. The longer the faction fight goes on, the
more ridiculous it seems. It reminds me of a sinking boat on which the
passengers and crew are arguing over who should be the next captain,' Ms
Koike explained, in between mouthfuls of noodles in the parliamentarians'
canteen.
Faction-fighting continued yesterday, as supporters of Mr Keizo Obuchi,
chosen to replace Mr Kanemaru at the helm of the LDP's largest faction,
continued a whisper campaign aimed at undermining the authority of his
opponent, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who still has the support of a majority of the
faction's members.
The inability of the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic party
of Japan, to score political points has allowed the Japan New party to lift
its profile by tapping into popular discontent with the apparently
unchanging ways of the ruling party and its five fractious factions.
As a recently elected parliamentarian, Ms Koike is still enthusiastically
pushing at the apparently immovable Japanese political hierarchy. But she
does not have much faith in the LDP's public embrace of 'political reform',
which surfaces each time the party faces one of its periodic crises.
'I am very pessimistic. We are the lawmakers, but look at the laws we have
made,' she said referring to the meagre Y200,000 fine imposed on Mr Kanemaru
for illegally receiving Y500m. 'It's easy to say we should have a
redistribution of seats, and then argue over an increase of four seats here
and a decrease of four seats there, but this is a technical thing and has
nothing to do with the philosophy.'
If Japanese politics were run by Koike rules, the first change would be made
to parliamentary debate. She complains there is 'no debate' in Japanese
politics, and that opposition parties are restricted because they can only
ask pre-arranged questions and not outline policy alternatives. She said.'
Parliament should be a place of debate, but now it is like kabuki (the
Japanese traditional theatre). Sometimes a minister will say, 'Oh, this
question is too important for me to answer, I'll ask the bureaucrat to
speak.' It is a farce.'
Her own public performances are coloured by a feeling for the theatrical, a
sense acquired during 14 years of television work. As anchor-person at a
popular current affairs programme called 'World Business Satellite,' Ms
Koike, 40, was frequently profiled in the Japanese press as the thoroughly
modern woman, trilingual and single.
She speaks English and Arabic, a skill which got her noticed after an
interview with Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation
leader, in which she did her own live-to-air interpreting. Her father, an
oil man, worked in the Middle East and she stayed on to complete a degree in
sociology at Cairo University and to write 'Climbing the Pyramids in a
kimono', an account of her experiences.
'I remember in the early 1970s at the time of the first oil shock that the
Japanese politicians who came to the Middle East had no understanding of the
politics in the region. For 20 years I had seen the same problem, and I
decided to do something about it, to use my profile to create momentum for
change.'
Ms Koike is not exactly sure how the electoral system should be changed. Her
recently born party is still drafting a proposal but she is certain that the
present system does not properly represent the aspirations of Japanese
voters.
On political funding, her policy is already decided. The present limit on
corporate donations to individual politician is Y1.5m, which she wants
reduced to Y100,000, while transgressors would be subject to a maximum
penalty of Y3m and a jail sentence.
'It is best to send violators to jail. We also have to make the system more
transparent. Politicians have so many support groups and study groups, so
many pockets, that it is difficult to know where all the money is going. We
should limit the number of pockets, two pockets per politician.'
Ms Koike likes standing atop trucks praising her political opponents but she
does not intend to stay on beyond her present six-year term: 'I don't really
want to be a politician like the others. I am interested in changing the
system, not in becoming a part of it.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S cabinet has set up a watchdog agency headed by Zhu Rongji, who is in
charge of economic policy, to monitor the country's growth in securities
business, according to the official media, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The cabinet will oversee another new group, the China Securities Supervision
and Administration Committee, in setting day-to-day policy for the
securities industry.
Zhu, appointed to the Standing Committee of the Communist party's politburo
this month, laid the groundwork for the Shanghai stock market as the city's
mayor in the mid-1980s.
The Supervision and Administration Committee will be chaired by Liu Hongru,
a former central bank vice-president and now vice-minister of the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy.
The dual committees are the final piece in Beijing's plan to spread its
experiment with financial markets across the country. Three new
state-controlled brokerages are operational and a national system for
securities trading is taking shape.
'(The government) is making great efforts to be a fair judge and will unify
and co-ordinate related policies concerning shares and state treasury bonds
to protect the interest of the broad masses of investors,' the Xinhua news
agency said.
Since China officially established its two stock markets in Shanghai and
Shenzhen in 1990, securities policy has been handled by the People's Bank of
China, the central bank.
A lack of coherent policy and poor supervision became apparent last August,
when a botched issue of share application forms provoked rioting in
Shenzhen. The riots, fanned by allegations of official corruption and
insider dealing, shook planners in Beijing and raised the threat of wider
social unrest.
The official securities watchdog joins the three newly-established national
securities companies as part of Beijing's strategy for keeping control over
the markets.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Britain attacks World Bank over Indian project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank's handling of the Sardar Sarovar project in India's Narmada
valley has raised questions about its commitment to public accountability,
the British government said yesterday.
In an unusual public criticism of the bank's management, the Overseas
Development Administration said normal processes for monitoring
implementation of projects had failed. It hoped it would not be necessary
again to commission an independent review of a bank-funded project.
Following a report by Mr Bradford Morse, a former administrator of the
United Nations Development Programme, and Mr Thomas Berger, a former
Canadian Supreme Court judge, the World Bank's executive board decided on
Friday to continue funding the project, subject to a rigorous performance
review next April.
The board had considered whether to halt financing. However, Mr David
Peretz, UK executive director of the bank, said that since India intended to
proceed with or without support, continued Bank involvement offered the best
hope for rescuing the project.
Mr Peretz said the Morse report was a serious indictment of the Indian
authorities and the Bank's management. The Bank's own guidelines on
resettlement were repeatedly ignored; timetables for environmental impact
assessments had not been met; compliance with legal covenants was lax; there
was no effective consultation with those affected.
Mr Peretz told the board: 'The pattern of inadequate supervision and
enforcement fits in with concerns we have expressed for some time about the
Bank's capacity to monitor large or complex projects.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / Extremists' knife enters near Egypt's heart: The threat to
tourism from the recent attacks on foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH Mr Fouad Sultan, Egypt's tourism minister, boasted that the
country had 'the least terrorism of all the countries of the world. . . .'
and that 'everything is under control'.
Mr Sultan, regarded as one of the better performers of a generally
lacklustre Egyptian administration, could be excused for wondering whether
he might not have erred by tempting fate.
A sudden rash of Islamic extremist violence against tourists is endangering
the country's multi-billion dollar tourism industry at a time when it was
achieving spectacular growth rates and new investment was pouring into the
sector.
The slaying last Wednesday of a British tourist south of Cairo and the
stabbings at the weekend of Russian visitors to Port Said at the entrance to
the Suez Canal have cast a pall over an industry that had been reaping
tremendous rewards since the end of the Gulf war.
Together with concern engendered by the Cairo earthquake which killed up to
600 people (none of them tourists) these latest incidents have drawn
unwelcome attention to the possible dangers of Third World travel,
especially in a country where Islamic extremism is on the rise.
Tour operators and large hotels contacted in Cairo yesterday said they were
experiencing cancellations among both individuals and, more worryingly, tour
groups - the lifeblood of the industry.
The Cairo Marriott said that tour operators were reporting that group
numbers would be down by as much as 20 per cent. Italian groups - tourism
from Italy has been booming - were prominent among those notifying
cancellations.
Foreign embassies in Cairo, sensitive to the importance of tourism to the
hard-pressed Egyptian economy, have been guarded in their comments on
dangers to visitors, but most western missions have felt obliged, in
response to inquiries, to point out the risks
In London, Thomson, the UK's biggest travel company, said it saw no reason
at the moment to be concerned about future bookings or the safety of its 700
customers currently in Egypt.
The company, which takes 25,000 tourists to Egypt annually, said: 'These are
isolated incidents, just as there was another bombing in London on Sunday
night.' Thomson said it had had 'one or two' cancellations.
Kuoni Travel, which carries 15,000 UK tourists to Egypt a year, said it had
one cancellation last Friday.
Mr Martin Thompson, managing director of Abercrombie &amp; Kent Travel, an
upmarket operator, said: 'We believe that people should not go off the
beaten track in Egypt.' The company, which takes 11,000 tourists to Egypt
each year from the UK, the US and Australia, said: 'We're keeping our ears
close to the ground both here and in Cairo. But nobody in London has
cancelled so far.'
However, Egyptian tour operators fear a return of the gloomy Gulf war period
and its aftermath during which Nile ferries sailed empty and hotel occupancy
rates plummeted.
With investment of more than USDollars 1bn planned for an industry which is
Egypt's biggest foreign currency earner, apart from workers' remittances,
the stakes are high. A million Egyptians are estimated to derive their
livelihood either directly or indirectly from the tourism sector, which
contributes 6 per cent of gross domestic product.
Barring accidents, Mr Sultan had predicted that numbers of visitors would
grow to 5m annually by financial year 1994/95. This would represent a 400
per cent increase in tourist numbers in a decade, and there remains scope
for further growth.
Hotel room capacity in Egypt has more than doubled since 1985 to 53,000,
barely keeping pace with demand. Another 14,000 are under construction and
there are plans for more.
Businessmen with projects already under way are unlikely to be deflected by
the recent troubles, but those planning to make commitments may pause; for
whatever officials might say about internal stability, there is increasing
concern about a surge in fundamentalist violence amid growing signs of
disaffection with the established order.
Unless, the authorities can find a way to neutralise Islamic militants,
prospects are for more rather than less trouble. Ominously, extremists under
the umbrella of al-gama'a al-Islamiya (literally, Islamic groups) appear to
have decided to target visitors as a means of undermining the government's
authority.
Anonymous spokesmen have, since August, been threatening to strike at
tourists and tourist installations. That they have now made good their
threats suggests that a rudimentary network exists to carry out pin-prick
attacks. The militants may have found the government's Achilles heel.

   MADRID, KUWAIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAITI government yesterday ordered the country's prosecutor general to
open an investigation into the management of some Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.35bn) invested in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) since the
mid-eighties.
Mr Nasser Abdulla al-Rodhan, the Kuwaiti finance minister, told the official
KUNA news agency the probe had been ordered after the KIO's new management
in London had detected 'improprieties' in the handling of Kuwaiti funds in
Spain.
The new KIO management has accused its predecessors of having invested
recklessly in Spain. Two big affiliates, the Ercros chemicals business and
the Prima property group, are close to total collapse.
The KIO's investments in Spain became one of the main issues in elections in
Kuwait earlier this month. In June, the Kuwaiti government asked the KIO's
auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, and its lawyers, to investigate the actions of
the former management at the KIO and Grupo Torras.
The involvement of the prosecutor general may mean any parallel
investigations will stop. Neither was it clear to whom the prosecutor
general will give his findings.
It is possible he will report only to the prime minister and crown prince,
Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, the Emir's brother.
Kuwait plans to privatise its telecommunications services, a communications
ministry source said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuwait.

ISRAELI aircraft and artillery bombarded Shia Moslem villages in southern
Lebanon yesterday in retaliation for a weekend guerrilla attack in which
five soldiers were killed and five wounded.
Israel later widened its assault last night with gunboat raids on
Palestinian targets in north Lebanon.
The Israelis also deployed military reinforcements in its occupied zone
inside Lebanon, where the weekend attack by Iranian-backed Hizbollah forces
occurred.
The shelling by Israel and its militia allies of the South Lebanon Army
(SLA) extended across almost the width of Lebanon, from the Mediterranean in
the west to the lower Bekaa Valley in the east. A UN source said 200 shells
exploded in just an hour around the market town of Nabatiyeh and in the
Bekaa.
Israeli helicopter gunships raided two villages, including Kfar Tibnit, a
staging ground for Iranian-backed Hizbollah guerrillas. At least eight
Lebanese civilians were reported wounded. Lebanese-based guerrillas also
fired rockets into Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in the southern
part of the territory.
An Israeli military spokesman said gunboats later attacked 'terrorist
targets' near the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in north Lebanon. Israel
claimed Palestinians from this camp had carried out guerrilla attacks in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Israeli assault against targets in Lebanon was the fiercest since
February.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, addressing the opening winter session of
parliament, held both Syria and the Lebanese movements responsible for
latest guerrilla attacks on Israeli targets.
'It's hard to understand how they (Syria) on the one hand are involved in
negotiations with us, and on the other hand, permit this kind of action,'
said Mr Rabin.

DUSHANBE, the Tajikistan capital, was mostly quiet last nightafter the
government, backed by units of the Russian army, defeated a two-day coup
attempt by supporters of the former Communist president.
The rebels left Dushanbe after the government of acting President Akbarshah
Iskandarov promised that a special parliamentary session would decide
whether Mr Rakhmon Nabiyev, who was ousted from office at gunpoint last
month, should be reinstalled.
More than 2,000 irregular troops patrolled the city last night. There was
occasional gunfire.
The coalition Tajik government of pro-Islamic and democratic parties has
fought forces loyal to former President Nabiyev since May in battles that
have killed more than 1,000 people. The pro-Nabiyev forces possess
substantial arms, including armoured vehicles, but analysts said they seemed
unlikely to mount a new challenge to the government soon.
Part of the reason is a lack of leadership. Two of the three strongest rebel
military leaders were either killed or wounded in the coup attempt, which
began at dawn on Saturday.
Mr Rustam Abdourahim was killed and Mr Langari Langariyev wounded: both were
leaders of the irregular militia recruited from the southern Kulyab region.
The political leader of the coup attempt, Mr Safarali Kendjayev, former
parliamentary speaker, was wounded by his own troops when Commonwealth of
Independent States forces escorted the rebels out of Dushanbe on Sunday
night.

The rebels left Dushanbe after the government of acting President Akbarshah
Iskandarov promised that a special parliamentary session would decide

Part of the reason is a lack of leadership. Two of the three strongest rebel

Mr Rustam Abdourahim was killed and Mr Langari Langariyev wounded: both were

The political leader of the coup attempt, Mr Safarali Kendjayev, the former
parliamentary speaker, was wounded by his own troops when Commonwealth of
Independent States forces escorted the rebels out of Dushanbe on Sunday
night.
This leaves just one of Mr Nabiyev's key military leaders - Mr Sangak
Safarov, perhaps the most daring and skilful of the ex-president's
lieutenants - fully operational. Mr Safarov did not take part in the latest
fighting.
The CIS garrison in Dushanbe provided tacit support to the Tajik government
during the coup attempt. Though taking no part in the battle, the 201st CIS
Division took control of virtually all of the capital's strategic points. It
blocked roads leading into Dushanbe, preventing the entry of rebel
reinforcements, and defended the railway station, the television station and
the airport.

RUNNING for president can cruelly expose character traits. In President
George Bush it lays bare a fragile command of language - he thanked a New
Jersey rally the other day for a 'wonderful recession'. In Mr Ross Perot it
strips layers off an already thin skin.
In Governor Bill Clinton it reveals the increasingly evident fact that he is
a night person. The Democratic presidential candidate at dawn often seems on
auto pilot, not necessarily helpful given the frequency this year of
breakfast television interviews. When the sun goes down a different man
emerges.
This worked to his advantage on a crisp Sunday night in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, at the ramshackle Dixie Classic fairground. He was late arriving
from Michigan, as all politicians are from everywhere. Local entertainment
had done its best to keep a crowd of about 3,000 warm, especially a black
rock band and a folk group which sang a pleasant ditty about Mr Bush: 'Read
my lips, I'm just the driver/I don't know where we are either.'
But the rally was expecting 'something special' which, according to Mayor
Martha Wood, appears to be Winston-Salem's current slogan.
It did not quite get it from Senator Al Gore, though he tried to set up his
running mate in style to kick off the pair's latest, and probably last, bus
tour.
While Mr Gore was running through his now predictable bag of rhetorical
tricks, carefully mentioning the word 'change' every third sentence, Mr
Clinton stood at the rear, an arm around his wife Hillary, and occasionally
pointing out signs in the crowd to his daughter Chelsea.
Mrs Clinton, greeted by a chorus of 'Happy birthday to you,' which it was,
put in what is now her standard cameo performance when appearing with her
husband and when he has not lost his voice - a broad smile and three
sentences. If she is frustrated by this deferential role, she has become far
too good a political trouper to let it show.
Husband Bill, though, could hardly wait to get started. 'My mother,' he
said, about the State Department's investigations into every passport ever
held by anybody ever called Clinton, 'has handled far tougher people than
George Bush in her life'.
The crowd liked that one and it liked even more his next foray. Mr Perot, he
chuckled, had just that night accused Mr Bush of investigating his children
while earlier Mr Bush had accused Mr Perot of an identical offence. If all
they could do was pry into the lives of each other's children, then, in
contrast, 'I would like to look after 'your' children'.
He ran through his standard economic policy proposals more briskly than
usual, but all the time returned to Mr Bush (though not again to Mr Perot).
Detecting a Bush/Quayle placard in the crowd, he pointed at the offender.
'Why listen to them? They tell lies. Listen to me,' he urged.
In a well-wrought coda he said the country was facing 'an age-old conflict -
of hope versus fear. . . of new ideas versus comfortable and proven
failures'.
Always there was an explicit appeal to his audience. Looking like a first
world war recruiting sergeant, he pointed at the crowd and said: 'I want you
to be part of the bi-partisan movement sweeping the country.'
North Carolina had been 'a beacon of hope' in the US and if light was now
shining in Orange County, California, that bastion of conservatism where he
had held a successful rally last week, then surely, Mr Clinton said, it
should be blazing here in the tobacco fields - not that he mentioned the
crop by name.
It was a good speech, bog standard to be sure but lively and delivered with
some style.
It broke no new ground, but the ground Mr Clinton is trying to break here is
the 20-year-old Republican monopoly of the region, interrupted only briefly
in 1976 by another southerner, Jimmy Carter.
But this was Sunday night. Yesterday morning, before boarding the bus, it
was another television studio and another national audience and back to auto
pilot again. The answers rambled, he agreed and disagreed with his
questioners.
He hardly let Mr Gore get a word in.
But he was awake enough to remember the cost of a quart of milk, a gallon of
petrol and a pair of blue jeans.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Data unlikely to give Bush a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE weak economy has been a handicap for President George Bush throughout
the presidential election campaign. He should avoid big embarrassments in
the next week but the figures are unlikely to show convincing signs of
recovery, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
Today. The single most important pre-election statistic - gross domestic
product for the third quarter - is released. For Mr Bush to gain an
advantage it would have to show growth at an annual rate of 2 per cent or
more.
The consensus view, however, is that third-quarter growth will be 1.5 per
cent, about the same sluggish pace as in the second quarter. Consumption,
two thirds of economic activity, probably grew at about 3 per cent, but this
is likely to be largely offset by weakness of trade and capital spending.
Some bears believe a worse figure is possible. Mr Allen Sinai, chief
economist for The Boston Group, an economic consultancy, forecasts growth at
an annual rate of only 0.9 per cent. A figure below 1 per cent would allow
Mr Clinton to claim the economy was deteriorating again.
The Conference Board also publishes its closely followed consumer confidence
index. Most analysts expect a small decline in October, for the fourth
consecutive month. Confidence is running at about half the level normal in a
vigorous recovery.
October 28. Analysts expect figures for durable goods orders to show a 0.5
per cent increase last month, a modest rebound after a 0.1 per cent decline
in August. However, a nasty shock should not be ruled out as consensus
forecasts for this and other figures have frequently been over-optimistic.
Personal income and consumption figures for September are expected to show
modest increases of 0.5 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively, following
declines in August. Weaker than expected figures might causes ripples in
financial markets but would have little effect on the presidential race.
October 29. State unemployment insurance claims for the week ending October
17 may show an artificial decline, because of the Columbus day holiday.
Claims figures have been falling in recent weeks and the Bush campaign may
try to use the data as evidence that employment conditions are im- proving.
October 30. Figures for new home sales are expected to show a modest rebound
last month - an increase of perhaps 2-3 per cent after a surprising 6 per
cent plunge in August. Another fall in home sales would be disturbing
evidence that the housing market is not recovering despite repeated cuts in
interest rates.
November 2. The October Purchasing Managers' Index - a reliable indicator of
the health of manufacturing industry - is the last important statistic
before the election.
Mr David Wyss, chief economist at DRI McGraw Hill, the forecasting group, is
typical in expecting a modest rebound after an unexpected fall to 49 per
cent in September.
A figure of around 50 per cent, however, would indicate manufacturing
industry is struggling and is bad news for Mr Bush. However, the index is
mostly of interest to financial markets and means little to the man on the
street.
Mr Bush is fortunate in one respect: he will not be embarrassed on the eve
of the election by news of a rise in the unemployment rate - by far the most
politically sensitive indicator. Monthly employment figures are released on
the first Friday of the month and so will not appear until after the
election is won or lost.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Cuban trade caught in battle for Florida vote: A new law
aimed at winning support from anexile community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELIZABETH PISANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATS and Republicans, falling over each other to woo the Cuban exile
community and net Florida's 25 electoral college votes in next week's
presidential election, have infuriated America's allies.
At issue is a new law making it illegal for subsidiaries of US companies
based anywhere in the world to trade with Cuba. The European Community,
Mexico and Argentina have complained that the US has no business telling
companies overseas who to trade with; Canada and Britain have forbidden
companies incorporated locally to take any notice of it.
Florida has long been a Republican bastion, thanks to the party's tough
anti-Castro policies that have secured the support of the state's 700,000
Cuban-Americans (83 per cent of them in Dade County).
'Those votes in Dade County, Florida, mean more to George Bush right now
than the whole of the EC and Canada put together,' said Mr Michael Krinsky,
a New York-based lawyer who represents Havana's interests.
Mr Jose Cardenas, director of research at the conservative Cuban American
National Foundation (CANF), added: 'Republicans talk the political language
of Cuban Americans. But now the Democrats are trying it on for size and like
the way it looks.'
Two years ago President Bush vetoed legislation similar to that signed into
law last week and for months opposed the new law, promoted by Democratic
Congressman Robert Torricelli. But once Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democrat's presidential candidate, endorsed the proposals, which were tacked
on to a defence spending bill, Mr Bush changed his mind. He signed the bill
at a Republican campaign function last Friday in a smart Miami hotel.
'It's the Carry Florida Amendment,' snorted an executive at a company that
stands to lose several million dollars of business.
The bill is the brainchild of Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, a Cuban-American
millionaire variously described as a champion of freedom for the Cuban
people and a pretender to the presidency in a post-Castro Cuba. He is
chairman of CANF, whose Free Cuba political action committee contributed
Dollars 17,000 (Pounds 10,430) to Mr Torricelli's campaign. Mr Mas Canosa's
organisations have also rustled up half a million dollars in funds for about
50 other legislators around the country.
US trade with Cuba has been restricted for three decades, but for the last
17 years subsidiaries of US companies based elsewhere have simply had to
apply for approval from the Treasury in Washington to trade with Cuba. Now
such trade is illegal.
However, carefully worded comments from the State Department, which earlier
in the year opposed the Torricelli bill, suggest Washington will be a limp
crusader against US subsidiaries ignoring the law.
Representatives from both the Bush and Clinton campaigns believe the
legislation is the last straw that will break the back of an increasingly
shaky Castro regime. Some analysts disagree and feel the new law will give
Cuban President Fidel Castro a new lease of life. 'This bill gives Castro
all he needs to scream imperialism without hurting materially,' said Mr
Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College.
About 300 US subsidiaries requested approval for Dollars 718m of trade with
Cuba in 1991, Dollars 13m up on a year earlier, although economists believe
the actual trade was far lower.
Some companies maintain the US suffers most from restricting this trade. An
executive at commodities traders Cargill said: 'One of the basic issues that
we brought to the attention of anyone willing to listen on Capitol Hill was
that if you close off opportunities to US companies, business will move to
other countries.' Cargill's Geneva-based subsidiary Cargill International
accounted for three-quarters of all US subsidiary trade approved with Cuba
for 1990.
The company's entreaties made little headway. 'We were told it wasn't an
economic issue, it was a human rights issue,' the executive said.
But Mr Mas Canosa is well aware of the economic implications. '(When Castro
falls) a market of 11m consumers will open up overnight; a market that will
need everything from toilet paper to the most sophisticated computer. And
most of that will come from Florida.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / White House attacks Perot for 'paranoia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday launched an all-out attack on Mr Ross Perot,
dismissing the independent presidential candidate's allegations of a 'dirty
tricks' plot by the Republican party to disrupt his daughter's wedding as
'crazy' and attacking him as 'paranoid', writes George Graham in Washington.
'I think the news media needs to look into this,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater,
the White House spokesman. 'They're the only ones left who can investigate
this and prevent us from electing a paranoid person who has delusions. This
man simply cannot see the truth,' Mr Fitzwater said.
Mr Perot edged slightly away from the allegations he had made on Sunday,
admitting he had no proof and saying he accepted the Republicans' denial at
face value. Nevertheless, he repeatedly insinuated that the party's
behaviour was suspicious.
'Am I the only guy in the room that finds it strange that at a time when all
of them want my support and I tell them the first thing we have to talk
about is my daughter and the effort to smear her, that nobody calls back and
says: 'Ross, we don't know what you're talking about'?' he asked reporters
yesterday.
Political analysts were scratching their heads yesterday over whether voters
would see Mr Perot's claim as a credible example of the Republican party's
propensity for 'dirty tricks,' or as further evidence of the Texas tycoon's
penchant for plots and conspiracies - a penchant which has already spawned a
host of 'Perotnoia' and 'Inspector Perot' puns.
The episode might be dismissed as a trivial aside, but it comes at a time
when the campaigns of both President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton
are agonising over the likely path of Mr Perot's support in the run-up to
next Tuesday's election.
Mr Perot, who re-entered the campaign at the beginning of this month, has
gained ground steadily since the three televised debates in which he
appeared with Mr Bush and Mr Clinton. Several opinion polls now put his vote
at about 20 per cent. His advance has come mainly at Mr Clinton's expense.
Pollsters wonder whether the independent's support will prove to be a
short-lived fever, reaching a peak and dropping away before November 3, or a
more enduring phenomenon.
Public reaction to his charges could play a considerable role.
In June Mr Perot's standing in opinion polls slid rapidly in the face of
repeated stories about his habit of using private investigators against
business foes, Mr Bush's sons and even his own family.
'He is, after all, accusing the president of the United States of organising
an assault on his daughter's wedding. Either he is going to marginalise
himself or the president is going to be involved in controversy. I think
it's more likely he will marginalise himself,' Mr Stanley Greenberg, a
pollster for the Clinton campaign, told the New York Times.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Blue Jays distract Canadian voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE streets of Toronto were clear evidence yesterday that Canadians savour a
victory over their US neighbours far more than they fear the threat of their
own country falling apart.
At a polling booth on Queen's Quay, near the shores of Lake Ontario, a
steady trickle of voters arrived to cast their ballots in a landmark
referendum on a new constitution. The final result of the vote was to be
announced early this morning, but the six-week referendum campaign has been
marked by anger against politicians and a desire to move beyond the dreary
business of constitution-making.
The queue was much, much longer and the mood far more exuberant just a few
hundred yards to the north at the entrance to the SkyDome, Toronto's sports
stadium.
Braving near-zero temperatures, baseball fans began lining up before dawn
yesterday to ensure a seat for the lunchtime celebration in honour of their
beloved Blue Jays, which became the first team outside the US to win the
World Series baseball championship.
In reality, the Toronto Blue Jays are about as Canadian a team as the World
Series is an international competition. All their players are either
Americans or from the Caribbean, and few of them even live in the frozen
north.
But the Blue Jays' victory does have some tangible benefits for Canada. The
team is owned by two pillars of Canadian business; John Labatt, the brewing
group, has a 90 per cent stake and the remaining 10 per cent is held by
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The Blue Jays' success on the field is a commercial bonanza for its owners -
not to mention Toronto's recession-hit T-shirt and souvenir industry. The
SkyDome has pulled in more than 4m fans in each of the past two baseball
seasons, more than any other North American ballpark.
But the team has needed every penny from the tickets they have sold. They
spent more than CDollars 46m (Pounds 23m) on salaries for players and
coaches last season, leading cynics to suggest that any team could win the
World Series if it threw enough money around.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Deficit of top credit agencies passes
Dollars 50bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCUMULATED deficit of the world's leading export credit agencies passed
Dollars 50bn (Pounds 30.6bn) in 1991, according to the Berne Union, which
represents the world's top 41 agencies.
A total of 49 countries failed to meet fully their repayment obligations
under debt restructuring arrangements, up from 46 in 1990, the Union
revealed at the end of its latest annual meeting.
This was 'a matter of continuing concern', Mr Ragnar Sohlman, Berne Union
president, said in a statement that provided data on the agencies'
accumulated deficits for the first time.
The 'adverse payments climate' continued in 1991, resulting in claims from
exporters rising to Dollars 13bn, and recoveries from defaulting buyers
falling to Dollars 3.9bn.
A Berne Union official refused to unveil comparative figures for 1990, but
said that the total for recoveries was only marginally lower than in 1990.
Confirmation that the combined cumulative deficit of export insurers
continues to rise is a factor likely to increase pressure on agencies to
enforce more rigorous risk-assessment methods, and in some cases to raise
export credit premiums.
Mr Sohlman said the 41 export credit agencies, from a total of 33 countries,
underwrote Dollars 340bn in new business in 1991, a rise of 3.5 per cent on
1990.
As in previous years, 80 per cent of this was for commodities, raw materials
and consumer goods which were sold on short-term credit terms, sums normally
repaid within six months.
Total exposure under insurance and direct lending programmes amounted to
Dollars 459bn, a rise of 6 per cent from 1990 after currency fluctuations
have been taken into account.
'The recovery of debts from countries in course of fragmenting pose
additional problems,' Mr Sohlman added.
'So do the softer terms, involving the write-off of part of the debts of the
poorest countries, agreed in the Paris Club (of leading creditor nations).'
Of the union's 41 members, 20 provide insurance against political risks
linked with investing overseas.
New underwriting for foreign investments amounted to Dollars 4.8bn in 1991,
up from just over Dollars 3bn in 1990.
Cumulative underwriting for investment insurance amounted to Dollars 19.3bn,
a 12.5 per cent increase on 1990.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: New entrants boost UK exports - British
Aerospace remains leading exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN OUT of the top 10 British exporters saw a fall in the overall value of
their exports between 1990 and 1991, the FT's latest survey of top exporters
shows.
It was left to new entrants - such as Nissan and Vauxhall, which
significantly boosted their exports from the UK in 1991 - and a tiny
miscellany of outstanding performers to keep exports growing - albeit by
less than 1 per cent to Pounds 45.2bn.
British Aerospace remained the UK's leading exporter, but saw exports fall
by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn.
ICI also held its place at number two - also recording a 2.56 per cent fall
in overseas sales.
The only improvements inside the Top 10 came from Ford, whose exports edged
up by 1.9 per cent to Pounds 2.78bn, and Guinness, which edged up one place
to 10th position as the result of a 4 per cent export improvement to Pounds
849m.
Shell 'rose' from seventh to fifth place on the back of a revision of its
1990 performance: its exports actually fell by more than 5 per cent to
Pounds 2.4bn.
A total of 37 companies in the Top 100 are foreign owned, with 21 of these
belonging to US parents. Of the UK companies in the Top 100, exports fell by
1.5 per cent, from Pounds 30.9bn in 1990 to Pounds 30.4bn last year. By
contrast, the foreign-owned companies saw exports rise by 6.4 per cent to
Pounds 14.9bn.
Of passing comfort to leading British exporters was the fact that export
performance held up in spite of falls in turnover and employment in the UK.
Overall turnover for the Top 100 fell by 3.1 per cent to Pounds 140bn, while
they trimmed 6.6 per cent of their workforce - involving the loss of 110,000
jobs. At the same time, their turnover outside the UK rose by 3.2 per cent
to Pounds 167bn.
Among the handful of buoyant performances, the Weir Group leapt from 99th to
81st place on the back of a 26 per cent improvement in exports and a 34 per
cent surge in turnover.
Boots and Marks and Spencer also boosted overseas sales by around a quarter
to leap up the rankings - putting Boots in the top 100 for the first time,
and lifting Marks and Spencer to 54th position. Both boosted exports on
virtually stagnant turnover - Boots up 2.9 per cent and Marks and Spencer up
0.4 per cent.
Westland also reported a 26 per cent improvement in an otherwise drab
aero-engineering sector which saw overall exports fall by 5.5 per cent.
This fall was due in part to lower exports from British Aerospace, but in
addition resulted from a 9 per cent decline in exports by Rolls-Royce. The
aero-engine maker slipped from 6th to 7th position as foreign sales fell to
Pounds 2.06bn.
Three oil companies - all US owned - performed well, with Esso boosting
exports by almost 42 per cent to climb to 11th position in the Top 100.
Texaco boosted exports by 25 per cent, with Mobil up 21 per cent.
In spite of improved export performances, all three reported falls in
turnover: Esso and Mobil of 3 per cent apiece, and Texaco of 13 per cent.
Other good performers were British Nuclear Fuels, up 50 per cent, with BAT
Industries up 30 per cent, Thorn EMI up 23 per cent, and Hanson Trust up 27
per cent.
Dobson Park Industries crept in as the 100th largest exporter after a 35 per
cent improvement in exports to Pounds 72m. While Dobson Park's UK turnover
fell by 13.5 per cent to Pounds 152m, offshore output rose by 19 per cent to
Pounds 154m.
The most extraordinary headway was made by Nissan, whose exports leapt by
108 per cent, from Pounds 328m in 1990 to Pounds 682m last year, and
Vauxhall, whose 247 per cent jump took its exports to Pounds 620m.
Also impressive was Sheerness Steel, which crept into the Top 100 for the
first time - to 97th place - because of a 146 per cent improvement in
foreign sales to Pounds 84m.
Export growth came at Sheerness despite a 26 per cent fall in UK turnover -
a factor vividly shown by the fact that in 1990, exports accounted for just
26 per cent of turnover, compared with 86 per cent last year.
In terms of its export dependency in 1991, Sheerness was third only to
Nissan - which exported 87.5 per cent of its turnover - and Caterpillar,
which exported 89 per cent. Associated Octel, at 85 per cent came close
behind.
Other companies with an extremely high level of export dependency included
IBM (57 per cent of UK turnover); Wellcome (72 per cent); Rothmans (60 per
cent); Allied Colloids (78 per cent) and Amersham International (76 per
cent).
Takeovers took Hawker Siddeley, Dowty and Davy out of the Top 100, while
Philips, Rank Xerox and ASW failed to provide necessary data.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Spain offers Algeria Dollars 1bn export
credits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPAIN is to extend Dollars 1bn worth of export credits to Algeria in
1992-93. The agreement follows the visit to Algiers last week of Mr Javier
Solana, Spanish foreign minister, the first by an EC foreign minister since
Algeria's electoral process was suspended last January.
Each Dollars 500m package will include two Dollars 150m short-term loans
with maturities of 18 and 24 months, and one medium-term loan. The
short-term moneys will cover Algerian purchases of essential goods, not
least of them food, the other loan will help fund longer-term projects.
Spain's exports to Algeria were worth Dollars 650m last year and are
expected to be slightly higher in 1992. With the building of a new gas
pipeline to Spain, Spanish purchases of Algerian natural gas are set to
treble to about 10bn cubic metres by the late 1990s.

<TEXT>
HEADS of Mr Bill Clinton's campaign for the US presidency yesterday were
investigating reports that a lawyer, claiming to be a campaign official, had
sent a signal to the EC to delay a Uruguay Round trade agreement until after
the November 3 election.
Campaign officials strongly denied charges made by President Bush on Sunday
that one of their team may have made a deal with the French to sabotage the
current talks centring on farm trade reform.
Throughout the US election campaign, Mr Clinton's spokesmen have been
universally discreet regarding the Democratic candidate's intentions on
trade. Beyond warning that Mr Clinton will not necessarily concur with
anything the Bush administration negotiates, it has steadfastly stuck to one
line: there is one president and he must do the negotiating.
A spokesman for the European Community in Washington said that 'someone'
claiming to have 'solid links' with the Clinton campaign had met EC
ambassador Andreas Van Agt to discuss various options for a Gatt settlement.
The delegation did not check the person's credentials and the ambassador
ended up sending a cable to Brussels with a long political analysis based on
the conversation.
However, the spokesman said, 'the whole story has been much exaggerated. We
always send political analyses to Brussels.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Gloomy reading sector by sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXAMINATION of leading exporters by sector makes gloomy reading.
Indicative of the difficulties facing most UK exporters, the three
construction companies in the Top 100 saw exports fall 15.4 per cent, while
general engineers reported an 11.7 per cent fall. Among these, Simon
Engineering exports tumbled 32 per cent, with APV down almost 29 per cent,
Vickers down 23 per cent, and Siebe down 19 per cent.
It was left to the Weir Group, with a 26 per cent gain, Vosper Thorneycroft
(up 14 per cent), and new entrant Dobson Park (up 35 per cent) to relieve an
otherwise depressing picture.
Among the largest sectors, the 13 chemicals companies placed in the Top 100
saw exports fall 1.3 per cent. Du Pont, Monsanto, BASF and Schering reported
falls of 10 per cent or more, leaving Polaroid to stand alone, gaining 22.5
per cent.
Looking at the 13 companies in the motors sector, a 13.8 per cent sectoral
improvement was gained solely because of the entry of Nissan and Vauxhall
into the Top 100. By contrast, Peugeot saw exports fall 20 per cent, with
Michelin's foreign sales falling 11 per cent.
In the Food and Drink sector, eight companies reported an overall gain of
5.3 per cent, with the biggest gains by far coming from Nestle (up 16 per
cent) and Grand Metropolitan (up 11.5 per cent).
Among companies grouped in the Health and Household sector, the only strong
performances came from Lilly (up 15.4 per cent), Roche (up 17 per cent), and
Boots (up by almost 27 per cent). Marks and Spencer reported a 26 per cent
rise.
While BP and Shell saw falls in their export performance, other oil
companies performed well. Esso's exports rose by 42 per cent, while Texaco
boosted overseas sales 25 per cent and Mobil 21 per cent. Among the
'miscellaneous' stars, British Nuclear Fuels boosted exports 50 per cent;
BAT Industries reported a 31 per cent rise; Thorn EMI, rose 23 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Scottish bus group's Asia deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALTER Alexander, the Scottish-based bus builder, yesterday announced Pounds
15m worth of orders for double-deck buses from Singapore and Hong Kong.
The orders confirm a recovery for the company which in mid-1991 had to put
many of its staff on a three-day week and was forced to make others
redundant.
Walter Alexander will supply 85 air-conditioned double-deck buses to Citybus
in Hong Kong, and provide 200 double-deck bus kits for assembly in
Singapore.
The orders, which will be completed in October 1993, mean that exports at
present account for some 50 per cent of Walter Alexander's order book.
This year it has exported more than 140 buses to foreign customers and is
building Peoplemovers for Honolulu international airport, Hawaii, having
supplied similar vehicles for Atlanta and Miami.
Mr Ian Galloway, chief executive, said that partly because of overseas
orders, Walter Alexander is now having to work overtime at its plant at
Falkirk where it employs 610 people. It also employs 154 people in Belfast.
The company recently recruited 100 people in Falkirk and is now constrained
by the number of skilled coachbuilders it can find. It is taking on 30-40
extra people in Belfast.
It expects to deliver between Pounds 32m and Pounds 33m of buses this year,
and expects sales to reach Pounds 45m next year, of which Pounds 36m have
already been ordered.
Mr Galloway said that the domestic market in the UK was showing some signs
of recovery, although bus operators were ordering fewer than half the 2,000
buses they needed to order each year to upgrade their fleets.
The company had been helped by the closure last winter of some of the
bus-making capacity of its UK rivals.
In April, Mr Galloway led a Pounds 7.4m management buyout of Water Alexander
from Spotlaunch, a company formed in 1990 by the finance company Granville
to buy the entire Walter Alexander group, which was then quoted on the stock
exchange.

FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Shipowners face higher insurance premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL shipowners can expect to pay increased insurance premiums next
year, as the industry struggles to keep pace with rising claims.
The UK P&amp;I Club, one of the world's biggest marine insurers, which insures
the liabilities of over a quarter of the world's fleets, said yesterday it
expected premiums to increase on average by 15 per cent in 1993 compared
with a 20 to 25 per cent increase this year.
The Club, which is owned by the 800 fleets whose insurance it provides, has
also warned its members that it may be forced to place a limit on the level
of insurance cover it offers, although this would only occur if the world's
15 other P&amp;I clubs agreed to follow suit.
The UK Club insures the liabilities of more than 800 fleets including such
household names as Shell, BP, Chevron, Hapag Lloyd, Mitsui and Sealand. It
covers such risks as pollution, damage to other ships and marine
installations and bodily injury to passengers and crew. Traditionally this
level of cover has been unlimited.
Lloyd's of London and a number of European and US companies provide an
entirely separate market for the insurance of marine hulls and machinery.
But Mr Stephen James, director of Thomas Miller P&amp;I, which manages the UK
Club, said increases were less than he had feared at the beginning of the
year.
'Claims are beginning to level off mainly because of the slowdown in the
shipping industry,' said Mr James. 'Claims are continuing to rise but not at
the same alarming rate as in recent years.'
The club expects overall claims from 1991 to total Dollars 382m (Pounds
234.3m). Claims have risen steadily during the 1980s, topping Dollars 420m
in 1990, the worst year in the club's history. Oil spills, especially in the
US, have been a particular cause for concern. Clean-up costs after the Exxon
Valdez tanker accident in Alaska in 1989 amounted to over Dollars 2bn,
although the P&amp;I clubs were able to offset the bulk of claims through
reinsurance.
Insurance premiums, which can account typically for about 5-10 per cent of a
fleet's costs, have risen at a rate averaging 3 per cent above inflation
over the last decade. Premiums for P&amp;I cover were now generally higher than
those for hull and machinery. Insurance represents the biggest item of
expenditure after fuel.
UK P&amp;I Club is also stepping up its efforts to improve the quality of
management on board ships to reduce accidents and potential claims. A number
of club members have been expelled because their safety and management
standards have failed to measure up.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Bosnian test for Spanish troops: Madrid displays a fresh
commitment to western security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first soldiers in a 700-strong Spanish military contingent were last
night due to join the UN protection force (Unprofor) in Bosnia, ushering in
a new era in the Madrid government's commitment to western security.
'We are seeing a changing mood on the part Spain,' says an EC diplomat.
'It is ready to make gestures now that it drew back from in the past.'
The troops are drawn from the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Parachute
Brigade. These are two of the few professional units in an overwhelmingly
conscript army. They will be deployed to protect humanitarian aid convoys on
the road between Mostar, in south-west Bosnia, and Sarajevo.
This 'obligation' marks a milestone. In the recent past Spain has stepped up
its commitment to UN peacekeeping missions in areas such as Angola and
Namibia and latterly El Salvador, where some 100 Spanish military personnel
are currently stationed.
However, the Bosnia involvement, for an initial six-month period, is of a
different order.
It is novel because of the size of the contingent, because Spain will be
paying for its estimated Pta3bn (Pounds 1.8m) in expenses and because,
unlike in other war zones, the troops are 'braced for casualties' as the
defence ministry puts it.
On a different, but crucially important, level for a society such as Spain,
the Unprofor commitment also illustrates changing perceptions about a
military that was once viewed as solely interested in domestic politics.
'The public now sees the officers as obsessed with professionalism instead
of with plotting for want of nothing else to do,' says a senior
administration official.
'The army is using the UN channel to show off its professionalism and
everyone should be pleased about the new image.'
Some western diplomats believe that Spain, which joined Nato in 1982 but
remains outside its military command chain, is testing the ground in Bosnia
for what could be a readiness in Madrid to contribute forces to a future
European rapid intervention brigade.
'Our navy works closely with Nato,' said a Spanish defence ministry
spokesman, 'and our ground troops could increasingly do so too as long as
they are under a Spanish command.'
Some Spaniards are, however, uneasy about a gesture which is likely to put
the troops, with their extremely limited international experience, under
fire.
They claim that the move has more to do with power politics in Madrid and
the UN headquarters in New York than defence burden sharing.
Today the UN is due to choose between Spain, Sweden and New Zealand in a
vote to elect two new members for a two-year term on the Security Council.
But any link between a UN seat and the Bosnia task force is rejected by Mr
Javier Solana, the foreign minister, who stresses that Spain is overdue for
a Security Council seat having last held one 11 years ago.
According to Mr Solana, the troops are being sent 'because we have an
obligation to European security'.

Military commanders of Bosnia's three warring sides met face-to-face across
a negotiating table yesterday while their troops fought on throughout the
former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Leaders of Serb, Moslem and Croat forces met at Sarajevo's shell-battered
airport for a closed door meeting chaired by the United Nations
peace-keeping force commander. It was the second encounter between the three
sides organised by the UN.
The leaders were expected to discuss practical ways of ensuring water and
electricity to the Bosnian capital, which has been surrounded by Serb
fighters since April. UN officials have called the talks a breakthrough. But
there was no visible effect on fighting in Sarajevo or other towns.
Heavy shelling rocked the capital's western suburb of Stup around midday and
mortars rained into a district near the UN headquarters, wounding five.

GERMANY weighed in yesterday behind Hungary's increasingly frantic efforts
to stop Slovakia from damming and diverting the river Danube to feed the
controversial Gabcikovo hydroelectric barrage.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, issued a veiled warning of the
economic price of 'rash decisions' in the dam dispute after Slovakia began
at the weekend to block the Danube with quarry rock and concrete blocks.
Mr Kinkel said, without explicitly singling out Slovakia, that the European
Community's 'goodwill' in providing economic support was in danger. 'The row
has sparked a new, utterly unnecessary crisis in eastern Europe,' he said,
repeating calls for a negotiated settlement. The strong German intervention
drags the dam dispute squarely on to the European stage before tomorrow's
summit meeting between the EC and leaders of the central European countries.
Slovakia, despite pressure for a temporary halt, yesterday took construction
beyond the point of no return, diverting much of the river's flow into its
own territory.
The Hungarian government reacted yesterday with talk of reprisals. Mr Janos
Martonyi, state secretary at the Hungarian foreign ministry, ruled out
military action but pointedly kept all other options open and cast doubt on
the future of regional co-operation embodied in the Visegrad group of
central European countries.
Mr Martonyi re-emphasised Hungary's position that the diversion of the main
flow of the Danube, the international border, represented a territorial
violation as well as an environmental catastrophe in the making. Hungary
says that the dam will lower the water table, dry up marshes around the
Danube and damage the water supply.
The Bratislava government argues that the Gabcikovo barrage complex is
essential to the energy security and economic well-being of Slovakia, which
is to become independent from the new year.
The Czech and Slovak regional governments yesterday ratified a customs union
agreement between the two republics, writes Ariane Genillard in Prague. The
agreement was negotiated by by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister,
and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart.
It allows for the free flow of goods between the republics after they become
independent on January 1 and should facilitate a renegotiation of the EC's
Czechoslovakia association agreement. EC officials are tomorrow to meet in
London the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Polish prime ministers to discuss
extension of the EC trade agreements.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations protectorate in Sector West, central Croatia, is
considered a model among the UN's four peacekeeping zones in Croatia because
of the high degree of co-operation between the UN and the local authorities.
But attempts by Serb rebels at the weekend to destabilise the sector and
prevent refugees from returning have highlighted the UN's fragile hold over
even this small part of the former Yugoslavia.
UN attempts to reopen the motorway between Zagreb and Belgrade, the Croatian
and Serb capitals, were undermined on Sunday when 20 armed Serbs used
combine harvesters to throw up a road block on the route, 70km south of
Zagreb.
Local Serb officials said the motorway would be reopened only if Serbs had
the right to control the road, a move which would undermine the UN's
authority.
The road, named in the Tito era as the highway of brotherhood and unity, was
closed in August 1991 when Serbs in the area, backed by Belgrade, rebelled
against Croatian independence. Telephone links were also severed between the
two republics.
When UN peacekeepers were deployed in Sector West last May they moved
quickly to demilitarise Serb and Croat-held territories by July to allow the
return of refugees - many of them Croat - to this part of central Croatia.
Plans to reopen the motorway were agreed at the Geneva peace talks in
September.
But General Carlos Zabala, the UN sector commander, said that, in addition
to the roadblock, Serb paramilitaries were trying to reverse the
demilitarisation process by wearing military uniforms.
If the UN's hold over Sector West is further undermined - to the extent that
it breaks down - President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia could withdraw his
half-hearted support of UN operations in Croatia, western diplomats fear.
The Croatian government had originally opposed deployment of UN forces in
the republic on grounds that they would consolidate Serb gains.
Backing for the local Serb action is coming from President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia, who is determined to prevent the refugees returning and
is playing on fears in the Serb community in Sector West that the Croat
authorities plan to assert control over the territory through force.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LITHUANIA'S nationalist leader, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, has suffered a
serious electoral defeat at the hands of former Communists who have
politically exploited the small Baltic republic's severe economic
difficulties during its first year of independence.
Unofficial results of Sunday's parliamentary elections suggest big gains for
the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) of Mr Algirdas Brasauskas, a former
Communist Party leader who has pressed for a less brutal break with Moscow
and a gentler transition to a market economy.
Mr Brasauskas, a moderate nationalist who three years ago split from the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union to promote Lithuanian independence,
looks likely to form the next government and says that he will seek a broad
coalition.
'We will talk to other parties and do not want to usurp power,' he told
Reuters news agency. 'It is time to throw away ambitions and search for an
agreement.'
Although a second round of voting in two weeks time could still alter the
expected outcome of the elections, a separate referendum produced
overwhelming support for a new constitution which foresees presidential
elections early next year.
Mr Landsbergis, who has effectively ruled Lithuania as chairman of
parliament and may keep his post until presidential elections, appeared
yesterday to concede defeat for his radical Sajudis independence movement.
He said that the former communist DLP had conducted an effective electoral
campaign. However, he also accused Russia, which recently halted a troop
withdrawal from Lithuania and suspended oil deliveries, of interfering in
the election.
Although he did not substantiate the charges, Mr Saulius Cheltenis, a
Lithuanian magazine editor, said that for 'people to be cold in their flats
and wonder how they are going to cook their next meal' was enough 'for an
oil blockade to affect elections'.
However, the Russian suspension of deliveries was not the only factor to
prompt support for Mr Brasauskas, a moderate who has proved his loyalty to
an independent Lithuania.
Although recent elections in neighbouring Estonia produced a defeat for
former Communists, Mr Cheltenis pointed out that there had been a backlash
against the radical reforms in much of eastern Europe, including in Poland,
which, like Lithuania, is a largely rural Catholic country with obsolete
heavy industry inherited from its Soviet masters.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Gonzalez, for richer and poorer: Why 10 years under the
Socialists has given some Spanish workers cause to celebrate, and others to
protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government had a good day on Sunday, celebrating 10 years of
rule by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish Socialist Workers party at
a massive rally in Madrid's main bullring. Mr Gonzalez announced he would
stand for re-election next year and said that what Spain needed most was
another 10 years of Socialist government.
Yesterday was less comfortable. Nearly 1,000 steelworkers who have walked
from northern Spain in protest at plans to cut 9,700 jobs and 1.5m tonnes of
capacity from the state's two integrated steelmakers in Asturias and the
Basque country arrived in Madrid. They were joined by another 10,000
protesters outside the industry ministry.
It might be going too far to suggest that some of the people in the bullring
on Sunday were outside the ministry last night, but what was being
celebrated and what was being protested are, in essence, the same thing.
The 10 years of Socialist government have been about preparing Spain for
life alongside the leading economies of the European Community and that has
meant raising the living standards and increasing the wealth of its
citizens.
But as the steel march starkly showed, it has also been about making some of
them poorer. Spain does not have an industrial policy as such but the state
owns a lot of industrial companies - from steel to shipbuilding, coal,
avionics, electricity and airlines - which, no matter how hard Madrid tries
to leave them to the markets, keep demanding its intervention or support.
This year Madrid merged its Asturian integrated steelmaker, Ensidesa, with
Altos Hornos de Vizcaya, which has a large plant near Bilbao. It drew up a
neat, almost bold, plan to trim their combined 24,500-strong workforce and
to cut steel output from 6m tonnes a year to 4.5m tonnes.
It assumed it could combine two Asturian sites into one, keeping some blast
furnaces in the port of Gijon open, and shutting those in nearby Aviles. The
Gijon furnaces would then send molten steel to be cast in a modern steel
shop in Aviles.
At AHV, all the furnaces would be closed but Bilbao would get, instead, the
world's biggest mini-mill which, through melting scrap in giant electric
furnaces, would produce about 900,000 tonnes of steel a year. The costs of
the jobs cuts and the new mill would be a huge Dollars 6bn.
Both Ensidesa and AHV are high-cost producers of relatively common products
which could be more cheaply imported from northern EC competitors. Their
combined losses in 1991 and this year will be Dollars 1.3bn.
But the spread of the vote that has kept Mr Gonzalez in power for a decade
makes it imperative that steelmaking continue in the Basque country and
Asturias, which is a powerful Socialist stronghold and heavily dependent on
subsidised steel and coal jobs.
The Socialists are strong in the Basque country, too, but, even more
important, might require the support in parliament in Madrid of the ruling
Basque party if, as seems likely, Mr Gonzalez's PSOE does not win a majority
at the next general election.
Thus, the opposition of the EC's competition commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan,
to the steel plan came as a rude shock to Madrid this month. Sir Leon, whose
job it is to ensure that European industries are not unfairly subsidised,
tried to persuade his fellow commissioners to have the Bilbao mini-mill and
a further 800 jobs cut from Spain's plans.
Last week the Commission compromised and asked Spain to find its own further
cuts, either in jobs, capacity or subsidies - the implicit warning being
that if it did not, industry ministers would reject the plan on November 24.
Madrid, then, is caught between Asturian and Basque anger at its original
plan, and the need to make even deeper cuts. An 'industrial shuttle', in
which Madrid's industry minister will try to win support for its plan from
sceptical EC partners in Britain, France and Germany before November 24,
begins this week.
It may work, but if 9,700 steel job cuts, spread over six years, cause this
much trouble, how will Spain ever trim its state industries before economic
and monetary union (Emu), to which Spain is still committed, in 1999? The
INI, the state industrial holding company, has just announced plans to shed
20,000 jobs in four years, when, at best, only 25 per cent of INI's 140,000
employees work in profitable companies.
But the day is not far off when the current trade off between votes and jobs
will become untenable. Not yet, though. This is an election year and Sir
Leon has given Madrid a perfect opportunity to tell the steelworkers that it
is, despite all appearances, fighting to save jobs.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Tax panic grips Italian evaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LID on Italy's worst kept secret has finally been lifted: the
self-employed, professions and small business have been getting away with
absurd tax returns for years.
The secret has been blown by the simple expedient of the finance ministry
leaking data on tax returns of the 6.1m classified as self-employed in order
to demonstrate the equity of a proposed new 'minimum tax'.
In the country of the fur coat, the cellular telephone, the third holiday,
the Swiss bank account, and the highest savings ratio in the EC, 35 per cent
of self-employed are supposedly living on the poverty line with annual
incomes below L7.2m (Pounds 3,310). Only 3.6 per cent of wage-earners have
incomes in this category.
On the basis of a spot check on 62,000 tax returns, the authorities
discovered 56,000 were under-declaring. The worst offenders were retailers,
who declared only a fraction of their projected earnings.
A check of 22 delicatessens in the wealthy northern city of Varese showed
average taxable income of L12.6m (Pounds 5,800); 11 leather shops in
Florence had average taxable income of L20m (Pounds 9,210). Employers were
also often declaring earnings half that of their employees.
The new tax measure assesses real earnings by category on a computerised
formula and then imposes a minimum payment regardless of the return
submitted. In most cases this entails a doubling of current declared
earnings for the new tax base.
Not surprisingly it has provoked a storm of protest, the first organised
manifestation of which was a meeting yesterday in Rome of the traders'
association, Confcommercio.
Last week, senior members of the Christian Democrat party unsuccessfully
tried to water down the proposal with a series of exceptions. 'They wanted
to make the exception the rule,' said one official.
'The traders wanted to raise issues like 'Why should my income be the norm
if traffic restrictions cut my clientele?' or 'What happens if for six
months someone has not been able to serve properly because of a bad back?'.
. . It was impossible.'
The protest cuts across all political persuasions but grouped as a whole
these 6m people represent a formidable block of votes. Their main champion
is the populist Lombard League.
The unions have kept their distance, aware their that wage-paying members
for years have paid their taxes at source.

FT  27 OCT 92 / French government wins censure vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S conservative opposition failed yesterday to muster enough votes to
pass a censure motion against the Socialist government in the National
Assembly, writes Our Foreign Staff. The Communists abstained, enabling the
conservatives to gain only 261 of the necessary 286 votes.
The motion was put forward in protest at an 'unrealistic' 1993 budget. The
opposition RPR and UDF parties consider the forecast 2.6 per cent economic
growth rate far too optimistic and fear that the budget deficit is running
out of control.
Mr Martin Malvy, budget minister, yesterday admitted that the current year's
deficit would be around a record FFr180bn (Pounds 21.5bn), against the
FFr89.6bn originally forecast. The FFr165bn deficit predicted in the 1993
budget is thought too low by many economists.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUSSELDORF
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday issued his grimmest warning yet of the
effect of an unrestricted influx of asylum-seekers into Germany, declaring
that failure to curb it could lead to a 'state of national emergency'.
Unofficial estimates put the number in October at approaching 60,000,
compared with 42,000 in September.
'We have already passed the limit of what we can bear,' he told the annual
conference of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU). 'The influx. . . . is
leading to unbearable conditions in our towns and cities.'
In an urgent appeal to the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) to agree
on a common policy, he added: 'If it is not dealt with, we are facing the
danger of a profound crisis of confidence in our democratic state.'
He was speaking after new signs of SPD disarray over how far to go in
restricting the far-reaching right to asylum enshrined in the constitution.
The governing coalition, led by Mr Kohl's CDU, is demanding a change to
limit the right of asylum to those coming from countries with recognised
political persecution.
The SPD has called a congress next month to decide its position, with Mr
Bjorn Engholm, its leader, calling for a constitutional change. However, a
growing number of SPD branches are opposed.
Mr Kohl yesterday estimated the number of purported asylum seekers this year
at well over 400,000. Barely 5 per cent 'are genuinely persecuted'.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, suffered a severe setback in his
ambition to succeed Mr Kohl as chancellor when he was defeated in a poll to
become one of four deputy leaders of the CDU.
The vote marks a startling revolt by the party grassroots against its
leadership, and in particular by the new members from east Germany.

FT  27 OCT 92 / W German economy 'in critical state'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE west German economy is in a 'critical state' and will generate only 0.5
per cent real growth next year, according to a joint report from the
country's five leading economic institutes. A modest recovery in the east
will bring aggregate growth to 1 per cent.
The annual autumn study, though at odds with the government's
hastily-revised forecast of up to 1.5 per cent growth in the west, released
at the weekend, reflects common agreement that international recession is at
last taking its toll. It is only weeks since the government was speaking of
2.5 per cent growth next year.
Predicting average inflation in the west of 3.5 per cent after 4 per cent
this year, the institutes urged that pay settlements be kept down to 3 per
cent - around half the levels of the past two years. The over-hasty
alignment of eastern wage rates with those in the west would be 'socially
and politically explosive', they warned.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said that even though the
economy was weakening, there was no reason for the central bank to relax its
stance on maintaining stability.
Control of inflation and money supply remained the bank's priorities, he
said in a speech in Hamburg. Preliminary figures released yesterday
suggested that inflation in western Germany was virtually unchanged in
October. Consumer prices have risen 0.3 per cent in Baden-Wurttemberg during
the past month, taking the year-on-year inflation rate to 3.3 per cent.
In North-Rhine Westphalia, the most heavily-populated state, a similar rise
took the annual rate to 3.6 per cent. In the five new states, however,
inflation is still strong, and stood at 12.7 per cent in September,
according to statistics released yesterday.
As Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned his Christian Democrat party congress of
tax rises and public spending cuts, Mr Schlesinger said there was no need to
increase taxes at present 'but whether this applies in the longer-term will
need examining'.
The bank, hitherto stolidly against higher taxes, appears now to agree with
Bonn that at least the threat of a rise could help dampen both union
ambitions in the spring wages round, and private demand for credit which has
been an important factor in this year's surge in money supply growth.
A summer slump in Germany's foreign trade, reported yesterday, further
deepened the gloom spreading rapidly into every sector of the economy. At
DM47.9bn, August exports were 4.7 per cent lower than a year earlier, and
imports were down 11 per cent at DM47.6bn, according to the statistics
office. Compared with July, exports fell 18 per cent and imports 27 per
cent.
Industrial confidence is also down sharply, according to the Ifo institute
in Munich, one of the five authors of the autumn study. The D-Mark's rapid
appreciation during September has hit export prospects and incoming orders
fell again during the month, Ifo said in a separate report.
Manufacturing plant is working at around 83 per cent of capacity compared
with more than 87 per cent in September last year, and average outstanding
orders amount to 2.6 months' work, against 2.8 months in June.
According to details available from the five institutes' report, officially
released today, west German growth this year will be only 1 per cent, and
the east will show a rise of around 5.5 per cent, half earlier estimates.
Next year the east should see a gain of around 7 per cent and average
inflation should slow from 11.5 per cent to 8 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Transport barriers in EC prove hard to lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC TRANSPORT ministers yesterday made new but inconclusive efforts to agree
two critical measures designed to make next year's barrier-free single
market work: freer access to Europe's congested airports, and freedom for
road hauliers to operate inside other member states.
They rejected Commission plans to 'confiscate' under-used landing and
take-off slots at airports for redistribution to new entrants to the air
transport industry. Nor could they agree what constitutes a 'new entrant,'
the dying breed of low-cost independent carriers that Brussels had hoped
would invigorate the 'open skies' policy agreed by ministers in June.
Ministers made moreprogress on agreeing a compatible EC system of tolls and
road-user charges for lorries over 12 tonnes. Germany has made a common
system the precondition for allowing 'cabotage,' the right of foreign
lorries to ply their trade inside Germany.
However, there remains concern that the Commission's plan to place no limit
on charges would result, not in a common policy, but fragmentation of the
single market. Also, some of the poorer and geographically peripheral member
states made clear yesterday that they would not go along with the bigger,
more cental states imposing high charges in a loose policy which might allow
discrimination.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Report seeks level playing field for EC single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A REPORT into how to make the single European market fair, efficient and
user-friendly once it comes into force on January 1, 1993, will be presented
to the European Commission today.
It will be published tomorrow by Mr Peter Sutherland, former competition
commissioner and chairman of the committee which drew it up, and will be
considered by internal market ministers on November 10.
The success of the single market depends on the plethora of Community laws
being strictly enforced. The way in which the EC resolves disputes about
those rules is likely to be one of the first practical tests for
subsidiarity - the principle that decisions should be taken at the lowest
appropriate level - if a definition can be agreed at the Edinburgh summit in
December.
Commissioners are today also expected to approve their own long-awaited
paper on subsidiarity, which was intended for presentation to Community
leaders at the Birmingham summit earlier this month.
The Sutherland committee has tried to tread the narrow path between the
political and practical need to devolve responsibility to member states and
the danger that this might result in an anarchy of different levels of
enforcement.
For example, instead of suggesting a rigid centralised bureaucracy to
monitor the single market, the Sutherland report proposes greater informal
co-operation between national internal market officials to avoid
cross-border disputes about implementation.
But Brussels officials suggested yesterday that this might not be enough to
ensure firm and fair enforcement of EC law, and could result in
unsatisfactory trade-offs between countries. 'Those countries which have
stronger standards of implementation will lose out,' said one.
Members of the committee resolutely refused to reveal the details of the
report ahead of tomorrow's Strasbourg launch, but they are understood to
have examined how to respect subsidiarity, how to reassure consumers and
business about the internal market programme, how to remove doubts about the
enforcement of Community law, and how to enforce the rules 'through
partnership' between member states and EC institutions.
Both the Sutherland report and the Commission subsidiarity paper strongly
suggest that EC citizens should be urged to seek redress for their
complaints in national courts, rather than burdening the European Court with
legal cases.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (17): Difficult year for reforms - The
Tea Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From a distance the squat tea-processing factory in the hills above Kandy
looks fully functional. But close up one discovers bolts across its doors
and windows and it rapidly becomes apparent that the machinery has long lain
idle and the plant been left to fall into disrepair.
The factory serves as a useful analogy for Sri Lanka's tea industry as a
whole, which superficially appears to be in a healthy state. Tea remains the
country's highest net earner of foreign exchange and Sri Lanka has
outstripped India as the world's top exporter.
Last year it produced a record crop of 240m kg, although severe drought
earlier this year will hit 1992 production hard.
Look more closely, though, and the picture becomes less rosy. Sri Lankan
yields are extremely low, averaging 1,100 kg a hectare, according to local
tea broker Forbes and Walker. This compares with yields of about 1,700 kg/ha
in India and more than 2,000 kg in Kenya.
Far from being a money-spinner, tea has been a tremendous drain on the
treasury. The two state corporations that have run the estates for the past
17 years have received estimated subsidies to the tune of SLRs400m a month.
Since 1980 the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation has recorded profits
in only five years, and the Janatha Estates Development Board in only two.
Most observers blame such poor performance on the nationalisation in 1975 of
the largest estates under the populist government of Mrs Sirima
Bandaranaike. Before this, total plantation produce accounted for about 70
per cent of foreign exchange earnings, a figure that had dropped to below 30
per cent by last year. That partly reflects the diversification of the
country's export base, but is also the result of state mismanagement,
corruption and political interference in the running of the estates.
Replanting of high-yielding tea varieties has been sporadic - with only 24
per cent completed by 1990 - and the unwieldly state corporations have been
ponderous in their response to changing international markets.
Sri Lanka continues to produce predominantly orthodox teas, with only 3 per
cent CTC (cut, tear and curl) production, even though demand has shifted
markedly to the latter which now accounts for 68 per cent of the world
market. Factories have been slow to install the necessary machinery and much
of the original equipment has not been replaced since the turn of the
century.
The need to rationalise the entire sector has led the government to swallow
hard and take the controversial decision of placing the estates under
private management. Of the country's 502 estates, 449 were regrouped into 22
enterprises, the management contracts for which were put out to tender. The
remaining 53 estates were considered too run down to be offered to the
private sector.
Mr Maxwell Fernando, a consultant at Forbes and Walker, is confident that
private managers can turn the industry around. The estates, he says, are
'being privatised not for the kind of ideological reasons that led to their
nationalisation in the first instance, but for pragmatic reasons of
productivity and viability.'
Mr Fernando believes new management teams can reduce costs, which he
describes as 'the highest in the world', and raise productivity. 'There was
absolutely no financial control in the state management days. Let's hope
things will now change.'
He also hopes that managers will be more responsive to markets now that 'the
shackles of bureaucracy have been removed'. CTC production should increase
and there may be moves to enter niche markets such as scented teas.
Management contracts will run for an initial five years and will be extended
if performance is satisfactory. The new companies, which are expected to
absorb any operating losses, are to be paid on a profit-sharing basis, with
10 per cent of profits to be given to the workforce. The government is to
remain in control of hiring and firing, leading to concern that political
manipulation may continue.
Mr Fernando admits that the nature of the management contracts 'raises the
danger that they will fall prey to short-termism', a tendency that has long
hampered the industry. He believes, however, that management teams are
merely a stage towards fully fledged privatisation, a view privately shared
by senior government officials.
The World Bank is more critical. The contracts drawn up with the management
companies are unlikely to 'provide the incentives for adequate investment
and longer-run profit maximisation that would come from private ownership',
it says in its latest country report.
Labour relations remain highly sensitive, given Sri Lanka's ethnic tensions
and the fact that 90 per cent of plantation workers are Indian Tamils,
brought in by British planters last century. Analysts say plantations are
heavily overstaffed and that certain working practices are inefficient. The
government admits that the strength of plantation worker unions has caused
it to tread cautiously.
The implication is that, given a free hand, private companies might cut the
workforce substantially. There may be a possibility, however, of redeploying
workers as estate crops are diversified into such areas as cut flowers,
fruit and vegetables.
The preponderance of Indian Tamil labour has already led to a watering down
of privatisation proposals. When Indian tea companies - hit by loss of
production in strife-torn Assam - bid for the management contracts,
deep-rooted Sinhalese fears of Indian domination were stirred. The
government intervened, restricting bids to nominally Sri Lankan companies.
Sri Lanka could not have chosen a more difficult year in which to implement
such reforms. The four-month drought has already cut production drastically
and Forbes and Walker is predicting a total crop for 1992 of about 180m kg,
some 23 per cent down on last year. Higher prices may help to compensate.
Despite such difficulties, many of the new management teams believe they can
move into profit relatively quickly. 'I'm fairly confident that we can turn
it around in 1 1/2 years,' says a chief director of one company.
He feels that productivity can be raised substantially simply by reversing
the neglect of the past 15 years. Of this period, he says: 'Mismanagement is
an understatement. There was no management at all.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (18): Still a central element of the
economy - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the air, much of Sri Lanka resembles a verdant, Miltonian paradise. On
the ground, even next to Colombo's airport road which is often choked with
traffic, plant life vies for space and monsoon rains drip off the coconut
palms.
For all the government's emphasis on industrialisation, agriculture remains
a central element of Sri Lanka's economy. The sector accounts for 24 per
cent of the nation's GDP and more than 30 per cent of exports. Some 2.2m
people are directly employed in agriculture which remains an important
source of income for 70 per cent of the population.
However, the picture is changing and the importance of agriculture has
declined significantly over recent years. In the early 1970s, the three
principal export crops of tea, rubber and coconut comprised about 70 per
cent of foreign earnings. But, as emphasis has shifted towards manufactured
exports, earnings from plantation produce dropped to below 30 per cent.
Textiles have overtaken tea as the island's principal export.
As Sri Lanka has moved towards an open economy and emphasised export-led
development, donors have expressed concern that the government does not have
a clear agricultural policy. The World Bank's latest country report says:
'Recently, the amount of attention agriculture, particularly the non-tree
crop sector, has received from policy makers has been limited to fragmented
and piecemeal discussions at project level.'
Some thought has been given to reform of the tea estates, which for too long
have been poorly managed and a burden on the treasury. But little has been
done to arrest the continued decline of the other two tree crops - rubber
and coconut. Exports of these have steadily fallen behind Sri Lanka's main
international competitors.
Last year production of rubber fell to 104m kg, the lowest level since 1962.
The area under cultivation has declined and replanting by estates and
smallholders alike has been at best sporadic. The performance of coconut has
varied with fluctuating prices and weather conditions, but insufficient
replanting has also affected yields.
In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on the development of minor
export crops. These are often cultivated as mixed crops on small patches of
land, thereby limiting the government's influence over production. Crops
such as coffee, cocoa, cinnamon, cardamom, mace, pepper, chilles, cloves and
citronella are grown on a relatively small scale, but together account for
some 4 per cent of total exports.
There has also been a move to encourage the export of cut flowers and
perishable fruits and vegetables, especially to the Maldives and the Middle
East. Sales of cut flowers have been impressive, but the island's
infrastructure has proved inadequate to cope with the large-scale export of
fruit and vegetables. Traders report that produce, battered about in
unrefrigerated lorries on poor-quality roads, often arrives in Colombo in a
damaged state. As much as 40 per cent may be unfit for sale.
Development of agro-industry has been hampered by similar constraints as
well as by laws forbidding private ownership of more than 50 acres of land.
Exporters often cannot meet bulk orders and attempts to combine disparate
smallholdings into co-operative suppliers have met with limited success. The
varying quality of produce has proved a particular stumbling block.
Nonetheless, the government is keen to exploit the potential of
non-traditional crops and there is a general desire, as one local landowner
puts it, to 'move from the bazaar trade to an industrial scale'. He singles
out the growth of the canned fruit and fruit juice industry but cautions:
'They're not making a dent in the international market in terms of the Del
Montes.'
In the non-export sector, food crops are dominated by Sri Lanka's staple,
paddy. Rice production has risen dramatically over the past 30 years thanks
largely to a range of incentives offered under the Jayawardene government of
1977-88, and to the increasing availability of fertiliser.
Output rose from 600,000 tons in 1960 to a peak of 2.7m tons in 1985, a
level just short of self-sufficiency. Since then paddy production has fallen
away slightly, owing mainly to the impact of the separatist war in the north
and east. Production last year was 2.4m tons.
The reduction of land under effective cultivation has been partly offset by
the accelerated Mahaweli diversion programme, a large-scale project
comprising dams, reservoirs, power stations and a network of irrigation
channels. The scheme, now complete, will provide irrigation to more than
250,000 ha.
Overall, donor officials say the government should be doing more to give a
clear lead in agricultural policy. They fear that dialogue between farmers
and the central administration has broken down, particularly since the
recent phasing out of extension workers.
There should, they say, be clearer direction given to farmers in the
agro-export business. The process of putting smallholders in touch with
appropriate markets needs to be greatly improved.
'Agriculture is not a sexy subject,' says one donor official. 'In their push
to become the Singapore of South Asia, they may be in danger of forgetting
where their roots are.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (15): Long tradition of democracy -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS of civil conflict have put Sri Lanka's democratic system under severe
strain, but the country has somehow managed to maintain the integrity of
civilian rule.
Sri Lanka has a long democratic tradition, with the introduction of
universal suffrage in 1931 when the country was still a British colony.
Under the 1978 constitution, the president carries considerable authority
within government and over the 225-seat parliament. He can hold any cabinet
portfolio and has the power to dismiss ministers or parliament at will.
In spite of such far-reaching powers, President Ranasinghe Premadasa has had
to fight off two assaults on his authority since being elected in December
1988.
Last year, the main opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and a faction
within the ruling United National Party combined in an attempt to impeach Mr
Premadasa on 24 accounts of alleged abuse of power. The impeachment failed,
as did a move by the SLFP to annul the results of the 1988 national
elections.
The moves underlined Mr Premadasa's status as an 'outsider' in modern Sri
Lankan politics. All elected presidents and prime ministers since
independence have been products of elite Colombo schools except for Mr
Premadasa.
The president, a deeply religious, orthodox Buddhist, reacts to the jibes of
Sri Lanka's elite with a self-assured disdain.
He was born from the same underprivileged section of society from which the
People's Liberation Front (JVP) insurgents garnered their support.
Perhaps for this reason, there is a belief that Mr Premadasa, who played a
key role in crushing the 1986-89 JVP insurgency, was chosen to lead the UNP
merely to meet the needs of the hour.
The president has said as much. Of the attempt to impeach him, Mr Premadasa
told a visiting European human rights team that his predicament was best
understood in terms of Sinhalese cooking. To flavour rice, cooks place a
leaf called rumpay in the rice; once it is ready, the rumpay is thrown away.
Mr Premadasa is not likely to be so easily discarded.
The failure of the impeachment has strengthened the president's political
position. The SLFP, the main Sinhalese opposition, has meanwhile turned
increasingly to internecine fighting.
Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, former prime minister and SLFP leader, has suffered
a recent illness and is a ghost of her former self. Two of her children are
now fighting for political control of the party.
Ms Chandrika Kumaranatunge, Mrs Bandaranaike's daughter, is the widow of
movie-star politician, Mr Vijay Kumaranatunge, the assassinated leader of
the Sri Lanka People's Party.
Her younger brother is Mr Anura Bandaranaike, London-educated, moderate and
a parliamentarian through and through. He made an able opposition leader in
the years when his mother was out of politics, stripped of her civic rights
by former President Jayawardene after the UNP 1977 election victory.
'The people. . . seem to trust and respect certain families that have served
them well in the past,' says Mr Bandaranaike, but he admits to a running
dispute with his mother.
'My complaint is that she hasn't held an election in the party for well over
a decade. How can we demand the full restoration of democracy from the
Premadasa regime when we do not practise democracy in our own party?' he
asks.
His mother disagrees: 'Anura is in too much of a hurry. He is being used by
a dangerous element that has infiltrated the party.'
This is a reference to the 'Hela Uramaya', a caucus of about 25 MPs in the
SLFP's 67-strong parliamentary group. The group resists any serious offer of
devolution to the Tamils in the north and east, the only possible basis for
an end to the war.
There are also a number of minor opposition parties, both Sinhalese, Tamil
and religious.
The island's newest party, the Democratic United National Front (DUNF), is a
breakaway faction of the ruling UNP formed from 13 MPs, including three
former ministers expelled for alleged involvement in the attempted
impeachment.
The DUNF is still not clear on tactical choices. If it fields its own
candidate at the 1994 presidential polls, it could help the SLFP to offer a
serious challenge to Mr Premadasa.
The Supreme Court order rejecting Mrs Bandaranaike's petition to annul the
1988 polls wrecked the calculations of both the SLFP and the DUNF, which
were hoping for presidential and parliamentary elections by next January.
There are also four small Sinhalese parties, with a history of Marxist
affiliation, grouped under the United Socialist Alliance banner. On a good
day the socialists can round up 13 MPs.
Although the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are barred from official
politics, there are several influential Tamil parties in parliament.
Distinct from the Tamil communities in the north and east provinces are
those Tamils concentrated in the plantations of the central highlands. They
are identified as 'Indian' Tamils, descendants of the labour brought from
south India by British tea companies last century.
Their trade union, the Ceylon Workers Congress, is the island's largest
union, founded and still led by Mr S. Thondaman, minister of tourism. The
CWC has three seats in parliament, but can deliver 300,000-400,000 votes in
a presidential contest. It thus remains a decisive voting block.
There is also the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students which has 13
seats. Its MPs are hardly seen in parliament, largely because the party has
close ties with the Tigers.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (16): Plenty of potential for expansion
 -Textiles industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT content with the steady income he earns from practising law, Mr Tilak
Gunawardana has turned his hand to designing pillow cases and bedspreads. He
sends his designs to a team of young women scattered around the country who,
working from home, produce samples to be displayed at international trade
fairs.
Mr Gunawardana's export turnover was a modest Dollars 14,000 last year, but
he is keen to tap into what he believes is an industry with plenty of
potential for expansion.
Clothing and textiles, Sri Lanka's star export over the past decade,
accounts for more than half of manufactured export earnings. Growth remains
strong. Last year earnings were about Dollars 850m; a 27 per cent rise on
1990.
However, structural problems remain. Most local fabric, produced on narrow
looms, is unsuitable for clothing manufacturers, necessitating the import of
cloth. About 75 per cent of gross earnings are spent on importing fabric,
buttons and zippers.
Mr David Thurairajah, consultant to the Apparel Exporters Association,
believes the development of a domestic fabrics industry is crucial to the
continued success of the garment sector. 'Our main competitors are
Bangladesh and Vietnam, which both have an abundant supply of low-cost
labour,' he says. 'Therefore we must develop an indigenous fabrics base to
make sure our prices remain competitive.'
The government started a programme of 'backward integration' in 1990, using
tax incentives to encourage the establishment of high-quality textile mills.
Since then 15 mills have been set up. They now produce nearly 50m sq m of
the 300m sq m the country requires.
Mr Thurairajah believes that Sri Lanka will have the capacity to produce
most of the fabric needed within the next five years, boosting the
industry's net foreign exchange gain from 25 per cent to 75 per cent.
'Prospects for the industry are good, as long as we are not dependent on
imports,' he says.
Indeed, the government is basing much of its hope for economic growth on the
sector. Earlier this year President Ranasinghe Premadasa launched a drive to
set up 200 garment factories in rural areas, a move intended to boost
exports and provide employment for up to 100,000 people.
'The main object,' according to Mr Thurairajah, 'is the industrialisation of
undeveloped areas to provide employment for the poorest of the poor.'
Significant pressure has been put on established garment companies to set up
parallel factories in the countryside. Banks have been encouraged to help
with financing.
Companies that set up rural factories will be exempt from corporate tax and
will be given access to lucrative EC and US textile quotas. Accusations of
'arm-twisting' have been heard in some quarters.
No new garment factories are to be set up in the free trade zones. In 1990,
some 67 per cent of gross export earnings in the zones derived from the
textile, garment and leather industries, leading to fears of saturation.
The establishment of rural factories is an important element of the
government's strategy of 'industry at the periphery'. The Premadasa
administration is highly sensitive to the build-up of rural resentment which
contributed to left-wing uprisings in 1971 and 1987-89.
'The aim is to have balanced development,' according to a senior government
official. 'The rural sector was suffering from unemployment and it would be
too costly to bring everyone to the capital. Setting up factories in the
countryside is a way of taking the weight off Colombo's infrastructure.
There is no compulsion. What we are trying to do is to give incentives.'
A finance ministry official admits: 'The incentives are some form of
compulsion. A classic failure of market forces is the tendency for industry
to concentrate on urban centres.'
Of the 200 garment factories that are supposed to be operational by the end
of the year, 73 are being built with eight already in production. Government
officials admit that only half the target will be reached.
On the whole, Sri Lanka remains an attractive country for foreign textile
companies. Hong Kong-based Unisouth Holdings is just one company relocating
its factory there. The advantages, according to a local representative, are
generous tax incentives and a well-educated labour force. Wages for a
semi-skilled worker in Sri Lanka are about Dollars 40-Dollars 45 a month,
nearly 10 times cheaper than equivalent labour in Hong Kong.
In the longer-term, however, most observers feel that Sri Lanka needs to
move away from the cheaper end of the market to the production of more
expensive items. 'We havn't yet developed the necessary skills to
manufacture high-quality articles of clothing,' admits Mr Thurairajah. 'But
we are gradually moving upmarket.'
Ms Monika Kinzebach, a designer on a German-funded project to advise Sri
Lanka's textiles industry, agrees that the country needs to move upmarket.
'Sri Lanka has the potential to develop its textile exports because things
can be produced here that would be too expensive to make in Europe. But, at
the moment, there is a lack of knowledge of the international market and
they are using designs that are difficult to sell.'
Mr Gunawardana, meanwhile, is working on ambitious plans for new ranges to
market in the trade fairs of Europe and Japan. He feels he may be on the
verge of big things. However, he is not giving up his legal practice just
yet.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (12): A group to be proud of / Profile
of Ceylinco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lalith Kotelawala, chairman of the Ceylinco Group, is one of Sri Lanka's
most colourful businessmen. His boardroom walls are hung with pictures of
great corporate moments: Mr Kotelawala with Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the South
African diamonds magnate; Mr Kotelawala accepting an award from President
Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The Ceylinco chairman has reason to be proud of his achievements. The group,
which has no holding company, consists of 35 companies, four public, with
interests ranging from banking and insurance to tourism and diamond cutting.
With about 7,000 employees, Ceylinco has a turnover of more than SLRs5bn a
year.
Mr Kotelawala remembers with bitterness the period 1961-1977 when the
government nationalised many of the group's business interests, including
insurance and graphite mining.
The government also undertook a policy of import substitution, which led Sri
Lanka to produce a profusion of low quality goods.
'You make your own razor blades, which don't cut your beard but cut your
face,' Mr Kotelawala explains.
He says the government now understands the needs of business and cites as an
example his group's investment in hotels which would not have been
contemplated except for the generous tax holidays offered by government.
Mr Kotelawala suggests the government should now go further: 'Sri Lanka
should make itself income tax free'.
While many businessmen successfully elude the inefficient tax authorities,
they do not invest the undisclosed earnings into the productive sector.
As Mr Kotelawala explains, if such a person 'buys shares or puts the money
in the bank, he gets exposed and the tax people are after him'.
Other corporate executives describe Mr Kotelawala as an astute businessman.
In 1988 the group started Seylan Bank which last year took over the Sri
Lankan subsidiary of the disgraced Bank of Credit and Commerce International
following its closure, covering fully all BCCI depositors.
Mr Kotelawala says deposits were held by 'very poor Sri Lankans who had
worked in the Middle East and they would have lost their entire savings'.
BCCI also owned some prime land in central Colombo on which Ceylinco is
planning to build a SLRs600m residential and office complex.
Seylan has, however, been criticised by its competitors who allege it has
invested much of its funds in risk-free government securities, instead of
on-lending to business sectors. It is a charge Mr Kotelawala strongly
denies.
'We have gone into the rural branches, which we wouldn't have done if we
were purely profit-oriented'. He admits, however, the other banks are 'very
angry with us. In 3 1/2 years we have outstripped. . . all the other banks
in Sri Lanka'.
Mr Kotelawala says the group's success has been built around a forward
thinking approach to management. He promotes strictly on merit, so that 'on
my board of directors, there are people who started as security officers. We
have managers who began as messengers'.
He says each subsidiary pays 5 per cent of its profits every month as
bonuses to employees and claims 15 strike-free years following a decision to
set up a group trade union, of which Mr Kotelawala is patron.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (11): Reassuring safeguards / Profile of
John Keels Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE John Keels Group is among Sri Lanka's largest. It has expanded rapidly
over the past three years.
With its interests ranging from financial services and tourism to fresh
mushrooms and processed meat, the pre-tax profits of John Keels Holding, the
parent company, have risen from SLRs27m in 1989-90 to SLRs90m in 1991-92.
The group, which had a market capitalisation of SLRs6.25bn at the end of
March, has nearly 50 subsidiary companies. The holding company is listed on
the Colombo Stock Exchange, as are several of its subsidiaries, with 20 per
cent of its shares actively traded.
The company stresses that its corporate rules and structure protect public
shareholders' interests.
No private shareholder or any of their immediate family holds more than a 10
per cent stake in the holding company. All employees must retire at the age
of 60 and no member of management 'shall bring their children into the
company. It is an employee-driven company,' explains Mr K. Balendra,
chairman of John Keels Holding.
In addition, all the unlisted subsidiaries are owned in the name of the
parent company and not by individual shareholders.
'There can be no criticism that money is being moved to unlisted companies
in the group in which an individual holds a stake,' explains Mr Balendra.
Such safeguards are reassuring in Asia, where listed companies have
sometimes been used by private majority shareholders as a way of entering
the capital market, in order to raise finance for personal business
interests.
Critics of John Keels say the group has grown primarily through acquisition
and has yet to show it has the available expertise to manage its range of
business.
Its last big acquisition was in April 1991 when the group purchased the
Whittalls group of companies for SLRs330m, which included two hotels, an
insurance company, a printing press, and food and beverage factories.
John Keels says, however, the acquisition has not yet given the returns it
was expecting. Instead, the sharp rise in profitability has come from
sectors such as tourism which have picked up markedly since 1989 and in
which the group has a large exposure.
Over the past three years the pre-tax earnings of the holding company have
risen 256 per cent, 88 per cent and 97 per cent. Mr Balendra accepts these
were 'exceptional figures.'
'We're not going to sustain these rates of increase', he says. Instead, he
predicts a rise in pre-tax earnings this year of 40 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (10): Tackling poverty - Janasaviya
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Susil Sirivardana, commissioner of the Janasaviya (Poverty Alleviation)
Programme, laughed at the suggestion that he was a frustrated revolutionary.
After two hours discussing the plight of Sri Lanka's poor and the inequities
of its elite, this was a rare moment of light relief.
The Janasaviya programme, with a 1992 budget of SLRs4.9bn, was developed by
government in response to the 1987-89 People's Liberation Front (JVP)
left-wing insurgency. 'The JVP comes from the frustrated, polarised,
educated, rural youth,' explains Mr Sirivardana, who says that 15 years of
liberal economic policy has 'produced a polarisation of society and a
decline in human development'.
In the 1988 election, President Ranasinghe Premadasa ran on a platform of
poverty alleviation which promised to 'put people first, especially the poor
and the poorest of the poor'.
Janasaviya is the fulfilment of that promise and in Mr Sirivardana - who
participated and was jailed for his part in a JVP-inspired insurrection in
1971 - Mr Premadasa has chosen an emotionally committed administrator.
'With Janasaviya we told the poor 'This is not the old politicised, corrupt,
crooked, deal you are revolting against. If you are revolting against social
injustice, here you can create justice',' says Mr Sirivardana.
The programme involves almost 350,000 families and provides two forms of
government support. The families receive a a monthly entitlement of
SLRs1,458 with which to purchase specified consumer goods, such as food and
clothing, from co-operatives. In return, each family is asked to put in 20
days of community-related work.
Then, after two years on the programme, families become entitled to a
SLRs25,000 Janasaviya Entitlement Certificate. While this is not available
as cash, it pays interest of SLRs250 a month and can be pledged to a bank as
collateral for a loan.
In 1989, its first year of operation, the programme attracted the ire of the
World Bank. In its latest Sri Lanka report, the bank said Janasaviya
initially suffered 'two major shortcomings. . . First, it was not well
targeted to the poor. . . Second, the supposed production-orientation of the
programme was missing'.
Janasaviya has since been restructured. The screening process for deserving
families has been improved and the Janasaviya Trust, funded by donors
including the World Bank, has been set up to identify civil works projects.
These range from crop cultivation to local infrastructure projects.
According to the bank's report, the trust should ensure that 'those refusing
to participate in a productive activity would be dropped from the programme
immediately'. Mr Sirivardana recognises that the World Bank views some of
the programme's components as welfare and subsidy. 'It's not that for us',
he says.
He argues that Sri Lanka has suffered adverse domestic effects - a worsening
incidence of poverty and a deterioration in health and education services -
in its effort to become internationally competitive. 'I see it definitely as
a policy failure and preventable,' he says.
The criticism,which is not new of World Bank-sponsored economic adjustment
programmes, is supported by the facts. Between 1981 and 1985, the share of
national household income of the poorest third of the population dropped
from 15 per cent to 11 per cent, while the richest third grew from 52 per
cent to 62 per cent.
In the same period, economists estimate the purchasing power of the poorest
third of the population declined by about 10 per cent. In terms of minimum
calory requirements, a quarter of Sri Lanka's population remains below the
poverty line.
This is despite Sri Lanka's notable achievements in the sectors of health
and education. The nation retains probably the highest literacy rate of all
developing countries, with about 90 per cent of the population above the age
of 10 years officially literate.
Sri Lanka also has an impressive health record with an infant mortality rate
of just 19 in 1,000 live births. Almost 90 per cent of children receive
standard immunisation.
In part, this is the legacy of the 1950-70 period when, for example,
government expenditure on education averaged 5 per cent of gross domestic
product (GDP). By the early 1980s it had dropped to 2.3 per cent of GDP.
During the last JVP insurgency, the universities were closed for two years
and schools and hospitals were severely disrupted. Mr M. D. Pieris,
secretary of the Ministry of Health, explains: 'The JVP could, just by
rumour or anonymous letter, shut down whole institutions'.
The government has since taken steps to reverse the decline and the
education budget is currently 3 per cent of GDP. Mr Pieris says the
government would spend more if the continuing Tamil conflict were solved and
the defence budget reduced. But the most important element of the
government's social initiative is the Janasaviya programme, providing a
safety net for the country's most disadvantaged.
Janasaviya officials query, however, whether the programme is a short-term
holding effort - a political response to the JVP exigency - or if it can
become a comprehensive effort to, in Mr Sirivardana's words, 'change the
social order; empower the poor'. Despite his energy and conviction, Mr
Sirivardana concedes that the future for Sri Lanka's poor remains dim. He
reluctantly accepts that 'investment by the poor in itself is insufficient
to take them out of the poverty trap.
'You've got to have an active support system' including an effective
agricultural extension service, he says. This, he notes, is not in place.
The World Bank's assessment in its report is blunt: 'No matter how much
emphasis the government puts. . . in its Janasaviya programme and other
policy areas, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty altogether'.
The Janasaviya programme, Mr Sirivardana insists, has had important benefits
by 'generating a great deal of hope among the poor and those who care for
them'.
But the question he asks - 'Are we as a country prepared to live with so
many poor?' - remains unanswered.

Increased interest payable and exceptional charges related to the carrying

At the operating level, profits improved to Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 243,000),
but the charge of Pounds 215,000 against the company's former retail chain
of seven properties and interest payable of Pounds 516,000 (Pounds 423,000)
saw the pre-tax deficit deepen to Pounds 405,000 (Pounds 180,000).
Mr Peter Bailey, chairman, said that the high level of short-term borrowing
should fall as trading improved. However trading since the period-end had
been 'disappointing'.
Turnover fell to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 7.84m) reflecting rationalisation.
Losses per share worked through at 2.12p (0.95p). The interim dividend is
again passed and there will be no final distribution.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dumas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned reconstruction of Dumas Group, involving the acquisition of a
substantial private company, has fallen through.
The importer and distributor of speciality foods has therefore re-activated
earlier discussions under which a group of private investors would take part
in a financial and managerial reorganisation.
A basis has been agreed for recommending proposals to shareholders of the
USM-quoted company and a circular is expected shortly.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wiggins losses at Pounds 9.21m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP INCREASES in losses were reported by Wiggins Group, the commercial and
residential property developer which survived the collapse of its Docklands
development at the cost of virtually all its working capital, for the year
to March 31 1992.
At the pre-tax level losses escalated from Pounds 2.54m to Pounds 9.21m. The
figure was struck after exceptional losses of Pounds 6.07m (Pounds 914,000)
including Pounds 6m from the south western housebuilding subsidiary.
Negotiations may shortly be concluded for the disposal of the south western
company which will have the effect of cutting the net asset deficiency by
Pounds 3m to Pounds 7m.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 7.98m (Pounds 11.5m). Losses per share amounted
to 77.9p, compared with 15.7p.
The group continued to trade even at its current level, only with the
support of its banks and creditors.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Invesco in landmark cash pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM's agreement yesterday to pay Pounds 9.5m cash compensation to
investors in Drayton Consolidated Trust marks the first time a fund manager
has compensated shareholders of an investment trust under its control.
'It was maladministration in the widest sense. It was wrongful management,'
said one of the advisers retained to assist in the reorganisation of
Drayton. In short, Invesco MIM loaned nearly Pounds 40m to an unquoted
Scottish confectionary company, Alma Holdings, nursing a 14 per cent stake
valued at Pounds 3m. But Drayton shareholders never fully knew the extent of
exposure, in part because as new loans were being extended old ones were
being written down.
Other Invesco MIM clients held stakes in Alma but were not asked to lend
funds to help it survive. Drayton shareholders were shoring up the value of
other MIM client's investments while diluting their own equity stake.
'The directors did not feel they were fully informed at the time,' said Mr
Nicholas Cobbald, a director at Drayton Consolidated. Mr Cobbald said
Drayton was entitled to seek compensation from Invesco MIM because 'they
should have been informed and that was why there was a settlement,'
The affairs of Drayton have focused attention on the relationship between
investment trust company boards and the investment managers which invest
their funds. Corporate governance, currently a concern of corporate boards,
is becoming a matter for investment trust company boards as well.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies, the industry trade
association, is quietly discussing a code of best practice for boards.
'We are looking into whether it is sensible,' said a spokesman for the AITC.
Industry insiders, however, said an association committee is already working
on such a code. But there is widespread disagreement about just how far the
code should intrude into current practices.
Issues under discussion include the extent to which fund managers should be
represented on an investment trust's board, the role of non-executive
directors and whether trusts should bear the name of the fund manager in
their title.
At Drayton, only two Invesco MIM employees were on on the Drayton board.
They were Lord Stevens, Invesco's chairman and chief executive and Mr
Alexander Reid, its investment manager.
As one of Drayton's advisers notes, as the fund moved away from the listed
shares which had been its traditional investments and into the unquoted
investments which proved its downfall, it made no effort to seek experts in
the unquoted sector for its own board.
Significantly, the advisers to Drayton say, the cash payment to shareholders
is not compensation for mere bad judgement by fund manager Invesco.
Other investment trusts, particularly in the unquoted sector, have made
disasterous investments as well with no corresponding demand for payment
from shareholders.
The lessons of Drayton have been expensive for Invesco MIM. Its chief
executive, Lord Stevens, who was also the chairman of Drayton, was forced to
resign, partly due to the affair.
The settlement, giving shareholders 85p cash per share, will also create a
new investment trust, Second Consolidated, with net asset value of 158p per
share.
Mr Hamish Buchan, investment trust company analyst at County NatWest Wood
Mackenzie, said that without the package, Drayton, whose shares once had a
net asset value of over 400p, would have had a net asset value of 26p per
share.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Aiming to shake the shabby out of Habitat -
The history and future of a sixties trendsetter which lost its way in the
eighties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY WHO grew up in the post-Habitat era can possibly imagine what it was
like to try to furnish a house before the youthful Terence Conran opened his
very first Habitat store in Fulham Road, London in the dazzling spring of
1964.
If middle-class Britain had a furnishing style in those post-war years, it
was either hand-me-down Brideshead or department store repro.
In the late eighties it became fashionable to mock it, to make jolly little
jokes about Shabitat, and to avow one never went near the place.
But its arrival marked a turning point in the tastes and life-styles of the
middle-classes. For the first time there was somewhere where they could go
where nothing jarred, where the salad bowls were perfectly turned, the
casseroles were authentic peasant ware from Provence, and where even the
wooden spoons seemed to evoke a simpler, better, more sun-filled way of
life.
Sir Terence's peculiar talent was for turning his own tastes and life-style,
his nostalgia for French rustic life, into a highly commercial operation so
that middle-class urban dwellers in Islington and Chelsea came to fill their
homes with chicken bricks and tangines, with pale pine tables and petits
pots a la creme.
The single store blossomed into a chain, the chain prospered but, as Ian
Renwick, head of corporate communications at Habitat, puts it: 'Three years
ago we fell off a precipice.' Profits plunged leading to losses of Pounds
8.8m in 1989 and Pounds 11.9m in 1990. Somewhere along the road the dream
had gone wrong.
In recent months it has been no secret that Storehouse, the parent company,
had been looking for a buyer. Now we know that Stichting Ingka Foundation,
the trust started by Ingvar Kamprad, founder of Ikea, the Swedish furnishing
chain, has bought it.
At Habitat headquarters the mood is buoyant.
'We can now get on with running the business,' says Vittorio Radice,
recently installed as managing director, after two years with the group
first as merchandise manager and then as buying director. 'Without any
politics, with no looking at short-term profit. The Foundation sees the
future of Habitat very much as we do and is prepared to invest in the
future.
'The Foundation sees Habitat and Ikea as two completely separate brands and
we will be run quite separately from Ikea. Whereas Ikea goes in for 200,000
sq ft self-service style stores, eventually I want all our stores to revert
to being smaller, fully serviced stores with high quality sales staff.'
Out has gone the mail order (too down-market), out the polyester bedlinen
(nothing but 100% cotton bedlinen from now on), out the melamine and the
self-assembly furniture ('unless a piece of furniture is born to be
self-assembly').
'Already,' says Mr Radice, 'we have turned the corner. Sometime around May
last year it seemed to happen.'
He waves yesterday's figures jubilantly. 'Just look at this - yesterday we
were 26 per cent ahead of the same Sunday last year whilst for the whole
week we are 7.4 per cent ahead of the equivalent week last year. Habitat is
in line to return to profit.'
Quite why and how the chain lost its way, or more accurately, failed to
evolve, is a matter of some dispute.
Mr Radice is in no doubt. 'Habitat today could be the best home furnishings
chain in the world if the original concept hadn't been murdered. When
Terence Conran first opened stores they were in beautiful buildings - a
restored church in Tunbridge Wells, a 1920s cinema in London's King's Road,
a grand hotel in Bristol, an old Spitfire factory in Manchester - all these
were wonderful, individual, special to their towns.
'Then they started opening in huge sheds in edge of town sites, next door to
B&amp;Q, MFI, Do-It-All. They even opened seven Habitat stores in BhS. All this
diluted the image, took it down-market. I think that was a tremendous
mistake.
'When I arrived I asked whom they saw as their competition. The Reject Shop,
MFI and John Lewis I was told. I knew at once I had to do something.'
What Vittorio Radice is determined to do it is to win back the market it
should never have lost in the first place.
'We aim to have 50 stores in this country, of which 20 will be new and
another 10 of the existing stores will be relocated. It will be an
evolutionary process with, I hope, no redundancies. In fact we hope to
create jobs.
'I want the stores to be no bigger than 10,000 sq ft, small enough to retain
an individual, characterful mood, with each store listening closely to the
needs of its own customers.'
Habitat is, if you like, returning to its roots, going back, after a painful
detour, to where it all began. Those who remember the original Habitat store
in the Fulham Road, where Joseph stands today, remember one really terrific
shop showing what it could be like if everything was all of a piece, if one
consistent, sure taste lay behind it all.
Times have moved on, tastes have changed, but the original blueprint is
still Mr Radice's guiding light. 'I remember when I was with AMC Milan (a
large Italian furniture buying organisation where Mr Radice worked for seven
years) I used to come from Italy just to see Habitat because it was the
retailing phenomenon of its time. Then in the mid 1980s I stopped coming.
Well, I want people like me to feel they have to come and see what Habitat
is up to again.'

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Onerous disposal problem for Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STICHTING Ingka Foundation, Habitat's purchaser, may be a charitable
institution but it is certainly no slouch when it comes to tough talking.
Although the purchase price of Pounds 78m - including repayment of Pounds
24m of inter-company debt - was Pounds 7m above Habitat's net book value,
SIF succeeded in leaving Storehouse with some onerous responsibilities for
disposing of unwanted properties.
Storehouse is taking an extraordinary provision of Pounds 5m to cover the
cost of closing an unspecified number of Habitat stores should Habitat
subsequently decide it does not want to trade from them or chooses to
relocate elsewhere. This also includes some sites which have already ceased
trading.
Mr David Simons, finance director, said it might take up to two years to
dispose of these properties although he emphasised that the Pounds 5m
provision was a conservative estimate that reflected the maximum potential
liability.
Separately, Storehouse has also agreed to retain the freehold and leasehold
interests of several other properties which have a book value of Pounds 14m.
Storehouse will continue to receive rental income from the tenants until it
can dispose of these properties to institutional investors.
'One of the bits of baggage that Habitat has been carrying around has been
that quite a lot of the stores are in poor locations. We could not expect
Ikea to take them all on,' said Mr Simons.
Overall, the effect of disposing of Habitat and Richards will lead to a
reduction of Pounds 20m in shareholders funds but a Pounds 100m net cash
inflow.
Mr Simons, who was responsible for straightening out the group's tangled
balance sheet, has amicably agreed to leave next March. He will be succeeded
by Mr Graham Rider, finance director of BhS.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Heseltine raises hopes on coal jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, held out some hope for
miners threatened by pit closures yesterday by promising that his planned
energy review would take account of employment prospects in the coal
industry.
Announcing details of the review, he said it would be wide-ranging and open,
and would culminate in a white paper on energy policy in the new year.
He said the main purpose would be to consider each of the 21 pits left on
the closure list in the context of overall energy policy, 'including the
consequences of that policy for British Coal and the employment prospects
for the industry'.
He would want to ensure that the case for closure of each pit 'had been
fully made'. Terms of reference for the review were:
Whether the prospects for coal had been correctly assessed. Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, would be consulted to see
whether any company was abusing its position in the market.
The consequences of the 'dash for gas' in power generation, how gas compared
to coal in cost and the size of the UK's gas reserves.  The implications of
the statutory obligation on electricity distributors to buy a proportion of
power from sources other than coal, oil and gas - which would also include
nuclear power.
The opportunities for private-sector production of coal and the position of
coal imports.
Regional needs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Mr Heseltine said talks would take place with the providers and consumers of
energy, trade unions and other interested parties.
Independent consultants would be appointed to report on the prospects for
British Coal, to look at its competitiveness and at alternative markets for
coal.
Mr Heseltine is to appear this afternoon before the Commons all-party select
committee on trade and industry, which is conducting an inquiry of its own.
The deadline for submissions to the DTI is December 1.

FT  27 OCT 92 / DTI admits company chief worked for MI6
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP Whitehall official yester-day admitted that the managing director of a
UK machine tools exporter worked for MI6, the intelligence service, to
gather information on Iraq's nuclear programme.
Ministers also approved the continued export of equipment by Midlands-based
Matrix Churchill to one of Iraq's main defence procurement agencies a year
before the invasion of Kuwait in order to preserve the intelligence link, he
said.
Giving evidence at the trial at London's Old Bailey of three former Matrix
Churchill directors, who face charges of breaching export regulations, Mr
Eric Beston, an assistant secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry,
agreed that one reason ministers approved an export licence for Matrix
Churchill in early 1989 was to maintain an intelligence source within the
company.
He did not know at the time the source was Mr Paul Henderson, then managing
director, and only learnt this when Customs officials began to gather
material to bring the prosecution, he said.
Mr Beston's admission followed an earlier revelation by Mr Henderson's QC
who said that the former head of Matrix Churchill worked for MI6 and helped
gather information about President Saddam Hussein's attempt to develop a
nuclear bomb.
Mr Geoffrey Robertson, QC, said that the approval by ministers of the export
licences of machine tools destined for military use enabled Matrix Churchill
to survive as a company and Mr Henderson to continue acting for MI6. The
Iraqi-owned Matrix Churchill went into receivership earlier this year.
Mr Henderson, Mr Peter Allen, the company's former sales director, and Mr
Trevor Abraham, the former commercial director, all deny four counts of
breaching export regulations between July 1988 and August 1990. The
prosecution has alleged the three men deceived the DTI by pretending machine
tools and computer software exported to Iraq were for civilian, not military
use.
Some of the equipment exported by Matrix Churchill was sold to the Iraqi
company Nassr, which the government knew played a major role in the Iraqi
defence procurement programme, Mr Robertson told the court.
The two companies were connected, with Dr Safa Al Hobobi being the chairman
of Matrix Churchill and a director of Nassr. This connection was known to
the DTI, Mr Beston agreed.
According to a secret Foreign Office memo, evidence existed linking Dr
Hobobi with the Iraqi nuclear programme, the court heard.
Mr Robertson asked if the main reason for ministers granting the export
licences was so the intelligence service could continue to have access to Dr
Hobobi's intelligence network through Matrix Churchill. 'That was one of the
considerations,' Mr Beston said.
Mr Beston also agreed that it was known both within the DTI and by ministers
that the goods to be exported would be used in Iraqi munitions factories. He
also agreed that Mr Abraham had told DTI officials that most of the machine
tools exported would be used for munitions production.
Earlier, Mr David Bryars, a senior principal with the Export Credits
Guarantee Department, agreed that his department had known that Industrias
Cardoen, the Chilean intermediary in an earlier transaction, was an arms
manufacturer.
He had also got the impression that Customs officials were well aware of the
type of transactions Matrix Churchill was involved in. Press reports also
linked Matrix Churchill with the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro affair in the US
and Industrias Cardoen with the death of a British journalist, he agreed.
The trial continues today.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Tory crisis deepens over Maastricht: Senior MPs warn Major
to lift election threat - Government turmoil hits sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, ALISON SMITH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S decision to threaten a general election over the Maastricht
treaty pushed the Conservative party into fresh crisis yesterday as senior
Tory MPs bluntly warned the prime minister to step back from a confrontation
on the issue.
After an hour-long meeting of the right-wing 92 Group, government business
managers were told there was 'universal condemnation' of the threat from the
60-odd MPs in attendance and fears that it had put Mr Major's leadership at
risk.
The turmoil unnerved London's financial markets, with sterling suffering
sharp losses against both the dollar and the D-Mark. Analysts predicted the
political uncertainty would bring further losses in coming days.
But the anger among Tory MPs and a decision by the Labour party to vote with
Conservative Euro-sceptics in an attempt to defeat Mr Major in a crucial
Maastricht vote on November 4, failed to persuade Downing Street to drop the
election threat.
That stance left the prime minister starkly at odds with most Tory MPs and
many ministers. The general view at Westminster was that the decision to
raise the stakes over next week's vote was dangerous brinkmanship. It was
designed to cow potential Tory rebels against Maastricht but had needlessly
risked the prime minister's own future.
Unless Mr Major was willing to step back from a confrontation - perhaps by
framing the motion for debate next week without a specific reference to
Maastricht - he would be staking his premiership on a single vote.
As party managers at Westminster tried to work out the relative strengths of
the pro- and anti-Maastricht factions, Whitehall officials left open the
possibility of such a tactical retreat. Calculations suggest that if just 31
Tory MPs vote to oppose the government, that could be enough to defeat a
paving motion.
Senior members of the 92 Group last night said a motion calling simply for
the adjournment of the Commons - a frequently used technical device - might
avoid an unnecessary split. Another option would be to allow MPs a free
vote.
They suggested some cabinet colleagues may have been urging the prime
minister to put his future on the line over the treaty to strengthen their
own hopes for the eventual leadership.
In all, 21 MPs at the meeting were reported to have spoken against Mr
Major's stance, with nine supporting him.
Mr John Carlisle said as he left the meeting: 'The mood was one of dismay at
the way the government has handled this, and one of personal anger towards
the prime minister.'
He added: 'There was a feeling of support for the prime minister, if only on
the basis that there was nobody else.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, signalled that while his
party would continue to support the government over Maastricht, it would
oppose it on an adjournment motion.
A stream of Tory Euro-sceptics said they would ignore the prime minister's
threat, arguing that they would be voting on the timing of the ratification
of the Maastricht treaty rather than on whether they had confidence in the
government. Facing Tory charges of opportunism, Labour argued that while it
supported the treaty, it did not believe that the legislation to ratify it
should be brought back until Denmark had clarified its position.
On foreign exchange markets the pound lost nearly 3 pfennigs against the
D-Mark, to close at DM2.4425. Sterling also lost more than 2 1/2 cents
against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5870, a 17-month low against the US
currency. It slipped further in New York to DM2.4255 and Dollars 1.584.
Dealers said a worrying feature of sterling's performance was its loss of
ground against the D-Mark at a time when the dollar and other European
currencies were firming because of expectations that the Bundesbank's
official interest rates will be cut. On the stock market, the FT-SE 100
index of leading shares closed down 8.1 points at 2661.6.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Stempel bows to pressure and resigns as GM chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Stempel resigned yesterday as chairman of crisis-stricken General
Motors, bowing to pressure from fellow directors who accused him of not
moving forcefully enough to shake up the company's loss-making North
American car operations.
Mr Stempel, 59, who only became chairman in August 1990, is the first chief
executive of the world's largest manufacturing company to be ousted since Mr
William Crapo Durant, founder of GM, was forced out in 1920.
He is expected to be succeeded as chairman, on an interim basis, by Mr John
Smale, who led a boardroom coup last April by non-executive directors
concerned at the slowness of GM's revamp. Mr Smale, 65, is a former chairman
of Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group.
Mr Stempel made no reference to any direct boardroom pressures yesterday in
his resignation statement. He said merely that he could 'not in good
conscience continue to watch the effect of rumours and speculation that have
undermined and slowed the efforts of General Motors people to make this a
stronger, more efficient, effective organisation'.
He hoped his resignation would end the 'chaos of the past several weeks'.
In April Mr Smale replaced Mr Stempel as head of the board's executive
committee, while Mr Lloyd Reuss, group president and head of North America,
was replaced by Mr Jack Smith, previously responsible for GM's international
operations.
Mr Smale, acting on behalf of the GM board, said Mr Stempel had been asked
to continue as chairman until a successor was named.
GM shares, which have risen sharply since rumours of Mr Stempel's
resignation began to circulate last week, rose Dollars  3/4 to close at
Dollars 34 1/4 in New York.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: American Express tumbles into
Dollars 205m loss

<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS last night revealed a Dollars 205m third-quarter net loss
after a heavy Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge related to 4,800
planned redundancies and other measures in its core travel related services
(TRS) division.
The group's deficit, the biggest in a quarterly period since the disastrous
losses suffered by its Shearson Lehman investment banking and securities
subsidiary in early 1990, underscored what Standard and Poor's, the rating
agency, yesterday termed a negative outlook for the company.
Although it affirmed debt ratings last night, S&amp;P noted American Express's
problems with credit quality and competition in the card market.
The American Express loss, which compares with a Dollars 31m net profit a
year ago, was caused by red ink in three of its most important divisions.
The TRS division loss was Dollars 187.5m, although operating earnings were
Dollars 155m before the restructuring charge.
The American Express Bank loss was Dollars 29.8m, caused by staff reductions
and by a large jump in bad debt provisions for property loans in the UK -
from Dollars 8m a year ago to Dollars 67m.
American Express's share of Shearson Lehman's loss was Dollars 37.4m. The
investment bank and brokerage house said its quarterly loss was Dollars 25m,
compared with net profits of Dollars 63m a year ago.
The reduction of the TRS workforce by 4,800 people represents 9 per cent of
the division's 53,000 employees.
Other costs were attributed to reorganised product groupings and the need to
cut expenses.
Loss per share in the third quarter was 45 cents, against net earnings of 5
cents a year ago. The losses slashed American Express's net earnings for the
first nine months to Dollars 380m, compared to Dollars 551m in the same
period of last year.

ATLANTIC RICHFIELD (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company,
yesterday turned in higher underlying third-quarter earnings, reflecting
higher crude oil and domestic natural gas prices.
Net income for the quarter to September 30 was Dollars 332m, or Dollars 2.06
a share, against a net loss of Dollars 156m, or 99 cents, including a large
one-off charge last year. Sales and revenues rose to Dollars 4.82bn from
Dollars 4.38bn.
During the 1991 quarter, Arco took after-tax charges of about Dollars 340m
to cover job cuts, reorganisation, property sales and write-downs.
Oil and gas exploration and production brought in earnings of Dollars 232m
after tax in the 1992 quarter. A year earlier, exploration and production
had a loss of Dollars 72m, including net charges of about Dollars 180m.
Phillips Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, yesterday
posted a third-quarter profits advance, lifting net income to Dollars 99m,
or 38 cents a share, from Dollars 56m, or 21 cents. Revenues edged ahead to
Dollars 3.13bn from Dollars 3.11bn last time.
Mr C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive, said exploration and
production earnings were helped by higher prices, particularly for domestic
natural gas and natural gas liquids.
Earnings from downstream operations were hurt by higher feedstock costs and
plant turnrounds. The results, however, were distorted by extraordinary
items.
Third-quarter results from Unocal, the California-based energy group, were
muddied by one-time items which brought net income to Dollars 11m, or 1
cent, after dividends on preferred stock, compared with earnings of Dollars
9m, or 4 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, Unocal earned Dollars 65m, or 24 cents, in the
latest quarter, against Dollars 23m, or 10 cents. Revenues were Dollars
2.51bn against Dollars 2.68bn.
For the first nine months, it earned Dollars 117m, or 46 cents, on revenues
of Dollars 7.6bn, compared with Dollars 89m, or 38 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 8.13bn.
Eliminating one-time items, nine-month earnings were Dollars 143m, or 57
cents, against Dollars 96m, or 41 cents, last year.
Like Phillips, Unocal said third-quarter earnings were boosted by higher
natural gas prices. Higher crude oil prices also helped earnings.
Mr Richard Stegemeier, chairman and chief executive, said restructuring and
workforce reductions were expected to contribute Dollars 200m to after-tax
cash-flow in 1993.

RECESSION in the world airline industry was underscored yesterday when
Boeing, the leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, reported a 9 per
cent drop in third-quarter earnings.
The Seattle-based company reported net earnings of Dollars 364m, or Dollars
1.07 a share, compared to Dollars 401m, or Dollars 1.17, in the third
quarter of last year. Sales were down 10 per cent at Dollars 6.9bn.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, noted that some airline customers had asked to
reschedule orders and option delivery positions. But some of the negotiated
deferred deliveries had been offset by new orders and requests by other
customers to accelerate deliveries.
The company's firm backlog of orders at the end of the quarter stood at
Dollars 93bn, down from Dollars 97.9bn at the end of 1991.
Total announced orders for commercial jets for the first nine months were
valued at Dollars 11.5bn, down from Dollars 14.7bn in the same period of
last year. Orders for the year as a whole were expected to remain below the
1991 level 'but should result in Boeing maintaining a favourable market
share.'
For the first nine months, the company reported earnings of Dollars 1.26bn,
or Dollars 3.69 a share, on sales of Dollars 22.7bn, compared to earnings of
Dollars 1.16bn, or Dollars 3.39, in the same period of last year on sales of
Dollars 21.6bn. The group expects sales in calendar 1992 to total around
Dollars 30bn.
Boeing, which been spending heavily to develop its new 777 airliner, using
computer-aided design technology, said more than two-thirds of the
engineering design and planning requirements had now been released to
manufacturing.
Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed yesterday declined to comment on
reports in a newspaper in Fort Worth, Texas, that General Dynamics was
offering to sell its Fort Worth division, which makes the F-16 fighter
aircraft, to Boeing or Lockheed. The unit is scheduled to build the
Pentagon's next generation fighter, the F-22, in conjunction with Lockheed
and Boeing.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Kidnap gangs hold Philippines economy to ransom: Manila's
campaign to attract new foreign investors is being undermined by a law and
order crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE officials are finding out that improving the country's economy
and taming the political opposition are not enough in attracting more
foreign investment. Efforts are being stymied by a rash of kidnap-for-ransom
incidents involving rich businessmen and their relatives.
Most of the victims have been Manila-based businessmen of Chinese descent,
along with a number of Americans and Japanese, and other expatriates in
Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Worried Chinese-Filipino traders have
taken defensive measures, and some families are packing up and taking their
assets elsewhere.
If security for businessmen is not improved and the kidnapping gangs
dismantled, the effect could be disastrous. The increasing lawlessness,
according to analysts, could be disastrous for the government's campaign to
woo new investments, deemed essential in perking up an economy that in the
first half of this year was stagnant.
The Philippines had failed to cash in on the surge in foreign investment
flows into South-East Asia in the late 1980s, owing to the repeated coup
attempts at the time that portrayed instability in the country. Missing the
boat again could permanently cripple Manila's attempt to catch up with its
fast-growing neighbours.
After the peaceful elections and orderly transfer of power some five months
ago, there has been a steady stream of trade and investment missions
visiting Manila, including Chinese companies based in Taiwan, Singapore, and
Hong Kong. However, the investors' safety has persistently surfaced as a
serious concern.
The government of Mr Fidel Ramos, who on October 8 completed his first 100
days in office as president, is aiming for an annual average of Dollars
2.5bn of investment over the six years to 1998, during which it hopes to
record average economic growth of 8 per cent a year.
At one local business presentation recently conducted by Mr Rizalino
Navarro, the trade and industry secretary, the audience of foreign diplomats
based in Manila asked mainly about specific government measures that would
ensure the safety of investors.
In the first eight months of this year, a total of 29 kidnappings were
reported to the police, most of them ending with the victims' families
paying up millions of pesos to the kidnap syndicates. No arrests have been
reported and the cases have remained unsolved.
The number of cases reported was double that in the same period three years
ago, according to an official report. Among the latest unreported cases,
according to a group of Chinese-Filipino professionals, were the kidnappings
of 22 of their group over August-September alone, and which reportedly
involved pay-offs of some 50m pesos (Dollars 2.1m) to the kidnap gangs.
Early this year, the Senate defence committee reported that in 1991 there
were about 50 kidnap-for-ransom cases, most of which had been unreported
owing to the victims' fears of further harm. The kidnappers 'earned' a total
of up to 300m pesos (Dollars 12.5m) in these activities, the report said.
Some of the payments were reportedly made abroad.
A serious stumbling block towards solving the problem is the suspected
involvement of police and military officers in the 'lucrative' kidnappings.
On the other hand, the newly organised Presidential Anti-Crime Commission
(PACC), supposedly a 'super-body' against lawlessness and headed by Mr
Joseph Estrada, the vice-president, had been hamstrung by inadequate
financing and alleged 'leaks' in its operations.
Mr Estrada was thought to have gained an important breakthrough last month
with the arrest of two senior police officers, one directly in charge of
anti-kidnapping operations. A third police officer had admitted to Mr
Estrada his involvement in kidnappings allegedly planned by the senior
officers, and has turned state witness in the court cases against the two.
The PACC has also made some arrests in recent weeks of alleged kidnap gang
members. However, the arrests represent a small proportion of a reported
total of some 40 kidnap gangs operating in metropolitan Manila alone.
Confidence in the government's drive has also been tarnished by the recent
'confession' by an arrested gang leader of the alleged involvement of some
'10 generals in the police and military in his group's activities'. This was
hastily retracted.
The police involved with the kidnappers reportedly have connections in the
local Chinese community, along with suspected members of Chinese organised
crime syndicates operating in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is alleged they
identify prospective targets for kidnapping operations. Successful
entrepreneurs active in the community as leaders are also coming under
suspicion.
The kidnapping syndicates are so sophisticated that some ransom notes are
said to be accompanied by photocopies of the victim's bank statements.
Yesterday police released a list of the 12 'most-wanted criminals' which
included a number of alleged kidnap gang leaders. On the list were
Chinese-Filipinos said to be the kidnap syndicates' connections in the
Chinese community. Big rewards were offered for their arrest. The PACC's
image was badly tarnished when a gang in late August kidnapped a Manila
businessman's son, a godson of Mr Estrada. The family refused to co-operate
with the police for fear of jeopardising the boy's safety and after several
days paid a reported 25m pesos (Dollars 1.04m).
Last month two teenage sons of Chinese-Filipino merchants were killed even
after the payment of a ransom of 1.7m pesos.
These incidents have caused anger and outrage in the Chinese-Filipino
community. However, government officials apparently have succeeded in
talking leaders of ethnic Chinese businessmen out of plans to set up
vigilante forces manned by foreign mercenaries.
Mr Ramos may also have contributed to the anxiety by declaring that he was
'not satisfied' with the performance of the PACC, which prompted an offer by
Mr Estrada to resign. Mr Ramos quickly reiterated full confidence in his
anti-crime leader and ordered immediate financing for the PACC, including
protection for witnesses. Mr Ramos, a former general who headed the
Philippine Constabulary has also declared an 'all-out war' against the
kidnap syndicates.
The outcome of that war will go a long way to determining the shape of the
country's economy in the coming years.

The Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said the structure of Japanese exports

'In order to curb the trade surplus, we need to increase domestic demand,

FT  27 OCT 92 / Danish opposition calls tune over Maastricht: Government has
to grin and bear it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I FEEL like a little boy who has had a distasteful plate of food put in
front of him and been told to eat it up,' said Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
Denmark's foreign minister last week.
The dish set before him is the 1,600-word position paper detailing the
supplements to the Maastricht treaty which Denmark requires before it can
put the treaty to a second referendum next year.
The paper is the work of three non-government parties, the Radical Liberals
(who normally count themselves as part of the minority Conservative-Liberal
coalition's parliamentary base), the Social Democratic party and the
left-wing, anti-Maastricht Socialist People's party.
These three control a majority in the Folketing, and so the government is
faced with a take-it-or-leave-it programme for negotiations with the other
11 EC states.
The two Socialist parties believe they have forged an alliance which will
enable them to topple the present government before long. 'It's only a
matter of time,' says Mr Holger Nielsen, leader of the Socialist People's
party. The Radicals, however, do not place this interpretation on the EC
compromise.
The final, official position paper which the government sends to the other
governments within the next few days may be modified slightly, but not in
any substantive way.
So, when Mr Ellemann-Jensen travels round the European capitals next month
trying to win support and understanding for the Danish position, he will to
all intents and purposes be acting as plenipotentiary for the opposition.
By the standards by which parliamentary politics normally work, the position
in Denmark is unusual.
The three-party position paper was worked out in the office of Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, the Social Democratic leader, with Mr Poul Schluter, prime
minister, and the foreign minister, as bystanders.
But this is not the first time that such a situation has arisen in Denmark.
From 1982, when Mr Schluter became prime minister, until 1988, the
government consistently had a majority of the same three parties against it
on a range of Nato-related issues.
However, because the Radicals supported the government on domestic issues,
there was never any question that the government could be brought down by a
vote of no confidence.
On the Maastricht issue, the government has accepted the opposition's
position paper with good grace as the basis for 'a national compromise'
because it regards the position paper's demands as realistic from two points
of view - as a basis for persuading the 11 to meet the Danish requirements,
and as a basis for persuading the voters to support the Maastricht treaty in
a referendum next year.
The key special arrangements which Denmark wants are well-known - no
obligation to participate in common defence policy, nor to introduce a
common currency or participate in the third stage of economic and monetary
union, no transfer of sovereignty in matters of legal and police
co-operation, and no obligation to introduce union citizenship.
To improve the way the EC works and make it more transparent, the three
parties propose open meetings of, and open voting at, the European Council,
a suggestion on which most other members are likely to choke.
They also urge speedy negotiations with applicant countries from the
European Free Trade Association and stronger contacts, with a view to
membership, with Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. They further propose
that during the Danish chairmanship of the Council, for six months from
January 1, the Copenhagen government should arrange a conference on
perspectives in the development of European co-operation.
If the Danes can obtain from the 11 the main concessions which they require
 -which cannot be taken for granted - the evidence of recent opinion polls
is that a substantial majority support the treaty next time.

He said a company would be established, possibly within six months, which
could offer shares and begin functioning in 1994.
The company, to be called the Kuwait Telecommunications Company, would take
control of local and international phone calls, fax and telex services from
the communications ministry. Mobile phones will remain in private hands, he
said.
Initially the company would be 51 per cent owned by the public and 49 per
cent by the government, the source said.
The government could then sell up to a 25 per cent stake to foreign
investors, retaining a 24 per cent stake, he said.
The equipment of the telecommunications ministry would be transferred to the
new company, the source said.
'We are in the process of evaluating our assets,' he said.
The launching of the company would be a major step in the government's
programme to privatise public services.
The investment branch of the Kuwaiti government has reported 'improprieties'
in its troubled investments in Spain and the government has referred the
case to the prosecutor-general, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
Finance minister Nasser Abdulla al-Rodhan told the official news agency KUNA
yesterday that the executive committee of the London-based Kuwait Investment
Office (KIO) disclosed the improprieties in a preliminary report.
'The finance minister has referred the subject to the prosecutor-general to
take the necessary legal measures,' KUNA added.

COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, and the Metals &amp; Minerals Research
Services consultancy organisation, have set up a joint venture to monitor
all aspects of environmental laws worldwide to assess the impact on copper,
lead and zinc production.
The venture springs from a comprehensive review by MMRS completed in July
this year which examined 700 pieces of legislation and came to the
unsettling conclusion that the three base metals industries would have to
find at least USDollars 6bn to comply with existing environmental laws.
Mr Normand Champigny, of Coopers' Toronto office, said his firm would use
its network of 700 offices in 112 countries to collect, collate and enter
into a database all environmental laws affecting base metals production. Mr
Simon Hobson of MMRS said his group would analyse these and forecast their
impact on metals producers and markets. The partners expect to release their
report in July next year and it will subsequently be updated quarterly.

GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, the Australian foods group, said Cold Storage
Holdings (CSH), its quoted Singapore subsidiary, had agreed to sell its
retail businesses to Dairy Farm International for ADollars 113m (USDollars
81m).
The sale is significant because it marks Goodman's exit from retail
activities as part of its strategy of concentrating on developing core
manufacturing businesses in Australia, Asia and Europe.
The deal, which includes 10 supermarkets, 48 pharmacies and 67 convenience
stores, will realise an extraordinary gain of ADollars 49m for CSH, which is
64 per cent owned by Goodman.
Goodman said the proceeds of the sale would be used to help finance
investment of about ADollars 200m over the next three years to expand the
group's manufacturing capacity in Singapore, Indon-esia, the Philippines and
Malaysia.
Mr Michael Nugent, Goodman's chief executive, said the sale price
represented 'a significant premium' for the retail operations.
'Strategically, the sale is very significant for Goodman because it signals
our exit from non-core retail activities and allows us to pursue our
strategy in Asia,' he said.
CSH will retain its Sunshine bakery business in Singapore, as well as a
number of other food manufacturing, whole-saling and distribution
bus-inesses in Singapore and neighbouring coun-tries.
The sale is the latest element in a restructuring intended to sharpen
Goodman's manufacturing focus following a series of disappointing results.
The group recently sold its Wattie's business in New Zealand to Heinz, the
US food group, for NZDollars 566m (USDollars 314m). It has also acquired
manufacturing companies in Australia and Europe.

OJI Paper and Jujo Paper, two leading Japanese paper manufacturers, are
being hit by weak demand for newsprint and high-quality paper for financial
institu-tions.
Yesterday they announced falls in non-consolidated sales and earnings for
the six months to September (see table).
For the year, Oji forecasts pre-tax profits will fall 8.1 per cent to
Y11.4bn (Dollars 93.4m) on a 3.7 per cent fall in sales.
Jujo, which is to merge with Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp in April, expects full-year
pre-tax profits to rise 3.3 per cent to Y7bn, on lower imported material
costs and a cut in interest payments. But it sees a 1.8 per cent fall in
sales to Y385bn.

WESTERN Deep Levels (WDL) and neighbouring Blyvooruitzicht (Blyvoor), two
South African gold mines, have reached an agreement which should extend the

The logic of the deal, which involves Blyvoor mining 92 hectares of the WDL
lease area, is that Blyvoor has easier access to the area covered by the
deal than WDL.
Working profits and capital expenditure will be shared, with WDL, which is
owned by Anglo American, receiving 55 per cent and Blyvoor 45 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW York bankruptcy judge yesterday approved the sale of the New York
Daily News, the loss-making tabloid, to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the property
investor and magazine publisher.
Judge Tina Brozman said the sale was 'necessary and appropriate' shortly
after she ruled in favour of Mr Zuckerman on a trade union dispute involving
the paper's typographers.
Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner of the weekly US News and World Report
magazine and The Atlantic, a monthly magazine, had warned he might walk away
from the transaction if he had to honour a 20-year-old contract that
guaranteed life-time employment for 165 typographers.
In allowing Mr Zuckerman to go ahead with the purchase, Judge Brozman
effectively forced the typographers to file an administrative claim as a
creditor and seek payments from funds that are destined for the newspaper's
general creditors' pool.
The union said it would appeal the court ruling, but Judge Brozman said she
did not think the appeal would succeed. She said that enforcing the
typographers' contracts 'would have a devastating effect on the sale and
would probably kill it.'
The fate of the Daily News, which was previously owned by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell, has been in the hands of the bankruptcy court since it filed last
year for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
Mr Zuckerman's chances of acquiring The Daily News have been improving ever
since the withdrawal several weeks ago of Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian who
owns The Telegraph newspaper group in London. Mr Zuckerman has also made
progress with most of the other trade unions involved.
The deal is expected to close within 30 days, during which time Mr Zuckerman
may have further talks with the Newspaper Guild, the union that represents
editorial staff at the newspaper.
The guild has been unhappy with Mr Zuckerman's demand that he have the
freedom to change editorial staff at the paper.

FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cragnotti puts Lawson Marden
into focus - The Canadian packaging group's progress since the Italians took
a stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past nine months, a string of Canadian consumer-goods analysts have
encouraged clients to buy shares in Lawson Mardon, the Toronto-based
international packaging maker.
Investors are now discovering that they might have done better to wait.
Earlier this month, Lawson floated a new equity issue at a considerable
discount to market levels. The underwriters, led by Wood Gundy, have
struggled to find buyers.
The CDollars 106m (USDollars 85.40m) issue is a landmark for Lawson. In one
sense, it is a sign of the progress the company has made in the 18 months
since it was taken under the wing of Cragnotti &amp; Partners, the Italian
investment group.
The extra capital is required if Cragnotti is to realise its ambition of
propelling Lawson from a base of flexible packaging, folding cartons and
labels in the UK and Canada into a much more powerful force across
continental Europe and North America.
But Lawson also badly needs to strengthen its balance sheet. The company was
keen to press ahead with the new equity issue to reassure lenders, led by
Bank of Nova Scotia, with which it will soon renegotiate its CDollars 160m
loan facility. Long-term debt has risen almost 50 per cent in the past year
to CDollars 297m, bringing its debt-to-equity ratio up to 1:1. With the
pinch of recession compounded by the cost of revamping operations, Lawson
has generated little capital lately from its own business. It earned a
minuscule CDollars 1.1m in the first six months of this year, including a
one-off CDollars 15m restructuring charge.
A 3 per cent rise in sales, to CDollars 627m, was due largely to recent
acquisitions and foreign currency windfalls stemming from a weak Canadian
dollar. Almost three-quarters of Lawson's sales are in the UK.
The unusual combination of a head office in Canada, the leading market in
Britain, and a controlling shareholder in Italy has its origins in the 1950s
when a Canadian packaging company, Lawson &amp; Jones, forged links with UK
printers Mardon Son and Hall.
The combined company was later taken over by BAT Industries, the UK tobacco
group. BAT sold its stake in 1985 through a management buyout, but cigarette
and tobacco packaging continues to be a pillar of Lawson's business both in
the UK and Canada.
Cragnotti, whose shareholders include Ferruzzi, Swiss Bank Corp, Credit
Lyonnais and Banco di Napoli, bought a 48 per cent voting interest in Lawson
early last year with the aim of expanding in an industry which has gained a
reputation for being less volatile than most others.
Cragnotti reasons not only that profits should remain reasonably stable but
that the packaging industry will have little trouble persuading banks to
lend it money through thick and thin.
Mr Andrea Mattiussi, who was a senior Cragnotti executive before taking over
as Lawson's president last April, has devoted his energies over the past six
months to bringing a sharper focus to Lawson's business and cutting costs.
He commutes between Milan, London and Toronto, and calls his briefcase and
cellular telephone 'my office',
'He's very, very determined to make money at this level of business,' says
Mr Patrick Slattery, analyst at Maison Placements of Toronto and one of
several Canadian stock market watchers who are recommending Lawson shares.
Divisional managers have been told that any new capital investment must meet
a target of a 1 to 3 per cent annual rise in production volumes, but a cut
of between 3 per cent and 9 per cent a year in costs.
Mr Mattiussi has trimmed the workforce, centralised many corporate functions
(such as advertising) and tried to create an employee culture which puts the
company's interests above those of any individual division. Six out of nine
vice-presidents have left, and a new generation of younger executives has
been promoted.
On his travels, Mr Mattiussi has also been cajoling customers to co-operate
in the belt-tightening in the form of lower inventories and fewer salesmen.
'Half the reduction (in costs) can remain in our pockets, and half can go to
our customers,' Mr Mattiussi says.
He predicts that sales per employee will rise to at least CDollars 190,000
by December, a 24 per cent improvement over the year.
Although the austerity drive and the financial restructuring are by no means
complete, Lawson already has its eye on expansion. The immediate aim is to
transform it into a 'really European company,' Mr Mattiussi says.
Earlier this month, Lawson paid Cragnotti CDollars 13.2m in cash plus a
CDollars 51.5m interest-free bond for Cartonajes Suner, one of Spain's
largest packaging groups. An acquisition is now being lined up in Italy.
These purchases give Lawson a manufacturing presence in southern Europe, but
the idea is also to open up export markets for high-value flexible packaging
made by its UK factories.
Lawson could end up biting off an even bigger mouthful in North America.
Cragnotti is negotiating to buy the US division of Del Monte Foods from
Merrill Lynch and other investors who organised a leveraged buyout of the
San Francisco-based company in early 1990.
Should Cragnotti's bid succeed, it would spin off the Del Monte packaging
interests to Lawson. This would double the Canadian company's business in
the US, where it has only three plants specialising in detergent boxes,
labels, lottery tickets and postcards.
Mr Mattiussi hopes the infusion of capital from the recent equity issue
would give Lawson the strength to seek a large acquisition or merger during
1993.
One possible target is Mexico, whose packaging industry is expected to
benefit greatly both from domestic growth and the opportunities presented by
the North American free trade agreement. 'We have to get there before the
Americans,' Mr Mattiussi says.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, buffeted by image problems and by losses at its credit
card division, has sacked Chiat/Day/Mojo, the advertising agency it chose
less than a year ago to handle its Dollars 60m of card promotion.
The US advertising world was taken by surprise a year ago when American
Express withdrew the bulk of its card business from Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a
subsidiary of the WPP Group, and switched it to Chiat.
That decision affected a 29-year relationship with Ogilvy which created the
'Membership has its privileges' and the 'Do you know me?' card and
travellers cheque campaigns.
Now, in a complete reversal, American Express has decided to return to
Ogilvy.
The change in ad agencies comes at a time when American Express is feeling
more competitive pressure from low-fee bank cards and non-bank cards such as
those launched recently by General Motors and General Electric. The GM card
has chalked up nearly a million new holders in only a few weeks.
The big losers are the advertising staff of Chiat/Day/Mojo, the New York
agency brought in to replace Ogilvy. Chiat's strategy involved ads that
featured giant American Express cards in golf courses and restaurants. But
the company's share of cards issued actually fell during the first half of
1992.
Ogilvy, meanwhile, has a new 'merchant testi-monial' campaign that features
Arrigo Cipriani of Harry's Bar and other American Express merchants who
speak well of the famous green card.
Chiat is still left with the account for American Express gold card in
Britain. The reason, according to American Express, is that the switch back
to Ogilvy concerned US rather than international advertising.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Storehouse sells Habitat and Richards for Pounds 108m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the retailing conglomerate created by Sir Terence Conran through
mergers in the 1980s, was dismantled yesterday as the new management sold
two of its five trading companies, Habitat and Richards, for Pounds 108m.
The proceeds from the disposals - to Ikea's holding company and Sears,
respectively - will be used to speed development of the core BhS and
Mothercare chains, which accounted for about three-quarters of last year's
group sales of Pounds 1.2bn. Blazer, the small men's-wear chain, has also
been earmarked for disposal.
Mr David Dworkin, chief executive since July, said: 'This is a dream come
true. It is an opportunity to focus on our two core businesses where there
is still great potential for expansion.'
Analysts welcomed the deal and suggested it might signal a new phase whereby
sprawling retail businesses slimmed down to concentrate on more narrowly
defined areas. Storehouse shares rose 3p to 164p.
The Habitat furniture chain, which runs 76 stores in the UK and France, will
be bought by the charitable Stichting Ingka Foundation (SIF), which owns the
Ikea Group of furniture stores, for Pounds 54m in cash plus the repayment of
Pounds 24m of inter-company loans. Storehouse said it was also in talks to
dispose of its Conran's Habitat chain in the US but if these failed the
loss-making business would be shut.
Last year, Habitat in Europe lost Pounds 1.1m on sales of Pounds 172m while
the US business lost Pounds 7.7m.
Mr Ingvar Kamprad, Ikea's founder, said Habitat would be run as a 'totally
independent group' to secure the 'distinct Habitat identity'.
Sears, which has withdrawn from the men's wear market, is paying Pounds 30m
for the 213-store Richards women's wear chain, which made profits of Pounds
1m last year on sales of Pounds 98m.
Sears' already runs the Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Warehouse chains.
Storehouse, due to report its interim results next month, forecast it would
break even after pre-tax losses of Pounds 13.9m a year ago.
Substantial sales increases have been reported at BhS and Mothercare but the
group will suffer from an extraordinary charge of Pounds 30m resulting in a
reduction of net assets as a result of the disposals.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Invesco to pay Pounds 9.5m compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the UK investment management company, said it will pay Pounds
9.5m as compensation in cash to shareholders in troubled Drayton
Consolidated Investment Trust for which it was fund manager.
The compensation, the first of its kind by a fund manager to an investment
trust, stems from Invesco MIM's decision to invest Pounds 43m in a troubled
company and failure to disclose the extent of that investment to Drayton's
shareholders and board of directors.
Drayton had taken a 14 per cent stake in Alma Holdings, Scotland's largest
confectioner valued at Pounds 3m. However, it guaranteed Pounds 40m in loans
to the company, taking its stake to 97.2 per cent when Alma collapsed
earlier this year and the loans were called in by the lenders.
Drayton's accounts never made clear the extent of the exposure, and tax laws
penalise investment trusts from taking a stake greater than 15 per cent in
any company. Shareholders had threatened to replace the board of Drayton,
and Invesco MIM as fund manager, earlier this year if compensation was not
made.
The compensation, announced yesterday, is part of a package which will also
create a new company, Second Consolidated, to hold the remaining investments
of Drayton.
That company will have a net asset value of 158p per share, giving a total
package to shareholders of 243p per share. At its peak, Drayton Consolidated
was valued at nearly Pounds 5 per share.
As a result of the reorganisation and compensation package, Invesco MIM will
have to spend Pounds 15.7m, of which roughly Pounds 5.2m is expected to be
returned following asset sales. The deal requires Invesco MIM to purchase
Pounds 7.5m of loans to another Drayton investment, City Merchants Bank and
to repurchase shares in an East European Development Fund investment trust.
Mr Ratan Engineer, Invesco's finance director, said that Invesco is unlikely
to incur further charges as a result of the Drayton reorganisation. Already,
the company has written off charges of Pounds 22.8 connected with Drayton.
The company will remain as junior fund manager while Foreign and Colonial
Ventures will be the senior manager.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Last of the royal yards are placed in the dock: A government
decision on the location of submarine facilities will determine the fate of
Rosyth and Devonport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just upstream from the Forth rail and road bridges in eastern Scotland there
is a giant cavity dug into reclaimed land. The hole is easily big enough to
accommodate half a dozen football pitches. Dump trucks beetle around its
floor. Being poured into this pit are a quarter of million cubic metres of
concrete and public money already exceeding Pounds 120m.
It is meant to become two dry docks for nuclear-powered submarines, one big
enough to take Britain's new Trident ballistic-missile vessels, the largest
submarines ever built in the UK. But it could equally well become nothing at
all.
The government has to make a judgment of Solomon between the two remaining
royal dockyards. A decision between this project at Rosyth and the rival
plans of Plymouth's Devonport dockyard is due by Christmas. At both yards,
thousands of jobs are at stake.
The dilemma has received little national publicity, but either region would
take failure as a blow comparable to the government's plans for colliery
closures. Rosyth Royal Dockyard is the biggest single industrial site in
Scotland, Devonport the biggest in south-west England.
They are the remnants of a network of naval yards dating back to Henry VII,
the first monarch to maintain a standing fleet. Deptford and Woolwich
disappeared last century. Chatham and Gibraltar were abandoned in 1984, and
Portsmouth was downgraded. They used to build ships as well as repair and
refit them, but no warships have been made at the dockyards for more than 20
years.
In the late 1970s the royal dockyards employed 34,000. By the mid-1980s the
figure had dropped to less than 20,000. Since then, the annual business has
remained constant at about Pounds 420m. There are now just 5,000 working at
Devonport and 4,000 at Rosyth.
In 1987, after 16 years of intermittent studies, the government brought in
private-sector managers to tackle waste and inefficiency in the dockyards.
Devonport, the largest complex of its kind in Europe, was won by a
consortium of Brown &amp; Root of the US, BICC and the Weir Group. Rosyth went
to Babcock Thorn, a joint venture between Babcock International and Thorn
EMI of the UK. The assets remained the Ministry of Defence's, and the
managers paid licence fees.
The yards were guaranteed a 'core programme' of work. But this has withered
along with the cold war. Above all, requirements for submarines have been
cut. Refuelling and refitting a nuclear submarine is two and a half years of
work, worth up to Pounds 150m. It is the backbone of the business. When the
management companies entered their seven-year contracts there was room for
two facilities. Now there clearly is not.
The issue needs to be resolved before the government can go ahead with its
next plan, fuller privatisation. The current consortia may be able to extend
their contracts by one or two years beyond 1994 but the Ministry of Defence
has already invited companies to express their interest in purchasing either
or both the dockyards. It is looking for 20 per cent savings in naval
support costs and says selling the yards is a 'logical progression' from
today's contractor arrangements.
'We would see the ministry washing their hands of all future redundancy
costs,' says Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Rosyth Royal Dockyard.
At least 10 companies are believed to have responded to the MoD's
invitation. Potential bidders include VSEL, which makes all Britain's
submarines and is itself in the middle of deep retrenchment; GEC, which owns
Yarrow Shipbuilders and has ambitions to be an all-encompassing naval
supplier; British Aerospace, which makes naval weapons; and Rolls-Royce,
which supplies naval engines. However, the two incumbent groups regard
themselves as front-runners - both of them prepared to bid for both yards,
but each intent on holding on to the nuclear work.
Both companies have branched out into non-MoD work such as boatbuilding.
Rosyth has 500 people refurbishing carriages for British Rail and London
Underground, and much of the site looks more like a railway marshalling yard
rather than a dockyard. But commercial work is only about a quarter of the
total.
'Without the nuclear work we would be going below the critical mass for a
facility of this size,' says Mr Mike Leece, managing director of Devonport
Management Limited, The Devonport yard. This contains a messy array of
buildings from various stages of its long history and covers 300 acres, much
bigger than Rosyth. It has been on a crisis footing for the past 18 months.
Rosyth, which has been building its new facility since 1987, was initially
the natural choice for a reduced submarine programme. It was the only yard
to have refitted ballistic-missile boats. In April last year, Devonport made
an unsolicited bid to provide rival facilities by converting old battleship
docks, big enough to house the Trident submarines. It says this would limit
capital costs to Pounds 170m, well below the cost of completing the works at
Rosyth. By enabling Devonport to operate at optimum levels, it would save
millions of pounds a year on the cost of refitting surface ships.
Without the submarines, it expects employment would fall to about 1,000,
with little security. If it closed, the logic of having a big naval base on
the same site would also be undermined. Studies indicate that more than
22,000 jobs in the region could be lost.
But if Devonport got its way, Mr Smith is convinced there would be no room
for another yard. 'We would end up sooner or later shutting Rosyth,' he
says.
Rosyth has had an unsteady history. Built as a specialist refit yard before
the first world war, it was closed between the wars. The adjacent naval
base, from which only minor warships are expected to operate in future,
provides very little of the dockyard's work.
The race for survival is bringing out increasingly dirty tactics. Rosyth's
managers make dark hints about nuclear safety risks at Devonport; a study
commissioned by Devonport questions the wisdom of relying on Scotland,
drawing comparisons with Russia and Ukraine.
Faced with Devonport's challenge, Rosyth scrapped plans for a grandiose
covered dock and is offering to complete a simpler project for a fixed price
of Pounds 267m. It envisages a new consortium which it says would be able to
keep both dockyards going, employing some 3,500 at each.
Mr Smith believes the yard's late campaign may have brought it back from the
brink. He is counting on government reluctance to contemplate 'another
Ravenscraig' (the Lanarkshire steel complex, the closure of which was
announced in January), and the temptation of opting for the least damage to
the dockyard communities. If he is wrong, Rosyth will literally be staring
at a hole in the ground.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Technology: Carving up the specialist pie - Haig Simonian
describes how privatisation will affect the technical expertise of one
Italian engineering group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Access to the latest turbine know-how is essential for success in industries
from aero-engines to power generation, but there is one unwritten rule:
never share technology with a company controlled by a competitor.
That rule could pay a big part over the next few months in determining the
future of Nuovo Pignone, the Italian high-tech engineering group best known
for its compressors and gas turbines.
The company, established as a foundry in 1846, invented the world's first
very high-pressure reciprocating compressor for ammonia production in 1920.
But executives of the Florence-based group, now owned by the state-owned Eni
energy and chemicals concern, may have to print new visiting cards should
the company change hands after last month's decision by the Italian
government to privatise it.
The world market for turbines and compressors is dominated by a handful of
multinationals and characterised by cross-licensing arrangements. The future
ownership of Nuovo Pignone - which claims 6 per cent of the the world gas
turbine market - will determine its product mix, possibly to the detriment
of some activities and arguably the benefit of others.
Hence privatisation - probably via a trade sale to another company, rather
than a public flotation - represents the biggest change for the company,
which now employs around 5,000, since coming under Eni's wing in 1954.
Earlier this month Eni gave Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian
financial services group, the mandate to advise on the privatisation.
Being part of Eni has shaped Nuovo Pignone's development over the past four
decades. It has lent heavily towards products for energy and chemicals,
reflecting the ambitions of Eni's founders to create a broad group spanning
oil, gas and chemicals from exploration and refining to retail sale and
distribution.
Eni's subsidiaries find oil and gas, build rigs and pipelines to extract and
distribute them, and design and construct the refineries and chemicals
plants to process such raw materials.
Meanwhile, Nuovo Pignone provides some of the machinery to fit into that
puzzle. Its compressors, operating at very high pressures and often in
extreme climates, cover uses from liquefying natural gas to pressurising gas
pumped down oil wells to improve extraction rates or store gas surplus to
requirements.
The move into gas turbines, the other main part of Nuovo Pignone's business,
also derives from its role within Eni. Developing gas turbines meant Nuovo
Pignone could offer customers not just established products like
compressors, but also the machines used to drive them.
Today, its turbines operate on Eni's gas and oil pipelines, as well as on
others designed, developed or sold by Eni's subsidiaries to users from
Siberia to the Iranian desert. Even some smaller Nuovo Pignone products,
such as petrol pumps and domestic gas meters, have a marked 'energy' bent.
Such a wide range - largely dictated by Eni's role in the hydrocarbons
business - explains why employees and managers are worried about
privatisation. No potential buyer has Eni's spread of activities, especially
in the energy and chemicals fields.
While Nuovo Pignone's compressors and turbines are likely to flourish in any
circumstances, some other divisions, like textile machinery, which was
developed when Eni was still in the artificial fibres business, look
vulnerable.
Nuovo Pignone executives admit that many client contacts have been won on
the back of the company's role as part of the Eni group. Once out of that
orbit, such business could be difficult to obtain.
Even some newer products, like Nuovo Pignone's gas turbines for generating
electricity, are spin-offs from its oil- and gas-related work. Though Eni
itself is barely active in generating electricity, Nuovo Pignone's turbines
for electricity generation have their roots in those drawn up for driving
compressors or other oil- and gas-related products.
Yet senior managers also insist they are not dependent on Eni. 'The group
accounts for between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of our turnover,' says
Romano Noceti, Nuovo Pignone's head of external relations. 'But we have to
fight for the orders we get from our parent company.'
A takeover by one of the world's big multinational engineering groups like
Siemens or Asea Brown Boveri could spell a substantial change for Nuovo
Pignone's operations. It currently has a licensing agreement with General
Electric of the US, the world's biggest power equipment group, to produce
high-capacity gas turbines using US know-how. Meanwhile, GE has tapped Nuovo
Pignone's expertise on lower-capacity machines, which the US group produces
under licence from the Florentine company.
Such links explain why some analysts see GE as the most obvious buyer for
Nuovo Pignone. Should a competing gas turbine maker end up as acquirer, the
future of Nuovo Pignone's relationship with GE - and hence a large slice of
its turbines business - could be in jeopardy. 'No manufacturer wants to
share technology and know-how with a company controlled by a competitor,'
says one industry analyst.
Even the idea of creating a big Italian turbine group by forcing a merger of
Nuovo Pignone and Ansaldo, the heavy engineering subsidiary of the
state-owned Finmeccanica group, runs up against technological barriers, they
say.
Many engineers say Ansaldo's background in making big, steam-powered,
turbines for power stations does not fit in with Nuovo Pignone's traditions.
'Making gas turbines working at temperatures of up to 1,200 deg C involves
much higher technology than steam turbines, where temperatures seldom exceed
500 deg C,' says one engineer.
Though steam turbines still have a role in today's highly-efficient
'combined cycle' electricity generating plants, where recycled energy from a
big gas turbine is used to heat steam for a smaller steam turbine, the
market for big steam turbines is limited, he argues.
Further complicating the Ansaldo-Nuovo Pignone concept is the fact that
Ansaldo recently agreed to manufacture Siemens's high-capacity gas turbines
under licence. However, some bankers believe the domestic merger may be
favoured on political grounds.
Irrespective of the buyer, Nuovo Pignone faces a difficult adjustment period
ahead. Changes will take place whoever purchases the company. But it is
already clear that the divorce from Eni could be more traumatic in some
circumstances than in others.

FT  27 OCT 92 / English Heritage cuts anger MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH Heritage's plans to shed responsibility for 200 of its 360 historic
properties and cut 180 of its 1,600 staff yesterday prompted angry criticism
from MPs.
The proposals, announced yesterday as part of a 20-point strategy by Mr
Jocelyn Stevens, English Heritage chairman, mean that the properties would
be sold off or turned over to local authorities or trusts. The plans have
already received government approval.
Speaking to MPs yesterday, Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary,
denied that the announcement was a prelude to 'commercial exploitation' of
heritage sites.
The proposals confirmed English Heritage's 'central role in the protection
of our heritage'. He added: 'That role will continue with my full support.'
Mr Robin Corbett, a Labour national heritage spokesman, criticised the
'total secrecy' with which the plans were drawn up and warned that some
historic monuments would be 'doomed to neglect'.
Branding Mr Stevens an 'unsuitable ideological ignoramus', he questioned
whether recession-hit councils and voluntary bodies could afford to take
over earmarked sites and claimed that job losses would involve people with
'unique skills'.
Mr Tony Banks, a Labour environment spokesman, said the proposals seemed
'rather like the country's final closing-down sale'.
Announcing his reforms yesterday, Mr Stevens said: 'This is a realistic plan
to safeguard the future of our heritage. The heritage is at risk from
neglect, pressure of use and lack of funds. We intend to begin by
streamlining our organisation.'
The organisation is offering voluntary early retirement to 100 headquarters
staff while 80 craftsmen in the directly employed labour force, which
repairs and maintains English Heritage properties, will lose their jobs.
Within three years the force, currently 380 strong, will be privatised. That
will reduce the English Heritage payroll to just over 1,000.
The sites to be disposed of have yet to be finally listed, but English
Heritage has grouped properties into three categories - the last group
containing the ones to be sold off.
The A division, 60 strong, includes flagship sites such as Stonehenge, Dover
Castle and Osborne House. The B division, of about 100, covers the more
important medieval ruins, such as Clun Castle in Shropshire. Those two
groups will remain under English Heritage control.
The other sites, mainly remote prehistoric remains, medieval remnants, or
destroyed buildings, will be offered to local authorities or
special-interest groups.
Mr Stevens said he was 'not keen' on selling sites to entrepreneurs, but did
not rule out the possibility.
Already Hampshire County Council has agreed to acquire two category C
properties: Portsmouth's Royal Garrison Church, which was largely destroyed
in the Second World War, and Fort Cumberland, a remote fortification in the
Solent.

<TEXT>
DEAN Witter Financial Services, the securities brokerage arm of retailing
group Sears, Roebuck, and NationsBank, the fourth-largest commercial bank in
the US, have announced plans to form a jointly-owned brokerage firm that
will sell mutual funds and other investment products to bank customers.
The new company, Nations Securities, will begin operations early next year
with 400 investment professionals located in NationsBank's branches in nine
US states. The company also plans to market products and services to other
US commercial banks.
Although still subject to regulatory approval, the agreement is the latest
example of how the once-strict divide between the commercial banking and
securities businesses, enshrined in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, is being
gradually dismantled.
Several big banks, including JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, are already major
players in the securities underwriting business, and only last week the
Federal Reserve gave Republic Bank of New York approval to open a securities
brokerage.
The joint venture is also an attempt by companies from two increasingly
inter-connected industries to exploit their respective strengths. Dean
Witter will provide the brokerage expertise and distribution channels of a
big Wall Street firm, while NationsBank will provide wide customer reach
through its branches, as well as the financial muscle of a major bank.
Other banks are likely to follow in NationsBank's footsteps. By offering
customers in-house access to a wide range of higher-yielding investments,
NationsBank and other banks will hope to stem the outflow of deposits caused
by the sharp fall in the returns earned by bank savings products.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Arts: Which Witch - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HERE it is
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the musical from Hell. Which Witch has been sent as a punishment on all
those who scoffed too harshly on poor feeble little Bernadette two years
ago. Bernadette, a martyr to muddle-headedness, at least meant well; it was
merely Dr Jekyll. But Which Witch, brash and cynical, is Mr Hyde. Although
replete with witches' sabbat, exorcism, inquisition, torture scene and
burning at the stake, it manages to be excruciatingly dull.
The composers, the Norwegian Ingrid Bjornov and Benedicte Adrian, are the
chief perpetrators. They met in a sandbox at the age of two (no comment),
and have been hard at work on Which Witch since 1986. Albums have already
been released, concert performances have been given, and hype is busy.
In addition, Bjornov also conducts the music from the pit, and Adrian
performs the leading role.
But the music for Which Witch is not only bland, it is also ludicrously
inconsistent. It has a pop-baroque overture, a funky-rock executioner's
song, numerous operatic trimmings and pretensions (even a coloratura mad
scene), and whole fallow acres of sub-tuneful declamation that tread the
murky borderline between Les Mis. and Lloyd Webber.
It even has, to accompany a Renaissance wedding dance, a tango accompanied
by rock drumming.
Which Witch fails even to tell its narrative well. Maria Vittoria,
fosterdaughter to a noble Roman house in the era of Farneses and Gonzagas,
is in love with Daniel, a priest, and her love does not fail even when she
is rejected by her adoptive family or when, after eloping with Daniel and
then losing him again to God, she is arraigned as a witch.
Bjo/rnov and Adrian call it 'the powerful story of a woman who refuses to
conform - choosing instead to follow her heart and recognise that her
consuming love for a man for the Church cannot be denied.' But it is unclear
whether the big witches' scene that closes the first half is real or dreamt.
The overall pace is far too slow, the very ending much too sudden.
The words are by Kit Hesketh-Harvey (no Widow in attendance here). The line
in his programme bio which reminds us that he studied with Sondheim should
be suppressed: what did he learn? These lyrics are sheer doggerel,
alternating between cheap comedy (two girls we never see again chant
'Chastity's extremely dull, God, I want to be a bride') and plodding
exposition. Here's a typical couplet: 'We can-not af-ford to wait,' 'I'll
find you at the ci-ty gate.' And the music weights every syllable like a
tombstone.
Richard Hudson's designs and Mark Bailey's costumes are the show's only
commendable feature. As Maria Vittoria, Adrian looks pretty but sings -
painfully flat - in the worst kind of undernourished squeezed tones. Graham
Bickley, as Daniel, has a better voice, but not enough power. As his
scheming sister, Vivien Parry demonstrates severe problems with moving in
and out of her chest register. There are moments when you can giggle at
Which Witch, but not many. It is a just a very dreary melodrama.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Brazil acts over trade imbalance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's foreign minister flew to Buenos Aires at the weekend to meet
Argentinian officials in an attempt to resolve the trade imbalance
threatening Mercosul, the nascent free trade arrangement.
A shift in trade in favour of Brazil was straining relations between the two
neighbours, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso said earlier at a Mercosul
conference in Canela, southern Brazil. 'You cannot have a good accord when
just one side is winning,' he said.
The gap has emerged because of Argentina's relatively low import tariffs and
what is generally perceived to be an overvalued exchange rate. The country
is heading for its first annual trade deficit in 11 years.
Brazil has been the main beneficiary; its sales to Argentina rose 142 per
cent in the first half. This year it expects a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m)
surplus with Argentina - the reverse of the previous three years.
Argentine industrialists accuse their Brazilian counterparts of dumping to
counter a domestic recession and are demanding market restrictions. But Mr
Marcos Azambuja, Brazilian envoy in Buenos Aires, argues: 'If we do not
export, other countries will.'
Mr Cardoso said he would tell Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine economy
minister, that Brazil was willing to compensate through purchases of
Argentine oil and increased quotas on wheat and flour. He added the problem
had nothing to do with the Mercosul treaty, which was working well.
But some participants at the conference warned that Brazil's failure to
achieve economic stability could threaten the agreement between Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.

FT  26 OCT 92 / W German growth put at 1.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Germany is not in recession and its economy will grow by 1.5 per
cent this year, Mr Otmar Issing, a director of the Bundesbank, said at the
weekend.
However, Mr Issing acknowledged there had been a 'perceptible slowdown' of
economic growth, mainly because of a lack of demand for German products
abroad.
This was leaving an ever-clearer mark on the west German economy.
His comments, given during a lecture delivered at the Edinburgh and Stirling
University, come at a time when there is mounting evidence of stagnation in
the whole German economy. Retail sales and industrial orders have fallen for
the sixth consecutive month and a number of large companies have responded
to deteriorating conditions by announcing job cuts.
Mr Issing said that although recent figures showed real gross domestic
product in western Germany in the second quarter dropped by 0.5 per cent
compared with the first quarter, it exceeded GDP for the second quarter of
last year by 'a good 1 per cent'.
These figures 'indicated clearly that the west German economy is not in
recession'.
Productivity utilisation had remained above average 'right up to the
present'.
He acknowledged that persistent sluggish demand had hit the manufacturing
sector particularly hard; the business climate had clouded over perceptibly,
undermining the sector's propensity to invest.
There were a number of purely domestic impulses to growth - among them the
continued need to rebuild eastern Germany - but these would not be enough to
offset the slowdown in exports.
Mr Issing made no comment on the future orientation of monetary policy,
which is believed to be increasingly influenced by concern about Germany's
economic outlook.
Senior Bundesbank officials met senior economists of Germany's larger banks
last week to discuss the central bank's interest rate strategy.
A report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading German newspaper,
on Friday suggested the Bundesbank had given the impression at this meeting
that it was committed to further cuts in short-term interest rates, but that
they would have to take effect slowly because of the danger the German
central bank would lose credibility in the battle against inflation.

A ROADSIDE bomb detonated by guerrillas killed five Israeli soldiers and
wounded five others in south Lebanon yesterday, the Israeli army said,
Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
It was the worst attack in nearly two years in Israel's self-declared
security zone in southern Lebanon.
A spokesman for the Rambam hospital in Haifa said three of the wounded
soldiers were in critical condition with shrapnel wounds. Another was in
moderate condition and the fifth lightly wounded.
An army colonel told Army radio that pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God)
guerrillas had detonated a bomb under a truck in a convoy of seven army
vehicles.
About 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
soldiers patrol the 15km-deep zone, set up by Israel in 1985 to stop
guerrilla raids.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (11): Plethora of
indices at hand - Barry Riley discusses benchmarks and measurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TRADITIONALLY most
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
if not all - fund managers have performed better than the average, and have
been more than happy to provide figures to prove it. But the age of
statistical sleight-of-hand may be passing, with the advent of more rigorous
measurement techniques and the increasing tendency for clients to set very
specific performance benchmarks.
Investment authorities around the world have recently been attempting to
clean up performance measurement standards. In the US, for instance, the
Association for Investment Management Research has established so-called
Performance Presentation Standards, which will become effective at the
beginning of 1993. And in the UK a voluntary Pension Fund Investment
Performance Code has been introduced by the National Association of Pension
Funds and other trade bodies, effective from the middle of this year.
A plethora of indices is available to provide the benchmarks against which
portfolio performance can be measured, but just two series of equity stock
indices dominate the picture for global equities.
The older series, the Capital International indices sponsored by the New
York investment bank Morgan Stanley, is especially well-entrenched among
American funds and consultants. A more recent and easily available rival is
part-sponsored by the Financial Times, the FT-Actuaries World Index series
which appears daily in the FT. It is also backed by another US investment
bank, Goldman Sachs, and by the UK's County NatWest.
These global indices are constructed on a building block basis, so that
individual country indices - there are 24 in the FT-Actuaries series - are
combined to create various regional, continental and global benchmarks.
Common principles include capit-alisation weighting, so that the indices
track actual portfolio behaviour, and some regard to the availability of
individual stocks to international invest-tors, who in some countries face
restrictions on what they can buy.
There are also national and international bond indices, notably the Salomon
Bros World Government Bond Index. Other leading broking houses produce their
own indices - such as the series of Global Benchmark Bond Indices produced
by Union Bank of Switzerland.
Even in the esoteric world of bond indices, however, there are
controversies. Salomon has upset some bond managers by this month including
Italy in its world index, because some doubt whether Italian debt can any
longer be regarded as of high quality.
The use of equity indices can be controversial, too. Some prefer a quite
different approach to the benchmark problem, which is to compare a fund's
performance with that of competitors with a similar investment objective.
This is very common with British pension funds, for instance, which are
routinely measured against the average or median fund.
Mr Dugald Eadie, chairman of the Edinburgh-based World Markets Company,
perform-ance measurement specialists, explains that balanced funds investing
in different types of assets cannot be compared with any single index. Also,
sponsors often want to know how much risk their fund managers are taking.
'The peer group approach allows a measurement of risk around the index,' he
says.
But specialist funds invested in one particular asset class are more
suitable for measurement against an index-related benchmark.
There have, however, been problems in the past with indices applying to less
efficient stock markets subject to distortions.
Japan is the best example, where principal sectors such as financials (and
until recently the telephone company NTT) have been difficult or impossible
for international funds to invest in.
During a particular year the foreign managers have therefore tended either
all to underperform or outperform an index such as TOPIX. The peer group
approach can therefore be more satisfactory.
But there can be conceptual problems when benchmarks are tailored too
specifically to the requirements of fund managers.
Mr John Clamp, chief executive of another UK-based performance measurement
company, Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps), points out that
British pension funds tend to be dissatisfied with a straightforward World
ex UK benchmark for inter-national equity portfolios. 'For certain funds the
view is being taken that the spread of the world index on a market
capitalisation basis is incorrect,' he says.
This is because British pension funds usually have a lot more invested in
Continental Europe than, say, in Japan, although capit-isation weights would
suggest the reverse.
Therefore a customised peer group benchmark is calculated by Caps, using
individual country indices weighted by the geographical split of the average
pension fund.
Timeliness, however, can also be a factor in the choice of benchmark,
according to Mr Eadie.
'Index benchmarks are available very quickly, within two days of the end of
the quarter,' he says. 'Peer group averages may take many weeks.'
In the UK pension fund industry, according to Mr John Clamp, there is in
practice roughly a 50-50 split between index-related and peer group
benchmarks.
Meanwhile, more and more indices are being created, and increasingly
sophisticated benchmarks are being devised. In the US there are large cap,
mid cap and small cap indices and managers are also categorised according to
growth, value and many other styles.
Consultants are designing benchmarks on a mix-and-match basis, and they can
be individually tailored for a whole range of specialist managers mandated
by a pension plan. Such capitalisation-segmenting indices have now appeared
in the UK with the publication of new FT-SE indices such as the Mid 250.
The question, however, is whether complex benchmarks based on a variety of
sources will actually help clients, or whether the trustees and other
sponsors will end up being bamboozled: 'It's a very real danger,' admits Mr
Clamp.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (8): Hint of
disillusion - Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cause of European integration may have suffered a severe setback with
political doubts over Maastricht and the ignominious departure of the pound
and lira from the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). But with just a few weeks
to go before the official starting gun is fired, most of the building blocks
for a single European market in financial services are in place.
The regulatory changes have altered the outlook for fund managers across the
EC, though it would be a mistake to exaggerate Brussels's achievement. While
the essential measures in Lord Cockfield's White Paper had been approved by
the end of June compromises and delays in implementation mean full
liberalisation will be frustrated until the next century.
Two important bits of legislation giving banks and stockbrokers free access
to the EC, for example, will not be in place until early 1995, though at one
stage it looked touch and go whether effective investment services and
capital adequacy directives would ever be adopted. The recent
re-introduction of exchange controls by Spain and Ireland in the cause of
defending their currency parities was an awkward reminder that the long,
hard battle to remove controls on capital movements has not been completely
secured.
Cultural and market realities, moreover, suggest that national attitudes
will persist. But most of all there is just a hint of Euro-disillusion in
the air - detectable in this month's decision by the French Bank Societe
Generale to sell its UK investment management subsidiary Touche Remnant to
Henderson Administration and rumours that Credit Commercial de France is
seeking a buyer for Framlington.
For UK fund managers, of course, September's breakdown of the ERM and the
consequent check to the ambitions of monetary union enthusiasts may prompt a
fundamental re-think. Many had bought the argument that funds should look at
the European Community as their true home market - given the EC's apparent
framework for a single currency - and adjust portfolio weightings
accordingly. Though there will have been an obvious bonus on Black Wednesday
for the many fund managers overweight in continental equities, asset
allocation models in the new world of the floating pound will surely come
under review.
In the same way that it was foolish to believe that currency risk had been
eliminated by the ERM straitjacket, it would be a mistake to think that the
process of European convergence has gone into reverse. Recent figures
demonstrate that the correlation in performance of the eight leading EC
stock markets has in every case increased over the past 10 years. The
declining influence of the US in the trade patterns of the UK and the
Netherlands - and the proportionately greater volume of intra-European
transactions - also suggest that convergence continues to accelerate.
Hopes, meanwhile, that Europe's pension fund industry would quickly move
towards integration have had to be scaled back. Pension funds represent more
than Ecu700bn in the EC, of which 86 per cent are in the UK and the
Netherlands. Switzerland is another mouth-watering prospect with an
estimated Pounds 100bn of funds under management and a system recognisable
to the Anglo-Saxon eye. Efforts by the sales arms of the big London-based
investment management firms to prise away from local control even a small
proportion of this wealth have generally proved disappointing. 'The major
Dutch pension funds are no doubt getting sick of us knocking on their
doors,' observes the director of one substantial UK-based group.
The different structure of pension provision across the EC, of course,
remains a hurdle. Only in the UK and in the Netherlands, for example, are
pensions provided for and managed in separately pooled pension funds. The
French and the Italians are among those who operate a pay-as-you-go system,
whereby the present generation of workers essentially pays for its
predecessors. In Germany there is some use of tax exempt special funds but
generally pensions are paid out of a company's own assets (provided for in
the balance sheet under a special reserve).
An intriguing question for the 1990s is whether the big international groups
will be able to make headway in the more difficult markets. Fleming
Investment Management is 'looking hard' at what is required to produce the
right structure for a pensions business in France. 'We reckon that for legal
reasons it will probably have to involve an insurance dimension, though we
are still thinking about just what sort of relationship will be required
between the fund manager and the insurer,' says Mr Patrick Gifford, director
and head of marketing.
In practice it is hard to see the EC's draft pension fund directive having
more than a psychological effect. The draft stipulates that member states
will not be allowed to require pension funds to invest in particular
categories of assets, or to localise their assets in particular member
states. Member states will not be allowed to restrict the freedom of pension
funds to choose an investment manager or asset custodian established in
another member state. In practice, though, this is unlikely to alter present
practice; in most countries funds would have to increase the exposure of
most asset classes before they were up against national limits.
The proposed directive, moreover, fails to liberalise the cross-border
membership of pension funds. This may happen in time, but negotiations on
minimum vesting and funding requirements, employee representation and tax
harmonisation were thought likely to be too delicate and time-consuming. It
is significant, though, that some multinationals (notably IBM) have moved to
centralise the investment management of their various European pension
funds.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (10): Technology
breaches the barriers - The challenges facing the global custody business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE days, intermediaries in the securities markets are so busy encroaching
on each other's turf that it is not easy to see where global custodians
start and where they stop. Fund managers, brokers, settlement houses,
custodians: technology is breaking down the barriers between all these
intermediaries so fast that the shifting profile of the industry is
sometimes difficult to pin down.
The latest of these developments is taking fund managers increasingly into
areas which until now have been the preserve of custodians. Last year, after
a rearguard action by a number of large US banks, fund managers were
admitted to Swift, the international financial communication system. In
theory, that gives them access to the same messaging system used for
interbank payment and other instructions, allowing them to bypass banks
should they so wish.
The second advance has been the move by a number of big fund managers,
prompted by Fidelity, to sponsor the development of a number of competing
electronic trade confirmation systems. These will allow fund managers to
confirm details of bargains they have entered electronically, rather than
waiting for slower fax or telex messages.
By the 1993, three confirmation systems will have been launched, all of them
aimed at the European market. The fund managers who have promoted the
development of these systems hope their specifications will be used as the
basis for similar products in the US and Japan, making it possible (once
bridges between the systems have been created) to confirm trades in all
principal markets around the world.
The creation of such electronic services - and the admission of fund
managers to communication networks such as Swift - point to a move by large
fund management groups to take greater control of the process that follows
the completion of a securities trade. The desire to reduce costs and risks
has motivated such developments. Membership of international settlement
houses such as Euroclear and Cedel could be the next step, as fund managers
cut out even more of the work done by the middlemen.
These developments have come against a background of price-cutting by
custodians. Like other activities in the securities industry, success
depends on volume: faced with the high fixed costs of building and
maintaining the necessary technology, it is the custodians which can push
through the largest volumes of transactions that will do best. Most have
built proprietary systems for their custody clients, and now face the added
problem of amortising the costs of these systems faster as the clients
demand more flexible systems that allow them to communicate with a number of
different custodians.
Despite these pressures, there are still plenty of opportunities for making
a profit out of the custody business. These come either from the extension
of the basic custody service into new markets - the emerging equity markets,
for instance, or derivatives - or from the kinds of extra services
custodians can sell on the back of custody.
The emerging markets have become one of the biggest headaches for the
back-office staff of fund management firms. The cost of dealing in these
markets, and the risks incurred in failed trades, are difficult to control.
Not surprisingly, the charges made by custodians are higher for this type of
business. 'Margins are higher the further away from mature markets that you
get,' says Mr Julian Gibbs of Barclays Bank.
Despite the higher costs, it is difficult to find custodians willing to take
on the settlement risks in emerging markets. When offering 'contractual
settlement', under which investors are guaranteed settlement on the due
date, custodians also retain the right of recourse against the investor if
trades fail.
Derivative markets provide a different opportunity. Many financial
institutions around the world are still trying to come to grips with the
difficulties of valuing their derivatives portfolios and finding ways of
measuring and managing the risks they entail. Those banks which have been
longest in the derivatives business and which also act as global custodians
are well positioned to offer help in these areas to investment managers.
Meanwhile, custodians continue to make money out of services which have
traditionally sat alongside custody: stock lending, foreign exchange and
cash management.
The first of these services has come under scrutiny in the UK in recent
months in the wake of the stripping of assets from the Maxwell pension funds
under the guise of stock lending. Under review now is whether fund managers
should themselves be able to control the movement of stock, or whether this
should rest with separate entities. Any such development would partially
reverse the process which has seen fund managers encroaching more on the
custodians' territory.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (9): Market is still
untapped - European fund managers lag behind the US in the use of
derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE benefits of derivative products are being aggressively marketed to
international fund managers by banks and futures and options exchanges keen
to corner a potentially vast, and still largely untapped, market.
There is a growing interest in the applications of derivatives for hedging
exposure (protecting one position by taking the opposite position in a
derivatives market) and for asset allocation (shifting exposure from one
market to another, without changing cash holdings).
A future obliges the holder to buy or sell at a set price at a future date,
while an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy
or sell. Futures are of particular use in asset allocation, while options
can be used for stock selection.
Not surprisingly, given the growth of index-tracking and the increasing
emphasis on asset-allocation, the largest single growth area has been index
products.
Volume in the FT-SE 100 future, traded on the London International Financial
Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) has exceeded 2bn contracts so far this
year, up 67 per cent on the same period last year, while FT-SE options
volume has increased 46 per cent.
Many fund managers are still resistant to over-the-counter products offered
by banks, partly because of the credit implications, and also because they
fear such products will lack liquidity. In addition, some of the exotic
options developed by banks are considered too complex.
'The banks are often too far ahead of their customers,' one investment
banker admitted.
But European fund managers still lag behind their US counterparts in the use
of derivatives.
For example, the equity swaps market, which has now gained a foothold in the
US, has yet to catch on in Europe, in spite of being widely marketed by
banks.
Possibly, certain aspects of the concept hold particular appeal for US fund
managers. An equity swap allows fund managers to invest in a foreign market
without assuming currency risk, which is often separated from other
investment decisions.
Further, the ability to transfer expertise in one class of asset to another
is often seen as a positive factor by US investment managers.
But the most important difference is that US investors are now geared to
indexation, and the equity swap, which simulates the performance of a stock
index, is most attractive to fund managers whose target is to outperform an
index.
In an equity swap, one counterparty receives a stream of payments which
replicate the return of a direct investment in an equity index, and in
exchange makes a stream of payments to the other counterparty based on,
usually, the London interbank offered rate.
In France, the spread of equity derivatives may have received something of a
setback. French institutional investors have in recent years been active
buyers of bonds with embedded put and call options.
The use of bonds with embedded options allows some investors to circumvent
regulations on derivatives. But some of the index-linked bonds were priced
expensively and have performed poorly.
In the UK, the spread of derivatives has reached a new stage, as the early
barriers, in particular resistance from trustees, have largely been
surmounted. The clarification of fund managers' tax position in the 1990
budget proved a turning point, and, more recently, guidelines on performance
measurement have boosted confidence in fund managers' ability to manage
derivative positions.
Although there have been some negative experiences, the availability of
liquid futures and options contracts during recent periods of extreme market
volatility has won some hearts. The availability of such products 'has made
life a lot easier for fund managers,' said Mr Tony Whalley, investment
director at Scottish Widows Fund and Life Assurance. 'When fund managers
felt the (stock) market had gone too far (down), they were able to buy
futures, rather than having to worry about stock selection,' he said.
Liquidity has become increasingly concentrated in the exchange-traded
futures and options markets, and has become a crucial incentive for using
exchange-traded products.
'Futures enable you to do what you would have done anyway more cost
effectively and more quickly, without disturbing the underlying portfolio,'
according to Mr Tim Breedon, associate director, investments, at Legal &amp;
General, the UK insurance company.
The UK is expected to be the largest growth area for derivative products
within Europe. Partly, this is because the use of derivative products based
on fixed-interest bonds is already quite well established. The more recent
expansion of the equity derivatives market will have the greatest impact on
UK fund managers, because of their concentration on stock rather than bond
markets.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (6): Money is
pouring into mutual funds - United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THANKS to the Federal Reserve's willingness to cut domestic interest rates
to aid an ailing economy, money has been pouring into US mutual funds faster
than fund managers can count it.
According to figures from the Investment Company Institute, in the first
eight months of 1992 sales of stock funds totalled Dollars 92.5bn, compared
to the Dollars 57.7bn sold by the same stage last year. Demand for bond
funds has been even stronger, with sales reaching Dollars 145bn by the end
of August this year, compared to Dollars 80bn in the same period of 1991.
The total amount of assets in mutual funds has also been growing rapidly. In
1990, just over Dollars 1,067bn of assets were invested in funds, a total
which jumped to Dollars 1,347bn in 1991. By the end of the first half of
this year that figure had already reached Dollars 1,419bn.
Vast amounts of cash have been flooding into funds because US interest rates
have dropped to the lowest levels since John F Kennedy occupied the White
House. During the short recession in late 1990 and early 1991 the Fed cut
rates in small steps to boost economic activity.
Yet after the recession ended, the subsequent recovery proved to be much
slower than expected, so the Fed kept on cutting interest rates, only more
aggressively. The end result was that by mid-summer the Fed had eased
monetary policy an astonishing 24 times, and the discount rate was 3 per
cent and the bank prime rate was 6 per cent.
This sharp fall in interest rates was disastrous for investors with
short-term assets such as money-market funds and bank certificates of
deposit, where rates dropped so far that after inflation and fees were taken
out, investors were left with tiny or negative returns on their investments.
With short-term assets yielding such a poor return, investors went elsewhere
in search of better yields, and their prime destination was the stock and
bond markets. Mutual funds became the biggest beneficiaries of this huge
transfer of investor assets.
The investment fund industry, however, has not just enjoyed its best year
because of extremely low interest rates. Industry analysts believe there are
two distinct, yet equally important, secular trends that have been working
in favour of funds.
One is that individual investors are returning to the equity market after a
relatively long absence. Mr Michael Hines, a vice-president of marketing at
Fidelity, the country's biggest fund group with Dollars 180bn of assets
under management, believes that individuals are beginning to see investing
as a more fashionable form of consumption. He says: 'People today get the
same kind of psychic gratification from their investments that they got a
few years ago from buying consumer goods.'
Mr Hines thinks that individuals are now more willing to switch from the
instant gratification they get from consumer purchases, to the deferred
gratification they get from investing in stocks and bonds. 'More people are
becoming long-term, buy-and-hold investors.'
There is certainly plenty of room for more small investors' money to come
into the stock market. The share of household assets in equities is 15 per
cent, an all-time low. While many households are more concerned with
reducing their debt levels than with spending or investing, a growing number
of analysts expect them to steadily build up their holdings of stocks over
the next few years.
Generation factors are at work here. The baby boom generation is growing up
fast, and its members are looking for investments that allow them to save
for their own retirement and their children's future, while offering an
acceptable trade-off between security and the potential for capital growth.
These investors are not going to be put off equities by short-term
fluctuations in market values. A recent series of polls conducted by
Fidelity on investor activity showed that every time the market dipped this
year, individual investors saw the decline in prices as a buying
opportunity. 'These people believe in the long-term resilience of the stock
market,' says Mr Hines.
The other important trend moving in funds' favour is the growing preference
among individuals to entrust their cash to fund managers, as opposed to
investing themselves.
A recent study by the University of Michigan discovered that an astonishing
75 per cent of all the net flows of cash into financial services during the
first quarter of this year went into mutual funds.
'The cyclical trend may be to own more stocks, but the secular trend is
towards funds and away from individual ownership of equities,' says Mr
Hines.
An increasingly wide choice of stock and bond funds now exists to meet
demand from investors, and changes in technology and attitudes means they
can buy top quality money management extremely easily - by telephone
(through toll-free 800 numbers), or by post.
The product itself is also much more sophisticated. Fidelity's customers,
for example, can write cheques on their fund accounts, a service unheard of
a few years ago. Mutual funds are now regarded as a liquid asset, unlike in
the days when money was put away to be left untouched for years.
If the two secular trends hold, they will offer reasonable protection
against the fact that the present rush out of short-term bank assets and
into funds will eventually slow, and maybe even be reversed. Interest rates
are unlikely to go much lower, and the longer-term outlook for the US
economy suggests that over the two years interest rates will creep up again
as economic activity revives and the Fed moves to dampen inflationary
pressures in the economy.
If there is a cloud on the mutual fund industry's horizon, it may well be
the growing competitive presence of other financial services firms, most
notably the securities houses. Some of the biggest broking firms in the US,
such as Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman, are rapidly building
up investment management products aimed at their brokerage customers.
The secret weapon of securities firms is their distribution network. A
brokerage company has hundreds of branch offices across the US and thousands
of brokers, selling not just stocks, but in-house funds managed by the
firm's asset managers. Look at any list of the top performing US funds today
and among familiar names like Fidelity, Dreyfus and Kemper, lurk the likes
of Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (7): Gloom returns
after salvage exercise - Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE fund managers have spent the past few months in deep thought over
where to put their money. Tokyo stock prices have appeared ready to plumb
new depths, while the general feeling in Japan has been that US stock prices
are on the way down, and currency chaos in Europe has made the region's bond
markets unattractive.
The Japanese government attempted to make the life of portfolio managers a
little easier in August by announcing emergency measures to bolster stock
prices and an investment package to stimulate the economy, but the gloom
soon returned.
As part of the stock market salvage exercise, the government suggested more
pension fund savings money should flow into equities, but there is not much
evidence that the suggestion has been followed. Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking
suggested that 'we will have to wait a little longer' before these new funds
are committed to the market.
Foreign investors have been net buyers of stocks for much of this year, and
local securities houses say US and European portfolio managers have realised
they were underweight in Japan. And yet it is not clear that the Japanese
economy has bottomed.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said foreigners were net sellers in late
September and early October, but returned to the market in the middle of
this month. Japanese brokers insist that foreign investors remain interested
in the market, and that the recent selling followed the strengthening of the
yen, which tempted foreigners to take profits.
Currency fluctuations have been foremost in Japanese portfolio managers'
thoughts. Mr Eiji Arima, manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Life
Insurance, has been 'watching the currency situation closely' in the UK, but
was also cautious about the prospects for the UK economy.
Japanese investors have been severely bruised by currency fluctuations in
the past, and funds were repatriated during the currency crisis in Europe.
Mr Shinpei Kawate, investment strategist at Yasuda Trust and Banking, said
that Japanese managers will have to 'exercise great discretion' and not only
in the UK, but in all of Europe.
The souring of sentiment comes after a surge of interest in UK securities
last year, when net purchases totalled Dollars 14.5bn, up from Dollars
1.95bn in 1990. Net purchases of UK securities, mostly bonds, accounted for
19.9 per cent of all Japanese purchases, behind only the US, which accounted
for 21.3 per cent, according to Japan's ministry of finance.
But it is the home market that has most concerned Japanese fund managers.
Daiwa Investment Trust and Management set an unwelcome precedent this year
with its New Stage stock investment trust fund, which was the first fund to
receive finance ministry approval for an extension.
New Stage prospered during the late 1980s, as stock prices rose sharply.
Having reached a high of 38,915.87 in December 1989, the Nikkei market
average has been in decline, leaving the New Stage below par value. As a
result Daiwa was allowed to extend the life of the fund for three years.
The net asset value of equity and bond investment trusts fell 9.8 per cent
last year, with the net assets of stock funds down from Y35,077.2bn at the
end of 1990 to Y28,562.4bn a year later. Net asset value has continued to
decline and, at the end of August, was Y23,219.1bn.
The pressure on equity fund managers was reflected in the rush of
redemptions in 1991, which rose 2.4 times on a year earlier, with
pre-maturity redemptions the vast majority. The value of new stock funds
launched last year was down 43 per cent to Y8,640bn, the lowest level in six
years.
Bond investment trusts have done better, as their net assets rose from
Y10,921.7bn at end 1990 to Y12,911.4 in 1991, and Y18,208.1bn at the end of
August. The names are slightly deceptive, as stocks accounted for 47.9 per
cent of 'stock investment trusts' in August, with the remainder in bonds and
cash accounts.
The weakness of stock prices has clearly been a reason for individual
investors' reluctance to commit their money to investment trusts. But the
close ties between investment trust companies and Japanese brokers may be
another reason, as the securities industries scandals last year gave
investors the impression that brokers unfairly favour their corporate
clients, some of whom had received compensation for investment losses.
The image problems of Japanese fund managers and the need for better
investment yields could provide opportunities for foreign fund managers, who
are gradually gaining access to funds through the liberalisation of the
Japanese financial system. Foreign companies have been given access to
investment trusts and pension funds, but the amount of funds under foreign
management remains small.
Mr Takao Uratani, senior fund manager for National Mutual Funds Management
Japan, the Australian-based group, said the stock scandals prompted
investors to think more about the 'western style' of fund management. His
group has appointed an investment adviser to two recently launched
Asia-Pacific funds, the Yamaichi Asia Fund of Yamaichi Investment Trust
Management and another fund marketed by Sanyo Securities, the second-tier
Japanese broker.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Risk factor too
high / A look at emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETURNS in principal stock markets such as Britain and Japan have been
disappointing in recent years as economies paid the price for the
debt-financed excesses of the 1980s.
But some stock markets have shown spectacular returns. In Brazil, for
example, the IFC Index more than quadrupled between the end of 1990 and
April 1992. The Mexican market rose by 138 per cent in 1991.
Some believe that such so-called 'emerging' markets represent the best
chance for attractive investment returns in the 1990s and beyond.
There is a plausible rationale for this view. Emerging economies have faster
growth rates than industrialised nations and many are opening their markets
to the private sector and to overseas investors. The prospects for corporate
earnings growth and for investment returns should thus be greater.
Emerging markets are also less 'efficient' than stock markets in developed
economies and therefore present greater opportunities for exploiting pricing
anomalies for profit.
There is no universally-agreed definition of an emerging market but the
areas which normally fit into this category include Latin America, south
Asia, eastern Europe and some small Mediterranean countries.
Nick Train of GT Management, says research has shown that these markets have
little or no correlation with each other, or with the stock markets of
developed economies. Of course, this is not always a positive factor, since
it means emerging markets can fall when developed markets are rising. But it
does mean emerging markets represent a genuine diversification of risk.
To date, most institutional investors have little exposure to the emerging
markets sector. Fund Research, the group which analyses collective funds,
said in a recent report: 'Although emerging markets account for 13 per cent
of the world's GNP and perhaps 80 per cent of the world's population, their
market capitalisation is only 6 per cent of total world capitalisation and
they probably represent only around 0.5 per cent of institutional investors'
total portfolio holdings.'
So will pension fund managers move more aggressively into this area, and
just as importantly, should they do so? There are plenty of
counter-arguments to the bull case.
The main problem is stock markets in such countries are normally
underdeveloped. It can be difficult to gain access to the kind of
information pension fund managers would expect to receive from companies in
industrialised nations. And liquidity is a particular problem, creating the
risk that managers buy into markets when they are fashionable, only to be
stranded when the area falls from favour.
Often, there are only a few shares in which institutional investors can
realistically buy holdings. In Colombia, for example, 82.5 per cent of the
market's capitalisation at the end of June consisted of just 10 stocks.
These difficulties have not stopped pension funds from investing in some
emerging markets. According to Tim Gardener, head of asset planning at
actuaries Mercer Fraser, there is already investment in the lesser-developed
Pacific basin countries such as Korea, Thailand and Malaysia of around 1.5
to 2.5 per cent of pension fund assets.
The Pacific basin has established its reputation as an area with superior
GDP growth performance, says Mercer Fraser's Gardener. But he believes
investment interest in other areas such as Latin America and eastern Europe
has been more supply-led with well-established names bringing out funds in
an attempt to attract investors.
'Projections of GDP growth in these areas are more speculative,' says Mr
Gardener. 'The illiquidity of markets is also an issue, and the charging
structure within these funds tends to be high.'
When closed-end funds are launched in temporarily fashionable areas,
investors have frequently found that the shares trade at a heavy discount
when the excitement dwindles. The average discount on UK-listed country
funds was around 32 per cent in October.
Nevertheless, for most pension fund managers who want exposure to emerging
markets, a fund still represents the most logical route. Given the likely
size of investment in any individual market, it would be hard to justify the
time and effort involved in researching the companies involved.
If the recent problems of the world economy continue, some would expect
interest in emerging markets to increase, as they are one of the few
investment sectors offering the prospect of exciting returns.
But Mr Gardener doubts whether pension funds will see a significant increase
in exposure to emerging markets in the near future. 'Many pension funds see
this field as akin to venture capital,' he says. 'And with so much
uncertainty in major economies, this is not a climate for taking big risks.'
And he makes a more general point. This could be the wrong time for pension
funds to move into such a high risk area since the funds are getting more
mature and thus likely to realign their portfolios in favour of bonds rather
than equities.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): A good ride in
most markets - Those who have increased exposure to bonds are looking fairly
content
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEEN from one perspective, it has been a good year for bond market
investors. The rally in the world's main government bond markets has been
surprisingly uniform: the US, Japanese and German bond markets all gained
over 7 per cent in the first nine months of this year, with the latter two
managing more than 8 per cent, according to the J P Morgan government bond
index.
With further interest rate falls in prospect in all three - and with
sustained falls in Germany still awaited - it is not surprising that fund
managers who have increased their exposure to bonds are looking fairly
content with life.
Turmoil in the currency markets, of course, has made any such view overly
simplistic. Whereas domestic investors have had a good ride in most markets,
international fund managers have seen concern over currency risk deepedn. A
domestic UK investor could boast an 11 per cent return from gilts in the
first nine months: but an unhedged USDollars -based investor had made a gain
of only 5.6 per cent, while a D-Mark investor was looking at a loss of 1.4
per cent.
Europe's currency upheaval has upset two of the favourite pastimes of fund
managers over the past two years. The first involved dabbling in higher
yielding European bond markets, both at and beyond the margins of the EC, to
benefit from the economic and monetary union that European politicians had
promised. This so-called 'convergence' play came to an abrupt halt when
Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in early June, and could have
been finished off for good by the turmoil in the European exchange rate
mechanism in September.
The obvious casualties were bond markets such as Italy's, where the yield on
10-year bonds, having narrowed to nearly 250 basis points (2.5 per cent)
above the yield on German bonds, jumped back to more than 500 basis points.
Even yields on French bonds have leapt from 40 to more than 100 basis points
above German levels, in spite of France's strong economic fundamentals.
One result is that Ecu bonds are now worth considerably less than the sum of
their parts. Touted as the future for Europe's bond markets only a matter of
months ago, few now expect this battered basket currency to regain centre
stage as the vehicle for European monetary union. The rushed exit of market
makers and investors, all of whom are long on bonds they no longer want, has
forced the yield on Ecu bonds to rise to nearly 50 basis points above its
theoretical level.
The second ploy that had developed around the ERM involved a form of
cross-hedging. With short-term US interest rates at a low level, money
market funds in the US had taken to investing heavily in higher yielding
European bonds. To hedge their exposure, most had used the D-Mark or the
Ecu.
That seemed a safe bet when the ERM was perceived as a fixed exchange rate
system. Its weaknesses were savagely exposed in September, though, as
sterling and the lira were ejected from the mechanism and the peseta was
devalued.
The question now hanging over the European bond markets is to what extent
the convergence process can be kicked back into life. Markets like France
and Denmark, putative members of any 'hard core' of European countries
centred on the D-Mark, may offer the safest short-term gains. Currencies
such as the peseta, the lira and sterling are likely to remain off many fund
managers' buy lists.
Meanwhile, predicting the timing and scale of interest rate reductions
around the world has become the main pastime of fixed income investors.
Although German money market rates have already slid by a percentage point
from their peak, the Bundesbank has offered little encouragement to those
who believe a rapid fall is on the way. Despite the relatively low interest
rates in Japan and the US, both countries' economies continue to sag,
suggesting neither has hit the bottom of its interest rate cycle. Against
this background, bond markets could be the place to be - and the investors
who do best will be the ones who predict where interest rates will fall.
Two considerations could hold back gains in the bond markets: fears about
the scale of fiscal deficits in some countries, and a concern that falling
interest rates will push up inflation once the world economy strengthens.
So far, inflation generally remains a distant concern. The German and
Japanese authorities have applied their monetary squeeze for longer than
most market commentators thought necessary. The risk of plunging these
economies into a sharp recession, rather than the danger of inflation, is
uppermost in investors' minds.
The need to fund large fiscal deficits could pose a more serious threat to
bond yields, preventing the sort of falls that might otherwise be expected.
This is particularly true in Europe in the short-term. Since the Danish
referendum first unsettled European markets, a number of countries - among
them Italy, Spain and Sweden - have delayed moves to fund their fiscal
deficits, preferring to wait for conditions to improve. The result is an
overhang of new bonds, which will help to keep yields up.
The size of deficits in a number of countries next year could also put a
strain on bond markets. Any further delays to economic upturn would hold
down tax revenues and force social security spending higher, keeping
deficits in the forefront of investors' minds for some time to come.
Some fund managers regard this fear as exaggerated. Mr Paul Abberley of
Lombard Odier, which manages Dollars 2.7bn of international fixed income
funds, predicts the impact of higher deficits will be small: 'Yields may be
around 15 basis points higher than they would otherwise be.' Savings rates
have risen into double digits to compensate, he says, and anyway the gains
from falling inflation far outweigh the cost of higher deficits. The outcome
of this tussle between the effects of gathering recession and the threat of
returning inflation will set the mood in bond markets in the future.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): New discipline
for decisions - Is currency overlay just a fad? Peter Montagnon examines the
theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS DIFFICULT to believe that as recently as early September sterling was
worth nearly Dollars 2. Since then, there has been Black Wednesday. Sterling
and the lira are out of the ERM and, quietly in the background, the yen has
strengthened against just about every other principal currency.
It all adds up to a nightmare for international fund managers. Assuming they
have managed to pick the right equity or bond, they risk seeing their return
destroyed by a seemingly unpredictable lurch in the currency markets. Or,
conversely, such a movement can compensate for and disguise what was
otherwise a foolish investment decision.
The response of some fund managers, particularly those based in the US, has
been to adopt a new approach to investment: the currency overlay theory
which involves an attempt to separate out currency from other investment
decisions and then hedging the currency risk as appropriate. Such an
unbundling adds a new discipline to investment decisions, but UK fund
managers remain sceptical - which prompts the question whether currency
overlay is just another North American fad.
The attraction of currency overlay is perhaps particularly strong for a
dollar-based investor in the present market constellation. In recent times
the US currency has been weak. So currency movements have tended to enhance
return. Now, many economists feel the trend could be reversed with the
dollar strengthening as German interest rates decline and the extent of the
European slowdown becomes apparent.
If that does happen, US funds could pay a high price for an international
diversification which gathered pace during the second half of the 1980s.
Some large funds now have 15 to 20 per cent of their assets offshore and in
one or two cases the proportion could be as high as 30 per cent.
In the US, some 15 funds have appointed separate managers to handle currency
exposure in the belief most international equity managers do not have
adequate currency expertise. According to Ms Margaret Waller, who
specialises in currency overlay advice at Pareto Partners, the share of
currency gain in total return has been 27 per cent for a dollar-based fund
over the past 10 years.
More important, perhaps is the way the picture shifted at the time of the
Plaza Accord on the dollar in 1985. In the early 80s investors who had
failed to hedge their overseas equity portfolio would have suffered a
currency loss of some Dollars 49 for every Dollars 100 invested, Ms Waller
says. As the dollar fell, those who were fully hedged would, by the end of
the decade, have suffered an opportunity cost of Dollars 98 on every Dollars
100.
Currency overlay may also have some appeal for Australian institutions who
are confronted with a volatile currency and the need to diversify away from
a relatively small home market. Continental investors who have traditionally
tended to concentrate more on bonds than on equities and then also more in
their home markets may also find it useful as they diversify. By contrast UK
investors have some strong reservations.
One reason, according to Mr Robert Schwob of Quorum Capital Management, is
the fear among institutions that they might lose their tax exempt status if
an active policy of currency management prompted the Inland Revenue to
reclassify them as currency traders. More important are probably the
pragmatic objections of fund managers.
'With equities, for most of the time, the decision that you like an equity
and you like the currency goes together,' says Ms Caroline Burton of GRE.
Not all investors want the currency risk to be hedged, she adds.
Some fund managers such as Mr Tom Crombie, of Scottish Equitable, admittedly
believe the UK is, as he puts it, 'ducking the issue'.
'In the past year US bonds have been a good investment, but the dollar
hasn't. You should have detached the bond from the currency,' he says. Even
Mr Crombie, however, is doubtful about the systematic approach called for by
overlay theory. 'There is a spurious precision in having this great matrix,'
he says. Separating out currency risk requires 'a particularly strong
currency view', adds Mr Robin Garrow of Scottish Widows.
Among objections to hedging currency risk in equity investments is the
possibility that the company whose shares are being bought may itself derive
much of its earnings abroad. Investors may not know whether that exposure is
hedged or not.
Even the so-called experts frequently misjudge the market. 'Currencies don't
respond to any rules. We're not aware of any academic evidence that suggests
you can do good forecasts,' says Mr Terry Prideaux of Kemper Investment
Management. In theory it should be possible to judge whether a currency is
correctly valued on the basis of its purchasing power parity, but experience
shows that, if this measure is relevant, it only works over long periods.
In the short run, the currency markets are vulnerable to all kinds of shock.
After last year's attempted coup in the Soviet Union, the dollar soared by 4
per cent when US markets were closed.
Then again, this type of objection may ascribe more to currency overlay
theory than its practitioners would themselves claim. 'We aren't forecasting
direction but volatility,' says Mr Schwob. Simil-arly, for Pareto Partners
currency overlay involves first and foremost assessing the degree of risk in
a portfolio based on the volatility of thecurrencies involved and then
hedging that risk so that it is reduced to an acceptable level.
The process should minimise large-scale losses arising from currency
fluctuations. Those who adopt it can at least claim that they have a system
in place for protection. That may provide considerable comfort in the event
that they are called to account when things go wrong. Whether their funds
will outperform in the longer run is another matter. After all, currency
overlay also reduces the scope for gain, and places much greater onus on
international managers to pick the right stock in markets that can never be
as wholly familiar as their own.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (2): Forecasts for
1993 are bleak - The performance of equity markets has been disappointing
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slow pace of economic recovery in the United States and the German
Bundesbank's reluctance to reduce interest rates are to blame for the
disappointing performance of global equity markets this year.
The fluctuations of leading stock market indices also suggest that
international fund managers were too quick to anticipate a US-led global
economic recovery as well as lower interest rates in Europe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its record high, of 3,413.21, on June
1, the culmination of a 7.3 per cent rally which started in the early days
of April. The rally was mainly fuelled by what turned out to be short-lived
signs of an upturn in economic activity.
The realisation that the US economy was still far from recovery and
uncertainty ahead of the presidential election in November eroded the gains
in the Dow Jones over the summer, and the index is now languishing just
above the year's low of 3,136.58.
Similar patterns are evident in the UK and German stock markets. The
FTSE-100 also reached its record high of 2,737.80 on May 11 in the wake of
the Conservative Party's fourth general election victory. But the index fell
back over the summer as fund managers decided that the economic fundamentals
were unchanged.
Germany's DAX index climbed to a 1992 high of 1,811.57 on May 25 on hopes
that Germany would lead the way for lower interest rates. Cyclical stocks
were particularly in favour as fund managers took the view that they would
be the first to benefit from stronger demand in global economy.
But disappointing interim results from the corporate sector, and the
Bundesbank's grudgingly small cut in interest rates, in spite of growing
signs that the German economy was slowing down, brought the DAX index down
to the year's low of 1,420.30 in early October. It has since recovered
slightly.
Tokyo's equity problems, on the other hand, had a limited impact on stock
markets in the rest of the world, in spite of a fall of 40 per cent in the
Nikkei average in the first eight months of the year, from 23,801.18 to
14,309.41. The index has since recovered, thanks to government support
measures, to trade around the 17,000 level by late October.
Equity strategists say that the fall in Japanese equities did not have a
'domino' effect on other leading stock markets because the reasons for the
fall - a slowdown in the economy, and the bursting of the property
speculation bubble - were seen as the country's specific problems.
Furthermore, many international fund managers had reduced their exposure to
the Japanese equity market late in 1991 because of what they regarded as
excessively high valuations.
However, strategists are concerned about the effect of attempts by Japanese
institutions to correct their over-extension into foreign capital markets.
Ms Lisa Hosking, strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London (CSFB),
fears that the repatriation of Japanese funds, as well as a flight of
capital into the D-Mark and the Swiss franc during the currency turmoil in
the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), means that there is less capital
available for second-line markets in Europe, such as Spain and Italy, in
Scandinavia, and for markets in the Far East.
One exception to this scenario is Hong Kong, which rose to a record high of
6,162.53 on the Hang Seng index in mid-July, a jump of 43 per cent since the
start of the year. Hong Kong's closeness to China, whose economy is starting
to grow rapidly due to a change of direction on economic reform, has been
the main attraction for international investors.
The Hong Kong stock market fell back slightly in the late summer but news in
mid-October of a trade agreement between China and the US, designed to open
China's markets to foreign goods, is expected to revive investor interest
once again.
Looking towards 1993, projections from some brokers point to an
outperformance of bonds and cash, and have therefore increased their
weightings in these instruments at the expense of equities.
Mr Andrew Garthwaite at SG Warburg says in his international asset briefing
for the fourth quarter that even though a 5-10 per cent recovery in earnings
in most equity markets would return bond-to-earnings ratios to reasonable
valuations, a much stronger recovery is needed to rebuild dividend cover, as
well as to secure sufficient dividend growth to bring bond-to-dividend
ratios back to 'fair' values.
This view is echoed by County NatWest, which has raised its cash allocation
to 10 per cent, against a benchmark of 5 per cent, and bonds to 30 per cent,
mainly at the expense of European equities. Although the broker expects
equity returns to outpace those available on cash and bonds, the margin is
not sufficient to compensate fully for the higher risk attached to equity
investments.
But for those fund managers who require a weighting in equities, Ms Hosking
would recommend the safer markets in Europe, which should benefit the most
from the expectation of falling interest rates next year. Her preferred
markets are the Netherlands, France, the UK and Switzerland.
This scenario is now plausible after the recent plunge in continental
bourses caused by the severe tensions in the ERM and the resulting
devaluations of the lira, sterling and the peseta. However, County NatWest
warns that the boost from falling interest rates will have to be balanced
against a deteriorating earnings profile, especially in Germany.
The imminent presidential election in the US - and the prospect of a victory
for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democrat candidate - has increased the risks
attached to US assets. Even though strategists believe that the financial
markets would welcome a change of administration, they fear that Mr
Clinton's commitment to infrastructure spending will add to the budget
deficit at a time when international capital is harder to attract.
A more pressing problem for equity markets, however, is the growing
consensus that the US is unable, and perhaps unwilling, to continue to be
the engine of economic growth for the rest of the world. Its would-be
successor is either Germany or Japan, but neither country has yet come
forward to assume the responsibility.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (1):  Portfolio of
uncertainties - European governments have been given a punishing
demonstration of the power of international capital flows. At the same time,
investors have had to reconsider the importance of currency decisions. Barry
Riley evaluates the lessons learned during a summer of crisis, and considers
the implications of the global economic slowdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THIS SUMMER the fast-growing international portfolio management industry
provided a reminder of its power, but perhaps also of its ultimate political
vulnerability.
Cross-border investment flows have soared in the past decade or so,
reflecting the liberalisation of exchange controls in many countries, and
reflecting also the growth of huge imbalances in the flows of funds around
the world.
By and large, governments have welcomed the appearance of vast international
buying demand for their bonds. Indeed, it is possible to argue that these
global investors may have encouraged fiscal deficits in countries such as
the US and Germany to grow larger than might have been possible, if
long-term financing were available only from domestic sources.
Multinational companies, too, have viewed positively their ability to issue
bonds and shares around the world.
But these huge global portfolios have represented a powerful potential for
currency speculation, when combined with the corporate treasury departments
which are also extremely active in the foreign exchange and currency
deriv-atives markets.
The European currency crisis built up after the Danish 'No' referendum vote
at the beginning of June. It finally erupted in mid-September with the
partial breakdown of the European Community's exch-ange rate mechanism and
the devaluation of sterling, the lira, the peseta and other currencies.
Until June, the international markets had swallowed the idea of European
convergence. German government bonds were still the most highly-regarded,
but investors were buying, for instance, French and British government paper
on narrowing spreads over bunds. Last winter and spring, about half of the
issuance of UK gilts was being absorbed by foreigners, an unprecedented
situation.
But now European governments have been given a punishing demonstration of
the power of international capital flows. For their part, international
investors have been forced to reconsider and upgrade the importance that
currency decisions should play in portfolio management, with the
development, for instance, of systems of currency overlay management.
Presumably, a great many international investors profited from the
willingness of European governments to buy up tens of billions of dollars
worth of their own and their EC partners' currencies to maintain what, by
mid-September, were obviously indefensible fixed parities.
We shall never know accurately, but European taxpayers have probably
bolstered the profits of banks, corporate treasury departments and
international investment institutions by more than Dollars 5bn.
But floating currencies present an entirely different scale of risk.
Moreover, the global economic situation is looking increasingly dangerous as
growth stutters or stops in most of the leading economies.
One consequence could be the loss of momentum of globalisation, a process
which has rapidly changed the face of equity and bond markets around the
world. Global investors have already had to face the Wall Street crash of
1987 and the slower but even more spectacular crash in Tokyo between 1990
and August this year. At that point Japanese equities staged a strong bounce
off the bottom, but only after a 60 per cent price collapse in about 2 1/2
years.
Slightly earlier, a series of international equity issues tested the
robustness of the global market. The Wellcome offering got away, albeit at a
lower price, and in a lower size, than had once been expected, but the
flotation of the Irish aircraft leasing company, GPA, collapsed
ignominiously at the last moment amid loud recriminations.
Perhaps the biggest problem now facing international fund managers is what
to do about their exposure to US equities and bonds. The dollar has been
weak but may well recover. On the other hand Wall Street has looked
overvalued for some time and would probably collapse on any sign of rises in
short-term dollar interest rates. As for US Treasury bonds, they yield less
than DM bonds but the fiscal outlook under a Clinton administration might be
seen as worrying.
At one level this raises the currency problem again. In circumstances
(falling interest rates) in which a country's capital markets are likely to
be buoyant the currency will probably be weak - and vice versa. Thus the
recent strength of the EC core nations' currencies has been accompanied by
sliding prices on the bourses.
At another level the problem of asset allocation is highlighted. The global
manager with an open mandate, in theory, has unlimited access to currencies
and money markets, to stock markets and to bond markets. There are
possibilities in commodities too, and in a variety of derivative markets.
In practice, these choices are usually restricted, often by expressing the
manager's objectives in terms of a benchmark, which can be either an index
of some kind, or the average performance of some group of similar
portfolios.
At the moment, many international equity managers are rather underweight in
US equities, but because the US stock market represents 41 per cent of
global capitalisation (and 46 per cent of, for example, a World ex UK
benchmark) there is still likely to be a substantial exposure.
It is a lesser version of the Japanese problem that developed towards the
end of the 1980s, when eventually the Tokyo market represented 45 per cent
of the global market, and as much as 70 per cent of the World ex US
capitalisation, this being a benchmark much favoured by US clients owning
international equity portfolios. Tokyo, incidentally, now accounts for only
about 26 per cent of global capitalisation.
Global investors prudently stayed underweight in Japan in the late 1980s,
but unwisely decided to move back into Tokyo in 1991. That was after the
first large downward leg in Japanese equities, but before the second one.
According to the forthcoming 1992 report on International Equity Flows,
produced by Baring Securities, as much as Dollars 46.8bn flowed from the US,
UK, France and Switzerland into Japanese stocks last year.
Overall, net cross-border flows reached Dollars 102.2bn last year, fuelled
by a big international diversification drive by US pension funds. According
to the consultants, Greenwich Associates, the average exposure of US pension
funds to international equities rose from 2.7 per cent in 1988 to 4.4 per
cent at the end of last year. Moreover, plan sponsors say that they expect
the figure to rise to 7.2 per cent by the end of 1994, equivalent to an
outflow of more than Dollars 20bn a year.
On the other hand, the big outflows of Japanese money into global markets -
especially bonds but also equities - have largely disappeared as the
Japanese have become preoccupied with the financial crisis at home.
Recently, too, they have been retreating from Europe, which has disappointed
their hopes of financial and political stability.
As for Europe, British pension funds, previously leaders in global
investment, are likely to have their hands full at home financing the
government's soaring fiscal deficit. Some smaller countries, such as the
Netherlands, are developing a new taste for cross-border diversification,
but Germany's big capital outflows of the late 1980s have collapsed under
the impact of unification.
According to International Equity Flows, 1992 could, therefore, be quite a
subdued year overall for cross-border stock market investment, although net
flows could total some Dollars 50bn. At the end of last year 8.1 per cent
(or Dollars 890m) of equities worldwide were held by cross-border investors,
and this could be between 8.5 and 9 per cent by the end of this year.
However, the scope for good performance by equities in a weakening global
economy may be questionable. Many fund managers are more enthused by the
potential in bonds as inflationary pressures subside in many economies and
real interest rates fall.
If the economic picture becomes seriously troubled, however, global
investors may find that the freedoms they came to expect during the
optimistic 1980s may be reduced. Already Europe's ERM crisis has resulted in
the partial reimposition of exchange controls in countries such as Spain and
Ireland.
All too often politicians do not like the message of the market and given
the chance they can be inclined to shoot the messenger.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (20): Arts subsidy cuts now restored -
East German cultural scene
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THEATRE, opera houses and orchestras in east Germany which until 1989 served
as heavily-subsidised showpieces of the Communist leadership in Berlin are
being forced to adjust to a somewhat less profligate patron in far-off Bonn.
Cries of betrayal arose from Rostock to Gera when the German government
announced in its planned budget for 1993 that subsidies for culture in east
Germany would be slashed to DM350m from DM780m this year, (DM900m in 1991).
Mr Hans-Joachim Meyer, the CDU minister of arts in Saxony, the most populous
east German Land which receives nearly 40 per cent of the subsidies, warned
that if such cuts took place his state could not support its museums,
theatres and orchestras of which even the smallest towns boast.
'Even the existence of the opera houses in Leipzig and Chemnitz would be
threatened,' he said. Leipzig has one of the leading opera houses in Germany
and Chemnitz has only just rebuilt its bombed-out opera house which is to be
re-opened in December.
Already under severe attack in east Germany for allowing the region's
industry to collapse, Chancellor Helmut Kohl had second thoughts about
opening himself to criticism that he was about to devastate the cultural
landscape of east Germany.
After hearing the complaints of the five east German Lander chiefs - all but
one from his own CDU - Chancellor Kohl agreed to restore many of the cuts.
The cultural allotment for east Germany was raised to DM650m next year.
This figure does not include additional subsidies to the performing arts in
east Berlin which come out of special cultural allotments in the Berlin and
Federal budgets.
The German taxpayer has been spared the cost of rescuing the east German
film industry located at the pre-war UFA studios at Babelsberg outside
Berlin.
CGE of France and Bertelsmann, the German media giant, combined to purchase
the DEFA studios at Babelsberg from the Treuhand privatisation company and
plan to build a media city housing two German television networks, a film
academy and the renovated DEFA studios now headed by Volker Schlondorff, the
film-maker, and the French businessman, Pierre Couveinhes.
East German theatres in particular have been hit by the dramatic fall in
purchases of tickets by citizens whose priorities have shifted to durable
consumer goods, travel and, in the case of the unemployed, sheer survival.
Fewer than half the number of tickets were sold in the past year (a total of
4.2m), compared with 1989.
In order to reduce costs, several towns such as Halberstadt and Quedlinburg
in the Harz Mountains have decided to amalgamate their theatres along with
Freiburg and Dobeln in Saxony.
East German theatre, opera and orchestra personnel have agreed to a
relatively modest 5.4 per cent increase in pay this year and to delay until
next January 1 receiving 74 per cent of the pay of their west German
counterparts.
But the axe is expected to fall in 1994 when Federal subsidies for culture
in the east are to be slashed to virtually zero and the full brunt of
subsidising the performing arts will fall on the impoverished east German
Lander and communities.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (22): More pluses than minuses - Quality
of life in Germany: a personal vie - After six years in Germany, FT
correspondent Andrew Fisher is preparing to return to Britain. Here, in a
personal view, he presents his likes and dislikes about life in modern
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER, FT Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVY, one of the most insidious of emotions, lies behind much of the
criticism of Germany which has flared up so unpleasantly in the UK and
elsewhere recently.
It was the impact of Germany's high interest rates and the consequences of
the Bonn government's fiscal laxity in adjusting to unification that sparked
off September's European currency turbulence. Sterling's forced exit from
the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) led to a degree of bitterness
which laid bare what many foreigners feel about Germany.
Anyone on a short visit can gain a fair idea of what there is to be envious
about in modern Germany, at least in the west since the new eastern states
lag well behind in the prosperity league. But you need to live in the
country to be able to balance out the negatives and positives of life in
Germany.
Here is an attempt from someone who has spent six years in the country and
is returning to recession-dogged Britain. Certainly, there are more pluses
than minuses in Germany. It is prosperous, clean, efficient, and full of
attractive towns and beautiful scenery. Its beer is about the best in the
world, its cakes, bread, and sausages are delicious, and it is possible to
eat well and cheaply in restaurants as well as expensively.
The country's numerous wine and beer festivals - the Oktoberfest being the
most famous and raucous - add a flavour to life that is typically German.
So do the Bavarian beer gardens, where the drink is served in big litre mugs
for those who can manage them and succulent legs of pork (with crackling)
and dumplings are a tasty accompaniment.
In Hesse, the state which contains the financial centre of Frankfurt, apple
wine is the local tipple and the pork mostly comes without crackling.
What else marks out the quality of life in Germany? For one thing, getting
to work is not usually the hassle it is in the UK, where London is the
dominant centre.
Germany's prosperity is spread amongst a host of cities, towns, and regions
so that lengthy commuting journeys are less common. Also, the train system
is reliable; there is little of the overcrowding that often renders journeys
on the London underground such a discomfort and time-keeping certainly beats
that on Network Southeast.
Getting around by road is easy, too. But maybe this is the time to mention
some of the negatives. Traffic jams are becoming more common and that
scourge of modern roads, the tailgating driver, is a common and dangerous
irritant, especially at the fast speeds which many Germans love.
Tailbacks on the autobahns can reach horrendous lengths at holiday times and
weekends as Germans indulge what seems to be a mania for travelling near and
far - anything it seems, but staying at home.
What is certain is that they are not usually journeying to shop. One of the
most frustrating features of Germany is its restrictive shopping hours, the
product of an alliance between employers and unions which leaves out the
consumers' interests. Shops and stores close punctually on weekday evenings
(there is a late Thursday) and have limited Saturday opening. The UK debate
about Sunday trading might be happening on Mars for all the relevance it has
to Germany.
On the other hand, most Germans do not seem too bothered about such curbs on
their freedom. Rules and regulations are generally treated with awe or, at
least, respect as anyone who has had anything to do with bureaucracies can
attest. My wife, a German who has lived long in the UK, has come home fuming
from many of her visits to local officialdom.
Since Germans tend to admire order, discipline, and Leistung (performance,
or achievement), it is hardly surprising that spontaneity and gaiety are not
among their most prominent qualities. Perhaps that is why they migrate by
the thousands at holiday-times to sunnier, hedonistic places like Italy,
France, and Spain, or more distant spots in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.
Fun, it often seems, is to be found abroad and efficiency at home.
That is, of course, far too simplistic. Germans like to enjoy themselves,
and not just in Bavarian beer gardens. A favourite saying is: Man soll die
Feste feiern, wie sie fallen, loosely translatable as 'Enjoy yourself while
you can.' Many Germans are certainly well-off enough to do that, their
spending power bolstered by the inexorable strength of the D-mark.
So why is there a sort of reverse envy about other countries, including
Britain where the pound was worth DM11 when I first visited Germany in the
mid-1960s and now languishes at around DM2.50? It is not Germans who express
polite sympathy when told of our return to the UK - it is the British. Many
Germans like London for its liveliness and variety and the British for their
friendliness and relaxed way of life.
Germans are also uneasily aware that they are less likely to react sensibly
to crisis, based on their recent history, than people in countries like the
UK or Italy. With economic growth fading, social unrest in east Germany
manifesting itself in ugly attacks by mindless skinheads on foreign
asylum-seekers, and more tax increases likely to finance unification, there
is much about Germany that foreigners do not envy.
There are other consolations about returning to Britain. The television is
better, the newspapers more entertaining - disregarding both countries'
garish tabloids - the films are not dubbed, and the service usually more
willing. When these flag, there are always the antics of the Royal Family to
take the mind off recession.
Pity about the beer, though.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (21): Boost for Berlin opera houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME SMALL less-developed countries have budgets not much larger than the
DM1.2bn annual subsidy which will be showered next year on Berlin's opera
houses, symphony orchestras, theatres and museums, writes Leslie Collitt.
Next year's cultural budget will rise by a heady 19 per cent to hit a record
2.7 per cent of total city expenditures.
Even Berlin's cultural balance sheet this year does not exactly reflect
hard-strapped budgets in Berlin and Bonn: revenues consist of a paltry
DM107m while expenditures are a whopping DM986m. The difference is made up
by DM668.4m in subsidies from the Berlin budget and DM210m from the German
government.
Although Berlin supports no less than three leading opera houses - two in
the east and one in the west - any suggestion that this might be a luxury at
a time of strict budget constraints is regarded as heresy. A flourishing
operatic, musical and theatrical establishment - itself a not insignificant
economic entity employing 45,000 people - is also seen by the business
community as an important element in attracting top-flight executives to
Berlin and enhancing Berlin's appeal for visitors.
All three Berlin opera houses have top directors to match the more than
DM177m they receive in subsidies. Opera buffs can choose between the
Deutsche Oper (DM78.4m) under Gotz Friedrich, the Komische Oper (DM41.2m)
led by Harry Kupfer and the Staatsoper (DM58m) under its new artistic
director, Daniel Barenboim.
Despite the subsidies, the blood-letting in personnel of the two east Berlin
operas has been heavy. Nearly a third of the singers at the Staatsoper were
sacked and Georg Quander, the Intendant, said tartly that if artistic
criteria had been the sole yardstick - and not job security regulations -
then only one-third would have survived. Gotz Friedrich, whose Deutsche Oper
has bred top-flight singers such as Jessye Norman and Cheryl Sweet, and
Harry Kupfer are both in the 'realistic music theatre' tradition of the late
Walter Felsenstein. Thus, even a lyrical performance of Verdi's La Boheme by
Friedrichs at the Deutsche Oper manages to portray the sharp social
divisions of the time.
Berlin's other cultural jewel, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra which gets
DM23.4m in subsidies, is under the baton of its new artistic director,
Claudio Abbado, who is having few problems filling the shoes of the late
Herbert von Karajan. Radio-Symphonie-Orchestra (DM7.4m), conducted by
Vladimir Ashkenazy, has gained greatly in stature in recent years. Berliner
Sinfonieorchester (DM11.6m) was East Berlin's leading orchestra and has a
strong following in the east. But it has the drawback of playing in the
opulently-restored Schauspielhaus whose accoustics are far from ideal.
Deutsches Theater in east Berlin (DM23m), one of the German-speaking world's
leading theatres, has becoming the leading 'state theatre' of Berlin,
eclipsing west Berlin's Schiller Theater and Schlosspark-Theater which get
(DM40.7m).
Berliner Ensemble, also in east Berlin, was founded by Bertolt Brecht and
suffered from arteriosclerosis long before the collapse of Communist rule.
It gets DM14.7m in subsidies and is to be jointly run by several leading
east German directors.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (19): Hamburg - A revitalised gateway /
Bright prospects for the port-city, media metropolis and high tech centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to believe that just seven years ago, Hamburg was trailing behind
the rest of West Germany, a depressed city with double the national average
unemployment.
Its port and its shipbuilding industry had been through traumatic
adjustments with mass redundancies, and the big oil refining industry was
languishing from the effects of the latest oil price shock.
Germany's prosperity seemed to be shifting ever more to the south, leaving
the proud Hanseatic port city out on the periphery of both the German and
the European economies.
And then the city picked itself up. Today it is bursting at the seams, the
streets bustling, shops bulging with goods, cranes swinging over a string of
large property developments, and with an air of self-confidence which would
have been unthinkable back in 1985.
Business at the port is stronger than ever, while financial services,
especially insurance and banking, run second only to Frankfurt; and Hamburg
is the undisputed media capital of Germany.
Where it is was formerly headquarters for a declining shipbuilding industry,
it is the aerospace and aviation sector, with Deutsche Airbus, and
Lufthansa's marketing and maintenance divisions, which is the dominant force
today.
Part of the story is about German unification, that windfall of history
which has left Hamburg no longer cut off, with a third of its natural
hinterland behind the Iron Curtain, but ideally placed as the best equipped
gateway to eastern Germany and the rest of eastern Europe - not to mention a
revitalised Baltic Sea basin.
But unification was really only the icing on the cake. For Hamburg had
already managed to turn the corner towards a recovered prosperity well
before the Berlin Wall came down: it is rather a story of the remarkable
depth and resilience of the German economy.
'Things looked lousy for us back in 1985,' says Dr Urda Martens-Jeebe, of
the Hamburg business development corporation, (HWF).
'There was the oil price shock (five oil majors have their German
headquarters in Hamburg), unemployment was rising, shipyard subsidies were
being drastically cut: it was a structural and economic crisis.'
That was the year when the HWF was founded, in what at the time must have
appeared as a fairly desperate effort to bring back jobs to the city. It was
also the year the city hit the bottom of its own regional recession, and
started to bounce back. It was a fortunate coincidence.
'From 1986/87, the growth in investment picked up to the national average,'
according to Dr Claus Noe, the state secretary for economics in the city
government. 'It was the first signal that the structural crisis had been
overcome.
'Between 1987 and 1989, two things happened which helped Hamburg. First, the
psychology disappeared that there was a north-south divide in Germany. And
that was supported by the development in competitive costs.
'Our big rivals, such as Munich, Frankfurt and Dusseldorf, were showing
classic symptoms of boom conditions: rents, land prices, and transport
problems were all combining to frighten off the investors. They started
looking around for another site, and Hamburg suddenly was in demand.'
Hamburg may have suddenly started to enjoy a significant competitive
advantage, but the hard graft of the HWF has also paid off. The aim was to
make the city more conscious of investors, and investors more aware of the
city.
'We had to make the city more friendly towards business,' says Dr
Martens-Jeebe.
'It is our job to make it clear if the economic policies of the Senate - the
city's governing council - are not in the interests of the business
community.'
The HWF tried to identify those areas where, in spite of its restructuring
problems, the city still was a leader.
'We had forgotten what Hamburg offered. Everyone assumed the high tech
locations were in the south. But medical technology was here - and
pharmaceuticals.
'It is the media metropolis, all the big publishers were here. And it was
already a headquarters for civil aviation.
'We had to create an investment consciousness: that it was good and right to
be in Hamburg. There was no point in trying to get the sort of industries in
Munich - we are not going to get a major motor manufacturer.'
Then the HWF concentrated on markets for potential investors: particularly
Scandinavia, Britain (with very strong historical ties to Hamburg), the east
coast of the US, and the Far East.
The real success story has been with investors from the Far East: they
identified Hamburg as the ideal base for a foothold in the future single EC
market.
In 1987, the Evergreen container shipping company from Taiwan decided to
make its European headquarters there. Today there are 63 different Taiwan
operations in the city.
Part of Hamburg's attraction has been its life style. Being a big media
centre helps: there is a thriving cultural scene, and a lively intellectual
community.
Hamburg is trying to attract head offices, rather than big manufacturing
operations, for which it does not really have the space - 'the living
conditions are good, so they have no difficulty getting their managers to
come here willingly,' says Dr Martens-Jeebe.
At the same time, Hamburg is now co-operating with the neighbouring federal
state of Schleswig-Holstein, not competing: the city tries to attract the
headquarters, while the factory site can be located in Schleswig-Holstein.
All that was happening before 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down.
Unification simply meant that the revival of Hamburg suddenly accelerated:
imports soared, construction companies won new contracts in the east, the
city's food processing industries, breweries and the like found a huge new
market on their doorstep.
In 1935, about one third of Hamburg's income came from its economic ties
with what became East Germany. Now that is likely to be realised again.
It is not only eastern Germany. For all its economic plight, the liberation
of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has opened up the Baltic Sea as a
whole economic area. And the applications of Sweden and Finland to join the
EC, as well as the presence of all Scandinavia in the European Economic
Area, means that Hamburg is no longer on the periphery.
Of course, there are problems. Rents for housing have increased about 40 per
cent in five years. There is an urgent need for a fourth crossing of the
river Elbe to relieve traffic congestion. And the relatively high structural
unemployment remains.
One problem is that with all the high technology industries, Hamburg has not
been attracting jobs for its unqualified workers - 'we are a high wage, high
technology city,' comments Dr Noe.
'Unqualified workers are not needed in a high technology service centre.
That is a big problem,' he adds. The only other thing Dr Noe is worried
about is that Hamburg will be described as a 'boom town.'
'We don't like that expression,' he says. 'It means the last phase of the
economic cycle - and it means over-heating. There is no talk of that here
yet.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (17): Optimists repeatedly disappointed -
The East German Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY quarterly period since last year brought optimistic government
forecasts that the east German economy was about to touch bottom and would
slowly begin to emerge from the trough.
But the calculated optimism did not alter the realities.
In spite of DM150bn in transfer payments from west to east Germany this
year, the east German economy continues to scrape along the bottom of the
charts. The old state monopolies are being dismantled more quickly than new
private enterprises can be erected.
Even lower unemployment figures of 1.1m last month (13.6 per cent) - 75,000
less than at the beginning of the year - were no cause for optimism. Real
unemployment is well over 30 per cent.
More than 300,000 short-time workers produce little which can be sold in
return for their German government-subsidised wage. Another 400,000 east
Germans are kept off the unemployment rolls by publicly-financed
job-creation programmes, which are to be abolished. Nearly 800,000 citizens
receive pensions five years in advance of normal retirement age. Still
another 500,000 east Germans have moved to west Germany to find work while
500,000 commute to jobs in the west.
It is the west German tax
payer, especially lower and medium-income groups, who bears the brunt of
these social welfare payments which maintain consumption in east Germany.
Small wonder that politicians speak of the urgent need to spread the growing
burden of support for east Germany to all west Germans. This, however, will
call for sacrifices which the Bonn government, faced with elections in 1994,
has been loath to demand.
The figures at the end of two years of unification are fairly grim. Gross
domestic product in east Germany of nearly DM100bn in 1990 plummeted to
DM50bn. Employment, which in the first half of 1991 still stood at 9.3m,
fell to only 6m in the second half of this year.
As a result of the sharp rise in east German wages, from DM1,407 per worker
to
DM2,725, competitiveness actually fell to 35 per cent of the west German
level.
The Bundesbank put it optimistically when it said that despite improvements
in some areas there was no evidence of a 'self-sustaining recovery.'
The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin observed that
even growth in construction activity in east Germany, which was expected to
be dramatic, turned out to be 'disappointing.'
In spite of a 200 per cent rise in demand for publicly-financed construction
projects since the start of the year, actual investment in construction rose
only 45 per cent. The gap was caused by the difficulties which inexperienced
east German officials had in coping with highly-complex west German building
regulations.
Private building activity has performed even worse, as a stroll through any
of east Germany's major cities confirms. Construction is still hampered by
the official ruling that the return of property to former owners takes
precedence over indemnifying them. Contested property cases clog the courts
in east Germany and are the main reason that the building boom has been
stifled.
East Germans place much of the blame for the massive deindustrialision of
their region at the doorstep of the Treuhand agency, which is responsible
for privatising former state companies.
Yet the Treuhand's achievements are impressive. Nearly 9,500 companies out
of the agency's original 12,000 were sold, albeit frequently for a nominal
price after the Treuhand assumed debts and environmental liabilities.
Privatisation led to pledges of DM151.3bn in investments and guarantees for
retaining 1.3m jobs.
Rescuing former state Kombinate (conglomerates) which were written off as
basket cases only a half a year ago is now official Treuhand policy. It has
no choice. Allowing them
to go under would eliminate more than 500 producers and 550,000 jobs,
including virtually the entire chemical and machine-building industries.
Only a few months ago, Mrs Birgit Breuel, the Treuhand's president, scoffed
at the idea that these companies might end up as wards of the state. But now
senior members of the German government openly speak of the need to protect
and support east German industries in much the same way as in the 1950s
Volkswagen and Salzgitter remained state companies in west Germany until
they were strong enough to stand on their own.
The Treuhand's debts, already expected to rise to DM250bn by the end of
1994, are almost certain to be a good deal higher, according to insiders at
the agency. The outlook for the white elephants of east German industry
appears gloomier than ever. Orders have dwindled to virtually nil at former
Kombinate such as the sprawling Sket engineering plant in Magdeburg and the
Takraf crane factory in Leipzig, which exported the bulk of
production to the former Soviet Union. Russia and the other CIS successor
republics are unable to provide the counter-guarantees which would release
DM5bn in Hermes export credit guarantees by the German government.
Invariably, where the Treuhand has succeeded in privatising huge former
state companies such as shipyards and steelmills, it has been an expensive
procedure for the German taxpayer. In this month's sale of the Warnow
shipyard, the heart of the east German shipbuilding industry, to Kvaerner of
Norway for the largely symbolic price of DM1m, the Treuhand pledged to
provide DM436m in investments to modernise the yard along with DM73m from
the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In addition, the Treuhand agreed to
compensate Kvaerner for up to DM500m in possible losses over the coming four
years. Industry sources said the Treuhand also will pay more than DM250m in
Warnow debts as well as assuming liabilities for old contracts amounting to
nearly DM600m. In return, Kvaerner agreed to invest DM96m and to retain
2,150 jobs in the shipyard. One knowledgeable German observer estimated that
saving each one of the 8,000 jobs in east German shipbuilding up to 1995
will cost the taxpayer DM820,000.
The Treuhand has agreed to pay DM300m and the state of Brandenburg DM50m in
assistance to Krupp so that it would take over and modernise the Eko
steelworks at the Polish border. But Krupp, facing mounting losses of its
own in steel production, showed signs of losing interest in the deal, which
in any event would need approval by the EC.
Agriculture in east Germany has fared no better than industry. The former
collective farms are strangled with debt and the German government shows
little willingness to relieve them of the burden.
Small-scale German farmers in the west, a potent lobby, do not want
competition from large, potentially efficient co-operative farms in the
east.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (18): Hopes remain long-term - Leslie
Colitt examines prospects for trade with eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Germany's historically-close trading links with Russia and Ukraine
have suffered, German companies are preparing for the time when the
republics of the former Soviet Union will again be able to buy their goods
and know-how on a large scale.
The composition of Germany's flourishing trade with the Russian Empire
before the First World War was remarkably similar to that of recent years:
Russian oil, lumber and other raw materials in exchange for German
machinery.
After 1945, Soviet-occupied East Germany was forced to pay nearly Marks
100bn in reparations to Moscow and to re-orient its entire production to
satisfy Soviet industrial demands. West Germany became a leading supplier of
higher technology products and Moscow's largest Western trading partner.
The extent of East Germany's dependence on the Soviet market is shown by the
trade statistics in 1990. East Germany exported goods worth DM17.8bn to the
Soviet Union - 47 per cent of total East German exports - and imported
DM9.1bn - 40 per cent of imports. Nearly 500,000 East Germans depended
directly or indirectly on sales to the Soviet Union which bought 30 per cent
of East German machinery and vehicles and 17 per cent of electrical
engineering products.
The Soviet Union also relied on East Germany for items such as large factory
fishing vessels, harbour cranes, body presses for car factories, cable
machinery as well as long-distance railway passenger cars.
East German imports from Moscow consisted of oil and gas which, along with
coal, iron and other metals, supplied more than 80 per cent of consumption.
West Germany's trade with Moscow was, by comparison, insignificant to the
German economy as a whole but of considerable importance to Moscow for key
items such as chemical plants and large-diameter seamless pipe for natural
gas pipelines.
In 1990, West Germany exported DM10.4bn to the Soviet Union - 2 per cent of
total West German exports - and imported DM9.1bn - 2 per cent of total
imports.
United Germany's trade with the Soviet Union last year was hit full square
by the inability of Moscow to pay Deutsche Marks for east German goods.
German exports plummeted by 35 per cent to DM18.2bn and imports fell 20 per
cent to DM14.6bn. The collapse continued this year, with trade in the first
six months falling by nearly 30 per cent.
Desperate calls came from BDI, Federation of German Industry, and DIHT,
German Chamber of Industry and Trade, for the German government to provide
barter trade guarantees to help revive German trade with the CIS successor
states.
Germany's Hermes export credit guarantees of only DM5bn for trade with CIS
this year were taken up largely by east German companies but Russia and the
other republics were unable to provide workable counter-guarantees. Trade
virtually ground to a halt.
Mr Otto Wolff von Amerongen, head of German industry's Eastern Board of
Trade, even advocated using roubles to finance trade with the CIS. The
roubles earned by German companies would be subsequently used for
investments in Russia and the other republics as well as purchases of
commercial properties he suggested.
Mr Arkadi Volski, the influential head of the Russian Industrialists
Federation, proposed using barter and clearing arrangements to overcome
payments problems during a visit to Berlin.
He said the former Soviet Union had 56,000 items of machinery and equipment
from former East Germany which had broken down or were about to do so
because of a lack of spare parts.
One dramatic example was the large industrial presses from Erfurt in every
Russian car and truck factory which were in dire need of repair.
Most of the giant former East German Kombinate which sold between 40 and 60
per cent of their products to the Soviet Union have lost virtually the
entire business. Only for a few is there a shimmer of hope that the CIS
market will revive in time to make a difference to their parlous balance
sheets.
Carl Zeiss of Jena, once east Germany's most prestigious optical and
precision engineering producer and a leading supplier of the Soviet defence
and space industries, said the Russian Government had ordered DM180m worth
of Zeiss products and placed them on a priority list. Queries had gone out
for an additional DM100m in Zeiss products.
But the Russian government was still unable to guarantee any of the payments
so that this year Zeiss expected to sell only DM750,000 in products to
Russia.
As a result, Zeiss' total turnover would be DM150m instead of the DM200m
expected earlier.
Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA), Germany's largest producer of rolling stock with
five factories in east Germany, has DM2.2bn in orders from Russia and other
CIS republics for its long-distance passenger carriages and freight cars.
This represents 70 per cent of DWA's output and is covered by Hermes export
credit guarantees and payment guarantees by the Russian Government. More
than half of the exports this year were paid for by mid-year but it was
highly uncertain whether the bills would continue to be paid.
Daimler-Benz and other large west German companies whose sales to the
ex-Soviet Union were never of vital importance, are taking a long-range view
of trade prospects with CIS.
During a recent swing through the central Asian republics of CIS by DB's
chairman, Mr Werner Niefer - one of the few to the area by a prominent
Western industrialist - DB signed a letter of intent with Uzbekistan that it
would explore possibilities to jointly produce 'several hundred thousand'
four-wheel-drive vehicles annually in the central Asian republic.
Turkmenistan expressed interest in assembling three-axle Mercedes trucks and
Mr Niefer signed an agreement with Kazakhstan for the delivery of several
thousand cars and trucks.
DB discovered to its relief that payments problems were 'unexpectedly small'
as the central Asian republics had oil, gold and other natural resources to
sell.
Possibilities for co-operation in aerospace were also sounded out by DB as
Kazakhstan has a factory producing passenger aircraft but is lacking modern
engines.
Mr Niefer rounded out his tour of the former Soviet Union in Russia where DB
plans to deliver the production line for the model 0303 bus which has been
phased out in Germany and is to be produced at a newly-built factory near
Moscow.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (16): Tougher sentences urged on neo-Nazis
 -In east Germany, violent attacks against asylum-seekers have shifted to
smaller towns, largely in the north where economic conditions are worse.
Now there are pressures on the Bonn government to ban the east German
neo-Nazi party, Deutsche Alternative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANK HUBNER, leader of the east German neo-Nazi Deutsche Alternative (DA),
carefully inspects my business card and passport as he sits in the front
seat of my car.
In the rear-view mirror I can see two of Hubner's large colleagues lingering
in the background. The 27-year-old leader's black hair is fashionably
cropped and he wears an expensive-looking black leather jacket, shirt and
trousers.
'You will be billed DM450 for a one-hour interview,' he says, speaking
softly. He certainly belies the popular image of a rabble-rousing fascist.
'It's for my loss of earnings during the time,' he explains politely.
I reply that we do not pay for interviews. Did he only give them for money?
'It's a matter of principle,' he says without blinking.
Hubner strolls back to the cramped flat he shares with a wife and baby in,
ironically, Bertolt Brecht Strasse, named after the anti-Nazi German
playwright. It is located in Sachsendorf, a sprawling housing district of
Cottbus where militant right-wing youths on four consecutive nights last
month hurled Molotov cocktails and stones at an adjoining hostel for asylum
seekers.
Sachsendorf's endless rows of bleak pre-fab apartment blocks are home to
nearly 30,000 east Germans. Several thousand of them watched approvingly
when the hostel was under siege.
Hubner's Nazi views are available to anyone who reads the Brandenburger
Beobachter, the DA newspaper which bristles with crude racist propaganda and
anti-semitic cartoons.
Security officials in Brandenburg state are convinced that he exerts a
decisive influence on about 150 young DA supporters in the Cottbus area
which borders on Poland. But in his public statements, Hubner appears
reasonable, divorcing himself from the wave of violence against asylum
seekers.
He is fully aware of the growing pressures on the Bonn government to ban the
DA as a neo-Nazi party. This he wants to avoid at all cost, as the party
would then be unable to contest future local east German elections.
The unbroken attacks against asylum seekers have shifted to smaller towns,
largely in the north where economic conditions are worse. But Ms Simone
Wendler, a politically-active resident of Sachsendorf said all the elements
still exist for a revival of violence there.
This is so despite the fact that unemployment in Cottbus is lower than
elsewhere and most young people have apprenticeships. The causes of the
violence were not primarily economic she suggested.
'The GDR's past is the key to understanding the present,' Ms Wendler says.
She recalls the trial in Cottbus last year of a neo-Nazi accused of torching
a youth hostel. He told the court that in history class they were taught
that only the Communists were good and that other Germans were bad. This was
a lie, the young man protested.
Many east Germans react similarly to the black-and-white view of the world
which was pounded into them for more than 40 years, Hubner himself was
imprisoned in 1986 as a militant skinhead and bought free by the west German
government. He subsequently linked up with Michael Kuhnen, the late West
German neo-Nazi leader.
A further explanation for the eruption of nationalism among east Germans was
the previous suppression of their German identity by the Communists, Ms
Wendler says.
The final reason is socio-economic. The GDR was an egalitarian society and
many east Germans who had enjoyed a middle class life style were plunged
into an economic and social underclass after 1989. The resulting insecurity
and fear was widespread.
Ms Windler insists that it is wrong to punish the 15-year-olds who threw
stones at the hostels while failing to prosecute the neo-Nazi ideologists
who stirred them up.
'But no-one in the German government appears willing to stand up and condemn
the neo-Nazis on moral grounds,' she complains.
Even the Christian Democratic Mayor of Cottbus, Waldemar Kleinschmidt, while
condemning the attacks on asylum seekers, previously tried to woo over the
rightwing extremists to democracy.
At the entrance to the hostel for asylum seekers - which formerly housed the
families of Soviet army officers - one of the occupants had poignantly
scrawled the misspelled words: Azilant Gut ('Asylum-seekers good').
Most of the 900 or more residents at the hostel are from Romania and
Bulgaria of whom 60 per cent are gypsies.
After wading across the nearby Neisse river from Poland, a single word -
asyl (asylum) - spoken to a German official, sufficed to get them into the
hostel where they were given clothing, living quarters and money. A large
family can receive up to DM450 a month which enrages many east Germans who
say they get no more in welfare payments.
Nearly 30 battered cars purchased by occupants of the hostel stood outside
the gates along with several trucks being loaded with goods for Romania.
Across the broad Lipezker Strasse, which last month separated the hostel
from hundreds of rightwing assailants, are rows of German flats with flower
boxes and neat curtains.
Michael Michelfeit and his wife Ulrike were visiting his mother in one of
the flats. In the past, he said the asylum-seekers had rummaged through the
garbage bins of the Germans in search of useable items. During the dry
summer their children set fires between the rows of garages and frequently
snatched the purses of elderly women.
'Sometimes you catch yourself agreeing with some of the rightwing slogans
against the asylum seekers,' Ulrike admits.
She said the authorities would have to clamp down more forcefully on the
extremists who were exploiting the dissatisfaction among young people. In
fact, the Brandenburg authorities have taken a tougher line toward the
neo-Nazis than officials in adjoining Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Gunter Noack, who was loading tools into his car, said he and most other
people in Sachsendorf disapproved of the attacks on the hostel.
'They were destroying material assets,' he said, pausing briefly, '. . . and
endangering lives. The asylum-seekers are people, too. But the government
must stop them from pouring in and hand down tough sentences on the
neo-Nazis,' he says, reflecting a widely-held view in east Germany.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (15): Tensions rise as the economy weakens
 -The immigration issue / National self-confidence is wavering amid economic
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE is a popular belief in Germany, fostered by social affairs experts,
that the rise of the extreme right does not offer any danger to democracy.
Backed up by continuous assurances, notably from Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
that Germany is 'foreigner-friendly,' it rings increasingly hollow as the
tally of killings, fire-bombings, and less overt signs of xenophobia
increases. The number of attacks by right-wing extremists rose more than
five-fold in 1991, and is continuing to go up this year.
Although the level of violence has eased since the August riots in Rostock
on the Baltic coast in the former GDR, the wave of antipathy rolls on.
Swelled by regular media reports which splash headlines on the number of
crimes committed by 'foreigners,' and politicians making capital out of the
alleged costs of housing, feeding and processing refugees, it has developed
a momentum which government has been unable to dissipate.
Most recent public attention has been focused on physical attacks on
Roumanians and other registered asylum-seekers in eastern Germany, but the
malaise has spread deeper and further.
The defacement of Jewish monuments and memorials is once again commonplace.
The so-called Jewish barracks in the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp
was burned down in late September.
Earlier this month, right-wing extremists attacked a Greek school in
Wuppertal. Expatriate staff of foreign companies have been tutored on how to
dress and behave to avoid abuse or worse.
Meanwhile, thousands of hapless asylum-seekers continue to press into
Germany through gateways opened up by the country's liberal asylum laws.
Under the traditional interpretation of the so-called basic law, or
constitution, anyone arriving in Germany asking for political asylum must be
admitted and his or her case investigated.
This has long been interpreted as a carte blanche for economic refugees from
all over the world to make a bid for a better life in Germany. The long-term
steady flow has turned to a flood following unification, the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the opening of Germany's eastern borders with Poland and
Czechoslovakia, and war in the former Yugoslavia.
Recent monthly registrations of asylum-seekers have exceeded one a minute.
By August the total for the year so far already matched the 256,000 who
arrived in 1991. Forecasts of 400,000 at most during 1992 were revised
upwards towards 500,000.
On today's acceptance rates, fewer than 5 per cent of the total will be
allowed to remain as genuine asylum cases. But all will be processed through
the lengthy and meticulous procedures set out by the interior ministry and
the constitutional court.
All will be distributed around the country - each Land or region allocated
assorted groups according to a strict quota system - and all will be housed,
fed and clothed at an estimated monthly cost of DM1,400 each.
Debt-laden local authorities, struggling with a national housing shortage,
and police and social services increasingly claim they can no longer cope.
Beyond the street battles, the signal failure of policy-makers and
administrators to deal with the problem has led to widespread popular
cynicism and loss of support for leaders of all the mainstream parties.
Indications of possible future trends have included the winning of seats in
the Schleswig-Holstein parliament by the racist German People's Union, and
the installation of a powerful voting bloc in the Baden-Wurttemberg
legislature for the far-right Republican party, led by Mr Franz Schonhuber,
a former Waffen-SS officer.
While vox pop soundings suggest that the vast majority of Germans despise
and are shamed by the regular outbursts of violence, other, more detailed
investigations show up considerable antipathy to foreigners. A recent study
by the Cologne Institute of Empirical Psychology, which involved more than
2,000 people between the ages of 16 and 24, showed that a third admitted to
being antagonistic towards non-Germans or at least harbouring xenophobic
thoughts.
A finding that is possibly even more significant is that only 25 per cent of
the sample believed there should be no discrimination of any kind against
foreigners.
A broader sampling in early September by the respected Infas institute
reported 25 per cent supporting repatriation of foreigners, and a good 50
per cent agreeing that 'Germany belongs to the Germans.'
The sheer volume of foreign faces, often concentrated in run-down,
heavily-populated areas, and the proliferation of habits alien to the
disciplined Germans, is producing unmanageable tensions at a time when the
economy is weakening rapidly.
National self-confidence is wavering under the influences of economic
uncertainty, the realisation that the dream of unification is a potential
nightmare, and the impact of international condemnation of the violence on
Germans' self-esteem.
The reactions of national political leaders, far from countering the
uncertainty, have in fact reflected it in magnified form. Wide cross-party
consensus is essential for any change to the basic law, but until recently
government and opposition policies have been in turmoil.
The three-party ruling coalition earlier this month healed its three-way
split and agreed a compromise reform plan.
Returning to Bonn after the summer, the SPD leadership raised hopes of
progress when it apparently gave up its long-standing ideological resistance
to any reduction of refugees' rights.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, party chief, declared himself ready to negotiate with
government on constitutional amendments. But within weeks the regional
membership was pressing party leaders to change tack once again, and
promising chancellor-candidate Mr Engholm an uncomfortable time at the next
party assembly in November. But his discomfort will be minor compared with
the tribulations of the beleaguered refugees.
As long as international and domestic economic conditions deteriorate and
the flow of newcomers continues without clear initiatives from Bonn, so the
potential among native Germans for resentment and violence seems likely to
grow.
The so-called 'asylum problem' has developed into Germany's most pressing
domestic political and social challenge. It has fostered the re-emergence of
the far right as a potent political power throughout the country and damaged
the east's hopes of winning vital foreign investment.
It has also put the German people at odds with themselves - and the watching
world.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (13): Carmakers under pressure - Vehicle
companies are either shedding staff, cutting back production, putting
workers on short time, or doing all three
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S motor industry, a vital part of its export-oriented economy, is
slowing down in more ways than one. Not only do more vehicles on the roads
mean more congestion and more tailbacks, thus decreasing drivers' ability to
hurtle along as fast as they please, but world markets are coming under such
severe pressures that German carmakers are having to take drastic action to
remain competitive.
German car companies are either shedding staff, cutting back production,
putting workers on short time, or doing all three. Mercedes-Benz, part of
the Daimler-Benz concern, is reducing its domestic workforce by 10,500
people this year and is producing fewer cars.
At the volume end of the industry, Ford-Werke (owned by Ford Motor of the
US) is cutting production at its Cologne plant as part of a Europe-wide
retrenchment by the group.
Volkswagen, Opel (part of General Motors of the US), and BMW are also
reducing labour and trying to overcome the high-cost burdens suffered by
German producers.
Struggling the hardest, however, is Porsche, the maker of luxury sports cars
which is finding the combination of weak foreign markets and the extra
pressures imposed by the latest currency turbulence almost impossible to
bear. It is cutting its workforce by nearly 2,000 people this year, having
sold only 22,000 of its expensive models in the financial year to July.
None of these developments come entirely as a surprise. It has long been
recognised that German producers' costs are too high in relation to
competitors in the rest of Europe and Japan. Labour costs in Germany are
among the highest in the world. They are around a third higher than in
Japan, the gap being accounted for by the high level of social security and
welfare costs met by employers rather than by wages, which are similar in
the two countries.
Compared with France, Italy, and the UK, the difference is even greater;
wages are lower in these countries and social benefits worth much less.
In past years, German companies could rely on superior productivity to
offset the impact of high labour and other costs. But this has now become
almost impossible as competitors have cut their labour forces, in contrast
to the employment increases now being reversed in Germany, and have striven
to become more productive by investing heavily and introducing new
production methods.
Moreover, the supremely efficient Japanese are now making cars at plants in
Europe, notably in the UK.
Productivity in France and Britain rose much faster in the 1980s than that
in the German motor industry.
At the start of the 1990s, Germany still topped the European productivity
table. France's productivity was 91 per cent of that in Germany, with Italy
at 74 per cent, and the UK (before the full effect of Japanese investment)
at only 61 per cent.
But the German industry was about 50 per cent behind Japan's productivity.
German trade unions recognise the severity of the situation, but there is no
way that they can prevent more job losses.
Moreover, the trend towards shorter working weeks impinges further on German
companies' profitabilty.
According to the German motor industry association (VDA), a Japanese
automobile worker puts in an average 800 hours a year more than his German
rival, while a US worker puts in 550 hours more; and one in the UK works 350
hours more.
The Spanish employee notches up 250 hours more than in Germany, the Italian
150 more, and the French 100 more.
Against the gloomy background of rising costs, stagnating sales at home and
abroad, and gyrating currencies, it is small wonder that the German media
has been carrying dire prognistications of things to come.
'The auto goes downhill' was the headline on a commentary in Suddeutsche
Zeitung, the serious daily newspaper. It chided German motor companies for
being too late with the introduction of lean production methods and for
concentrating too much in boom times on expensively-equipped models 'as if
customers were prepared indefinitely to spend more and more money on cars.'
Clearly, they are not. Recession in foreign markets, intense competition
from the Japanese, and the slackening of domestic demand after the powerful
impetus provided by unification have subjected German car manufacturers to
extreme pressures. Hence the pessimistic title of an article in Stern, the
popular weekly magazine: 'The decline of Germany's showcase sector.'
After several years of steadily rising sales, topped off with the turnover
gains produced by German unity, the car companies and their workers are
bracing themselves for an unfamiliar phase of austerity.
Since the motor industry in its widest sense - including suppliers, dealers,
repair, and other activities - accounts for about a fifth of gross national
product, the consequences will be felt throughout the economy.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (14): A late 20th century bonanza - For
the construction industry, the task of rebuilding east Germany is immense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE a scene from a Grimms' fairy tale, a quaint little grey house with a
first floor bay window stands near the centre of Zwickau in east Germany. It
could do with some renovation, but is serviceable enough to house a dentist,
a cosmetics store, and the local tenants' association.
There is no building next door, only the ghost of the house that used to be
there. Its outline, including the steeply sloped roof, is clearly visible on
the wall that once separated the two houses. Opposite are ugly blocks of
flats. Nearby, stands what was once an elegant pre-war office building, its
rusting window frames empty of glass and its plaster peeling.
Zwickau itself, in the state of Saxony, is a handsome town, now being
spruced up as the prosperity - emanating from the new Volkswagen plant
nearby - begins to have an effect. But the mixture of the charmingly
historic, the irredeemably ugly, and the totally rundown is common in east
Germany. Some old buildings survived, many as virtual ruins, through sheer
neglect and lack of resources, while others were torn down to make way for
utilitarian housing, roads, or public buildings.
For the construction industry, the task of rebuilding east Germany amounts
to a late 20th century bonanza. According to a recent study by Ifo, the
respected Munich-based economic research institute, it will cost some
DM2,400bn (Dollars 1,600bn) by the year 2005 to bring living conditions in
east Germany up to west German standards.
All this amounts to DM158bn a year, starting from 1991, and represents
DM9,800 per east German inhabitant per year.
By far the biggest slice of the total sum will be required for housing, both
to improve existing homes and build new ones. Ifo reckons this will account
for DM975bn (the figures are all based on 1990 prices); every year, around
390,000 homes will have to be modernised and more than 140,000 new ones
built.
Making up most of the remaining construction needs in the east will be
industry (DM528bn, including energy), transport (DM403bn), and environmental
protection (DM174bn). The sums are enormous, and the work is already in full
swing. In the pretty town of Schneeberg, a short drive from Zwickau along
the old silver route in the Erzgebirge (ore mountains), restoration work has
been completed on the attractive white and beige town hall with its
crenellated tower. But a whole street near the main square has been ripped
open for new pipes to be installed and the massive church which dominates
the town is filled with scaffolding inside and has long cracks in its
outside tower walls.
The rash of building sites in towns, along roads, and in industrial areas -
many old factories are being torn down to be replaced by new commercial or
production sites - holds out hope for the future on one hand and leads to
chaos on the other. They are the visible aspect of the immense economic
overhaul which east Germany is now undergoing.
Last year, new building investment there totalled DM36.4bn, equivalent to 12
per cent of the investment in western Germany.
The public sector is leading the way, followed by industry. In the housing
sector, progress is much more restrained. As Commerzbank notes in a study of
the sector, repair and modernisation work is moving ahead with the help of
state financial support, while little new housing is being built. This
reflects low incomes in the east and fear of unemployment, as well as high
interest rates and building price rises.
Investment in new apartment blocks is also unattractive since rents, now
rising from the old heavily subsidised levels, are still too low to cover
costs. Uncertainties over ownership and the debts of east German housing
concerns are further dampeners.
Commerzbank expects housing investment to become more lively next year. But
far more dynamic will be the industrial sector, supported by state financial
help for new investment in east Germany. Much of the growth will continue to
be in the retail and service sectors - the big Quelle mail order concern,
for instance, is building a DM1bn distribution centre near Leipzig - with
the new owners of companies privatised by the Treuhand also investing.
Altogether, Commerzbank expects building investment in east Germany to grow
by up to 20 per cent in real terms this year, with the sector having taken
on the role of an economic locomotive. Private sector building investment
will continue to be buoyant in 1993, but the public sector will continue to
set the pace under pressure from the huge modernisation demands in
transport, communications, energy, and the environment.
In west Germany, too, the building industry is an important prop for the
economy, though the heady expansion rate is slackening. Because of the still
unfulfilled demand for new housing and business construction, the bank
estimates real growth of 4 per cent in west German building investment in
1992, followed by a marked easing to 1.5 per cent in 1993. With the
tremendous inflow of people since 1987, mainly from east Germany and eastern
Europe, about 1.8m new homes are needed. People want bigger and better homes
as their incomes rise.
With the west German economy now slowing down, it is clear that the
construction industry will be unable to keep on grabbing new business as
merrily as before. But there is still enough economic strength to keep
builders happy for some time yet. As for east Germany, the order surge is
only just beginning there.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (11): Imbalance between young and old -
Population trends / Births down 40 per cent in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMICALLY speaking, a child is a costly luxury. No longer do people need
to breed to ensure that they are looked after in old age or to engender a
home-grown workforce for the fields. Emotional factors alone ensure that
people continue to have children.
This is a phenomenon of all urbanised, modern industrial societies, but the
consequences are felt particularly acutely in Germany, the third least
fertile country in the European Community after Italy and Spain: Germany's
population is growing old, and it would be shrinking but for an influx of
foreigners.
Expressed in pictorial form, a population ought to look like a pyramid: a
broad base of younger people supporting a dwindling number of older ones.
Germany's population now looks more like a Christmas tree, the pyramid
thinned out by the effects of two world wars, but 40 years from now, the
picture will look less balanced: an inverse pyramid where relatively few
young people support layers of older people.
'For the present generation simply to replace itself, 40 per cent of all
married couples need to have three or more children,' says Professor
Charlotte Hohn, director of the Wiesbaden-based Federal Institute for
Population Research.
'But in a society such as ours, most people want to have one child - or two,
at the most.'
Germany's reunification has highlighted the growing numerical imbalance
between young and old: in 1991, the number of births in reunited Germany
fell back by 8.5 per cent, from 906,000 in 1990 to 828,000, a drop caused by
a huge, 40 per cent reduction of births in the former east Germany.
A combination of social unease, migration to the western part of Germany,
plus growing job opportunities, has meant that young women in the ex-DDR
have been reluctant to have children, and hospitals in the east report a
surge in demand for abortions and sterilisations.
The resulting demographic problem is often cited as one of the more serious
difficulties facing Germany in the years to come: Germans have the highest
wages, take the longest holidays, work the shortest hours of their peers in
other industrial countries - and to cap it all there are set to be fewer
people at work to support a disproportionately large elderly population.
The government has taken a number of steps to mitigate the problem, for
example raising the retirement age and adjusting old-age healthcare
insurance regulations.
But this is not enough: in order to shore up the imbalanced population
pyramid, Germany will have to rely more heavily on imported labour.
That the working population of the former west Germany climbed from 28.6m to
29.4m between January and October last year reflects migration from the
former DDR as well as the influx of ethnic Germans (Aussiedler),
predominantly from the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, who are
entitled to German citizenship.
But more jobs were lost in east Germany than were created in the west and if
the workforce is to grow across the whole of Germany, the number of
foreigners living in Germany will have to expand, as it did in the last
decade when a net 2.2m people migrated into Germany.
Over the longer term the number of foreigners in Germany will grow anyway:
the 5.4m-strong foreign community in Germany now is expected to grow to 8.9m
over the next 40 years, without immigration.
Although not German citizens, these foreigners - predominantly Turks - have
come to look on Germany as home and, having paid their taxes, are entitled
to the same care in old age as other Germans.
Senior industrialists already recognise the imperative of attracting more
skilled immigrants into Germany: some 230,000 apprenticeships are unfilled
and in united Germany there are over 400,000 job vacancies for skilled
manual workers.
Employers and employee associations bend over backwards to say they would
welcome qualified applicants for these jobs, whatever their nationality, and
Mr Rudolf Stumpf, personnel director of BMW, has said that the car company
may as well shut if it were not for its foreign workers.
At a time when the number of ethnic Germans will be shrinking, this growth
may exacerbate social tensions which are already to be felt in the early
1990s in the attacks against asylum homes in the east of Germany.
It is an irony that asylum seekers are not allowed to work even though there
would be jobs for them: they are obliged to sit around doing nothing for
months at the state's expenses while they wait for a decision on their
asylum application, serving to stoke up resentments within the communities
in the midst of whom they are billeted.
As Mr Heiner Geissler, deputy chairman of the ruling CDU-CSU coalition
pointed out this summer in the wake of the attacks, more tolerance is
required and Germans will have to get used to living and working in an
increasingly multi-racial society.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (12): Rebuilding from the ruins - The east
German labour market / Planners take a more creative approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY in 1991, at the end of the unification party, west German workers had
their first taste of what was to come. The western economy was motoring
along, unemployment was falling and new jobs were being created by the
thousand. Contributions to unemployment insurance, fixed at 4.3 per cent of
gross pay, were in line for a fall to around 3.5 per cent. But the truth
about the communists' 'full-employment' society could not be concealed for
long.
Contributions instead rose to 6.8 per cent to cover the enormous costs of
managing the east's labour market, and although they have since fallen to
6.3 per cent, no further cuts can be expected.
The Federal Labour Office, deprived of subsidies from federal funds by the
finance ministry's budget-capping decree, still confronts an intractable
situation in the former GDR while conditions are deteriorating rapidly in
the west.
Unemployment there has risen by 10 per cent this year, and the creation of
new jobs has stopped. In the east, meanwhile, at least two out of every five
jobs has been lost under the twin influences of the collapsed market in
eastern Europe and the radical restructuring of the old east German combines
by the Treuhand privatisation agency.
Official unemployment of around 13 per cent masks a mass of 'hidden' jobless
who have been retired early, diverted into training projects, on short-time,
or working in so-called work-creation schemes.
Last year, when the labour office was concerned mainly with holding the
fort, it poured almost 70 per cent of the funds it spent in the east into
passive measures: the dole, pay for short-time workers who, in the main, did
nothing except clock-on every day, and pre-pension compensation for people
taking early retirement. This year, however, it is adopting a more creative
approach.
This year, almost exactly half the labour office's DM85bn budget will be
spent in the east, home to 20 per cent of the total population. While
unemployment pay will absorb almost a quarter of funds available, the share
allocated to all such purely defensive measures will fall below 50 per cent,
with resultant gains for 'active' projects such as education and training
and work creation schemes.
Although such projects seldom involve conventionally productive work, and
focus mainly on tasks such as cleaning up the environmental mess left by the
communists, they keep people within the active labour market.
According to Mr Heinrich Franke, head of the labour office, the will to
learn and work is 'extraordinarily' strong, rather more than in the west,
although all too often freshly-trained workers find no job at the end of
their courses.
Spending on work creation has more than doubled this year to DM7.3bn, while
a similar proportional increase has diverted DM10bn into further education
and vocational training. Overall, active measures account for 43 per cent of
spending, compared with 27 per cent last year.
This is still not enough, according to Mr Hans-Peter Klos, an expert from
the IW economics research institute in Cologne. Even though it is above the
OECD average of 38 per cent, he says, the 'rich uncle' approach, in which
the west simply pours in funds for mainly defensive policies, will
pre-programme inactivity into the eastern German way of life, and ossify the
hard-core of unemployment.
Urging programmes to increase worker mobility and unconventional measures
such as lump-sum one-off payments instead of weekly unemployment pay to give
the jobless a chance of setting up an independent business, Mr Klos may be
asking too much of a labour market which is already infected with some of
the rigidities established in the west, and too much of a government
committed to medium-term budgetary restraint.
Western unions, which have been steadily losing membership in their home
territory, were quick to recruit in the east, where they won considerable
benefits for their new members.
Basic wage deals, guaranteeing pay parity with the west by 1994, have been
struck in many important industries. As a result, even though average
productivity in the east is around 30 per cent of west German levels, labour
costs are already higher than in the US.
Meanwhile, blanket pay and conditions packages, mirroring those in the west,
make virtually no allowances for regional or skill differences. Some 25
years ago there was a 25 per cent differential between the basic pay of
engineering workers employed in various parts of west Germany. It is now 2
per cent. An unskilled worker who earned 73 per cent of the skilled rate,
now earns 86 per cent.
According to recent estimates, 2m new and permanent jobs have to be created
in the east in the medium-term as a pre-condition for the establishment of a
viable, self-supporting economy.
There are few immediate attractions for an international business community
which is reining in investment even in established markets. Nor is there any
of increased contributions from the not-so-rich uncle in Bonn, which is
already chafing at the proliferation of work creation schemes. Each place
costs around DM24,000 per man per year, compared with DM15,000 for
unemployment benefit.
But Mr Franke, who has lived with the eastern labour market crisis from the
start, stoutly defends job creation as his main management tool.
'As long as business does not invest, we must hold the bridge of work
creation,' he said recently.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (10): Foreign competitors use cost
advantage to win market share - The attractions of Germany as an investment
location are shrinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN INDUSTRY'S argument is straightforward enough: goods bearing the
'Made in Germany' label no longer earn a big enough premium to pay for the
luxurious lifestyle to which the west has grown accustomed, and to which the
east aspires. Everything - pay, taxes, energy, holidays, environmental
protection, education, social services and capital - is too expensive.
Germans stay at school longer, cost more to employ, have more holidays, work
shorter hours and retire earlier than virtually all their international
competitors.
Even when they are sick, Germans stay in hospital for more than twice as
long as their British neighbours.
As a result, international competitors are using their cost advantages to
steal market share from Germany, and the attractions of Standort Deutschland
 -as a country in which to invest and manufacture - are shrinking,
especially for German companies.
The main options for regaining lost competitiveness are clear to business
leaders: either reduce the whole of industry's cost-base or move out.
The tendency so far has been to side-step the enormous difficulties of
squeezing concessions out of prevaricating politicians and hard-line trade
union leaders and to take the direct route abroad instead.
The net result has been an extraordinary escalation in capital investment
abroad which has taken the annual total from an average DM8bn to more than
DM30bn in the past 10 years. The long-term average of foreign direct
investment in Germany has been a little over DM4bn.
While a large part of the rise in German foreign investment can be explained
by the need for German industry to internationalise in the wake of the
Japanese and others, and by the exploitation of opportunities opened up by
the development of the European Community into a borderless 'single market,'
there is evidence enough to show that it is no longer economic to
manufacture a widening range of products in Germany.
Recent examples of strategic shifts include the case of vehicle components
maker Heidemann, which announced earlier this month that it was to open a
factory in Pamplona, Spain.
The company, a typical Mittelstand employer of 2,000 inside Germany, and
mainly dependent on orders from Volkswagen, had the choice either of setting
up in Spain to supply parts for VW's Polo output which is being concentrated
in Spain, or lose the work to a local supplier. There is no suggestion yet
that the switch will cost jobs in Germany. However, 1,000 Nuremberg workers
will lose their jobs following Olivetti's announcement that it is to cease
making computers in Germany.
As an explanation, the Italian group said the factory closure would 'bring a
considerable improvement in the competitiveness of our product range'.
There have been many similar cases in the past 12 months. Robert Bosch, the
country's largest vehicle parts maker, has shunted car radio loudspeaker
production to south-east Asia, Mexico and Portugal, where labour is cheaper,
at the cost of 1,500 jobs in Hildesheim.
Chemicals giant BASF is shifting large chunks of its processing from Germany
to the Netherlands, mainly because of the immense costs of fulfilling
domestic environmental requirements and the delays entailed in negotiating
for planning permission.
Members of the chemical industry association, which this year face an
average 30 per cent fall in profits, claim that total environmental costs of
around DM8bn a year are more than 50 per cent higher than those in other EC
countries.
In the past six months the threat of recession and the dawning realisation
of the scale of the economic burdens taken on with unification have
temporarily diverted attention from the on-off 15-year debate over the
future of Standort Deutschland.
However, the shock-effect of these two new problems - driven home mainly by
a raft of huge job losses in the west this year and the failure of the
eastern economy to respond significantly to massive cash injections - could
hold the key to a resolution of the longer-term challenges facing German
industry.
In the context of a so-called 'solidarity pact' to aid recovery in the east,
IG Metall, the elite engineering trade union has offered tentatively to
accept a five-year pay deal which merely preserves the real value of wages,
in place of the usual inflation-plus formula.
While the union attached many strings to the proposal, it suggests that
appeals for a change of direction in pay policy may be having an effect.
Employers have blamed inflationary pay deals in the past two years for the
current round of job cuts which has hit engineers especially hard.
At Daimler-Benz, the country's leading company, for example, almost 30,000
people are to lose their jobs in the vehicles and aerospace divisions alone.
Mainly under the influence of recessionary pressures, the government has
committed itself to strict control of state spending which will limit
federal demands on capital markets and prevent increases in social welfare
and other levies on industry. A programme to reduce health service subsidies
by DM10bn a year will also contribute.
Marginal rates of corporate taxation are to be reduced by five percentage
points, compensatory reliefs will ease the burden of costs to industry
stemming from environmental legislation, and partial privatisation of state
authorities such as Deutsche Telekom should also lead to greater competition
and long-term cost benefits. As for the high cost of capital, it now seems
likely that once the Bundesbank is convinced that wage negotiations are set
on a more rational basis and the government can deliver on its promises to
cut spending, then it will lower interest rates from their present
near-record levels.
The process has only just started, and there are many other delicate issues
yet to be broached, such as regional pay differentials, working times and
holiday entitlements.
But the simple fact that government, employers and employees have in effect
undertaken to review the infrastructure of Standort Deutschland, with
concrete measures either proposed or already introduced, offers some grounds
for optimism.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (9): Insurers face surprising turmoil -
Germany's insurance industry is the largest in Europe with premiums of
DM168bn last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR decades, Germany's big insurance companies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
dominated by the Allianz colossus - have enjoyed good profits and have
benefited from relative immunity from competition.
But in the space of a couple of years, competition has intensified and
German insurers - facing uncharacteristic turmoil - have joined the ranks of
other insurance companies around the world which rely on investment business
to make a profit.
A turning point - for the perceptions of investors in the German insurance
industry - came in late July when Allianz, the Munich-based insurance giant
announced an underwriting loss of DM1.78bn for 1991, compared to a profit of
DM182m for the previous year. This was worse than expected and the shares
fell by 3 per cent on the day of the press conference. But later that week
the Deutsche Bank's research arm questioned Allianz's accounting for its
east German acquisition and the shares fell further.
In total, the Allianz share price has fallen by a quarter since the
beginning of June. The company has the largest market capitalisation on the
German stock market, accounting for more than 10 per cent of DAX 30-index of
large companies, and its poor performance has helped drag the market as a
whole down by 16 per cent in the third quarter of the year.
Disillusion with Allianz is largely due to the problems the company is
having with two recent acquisitions: of Deutsche Versicherungs, the former
east German state monopoly acquired for DM711m and Fireman's Fund, the US
insurer bought in 1990.
Another factor is the changing shape of the German market as a whole. By
1994, a series of European Community insurance directives must be
implemented in member-states. In Germany, the effect of the directives will
be to introduce price competition into a number of hitherto protected - and
highly profitable sectors of the market, predominantly in the personal
sector .
In theory, this should open the German market to competition from non-German
insurers, including the British who are reputed to have the best designed
products in Europe.
So far, the only interest shown by foreign companies is from the French: the
Victoire subsidiary of the Suez French financial and industrial group took
control of Colonia - one of Germany's largest insurance groups - in 1989 and
negotiations are underway to sell the stake on to Union des Assurances de
Paris, another French group.
More recently, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), another large French
group, bought up a 25 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs
(AMB), Germany's second largest insurance group. After a ferocious battle,
the French company earlier this year won the right to have the full voting
rights attached to its stake and boardroom representation at the German
company, whilst AMB's former chief executive was obliged to resign.
In practice, foreign companies will find it difficult to enter the German
market. Competition will intensify between domestic institutions which have
hitherto not had to compete with one another on price, at least not in
personal business sectors of the market. Where there has been price
competition, for example in industrial risks markets, losses have been steep
for a number of years. Added impetus to competition will come from the
banking sector. For decades, banks have operated marketing agreements with
insurance companies but their engagement in the market has intensified in
the last 18 months. Within this time, Allianz has emerged as a 22.3 per cent
shareholder in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank - and Deutsche
Bank has this summer made two big investments in the insurance market.
Deutsche bought a 30 per cent stake in Gerling, the largest independently
owned insurer in Germany and has - if market rumours are to be believed - an
option to buy the remaining stake. It also bought Deutscher Herold, an
insurance company specialising in private client business. The total outlay
could be as much as DM2bn, although the bank will not comment on the price.
The latest moves have given rise to stories about a 'battle of the giants,'
between the Allianz/Dresdner axis on the one hand, and
Deutsche/Herold/Gerling on the other.
Both sides dismiss this interpretation, Deutsche saying that the Herold
purchase is consistent with long-held plans to strengthen its investment
services for its private clients.
The rationale for the Gerling purchase is less clear, Deutsche saying that
it is an investment rather than an excursion into mainstream insurance
business. However, the bank has clearly not ruled out an all-out assault
into the industrial insurance market at a later date. This was implicitly
recognised by Germany's cartel authorities this September when they dropped
their insistence that Allianz should scale back its 22.3 per cent stake in
Dresdner, saying that competition was intensifying across the board in
Germany's insurance market.
Allianz and Deutsche, the two most powerful financial institutions in
Germany, show by their recent moves that the concept of 'allfinanz' -
co-operation between banks and insurance companies - has its followers in
Germany. They have not been discouraged by AMB's purchase of a majority
stake in the BfG Bank in 1987.
The bank was supposed to bring opportunities for cross-selling between
banking and insurance products. Instead, it has cost the parent insurer
nearly DM3bn as the bank encountered one serious problem after another. The
bank is on the verge of being sold to Credit Lyonnais of France as part of
the deal which has brought reconciliation between AMB and AGF.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (6): Bundesbank steels its nerve - Central
bank has faced intense domestic and foreign scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the brouhaha over the Bundesbank's tight monetary policies and their
impact on other countries, it is easy to forget the tremendous esteem in
which the institution is held in its own country.
Even trade unions have an uneasy respect for the Bundesbank. Usually,
central banks and unions are well apart in the economic spectrum, with the
policies of the former often aimed at curbing the demands of the latter.
This certainly applies also in Germany, as witnessed by the Bundesbank's
constant warnings against the inflationary dangers arising from excessive
pay claims.
But there is an important difference with many other countries, since union
leaders and their members share with the vast majority of German citizens an
innate dislike of inflation and a firm belief in the need to dampen it down.
This has not stopped union officials from berating the Bundesbank for its
high interest rates and tight monetary policies. Nor did it prevent unions
from asking for double-digit increases this year, though they did not get
them.
But when IG Metall, the big engineering trade union, agreed a 21-month
settlement with a lower wage increase for next year than in 1992, one of its
top officials made clear that the Bundesbank was now expected to fulfill its
job of keeping down inflation. In other words, the union trusts the bank to
ensure that its members' purchasing power is not eroded.
More recently, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union's fiery president, has
offered a five-year wage pact under which increases will only keep pace with
inflation and tax increases. This was his response to the government's calls
for a 'solidarity pact' with unions, regional states, and industry to sort
out the tangled problems of Germany's post-unification finances and economic
sluggishness.
Whatever the outcome of such efforts, it is clear the German public's regard
for the Bundesbank goes far beyond that of, say, the British for the Bank of
England. So however strongly the Bundesbank may be attacked abroad - and it
was criticised very sharply in the UK over the latest currency upsets
leading to sterling's devaluation - its domestic position is secure.
There are clear historical reasons for this, lying in the dreadful
inflationary experiences of the early 1920s and the aftermath of the Nazi
evils which caused the Second World War and left the German economy
shattered.
Both have left their mark on the German psyche. Inflation is regarded as a
virus to be eliminated before it becomes too threatening. It is this strong
public backing, coupled with a legally enshrined independence that is the
envy of other central banks, which steels the Bundesbank's nerve when it
comes to dealing with governments, unions, and employers.
The bank has crossed swords a number of times with Bonn. Chancellor Adenauer
was put out when the Bank deutscher Lander, the Bundesbank's predecessor,
put up interest rates in 1950. He called a later rise six years later a
'guillotine' for the economy.
In 1972, Karl Schiller, heading both the economics and finance ministries,
resigned over a Bundesbank proposal for temporary capital controls. A decade
later, Chancellor Schmidt pleaded in vain for lower interest rates.
Today, the immense financial, economic, and social strains caused by
unification - both by the speed of the event and the scale of the challenge
 -have put the Bundesbank under domestic and foreign scrutiny as never
before. For the sentinels of the D-Mark who work in the Bundesbank's
austere, unappealing headquarters at the edge of Frankfurt, the glare of
publicity has been disturbing and disruptive.
Imbued with the stability ethos of the Bundesbank, its policy-makers are
used to thinking medium and long-term and acting accordingly.
Underlying their policies is a commitment to steady and manageable growth,
with the Bundesbank providing the monetary conditions to support an economy
which is not subject to 'stop-go' jerkiness.
Its money supply targets, now the subject of numerous analyses, are designed
to permit rising production without additional inflation. The fact that its
latest target is being dramatically overshot has led to the Bundesbank's
high interest rates, these reflecting its dislike of the government's fiscal
inertia and of inflationary pay deals.
Since the Bundesbank is not an arm of government, though it is obliged to
support Bonn's economic policy as long as this does not conflict with its
own duties, it acts under its own responsibility. This may mean that, as at
present, bolstering a weakening economy takes second place to countering
inflationary trends.
At one stage this year, the annual rate of inflation approached 5 per cent,
a level that would be met with equanimity in many countries but not in
Germany. The Bundesbank, led by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, 68, a resolute
defender of price stability who has spent four decades at the central bank,
is determined to bring it down to 2 per cent.
This will certainly not be achieved this year, nor probably in 1993. But it
is worth recalling the Bundesbank's record in assessing whether it will
eventually succeed. In the inflationary 1970s, west Germany was the only
country to keep its annual increase in single figures. In 1986, it actually
had a minus inflation rate, the first since 1953.
With Germany's finances strained by the high costs of unification, the
Bundesbank is under the most extreme pressures it has ever experienced.
Even Mr Karl Otto Pohl, whose resignation as head of the Bundesbank last
year reflected differences with Chancellor Kohl over post-unity policies,
never had to face the unfavourable publicity barrage that has descended on
the courteous but stubborn Mr Schlesinger.
As the Anglo-German rumpus dies down, with the UK searching for a new
economic policy and Germany struggling to make unification work at a time of
slackening growth, the Bundesbank obviously hopes to stay out of the
spotlight.
But every time an interest rate change is rumoured or European currencies
look like being pulled apart again, the German central bank will be at the
centre of attention. Uncomfortable it may be for Mr Schlesinger and his
colleagues, but the strength of the D-Mark has its price.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (7): Bonn has a change of heart / A look
at Germany as a financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JANUARY this year, Chancellor Kohl made a long overdue visit to the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the biggest exchange in Germany. It was the first
time he had been there in nearly ten years in office, and the visit
demonstrated Bonn's new-found determination to provide active support for
Germany as a financial centre.
The change of heart, after years of neglect of the financial sector, was
probably directly linked to Germany's campaign to have the future European
Central Bank sited in Frankfurt. It also reflected a determination to build
Germany into a financing bridgehead for the fledgling market economies of
eastern Europe - and showed that the politicians had finally decided to help
bankers win back business in German securities currently conducted in other
financial centres, predominantly London.
Just how the government proposed to help had been made clear in a paper
written by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, and published without fanfare a
few days before Mr Kohl delivered his address to the flower of Frankfurt's
business and financial community. The plans were ambitious - to get a host
of measures in place by the end of the current year - but in the event there
were ten months of silence before anything tangible came of the proposals.
The Waigel document spelt out government support for increased regulation of
the securities markets; for a unified stock-exchange for the whole of
Germany; for an insider dealing law; for more sophisticated dealing
technology; for better stock-market disclosure rules and transparency; for
legislation to enable banks to launch money market funds which give
investors direct access to short-term money market instruments.
It now seems unlikely that there will be a 'German SEC' until the end of
next year at the earliest - nor an insider dealing law, although under
European Community Legislation the latter should have been on the statute
book by this summer.
The explanation for the delay is that there was a personnel change within
the finance ministry in the early spring: the relevant official left without
having produced a draft of the legislation required to set up an 'SEC' and
introduce an insider dealing law.
It was only by the late summer that such a blue-print had been produced,
thereby providing a basis for haggling between Bonn and the Lander - the
states which at present have responsibility for market regulation - but
ensuring that virtually nothing of the original Waigel programme would be in
place by the original deadline.
The only part of the package which will come into being anywhere near on
schedule is the move to create a Deutsche Borse - a German stock exchange. A
new holding company will be formed which will buy the Deutsche Terminborse
(DTB) - Germany's screen-based futures and options exchange and the
Deutscher Kassenverein, the settlements organisation.
The move will not end the particularism which has damaged the German
securities markets: there will still be eight stock exchanges in Germany,
competing with one another and quoting different prices for each stock, thus
splintering liquidity and transparency. But internal rivalries have been
overcome to the extent that the seven smaller Bourses - in Dusseldorf,
Munich, Hamburg, Hanover, Bremen, Stuttgart and Berlin - have agreed to take
a 10 per cent stake in the new venture.
As Mr Rolf Breuer, the Deutsche Bank main board director who will be the
first chairman of the Deutsche Borse, said in early October as final
agreement was announced after three years of negotiations, the structure of
the new entity reflects the realisation that all the exchanges should work
together for their common good.
'I am exceptionally confident that we have entered a new era,' he said as
Deutsche Borse was unveiled.
He cited in particular the development of new technology, which would be too
expensive for the seven smaller borses to finance on their own but would
ultimately be introduced to all exchanges.
He said it was new technology which had helped overcome some of the smaller
exchanges' antagonism towards Frankfurt's plans, in particular the Ibis
trading system introduced in April 1991. This now accounts for 30 per cent
of turnover in the 30 most frequently traded stocks, bringing new business
to the smaller exchanges as the market is screen-based and therefore not
tied to Frankfurt.
Germany now claims one of the more sophisticated stock-market structures in
Europe, providing one-stop shopping and settlement for investors wanting to
buy equities and derivatives. But is this enough?
As Breuer of the Deutsche Bank conceded earlier this month, the lack of a
regulatory body is causing increasing problems for Germany's financial
services industry. This is apparent in discussions with regulatory
authorities in other financial centres who, Breuer said, do not believe
Germany has a credible regulatory structure - making it difficult, for
example, for the DTB to set up screens outside Germany despite undoubted
demand.
Moreover, some investors also fight shy of buying shares in Germany because
of the perception that the regulatory environment is under-developed - and
because of the fact that insider dealing is still not a crime. The objective
now is to see the necessary legislation in place next year.
Mr Friedrich von Metzler, current chairman of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
and scion of an old Frankfurt banking family, is candid about what still has
to be done. With the move to a Deutsche Borse, he says that Germany is
'setting the ground for future developments'.
Steadily and surely, he and Breuer and other determined Frankfurt financiers
are building the institutional infrastructure essential if Finanzplatz
Frankfurt is to become on a par with London, New York and Tokyo - or even to
achieve the more modest objective of establishing a clear lead ahead of the
other continental European financial centres.
Ultimately, the institutional reforms will do no good without significant
cultural changes: there are only 660 or so German companies quoted on the
market, and most of these cannot be taken over - or are not even managed
with the interests of shareholders put ahead of other considerations. Equity
is still a far less favoured source of finance than bank debt, and private
investors prefer to put their savings in bonds rather shares.
It is often said that the average German family spends more money each year
on flowers than shares. The recent dire performance of the German share
market - down 16 per cent in the third quarter - is not going to change
this. Nor is the founding of the Deutsche Borse or the opening of a new
regulatory body sometime next year or the year after.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (4): The economy runs out of steam -
Although west Germany's traditional foreign markets have signally failed to
recover and produce the forecast autumn surge in exports, the government
remains outwardly confident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE west German economy has run out of steam at precisely the time when it
was expected to move up a gear and accelerate, taking the country into its
tenth consecutive year of steady growth and carrying the former GDR briskly
towards a bright new future.
The west's traditional foreign markets have signally failed to recover and
produce the forecast autumn surge in exports. The east's markets in the
former Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia have collapsed and
show no sign of recovery.
Domestic demand has slumped. And in September the spectacular appreciation
of the D-Mark against the currencies of many of Germany's key trading
partners dealt a telling blow to any lingering hopes of a late increase in
export orders.
After a freak spurt of growth in the first quarter of this year, which
stemmed mainly from the effects of fine weather on construction industry
output, the economic growth chart has slid back to the downwards trend which
started in the second quarter of last year.
Independent economists, who have steadily downgraded their predictions for
the past six months, now count on overall economic growth for this year of
below 1 per cent. But the government remains resolutely more confident; it
expects improvements in the final quarter to generate 1.5 per cent growth in
gross national product for the full year.
However, its optimism is based on mainly technical factors. The last three
months of this year include three more working days than in 1991, for
example. Also, Bonn believes a looming one point increase in value added tax
scheduled for January 1, will prompt a pre-Christmas boom in consumer
markets.
But once that is past - if indeed it materialises at all - on current
indications the slide is likely to continue into next year.
As things stand, the volume of new industrial orders to the end of August
has fallen for six consecutive months. Capital equipment manufacturers,
which export around half their output, have been consistently worst hit.
Production this year is expected to be 5 per cent down on 1991.
The depth of the troubles of the motor industry has become apparent more
recently. The underlying effect of fading demand was fudged for much of the
year as manufacturers raced to make up order backlogs. But new orders this
year are now expected to be as much as one-third lower than last.
In Baden-Wurttemberg, home state to Mercedes-Benz, total orders for vehicles
fell more than 16 per cent the first eight months. Domestic demand was down
26 per cent.
The chemical industry expects profits to fall 30 per cent in the current
financial year . . . and the story continues across the broad sweep of west
German industry.
Announcements of labour force cuts - 20,000 at Mercedes, 12,500 at
Volkswagen, 7,500 at Deutsche Aerospace - have become routine news items as
the year has progressed. Growth in the west's labour market, where 3m new
jobs have been created in the last nine years, has stopped.
IN the east, the picture is fogged by wildly gyrating economic data. But the
fact that the government has reduced its economic growth forecasts for the
region from 10 per cent to between 3 per cent and 5 per cent speaks for
itself. Although the official unemployment rate was 12 per cent in August,
only half the labour force in the former GDR is productively employed.
The dawning realisation that the west is going to have to continue
subsidising the east at current rates - transfers this year could reach
DM170bn - for many years to come has served not only further to darken the
immediate gloom. It has opened up a national debate on how Germany is to
manouevre its way out of the current situation and at the same time
consolidate the foundations for future growth and prosperity in both sides
of the country.
According to the pessimists - denounced vigorously by senior officials at
the Bundesbank - Germany now stands on the edge of recession. Hopes of
withdrawing from the brink or injecting growth into the economy rest almost
entirely with the independent central bank in Frankfurt, which controls
German monetary policy. Hopes for a longer-term consolidation lie with
politicians of all parties, trade unions and employers who have committed
themselves to a so-called 'solidarity pact' to foster and underwrite the
unification process.
For the immediate future, much depends on the Bundesbank's interest rates
policy. Expectations of rate reductions this year, which would have allowed
European trading partners to stimulate economic activity and demand for
German goods by cutting theirs, lay behind much of the early optimism which
produced forecasts of an autumn upswing. They have yet to be realised.
The bank stresses tirelessly that its prime task as protector of the
long-term stability of the D-Mark precludes short-term manouevrings to
relieve cyclical economic difficulties. It will need to be convinced that
inflation and the associated explosion in money supply growth are firmly
under control before any significant relaxation can be expected.
While September's acceleration in the growth rate of the M3 money supply
measure was a freak result, the underlying average rate of growth this year
has been almost double the bank's targeted top rate of 5.5 per cent.
Although a marked fall is expected in November as the economic downturn
deepens, the Frankfurt policy-makers have admitted that there is no chance
of bringing the rate within its target range this year.
Meanwhile, inflation seems to be stuck, doggedly resisting the bank's
efforts. A month-on-month prices rise pushed the annual rate to 3.6 per cent
in September, and while the Bundesbank confidently expects the year's
average to come in below 4 per cent, it has also warned of further
deterioration in January when the VAT increase takes effect.
After that, much will depend on the impact of the 1993 pay rounds.
Economists have been heartened by this year's two-year pay deal for 4m
engineering workers which included a 3 per cent rise next April, and the
recent 5.4 per cent claim from the Volkswagen workforce. They are now
forecasting a 4 per cent average award for 1993 - compared with 6 per cent
this year - and overall inflation of 3.75 per cent.
Given that the Bundesbank describes 2 per cent price inflation as merely
'tolerable,' present prospects give little cause for over-optimism about
large, early cuts in interest rates in Germany. But if the bank can be
convinced that a change of popular mood and realignment of people's
expectations with economic reality is firmly underway, more concessions are
possible.
It will need to be convinced that the government can deliver promised real
cuts in public spending and look for evidence in the progress of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's solidarity pact, now being debated at the expert level. Early
signs are not promising: the bank's recent statements indicate profound
scepticism about the finance ministry's ability to rein in federal spending,
and trade union leaders have already declared that they will not accept any
renegotiation of deals to bring east German pay up to western levels by
1994.
However, early indications are not always to be trusted, as German
economists who forecast an autumn recovery can verify.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (3): A difficult balancing act - German
foreign policy faces sensitive issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dramatic resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as German foreign
minister after 18 years in office, announced last April and carried out in
May, was more than the end of a personal era.
It symbolised a watershed in German foreign policy.
Only weeks before, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg was forced to quit involuntarily
as minister of defence, because of a row over arms shipments to Turkey.
Almost at one blow, the two longest-serving members of the Kohl coalition
vanished from the scene, making way for a younger generation, just at the
moment when Germany's foreign and security policy is undergoing a
fundamental reassessment.
Today a new team is in office in the German foreign ministry, headed by Mr
Klaus Kinkel as minister, matched by a new team on the other side of Bonn,
in the defence ministry, headed by Mr Volker Ruhe. Both are energetic and
ambitious politicians, and their new style has rapidly become apparent: the
question is whether it will also mean a new content to external policy.
Mr Kinkel could scarcely have been more hand-picked for his job: he was a
young civil servant plucked from obscurity to head the private office of Mr
Genscher back in the early 1970s, before becoming head of the ministry's
planning staff. He remained a civil servant, including a brief stint as head
of the BND, the German secret service, until January, 1991, when he was
suddenly promoted to be minister of justice, and joined Mr Genscher's party,
the Free Democrats (FDP).
AS for Mr Ruhe, he is a politician to his finger-tips, and makes little
secret of his ultimate ambition to succeed Mr Helmut Kohl as German
Chancellor. He was secretary-general of the Christian Democrats (CDU) before
Mr Stoltenberg quit, and he was suddenly thrust into the Cabinet. Within
weeks he had launched a string of new initiatives, all-but-axed the
controversial European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project - much to British fury
 -and shaken up his entire sleepy organisation.
Both, therefore, have a vested interest in a high-profile, successful new
German foreign policy. Yet both have also an urgent need to reassure
Germany's partners that they are not dealing with a changed regime in the
wake of unification, one which could become a re-assertive, heavy-handed
would-be superpower. So their emphasis is equally on continuity.
Mr Kinkel, in his most recent restatement of German foreign policy,
deliberately used the phrase coined by Mr Genscher, his mentor, to sum it
up: 'The politics of responsibility.'
In essence, that means that Germany renounces any hint of nationalism or
power politics, grim reminders of its hegemonistic past, in favour of
whole-hearted integration in international organisations: the European
Community, Nato, the United Nations, and the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). It is a policy which has, if anything, been
reinforced by the instability and upheavals going on in central and eastern
Europe, after the collapse of the Soviet empire.
'There is a general trend of centrifugal forces right across Europe,'
according to one very senior German diplomat. 'Everything that had been kept
together more or less by outside pressure is no longer under that pressure.
'At the same time, it is not only a united Germany that is looking for a new
place in the new order. There are many others who are uncertain of their
place. Indeed, none of the major players knows its place. The consequence is
that we have to foster and support every movement towards integration, be it
in the EC, the Western European Union (WEU), Nato, the Nato co-operation
council (with eastern Europe), and the CSCE.
'If we want to regain our stability, and we have to, we have to foster these
developments towards integration. Integration is our best insurance against
domination.'
Mr Kinkel puts it also in terms of external perceptions - 'since
unification, the world sees us with different eyes,' he warned a recent
meeting of newspaper publishers. 'In this changed environment, the unified,
bigger and sovereign Germany must now achieve what it has twice before
failed to do: it must find a role in the world which corresponds both to the
wealth and wishes of our own population, and which is also acceptable to our
neighbours and partners.'
That is the difficult balancing act the two new Ministers are seeking to
perform.
There is no question but that the European Community, and Chancellor Kohl's
driving ambition towards greater integration in a European Union, remains at
the heart of German foreign policy.
The storm of debate over the Maastricht treaty, which would introduce a
single currency, and - eventually - a common foreign and security policy -
has left German commentators doggedly restating their belief: that there is
'no alternative.'
In spite of his awareness that a large majority of Germans are deeply
unhappy with the idea of giving up their hard Deutsche Mark for a future
European currency of uncertain stability, Mr Kohl is adamant that he will
press ahead regardless.
He would add to that another priority: that of 'normalisation.' That means
Germany taking up its responsibilities in international relations, put on
ice ever since the Second World War.
Mr Ruhe has begun a policy of attrition, despatching military doctors to
Cambodia, military transport planes to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and naval ships
to the Adriatic, as well as military members on a CSCE mission to Georgia,
in the former Soviet Union. Mr Kinkel puts the theory: 'We Germans cannot
have UN membership a la carte,' he says.
'Normalisation . . . means the Bundeswehr undertaking worldwide
peace-keeping roles under the auspices of the UN, and with the approval of
the Bundestag.
'We cannot expect to go on sitting in the spectators' seats at the world
stage.'
Another sensitive question is whether Germany should apply to become a
permanent member of the UN Security Council. Mr Kinkel says: 'We are not
pushing ourselves forward, but if the question arose of a corresponding
reform in the UN charter, and others like Japan, Brazil, Nigeria and India,
put in a claim, then we will also express our wish for a permanent seat.'
Furthermore, after last summer's skinhead riots in Rostock and arson attacks
on a Jewish memorial at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, the foreign
minister said Germany could squander 'the chance of achieving normality as
good Europeans if we allow our image abroad to be marred by terrorism and
hatred of foreigners . . . we must do everything in our power to bury this
ghost.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (1): The national euphoria is over - As
Germany's economy slows down, the real cost of unification and the
subsidising of east Germany is becoming painfully clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS ALWAYS clear that German unification would be a painful process, but
quite how traumatic and prolonged that pain may prove to be is only now
emerging
The euphoria of unification two years ago blinded many, including Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, to the real scale of the adjustment needed in transforming an
unreconstructed Communist economy and society into a capitalist one.
The threat of economic recession in the west has opened many eyes to the
real costs of subsidising the east, in a society where problems in the past
have been dealt with simply by throwing more money at them.
The lack of compatible structures in the former East Germany -
administrative, commercial and social - capable of supporting the
western-style social market economy has meant that everything has had to be
built up virtually from scratch. In the meantime, all the old structures
have collapsed.
After two years of insisting that unification could be accomplished
relatively painlessly, that it could be implemented quite swiftly in the
east, and at the same time without significant tax increases in the west, Mr
Kohl has started to prepare his people for a much longer haul.
'We know today better than we knew two years ago that this truly secular,
unique event brings with it huge problems, more than many - including myself
 -had expected,' the Chancellor told the German Bundestag in last month's
budget debate.
Senior government officials estimate that it could go on costing west
Germany up to DM150bn a year in net transfers to the east for the next
decade.
Officials also recognise that it cannot go on indefinitely being financed
from the capital markets, but must mean both strenuous budget savings in the
west, and almost certainly new tax increases.
Any weaker economy than the west German one could not even begin to
contemplate the sort of financial transfers already carried out in the two
years since unification. A quite extraordinary effort of reconstruction is
already under way, involving every aspect of the physical infrastructure of
the former Communist state. The problem is that at the same time, east
German industry has collapsed, and shows very little sign of sustained
recovery.
If the western economy was growing fast, the cost of east German subsidies
might appear more manageable. But the artificial boost which followed
unification is over, and there has been no revival in the international
economy to give an export-led boost in the west.
All forecasts for economic growth this year and next are being revised
downwards. The result is that depression in the east is reinforced by
gathering fear of recession in the west, and the mood in the nation as a
whole is increasingly gloomy.
To compound the economic stress, the country is now facing an unprecedented
influx of would-be immigrants, above all from eastern and southern Europe.
They claim asylum, under Germany's liberal asylum laws, but they are in
reality economic refugees from the collapse of the Soviet empire. Numbers
could reach as many as 500,000 this year. They are also an easy target for a
mindless minority of German youths, alienated in the east by the collapse of
their system and their job prospects, and in the west by the very
materialism of a successful capitalist culture.
The skinheads responsible for attacking asylum-seekers hostels are scarcely
thinking neo-Nazis, but they have created a climate of fear at the possible
revival of right-wing extremism, both within Germany and abroad.
The opinion polls show a slow but steady increase in support for the parties
of the far right, led by the Republicans, who would gain more than the
minimum five per cent necessary for seats in the Bundestag, if there were
elections tomorrow. It is a prospect which has the large parties rattled.
AT the same time the whole country is suffering - like the rest of western
Europe - from a general disaffection with the political establishment.
There is a mistrust of politicians, reflected in consistently low ratings in
all the opinion polls, with Chancellor Kohl coming out frequently bottom.
It is a moment which seems to cry out for clear leadership, yet that is
precisely the sort of leadership which does not suit Mr Kohl. He is the
ultimate politician of consensus, the master of prevarication, who blurs his
own position on every issue until the outline of a possible compromise
emerges from the ongoing debate.
It is a form of leadership which has suited Germany in the good times, but
it could prove a liability now that hard choices have to be made on spending
priorities.
That is not entirely fair. Mr Kohl has given a lead on one issue, and that
is his passionate and very personal commitment to European union - to an
ever more closely integrated European Community. It is the one theme on
which he has sought to rally his people, yet, ironically, it is one issue on
which they appear to be getting doubtful themselves.
There is still a majority in the polls in favour of the Maastricht treaty on
European union, and there is an overwhelming majority in parliament in
favour of ratification, but on the specific question of whether a single
European currency should replace the Deutsche Mark, there is a very clear
majority against.
Even the German business community shares some of the growing scepticism
about the value of the European Community and its single market to the
German economy.
The Chancellor has now put his faith in a new hope: a 'solidarity pact' to
persuade the business sector, trade unions, the opposition Social Democrats
and the 16 federal states to back the government in a deal to help finance
the costs of unification. It is supposed to be negotiated by the end of the
year.
There are signs that such a pact may be possible, if only because of the
growing fear on both sides of industry that the recession is upon them.
Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the state president, and increasingly the voice
of reason speaking out above the muddled political debate, singled out two
key challenges - financing German unification, and coping with immigration -
as nothing less than touchstones of German democracy. It was a sombre
warning.
And yet one of the great strengths of Germany's post-war system has been the
country's capacity to find a consensus, and defuse confrontation. The
challenge of unification is simply the biggest challenge it has had to deal
with so far.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Long wave interference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Long Wave is the least understood and most important (cycle) . . . but
it moves so slowly that the motion is imperceptible to the human eye. Yet
like the glaciers, it can have the most devastating effect on the
countryside -
Professor John Sterman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Everybody seems to be talking about 'long waves' - the 50-60 year economic
cycles that Kondratieff, the Russian economist, first claimed to have
identified in the 1920s. A fortnight ago, I was discussing the US outlook
with Mr Charles Venus, an economic consultant in Little Rock, Arkansas. He
pointed to low interest rates and gave the usual textbook arguments for a
solid US recovery over the next few years. But then he surprised me by
raising a horrible doubt. Might not the US - indeed the entire global
economy - be caught in a Kondratieff downwave?
This is precisely what is happening, according to a paper* presented to a
recent Bank Credit Analyst conference in New York by Mr John Sterman, a long
wave theorist at MIT's Sloan School of Management. The economy is hard to
understand, he believes, because four things are happening at once.
Over the longest time span, technical change and population growth result in
steady economic growth - about 3.5 per cent a year since 1800 in the US.
Long waves represent very slow, very powerful fluctuations about this trend,
lasting some 50-60 years. Superimposed on each long wave are numerous
short-term business cycles, lasting on average about five years. Finally,
there is 'random noise', reflected in arbitrary variations in the growth
rate from quarter to quarter.
Most academics refuse to believe in long waves. Joseph Schumpeter, the
Austrian analyst of capitalism, was an exception. In his book Business
Cycles (1939), he identified three long cycles, the first beginning with the
birth of modern capitalism in the 1780s, the second in the 1840s, and the
third at the end of the 19th century. Lengthy economic downturns - including
the Great Depression of the early 1930s - occurred roughly on cue in the
second 'down-swing' phase of each cycle. In the 1940s, Schumpeter was one of
only a handful of economists to predict strong global growth after the
second world war, partly because he believed the powerful expansion phase of
the fourth Kondratieff cycle would then be under way.
But what could cause cycles of such long duration? The long-term dynamics of
capital goods industries and the tendency for innovations to occur in
clusters provides a possible answer. The start of an upswing is
characterised by pent up consumer demand and a wave of investment in new
technologies. Motor cars, washing machines and televisions helped power the
post-second world war expansion, just as railways provided a boost in the
mid-19th century.
But the supply of new products first requires investment in capital goods
industries, a process that can feed on itself for several decades. At some
point, however, capital goods production exceeds demand, precipitating cuts
which eventually trigger the contraction phase of the cycle. In long waves,
assets - such as plant, equipment and real estate - thus play an analogous
role to inventories in short-term business cycles.
There is another plausible reason for long waves: after 50-60 years the
people whose mistaken expectations shaped one cycle will be dead or very old
and thus unable to influence their successors. Put another way, you are
unlikely to repeat the mistakes of your parents, but you may easily fall
into the same traps as your grandparents. The speculative excesses of the
1980s, for example, could not have occurred in the 1950s because too many
people then vividly remembered the 1920s. In the 1950s in the US it was
difficult to borrow against the security of a house, because real estate was
still seen as a highly illiquid asset of uncertain value.
I remain agnostic about long waves. But if they exist, where are we now?
According to Mr Sterman, the current long cycle peaked in the early 1970s
when excess demand began to emerge in heavy capital goods industries such as
steel. We have been in the downswing phase ever since; this is why growth
has tended to be below the long-term average of 3.5 per cent and why
short-term recessions have been more severe than in the immediate post-war
decades. The final phase of a long wave is characterised by a trough in
which the economy moves sideways in preparation for a new Kondratieff
upswing.
If the trough began with the 1990-91 recession, might an expansion soon
begin? It is possible, but not probable. None of the relevant leading
indicators - such as the rate of capacity utilisation in capital goods
industries - point to an early upturn. Most economies still seem burdened by
the excesses of the last cycle. There is not yet a sense either of pent-up
demand from consumers or of an imminent wave of investment in new
technologies. But long wave theory suggests most of the downswing is behind
us. By the late 1990s, the mostly myopic economics profession may be amazed
by the strength of the global recovery.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Justinian bows out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Justinian is today given his quietus. For more than 30 years this column -
wittily dubbed by Private Eye as 'Justinian for the Money' - has appeared
weekly (more recently, fortnightly) to convey to readers how the law works
in practice, as opposed to the law in the text books.
Its author feels that at this moment some reflective thoughts - even highly
personal ones - over three decades of legal journalism would not go amiss.
To write about the legal system and the legal profession in the early 1960s
in any daily national newspaper was almost a novelty. It was also slightly
hazardous for any journalist without a legal qualification, let alone for a
qualified lawyer.
The legal profession positively opposed the concept of openness on matters
outside the open courtroom. To write without the cover of anonymity, if the
author was simultaneously a practising barrister, was an imperative. Even
then the author was quickly unmasked. This author recalls sometime in the
early 1960s being summoned to appear before that benign and great Lord Chief
Justice, Lord Parker. Trembling for fear that some dreadful legal solecism
had been committed, the author duly appeared.
The mild, friendly rebuke was not for having perpetrated an error of fact or
for misunderstanding the law, but for the fact that it was regarded as
improper for a practising member of the Bar to be relating to the outside
world what went on in the monastic environs of the Temple.
That kind of judicial review of Justinian's writings could not seriously be
entertained today. There is now total acceptance that even such a
distinguished Queen's Counsel as Mr David Pannick can deploy, with almost
total impunity, his radical pen, fortnightly in The Times.
It is one of the notable features of a changing legal profession, now
proclaiming its openness to the scrutiny of the public it serves, that it
can contemplate, even encourage, self-criticism in the media.
Contrary to popular belief, the judges themselves have begun to pay
attention to the scribblings of the legal commentators. A cuttings service
has been available to the most senior judges.
On one occasion - it was the contempt case against the journalist who
declined to reveal his source - counsel, who was advancing an improbable,
not to say impossible argument before the Court of Appeal for the contemnor,
was told by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson, that the struggling
advocate might find a more valid argument from a recent article by
Justinian. Adoption of Justinian's views was, however, no less implausible;
it sunk without judicial trace. But the Court of Appeal was kind enough to
think that the article was worthy of note.
Justinian's most notable contribution was a decade ago, at the time of the
Falklands war. The FT, editorially, stood out from most of the nation
thirsting for military engagement with Argentina. The line was that war
might have to be countenanced, but that armed conflict should come about
only after all possible means of negotiation had been thoroughly canvassed
and failed.
Among the canvassed proposals was that the government should accept UN
trusteeship of the Falklands. Justinian simultaneously outlined in detail
the notion of trusteeship under UN auspices. Britain would continue to
administer the territory, but the trusteeship government would be written in
terms which acknowledged Argentina's interests. Justinian wrote: 'Implicit
in trusteeship is the idea at some stage the islands might, for strictly
geographical reasons, become part of the Republic of Argentina.'
If Justinian's contribution to the debate did not commend itself to the
government, the idea was fostered by a number of leading politicians. It was
the nearest Justinian ever came to influencing the authorities. Other
writings attracted no more than passing interest, gaining approval or
incurring displeasure. If it was the latter, few disgruntled readers
delivered a public or private rebuke. (Justinian acknowledges gratefully the
forebearance of his readers.)
Justinian's influence was more in the area of journalistic imitation. At the
beginning of the 1960s there was only the faintest recognition by Fleet
Street of the need of a legal correspondent. Indeed, Justinian was the nom
de plume for the emerging legal correspondent of The Guardian and The
Observer.
Today, all the broadsheet newspapers carry weekly law pages - no doubt
generated by the advertising world - and regular stories and feature
articles on the law and the legal profession. The recent reforms of the
profession, which were openly fought over between the judiciary and the Lord
Chancellor, provided newsworthy (even exciting) copy for serious readers.
Today, the law occupies a discrete segment of the daily fare for readers of
the serious organs of the media. As Justinian bows out, he can claim to have
been the precursor, but not the spawner of contemporary legal journalism.
Perhaps Justinian may indulge in one piece of immodesty. David Kynaston
wrote in his 1988 centenary history of the FT that for more than a quarter
of a century the paper had been provided 'with a legal commentary, not only
on matters of commercial law, of the very highest calibre'. If that was a
sound assessment, it would need some qualification in the light of today's
rival legal commentators, to whom Justinian is sensibly bidding farewell.
The competition is now too fierce for the comfort of a commentator with 30
years' experience on legal affairs.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Monday Interview: Voice of high-tech challenge - George
Fisher, chairman of Motorola, talks to Tony Jackson and Michiyo Nakamoto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I spend a certain amount of my time,' says Mr George Fisher of Motorola,
'worrying about US competitiveness.'
It seems a curious admission from the chairman of one of the world's great
electronics companies, a competitor par excellence against the industrial
might of Japan. But Mr Fisher has his reasons. His other preoccupations
include US defence spending, the US infrastructure and the need for the US
to develop certain critical technologies. These are all matters in which
Motorola has an interest. Thus, what is good for the US is good for
Motorola.
And, presumably, vice versa, which is why Mr Fisher spends part of his time
on Vice-President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness. This puts him
squarely in the debate on the role of government in industry, which in the
US is delicate ground. In most other countries, industrial policy is a
legitimate topic for discussion. In the US, the phrase has distinctly
left-wing overtones.
'Basically, I think taxpayers' money is appropriately involved in developing
pre-competitive technologies or the infrastructure. There is a limit to how
much taxpayers' money should be spent, because you do get into the subject
of industrial policy, which generally we are not favourable to.'
In Germany, he argues, 3.7 per cent of GDP is spent on infrastructure. In
Japan, the figure is about 5.6 per cent; in the US about 1 per cent. In the
early 1900s, he says, the US was more in line with what Japan does today.
'The US has to do a better job.
'And maybe I'm myopic, but when I look at infrastructure investment in
computing and communications, that is very much driven by some pretty
fundamental technology in semiconductors. That is a legitimate concern of
the country. Japan recognises that; Germany recognises that. And when we
look at who we compete with in the world, it's largely Japan and Germany.'
Given that Motorola's business is in semiconductors and communications, Mr
Fisher naturally has strong views on this. A couple of years ago Michael
Borkin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said he
saw no economic difference between semiconductor chips and potato chips.
'I'll argue that to the death,' Mr Fisher says. 'It's insanity. You only
believe that if you want your country to go down the drain.
'It is absolutely clear in my mind that you have to have economic priorities
in a country, and that some things are more important than others to future
economic growth. High-tech industries tend to be among the economic drivers,
and we're competing with countries which recognise that.
'The US doesn't have a comprehensive strategy because it isn't popular in
many segments of the US political population to say that computer chips are
more important to the economic survival of the US than potato chips.
Somebody has to be willing to make those decisions. Just who is a real
question, and as you get further into industrial policy the more problematic
the question becomes. But I don't think we're even close to that.'
And after all, he argues, the US makes these decisions every day. 'There are
agricultural subsidies, there are protectionist tariffs in the US. People
are making those judgments. They need to be made in an organised way, rather
than in a de facto political way.'
Take the 760-odd laboratories which are supported by government funds. 'They
spend about Dollars 20bn a year, mostly on defence-oriented projects. There
need to be agreed priorities on what these laboratories spend their money
on, and how they are allowed to interact with private industry. I think the
government needs to worry a lot more about the transition from a military
foreign policy posture to an economic and commercial posture.'
High on the list of priorities is deciding which are the critical
technologies that the US needs to develop. But how are these to be defined?
'If I were a country, I would look at which industries were the real growth
drivers. I'd look at pharmaceuticals, high-tech electronics, biotechnology,
aircraft, design tools, whatever. I'd then ask the experts in those fields
what the technologies are which are really fundamental to those industries.
Then I'd look across and compile a list of which technologies are generic to
many industries. That's basically what Miti (Ministry of International Trade
and Industry) did in Japan, or the US Defence Department, or Germany.
'If you've established that these technologies are common, that avoids the
whole question of industrial policy and favouring one industry over another.
That's why you don't come up with 'Wow, let's go build a high definition TV
factory.' '
So what kind of technologies are we talking about here? Take flat screen
displays, he says, as used in computers and other electronic hardware. 'In
flat screens we have virtually no big companies except IBM, which is working
with Toshiba in Japan.
'But for reasons of national security and commercial competitiveness, the US
 -and the European Community, for that matter - should have indigenous
suppliers of flat screen displays.' It is not so many years, he recalls,
since the world suffered a shortage of standard micro-chips. This conferred
a huge advantage on electronics companies who made their own.
Similarly, he says, 'the western world's computer industry could be put out
of business as we evolve more and more to flat screen display, unless there
is a capability in the US and Europe to develop flat screen displays. That's
not necessarily because of any devious motive. The world runs out of
capacity from time to time, and guess what - the people who have the
capacity are going to be supplied first.'
One cannot help remarking that Fisher's attitudes to industrial policy must
be coloured by the fact that whatever technologies are picked, Motorola is
likely to benefit. Yes indeed, he says cheerfully. 'I may have been born on
a farm, but I wasn't born yesterday.'
But look at it this way, he says. 'If more of the money that used to go on
defence is spent on Aids research, that's probably a good use of taxpayers'
money. That also helps some pharmaceutical companies make a lot of money,
and I don't feel bad about that as a taxpayer. Likewise, if some of that
money is redeployed from heat-seeking missiles to the fundamentals of new
display technology, and a company like Motorola benefits, I don't feel bad
about that either.'
Given that so much of the conversation has been about politics, a final
question inevitably suggests itself. On the eve of the US presidential
election, who does he - or Motorola - want to win?
'I think it's mixed,' he says cautiously. 'Much of what the Bush
administration has been doing has been fine. They have tried very hard to
open markets around the world for us, and Motorola has certainly benefited
from that.
'On the other hand, Clinton would have the advantage of working with a
sympathetic Congress. Right now, the good things the president would want to
do are stopped by Congress, and the good things Congress would want to do
are stopped by veto.'
What good things does he have in mind? 'We were talking about some of them
earlier. Right now, the current in the administration is much more towards
letting market forces prevail: 'let's not interfere; government will only
screw it up.' Way over on the other side is government involvement in
virtually everything, social or industrial. But what you see in this
election is interesting. Clinton has some advisers way over at that extreme,
but he himself is much closer to the middle. Bush is coming closer to the
middle, but he's got some advisers way over at the other extreme.
'The healthy thing is those guys understand the need for the Republicans to
come more to the middle socially and the Democrats to come more to the
middle economically. So either Bush or Clinton will be fine. I'm going to
vote for Bush, probably, but I'm not pessimistic either way.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Dollars waiting to soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR is likely to trade in an uncertain manner against the D-Mark
between now and the US Presidential election on November 3, writes James
Blitz
The markets are assuming that Mr Bill Clinton will win the election, and
many analysts expect the dollar to soar in the aftermath of that victory.
They argue that Mr Clinton's commitment to increase public spending will
check the US Federal Reserve's policy of cutting interest rates. The
expected easing of German policy will also narrow the differential between
US and German rates that has driven the market this year.
The dollar's rise to a high of DM1.5365 in European trading on Friday was
proof that this is how dealers are thinking. But this week, several US
economic indicators may check the market's ebullience, reminding traders
that the US economic upturn is a slow one.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes that the
figure for third quarter GDP in the US, due out on Tuesday, may show
quarter-to-quarter growth below one per cent.
He also believes that consumer confidence figures due out on Tuesday on
Friday will disappoint the market.
Dealers will again focus on the fortnightly Bundesbank council on Thursday.
In the run-up to the last two council meetings, the market has got very
excited about the prospect of a cut in official rates, only to show huge
disappointment when the cut fails to come.
In the UK, the main event of the week will be the chancellor's keynote
speech at the Mansion House on Thursday. The government has put a new
emphasis on cutting rates and 'going for growth.' But the speech will be
analysed carefully for further hints on how this is to be achieved.

to have risen again last month.
There are few economic statistics in the UK but the Confederation of British
Industry produces its quarterly industrial trends survey and the chancellor
delivers the annual Mansion House speech.
This will be particularly important this year as Mr Norman Lamont is
expected to clarify the government's new economic policy, details of which
have been somewhat hazy ever since the prime minister declared that he was
'going for growth'.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Japanese Bonds: Hopes rise of cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government bond market is poised for monetary easing by the
Bank of Japan, with the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark fluctuating
around the 4.8 per cent level.
The fall in money market rates, due to funding operations by the central
bank, encouraged hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate and
the overnight call rate fell to 4 per cent, the lowest since February 1989.
While lower short-term rates have supported government bonds, market
participants have remained cautious about a fully-fledged rally because of
concern over higher long-term rates in the US.
Long-term yields were affected by the rise in US long-term interest rates,
as investors remained uncertain about the effects a Democratic victory in
the US would have on global interest rates.
However, further indications of a weaker economy have provided underlying
support for the bond market, with economic figures indicating a further
downturn increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease rates.
Money supply growth for September announced last week, fell 0.4 per cent
from the previous year, its first decline on record, prompting Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, to call for lower money market rates.
An increase in bankruptcies and lower consumption figures have also added to
the gloom. Interim earnings announcements by leading retailers have pointed
to a sharp fall in consumer confidence, as sales and profits at most
department stores posted double digit declines.
In addition, a survey by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) indicated that
capital spending by corporations will fall 3.2 per cent for this fiscal year
to March. The EPA said cutbacks on capital investment by manufacturers are
especially severe, with a 10.3 per cent decline.
The Bank of Japan's projection for zero money supply growth for the current
quarter, however, may cool some hopes of monetary easing. Mr Robert Feldman,
economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said the figure indicated there
would not be a cut in the official discount rate this year.
The central bank predicted a gradual recovery in the economy, while Mr
Kagehide Kaku, head of the bank's research and statistics department, denied
the possibility of an imminent rate cut.
The turmoil within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, however, has hardly
affected the country's financial markets. Some investors fear the opposition
parties may try to delay the approval of the supplementary budget in
parliament by calling for Mr Shin Kanemaru, of the Liberal Democratic Party,
to testify as a witness over his violation of the Political Funds Control
Law.
However, a long delay is regarded as unlikely because of the criticism that
is expected to arise if the opposition parties were to delay the fiscal
support package.
The bond market is now focusing on decisions over monetary policy to be made
at the Bank of Japan's branch managers' meeting, which starts tomorrow.
Concerns of over-supply, however, may temporarily depress the long-term bond
market, as the government is expected to auction 20-year bonds worth some
Y300bn.

FT  26 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Retail investors are caught between
politics and reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the US Treasury bond market, many of whom are nervous about the
impact of fiscal stimuli being promised by Governor Bill Clinton to get the
US economy moving again, appear to be coming round to the gradual
realisation that there may yet be life after election day.
Not everyone is sanguine, of course, and traditional retail buyers of
Treasury paper seem likely to remain on the sidelines until after the
presidential election a week from tomorrow.
These smaller players in the market simply may not have the stomach - or
sufficient information - to speculate about interest rates in the closing
stages of the presidential campaign.
Retail investors were reported to have sold heavily in the early part of
last week, and on Friday wariness continued as the benchmark 30-year
Treasury issue declined by  9/32 in light trading. This brought the bond's
total loss for the week to 1 5/16 , raising its yield to 7.63 per cent, the
highest since last July.
Bond market participants have instead begun to form a more jaundiced view of
the gap between Mr Clinton's political campaign rhetoric about jump-starting
the economy with federal spending programmes and the likely reality that a
Clinton administration would not translate instantly into higher budget
deficits and higher inflation.
Analysts at Salomon Brothers, for example, note the protestations from
Clinton's close advisers that - contrary to what the market thinks - their
candidate has no plans for immediate fiscal stimulus.
But Salomon also notes that these reassurances have failed to quell market
concerns and that ultimately bond prices will remain vulnerable until any
potential shift in fiscal policy is clarified by a future President Clinton.
Mr Phillip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities in New York, says
rather more directly that a Clinton presidency would be 'unlikely to unlease
a deluge of red ink'. In dismissing concerns that a Clinton administration
would go on a spending spree, Mr Braverman stresses Mr Clinton is focusing
on ways to increase spending without increasing the deficit.
The market is also forgetting the public service performed by Mr Ross Perot
 -he has made concern over the deficit a national issue and this will make
it more difficult for both Congress and the next president to avoid the need
to attack the deficit during the next four years.
In addition, the latest report from Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, the
securities house, warns that the US federal budget deficit is likely to
remain relatively high for years to come no matter who is elected.
Nor will the election stop the Federal Reserve from a further easing of
monetary policy if, as expected, the next round of macro-economic statistics
shows the US economy is still extremely sluggish.
Tomorrow, for example, the commerce department will issue a report on
third-quarter growth in gross domestic product; the consensus is for a
fairly anaemic 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent. Then the conference board will
release the consumer confidence index for October, which could be down
further from 58 per cent in August and 56.4 per cent in September.
On Wednesday, the commerce department will release durable goods data for
September, also likely to be weak.
These statistics might be expected to boost bond prices, were it not for
political uncertainty and the weight of more Treasury paper coming to
market, with auctions of Dollars 15bn of two-year maturities and Dollars
10.75bn of five-year paper.
The most important new economic data likely to be reviewed by the Fed will,
however, come after the election when October unemployment data is released.

FT  26 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Attention focuses on change to PSBR rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK gilts market continued to gain ground amid expectations that lower
interest rates are likely in Britain over the next few months.
With the government's economic policy still the subject of some confusion,
many market participants feel that a move down from the current level of
base rates is unlikely to spur inflation in the short-term, a development
that helped long-dated gilts to share in the price rises of shorter-dated
stock.
As few indicators emerge of any early end to the recession, attention
focused on possible changes to the rules for financing the public sector
borrowing requirement which Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer,
may address this week.
Because economic activity in Britain over the next year or so seems likely
to be weak, there is little prospect that the PSBR will come down quickly
from the figure expected for the 1993-94 financial year of about Pounds
40bn.
That may put extra pressure on the Bank of England to find new ways to
finance the PSBR, through, for example, innovative funding techniques which
some believe Mr Lamont may announce in his Mansion House speech to
representatives of the City of London on Thursday.
While last week the government held off from signalling a further cut in
base rates, now at 8 per cent, many participants expect overall borrowing
conditions to ease significantly by the end of the year in the wake of the
new recognition in Whitehall that the reces-sion appears to be deepening.
Short-dated gilts rose by nearly 2 points as a result of this expectation,
with the benchmark 8.75 per cent stock due in 1997 yielding 7.22 per cent on
Friday night, about 40 basis points down on the week.
Against expectations by some in the market that price gains for short-dated
gilts would force up yields at the long end of the yield curve, long-dated
securities also saw a rise in price of up to 1.5 points.
The Treasury 9 per cent stock maturing in 2008 saw a yield at the end of the
week of 8.81 per cent, roughly 16 basis points less than on the Friday night
of the week before.
With the level of sterling not giving market participants any real cause for
concern, there is also the feeling in the financial community that the
Bundesbank will cut its main interest rates over the next month or so as the
German economy slows. Indications were provided by the German central bank
last week, when it engineered a reduction in a key money market rate by 15
basis points.
In this environment, especially given a new emphasis on speeding up growth
by Mr John Major, the prime minister, there seems little to stop base rates
coming down to 6 per cent by Christmas.
Changes of this sort should boost company profits and influence more of a
switch of funds to equities from gilts. At the same time, however, many fund
managers appear to want to keep relatively large amounts of cash tied up in
gilts and other government bonds on the grounds that the apparent lack of
inflationary pressures on the horizon make these instruments a reasonable
medium-term bet.
As for the Mansion House speech, Mr Lamont desperately needs to increase his
credibility in the City. The onus will be on him to come up with something
in his address that throws fresh light on how he proposes to manage economic
policy in the next six months - assuming the chancellor manages to survive
that long after his less-than-sparkling performance since the summer.
He may discuss ways of making it easier to fund the PSBR by counting towards
this gilts sold to building societies and banks. Such institutions are at
liberty to buy the securities - they are expected to purchase about Pounds
6bn worth this financial year - but the purchases do not count towards
funding as this would represent an over-loose funding policy that could be
inflationary.
But as Mr Nigel Richardson, a bond expert at S. G. Warburg Securities,
points out, in the current environment in which deflationary risks appear
stronger than any threat from inflation, the move towards a different
funding policy might appear to have some logic.
Assuming a PSBR next year of around Pounds 40bn, the government might have
to be faced with selling Pounds 3bn worth of gilts a month to ensure it has
enough cash for public spending. While most of the funding needs for this
year appear to be met, the Bank of England announced on Friday a new Pounds
1bn tranche of gilts to be sold from today which may help towards funding
next year's borrowing requirement.
The gilts are in the form of a new type of stock, 7.25 per cent due in 1998.
The price will be 99.50, payable 25 per cent down and 74.5 per cent in
January next year. The Bank also announced the Treasury would redeem at par
all the 9 per cent Treasury loan 1992-1996 on January 28 next year for cash.

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Selsdon Man buried yet again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMEMBER Selsdon Man? He was the new, bone dry Tory model designed in the
1960s by Sir Keith Joseph, and originally personified by Sir Edward Heath.
He ran into a nasty economic recession, and was quietly buried.
Eight years later he was reincarnated, as a woman. Same story. Unexpectedly
deep recession, float the pound, dash for growth, inflation. Finally we got
the slimline Major version, whose batteries ran down in less than six
months. If this was purely a British story, one might simply conclude that
Selsdon Man was a fraud, and leave it there. But there is a significant
under-theme. Each time Britain suffered unforeseen recession, or dashed for
growth, it did so in good company.
In 1972, nearly all developed countries were on the same track; in the
mid-1980s, most of the English-speaking world; and this time, the biggest
economies. Naive people might be comforted to know that our 'new' policies
are so fashionable. (I suspect that Mr Major thinks like that.)
But any well-trained NCO knows that when you are all crossing a bridge, you
must break step. Apparently stable structures can be shaken to bits if
everyone moves at the same moment, so that each impact reinforces all the
rest. This analogy helps to explain why the recessions and the subsequent
inflations were so much worse than forecast.
Normally, a large part of the impact of any shift in domestic policy is
absorbed overseas, with little effect. Sometimes, indeed, domestic actions
seem to have no effect at all, and officials suffer nasty turns when they
may even doubt their own existence. (The British treasury is just trying to
get over this feeling, and told the House of Commons it could not influence
the whole economy only days before it agreed to have a try.) When economies
make the same move at the same time, it is another story. The effects of
change are not absorbed, but reinforced from abroad, so even modest actions
are liable to have surprising effects.
What our analogy fails to explain is why everyone moves in step in the first
place. There is no sergeant yelling 'LEFT, left, left-right-left]' But there
is fashion; and there is a bureaucracy which loves parade-ground discipline.
What the sergeant would call smartness, they call convergence.
In the 1960s these disciplinarians were to be found in the IMF. They noted
that cyclical divergences tended to produce current account deficits in
expanding countries and surpluses in sluggish ones. They had to finance
imbalances - which was what they were paid to do. However, they decided that
divergence was a Bad Thing, and tried to prevent it; with disastrous
success.
In the 1980s it was the fashion for deregulation which produced the
destruction in the English-speaking world. Europe might have been largely
immune, had it not been for the misguided effort to achieve economic
convergence. This was meant to open the road to monetary union, but what it
has achieved, quite predictably, is convergent deflation and monetary
disunion. Meanwhile, the US is showing that monetary union without
convergence works much better; some states in the US are in slump, with
others booming.
Will the third act in this tragi-comedy end like the first two, in
overheating and inflation? There is reason to hope that it won't, though not
through good management. The slump in banking confidence is so deep that
fiscal stimulus may work only haltingly; or better yet, it may work in some
countries but not in others. Some officials will be unable to carry out
misguided orders because others, the prudential supervisors of the banks and
thrifts, failed in theirs.
A final irony: all this nonsense has been perpetrated in the name of
trusting the markets. Yet in the event our rulers have trusted markets which
are inherently unstable, and need supervision, while they only fitfully
trust markets which are in the end self-stabilising. If Selsdon man had a
sense of humour (doubtful, this) he must be laughing in his grave.

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Borrowing surge hits fortunes of
sovereign issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURGE in borrowing needs of many European countries has caused a sharp
reversal of fortune for many sovereign Eurobonds in the secondary market.
But the widening of sovereign yield spreads in the secondary market may well
reflect a change in sentiment engendered by fears of supply, rather than any
fundamental changes in creditworthiness.
Some European countries face a sharp increase in immediate borrowing needs
in order to repay short-term debts incurred in the foreign exchange market.
Heavy intervention in the foreign exchange market in September, in an effort
to support their currencies, has also left some countries with severely
weakened foreign exchange reserves to be replenished.
The UK, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Spain and Italy are among the
European sovereign borrowers with increased funding needs. Some of these are
also struggling to cope with growing budget deficits caused by shrinking
receipts due to economic recession.
But these factors may not be enough to jeopardise the current credit ratings
of European sovereign borrowers.
'There is a tendency to view exchange rate pressure and domestic economic
problems as synonymous with declining credit quality,' says Mr Philip Bates,
head of Standard &amp; Poor's sovereign risk group. 'In many cases, these
problems do not directly affect countries' external indebtedness.'
The general view that European sovereigns are declining credits is not borne
out by a closer look at their creditworthiness, he argues.
Mr Bates points out that for foreign currency debt ratings, the emphasis is
on a country's external financial position. Credit analysts must consider to
what extent imbalances in the domestic economy are translating into
increases in the current account deficit.
In the case of the UK, for example, rumours of a possible downgrade of the
country's triple-A rated debt circulated widely last week, ahead of the UK's
record DM5bn Eurobond. In fact, there was never any question of downgrade,
says Mr Bates. 'The UK credit rating is not under any kind of threat.'
In addition, the UK's public finances are 'very strong' and although the
budget position has deteriorated, the UK still has 'a lot of financial
flexibility.'
Other countries seeking funds in the international capital markets are
actually improving credits. Denmark, after having its debt rating lowered
twice in the 1980s, has moved up to a AA+ credit with a stable outlook.
Ireland is another improving credit, having stepped up from A+ to AA-, after
reducing its budget deficit. Portugal has improved from A to A+, and Spain
is rated AA with a positive outlook, despite worries about the effect on
foreign investment of recently-imposed capital controls. Sweden, despite its
current financial crisis, still has a triple-A rating and has a declining
net external debt trend.
The two cases which are of more serious concern are Italy, currently rated
AA+ by S&amp;P, where the effectiveness of attempts to control the budget
deficit remains questionable, and Finland, which has experienced a surge in
net external debt to 150 per cent of exports.
Although spreads of sovereign debt have started to recover slightly, some
debt is still trading at very wide spreads, making further financing more
difficult.
For example, the yield spread of Finland's FFr4bn issue due 2003 has widened
from 41 basis points over the curve in July to 100 basis points. For
Finland, and also for Sweden, both considering tapping the French market,
this is likely to boost the cost of new issues.
Apart from the D-Mark bond market, the focus of sovereign borrowers'
attentions, the French market is considered one of few accessible markets,
and sovereign borrowers such as the UK and Denmark are also keeping an eye
on the sector.
In the dollar market, Italy's 8 3/4 per cent issue due 2001 has widened from
57 basis points over the yield curve in mid-September to 116 basis points,
while, Norway's 7 1/4 per cent issue due 1997 has widened from 44 to 54
basis points over the curve.
From a trader's point of view, steady credit ratings are only part of the
equation. Trading performance is affected by investors' perceptions of
economic and political risk, even where they have no specific impact on
ratings.

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: BBV posts fall of 19.8% to
Pta59bn in third term
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya, the Spanish bank, reported a 19.8 per cent fall in
third-quarter net income to Pta59bn (Dollars 551m) compared with the same
period last year due to a sharp drop in extraordinary items. The group
showed a slight improvement in its banking business.
The operating margin rose by 3.1 per cent after a 13.8 per cent increase in
other ordinary revenue, chiefly fee income. Operating profit was up 4.7 per
cent to Pta101bn. At the six-month stage, the operating margin had risen by
2.8 per cent and operating profit by 3.8 per cent.
BBV implemented stringent cost-cutting which led to a 4.4 decrease in
overheads and contained the rise of trading expenses to just 2.2 per cent.
The bank said that, in contrast to elsewhere in the banking sector, doubtful
debts had risen by 'only' 3 per cent over the nine months and that loans
were up by just 3.6 per cent due to the slack demand of solvent borrowers.
The third-quarter results came as BBV sold its interests in the Kesa and Kas
soft drinks producers to PepsiCo, realising capital gains of Pta7bn which
will be accounted in the fourth quarter.

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: Birmingham Post group at Pounds
3.47m after buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Independent Newspapers, publishers of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
will announce today that it made a healthy profit, despite the recession, in
its first report since the management buy-out from Ingersoll Newspapers.
In the six months to the end of June, the group which also publishes the
Coventry Evening Telegraph, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.47m.
Trading profits rose almost four times to Pounds 7.3m.
The Pounds 125m buy-out, with the support of Candover Investments and
CINVen, the venture capital group, was completed on November 14 last year.
The management team, led by Mr Chris Oakley, the chief executive, and Mr
John Whitehouse, finance director, were widely believed to have paid a full
price.
Despite the decline in recruitment and property advertising total
advertising revenue increased by 2.7 per cent, mainly through attracting new
business.
A trading profit for the group's dominant newspaper activities of Pounds
6.98m, compares with Pounds 1.72m. Return on turnover was 21.5 per cent at
the trading level and 10 per cent at the pre-tax.
Apart from attracting new business the main reason for the company's
strengthened position seems to have been a substantial reduction in
operating costs from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds 25.5m.
The new management team have been looking at every aspect of the company's
operation. The results have included a reorganisation of the press room and
drivers moving to contract employment.
Sir Norman Fowler, chairman, believes the company has made an impressive
start following the change of ownership.
Since the buy-out the company has acquired the Nuneaton Tribune and Hinckley
Journal titles and launched County, a new Country Life style magazine for
the counties of Warwickshire, Hereford and Worcestershire.
Trading profits of about Pounds 14m are expected for the full year.

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: ICI's trading casts shadow over
demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market has been hit by an attack of nerves about Imperial Chemical
Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer.
It fears poor trading could force the company, which reports its third
quarter results on Thursday, to postpone plans to split itself into two
separate groups.
The plan, which was greeted with enthusiasm by investors when it was
announced in July, involves dividing ICI's activities between two companies.
Pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and most of its specialities operations would
form one, ICI Bioscience, leaving the rest, including industrial chemicals,
paints, materials and explosives, in a new ICI.
But the difficult trading climate in the chemicals industry could put the
demerger plan on hold.
Analysts expect ICI to produce pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds
610m, down from Pounds 843m in 1991 and Pounds 1.53bn in the peak year of
1989. The shares, which closed at Pounds 11.71 on the day of the demerger's
announcement, slipped to Pounds 10.47 last week.
When ICI made its July announcement it included an opt-out clause. 'Any
decision would be taken in the light of market and other conditions
prevailing at the relevant time.'
Since then, two factors have changed. Trading conditions in the chemical
industry have deteriorated significantly and the performance of the
pharmaceuticals division, which contributed more than half of ICI's profits
last year, has been disappointing.
Some analysts are concerned that the new ICI might not be sufficiently
profitable in the present economic climate and could be liable to a
takeover.
Meanwhile, the poor performance of the divisions allocated to ICI Bioscience
have also cast a shadow.
The pharmaceuticals operations have been hit by the rapid decline of its
best-selling product, Tenormin, the heart drug. One analyst believes the
division's underlying growth is only 1 per cent at present.
This may undermine ICI's plans for ICI Bioscience to make a public offering
shortly after the split to reduce the old group's debts.
If the split and public offer are postponed, ICI's dividend could come under
scrutiny. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 610m this year would leave the group's
55p dividend barely covered by earnings per share of about 56p.
Most analysts argue a dividend cut is unlikely, for this year at least. The
balance sheet is strong enough to maintain the payment and they believe the
board would remember the market's violent reaction when it slashed the 1980
dividend. ICI would probably prefer to dip into reserves rather than make a
cut. But the decision will not be taken until February.
However, next year the board's position may be more difficult if the trading
position deteriorates further.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is expected to give some indication about the
split's prospects on Thursday. A final decision whether to go ahead will be
made next February.

undertakings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, has accepted
undertakings from AAH Holdings, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler, that it will
abide by 'protective measures' until the end of March 1993 to safeguard 'new
entry' into its market in the Grampian and Highland region of Scotland.
He had originally found that AAH's acquisition of the UK business of
Medicopharma, the Dutch pharmaceuticals wholesaler which withdrew from the
UK market in November 1991, had stifled competition in that region, though
not nationally. He had recommended that AAH divest the acquired warehouse in
Aberdeen.
However since Norscot Pharmaceuticals, the core of which is the management
of Medicopharma's Aberdeen branch, entered the mar-ket at the beginning of
April, Mr Heseltine has accepted that it is no longer necess-ary for AAH to
proceed with the divestment, merely with the protective meas-ures.
Mr George Berry, managing director of Norscot, said he was mildly surprised
by the decision, but not worried by it. In the Pounds 50m regional market,
Norscot was on schedule for about Pounds 15m turnover in its first year.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace of Germany is near a definitive agreement with the Dutch
government that would pull cash-strapped Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker,
out of financial difficulties, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
Sources said over the weekend that all the parties on Friday reached an
informal consensus over key terms for the transaction.
The definitive agreement for the takeover is understood to involve DASA
paying between Fl 35 and Fl 40 a share for the 10.6m Fokker shares held by
the government, and 13.2m shares it would buy directly from Fokker through a
private placement.
There were suggestions in European aerospace industry circles that DASA
would end up paying around Fl 37, well above Fokker's closing price of Fl
15.80 a share on the Amsterdam exchange on Friday.
At that price, the deal would be worth around Fl 880m (Dollars 510m); in
July, Fokker expected well over Fl 1bn.
The Dutch state owns nearly 32 per cent of the bourse-listed Fokker and has
around Fl 1.8bn of further exposure to the company via development credits
and loan guarantees.

property activities cease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
USBORNE, the pig breeder and grain merchanting company, returned to profits
in the six months to June 30 following its decision to withdraw from
property development.
On turnover of Pounds 101.2m (Pounds 90.6m) pre-tax profits were Pounds
833,000 compared with losses of Pounds 3.75m, which was struck after a
Pounds 4.4m provision on a development joint venture and losses of
discontinued businesses.
Mr Derek Sawyer, chairman, said that all the residential properties owned by
Usborne Developments had been sold and some letting of commercial properties
were being achieved in difficult circumstances. Overheads of Usborne
Developments were being cut to a minimum.
Earnings per share were 0.92p (losses 4.9p) and the interim dividend is
being doubled to 0.2p after having been cut from 0.5p the previous year.
Operating profits in grain merchanting improved to Pounds 755,000 compared
with Pounds 580,000 while pig production advanced to Pounds 430,000 against
Pounds 191,000.
Mr Sawyer said that withdrawal from the ERM should be helpful to agriculture
in the short term and he hoped that the violent swings in the pig market
experienced in previous cycles may be avoided this year.
The company has changed its year end to June 30. There will be a second
interim report for the period to December 31 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullers, the maker of giftware and decorative accessories, is expected to
need further new finance next year and is in danger of going into
receivership.
The warnings came from directors as they reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
3.33m for the 18 months to June 30, compared with losses of Pounds 4.77m in
the previous 12 months. Turnover was Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 12.8m).
They said that if the loan from Gamlestaden were not converted into
convertible preference shares, which is planned under the arrangements
announced earlier this month, the company might not be able to continue
trading.
Even if the conversion went ahead the directors were unable to state that
there was sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis but they were qualified
by the auditors as this might not be a proper basis.
Losses per share came out at 4.8p (12.72p).

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: Grupo Torras makes a little
history - The accounting problems of KIO's Spanish subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the next few days, Grupo Torras, the Spanish industrial holding
company wholly-owned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), will make a
little history by refusing to sign the 1991 accounts prepared by its
auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
It will be the biggest Spanish company ever to reject a set of accounts in
this way, and the gravity of the action is compounded by the fact that
Coopers has apparently reversed a Pta2.9bn (Dollars 26.4m) consolidated
profit reported by Torras to a loss, understood to be close to Pta37bn.
The KIO's lawyers have advised them not to sign off the accounts, arguing
that to do so would be construed as agreeing they are a true and fair
reflection of the company's behaviour.
That is something no one in the KIO headquarters in London or the Torras
offices in Madrid is prepared to bet on. The KIO's lawyers, Stephenson
Harwood, and its auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, are close to completing a
six-month investigation into claims by new managers at KIO and Torras that
the Dollars 4bn in cash put into Spanish investments by the KIO since the
mid-1980s has been wasted and lost.
Until last spring, the KIO had been run directly by members of Kuwait's
ruling Al-Sabah family. Its new managers, strengthened by the scale of
opposition to the Al-Sabahs in Kuwait's recent election, have begun to turn
on the heat in their efforts to discover what went wrong in Spain.
Their conviction that something has gone wrong has been strongly supported
by a three-month investigation into the future of the Spanish business by
Salomon Brothers.
'At June 30 1992,' Salomon says, 'Grupo Torras had a negative net worth of
Pta51.3bn. If we capitalise all the loans (to Torras) outstanding from KIO .
. . this figure would become a positive Pta5.99bn. If we further adjust for
present valuations of the companies (in the Torras portfolio), it goes to a
negative net worth of Pta58.06bn.'
What irritates the new KIO management is that the money the KIO invests is
from the Kuwaiti Fund for Future Generations, a sort of national pension.
Last November, Peat Marwick reported that Dollars 2.7bn in cash has been
invested in Spain. A further Dollars 1.2bn has been transferred from KIO to
Spain this year. What, they ask, has happened to the money?
Grupo Torras is a complicated animal. Salomon says 'it can be likened to the
conglomerates popular in the 1960s, when it was believed that financial and
management acumen could bring additional benefits to this type of
organisation (an industrial holding) - however, this was rarely proven to be
the case'.
But it was also Salomon Brothers who, in November 1988, designed the
flotation of Grupo Torras, praising it as 'a strongly profitable holding
company with pan-European ambitions'. Torras, the investment bank said then,
had carried out a diversification programme 'with timely acquisitions in
some of the fastest-growing sectors of the Spanish economy'.
Curiously, Torras is not following a Salomon recommendation that it find a
partner for the holding company itself. 'If KIO cannot find a suitable
partner who can . . . progressively take control of the investment, over
time the group should be eliminated and as each individual strategy for the
subsidiaries is adapted, the investments should be passed to other KIO
entities,' the report says.
But the past will not go away. Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Catalan financier
who teamed up with the former KIO management to build up Torras, has an 18
per cent stake in Ercros which he says he was merely holding for Torras.
Torras refuses to recognise this. Also, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the former KIO
managing director who led the expansion in Spain, and a US property
developer hold passive stakes in Prima which Torras is also refusing to
recognise.
The distrust between the old KIO management and Mr De la Rosa, and the new
KIO-Torras team, is considerable. The KIO was astonished to find a contract
signed in February 1990 between Torras and Mr De la Rosa's investment
company, Quail Espana, giving Quail control of the management of Torras,
plus commissions on business done by Quail on Torras' behalf and a Dollars
50m termination fee.
But this contract was just a renewal of an almost identical one signed in
June 1987, with the support of the KIO's long-standing chairman, now
retired, Sheikh Fahad Al-Sabah.
Mr De la Rosa says Quail had made about Dollars 120m in commissions from
Torras since 1987 but passed the bulk of these on to third parties it had
contracted. 'I have nothing to hide,' he says. 'We kept between Dollars 30m
and Dollars 40m and it was all declared.'
Whether the KIO investigation will be able to turn the suspicion that
something offensive happened to its money in Spain into fact is a moot
point.
Highly-geared developments by Prima and the Dollars 1bn investment in a
producer of commodity chemicals like Ercros were ill-judged, but will that
satisfy the Kuwaiti politicians demanding answers to the Spain debacle?

exchange debut

<TEXT>
FINMECCANICA, the Italian state-owned aerospace and engineering holding
company which is part of the IRI group, will today make its stock exchange
debut following the reverse takeover of Sifa, a quoted financial holding
company already under its control.
The transaction by Finmeccanica, which also controls the quoted Alenia
aerospace and Ansaldo Trasporti engineering companies, was originally to
have been the prelude to a multi-stage capital increase of up to L1,700bn
(Dollars 785m).
However, the plans have been thrown into confusion by the financial problems
of IRI, struggling to reduce its heavy debt burden and probably reluctant to
put up the L493bn required.
Private investors would also have been offered a stake in Finmeccanica at a
later stage through a L999bn convertible bond with warrants to buy shares.
However, changes in tax law have made the bond issue less advantageous,
while investor interest in Italian equity issues has been tempered by the
poor performance of the bourse.
The incorporation of Sifa, which has interests in equity trading and
property, has sharply improved Finmeccanica's financial position. Sifa is
thought to have had about L350bn in liquidity, while subsequent property
sales have pushed the total to around L800bn, bankers say.
Last week, the Italian government announced the loss-making aerospace and
defence interests of Efim, the state holding company in liquidation, would
be transferred to IRI on a management basis, pending a sale.
Bankers expect the two main companies concerned, Agusta in helicopters and
Oto Melara in missiles, to be run by Finmeccanica, possibly as a prelude to
an outright takeover once they are restructured.
However, it is unclear whether the additional funds available through the
merger with Sifa will spur Finmeccanica, which has grown through
acquisitions.
Last year, it reported a L525bn loss after meeting a European Commision
requirement to repay IRI L615bn in respect of aid to the Alfa Romeo cars
group, which it used to own. Group sales amounted to L10,966bn.
Although the government has said it will take on Agusta's and Oto Melara's
debts, Finmeccanica is expected to seek tight guarantees on future order
levels and employment before agreeing to buy the two outright.

Asahi has sold 88m shares, reducing its stake in Foster's, the world's

Foster's is raising some ADollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) by issuing two new

Asahi obtained a 20 per cent stake in the Australian brewer in 1990. It had
expressed interest in increasing its stake, but had decided to sell its

The company faces a cash-flow squeeze due to increases in interest payments
on bank borrowings and straight bonds.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, is to lose its
chief executive designate, Mr Tony Edwards, to the rival TI Group.
Mr Edwards, who was made group managing director in February, lost the
support of his directors after a power-struggle with Sir Anthony Gill,
chairman and chief executive.
A recent board meeting decided not to appoint Mr Edwards to the top job and
instead asked Sir Anthony to remain as chief executive for a least another
year and as chairman until the end of 1994.
Sir Anthony said: 'It is disappointing Mr Edwards did not establish himself
as a suitable successor to me. It became clear in late August that it was
not going to work.'
He has approached somebody to replace Mr Edwards and an announcement is
expected shortly.
Mr Edwards' resignation is the second to hit Lucas in a year. In March, Mr
David Hankinson, then finance director, unexpectedly resigned after losing
key boardroom decisions.
Mr Edwards had been credited by analysts with transforming Lucas Aerospace
from three nationally-based companies into a leading player in Europe's
aerospace components sector.
However, Sir Anthony said Lucas Aerospace was already a leading player in
Europe when Mr Edwards took charge. 'To credit Mr Edwards with transforming
the aerospace division is not true. It recently reported the lowest
operating profits for seven years, he said.'
Sir Anthony said he received a letter from Mr Edwards on Thursday telling
him he intended to join the TI Group by December.
Lucas recently announced a three-year restructuring programme involving
4,000 job cuts and the sale of companies not central to its aerospace and
automotive business.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 22.5m (Dollars 36.7m) in the year to July
from Pounds 82.8m a year ago. A net loss of Pounds 8.8m compared with a net
profit of Pounds 49.4m last time.
TI Group will contribute to Dowty's pension fund after a winding-up
valuation by the actuary showed a possible shortfall of about Pounds 11m.
Dowty, taken over by TI Group in June, ceased contributions to the pension
fund earlier this year.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Salomon urges KIO to find partner
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) has no legal obligation to support its
troubled industrial holdings in Spain, according to a report to the KIO by
Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank.
The KIO has since acted on the report, opting for a form of restructuring
for its Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, but ignoring a central
suggestion that it should bring in a part-er for Torras, or liquidate it.
Salomon said that 'considering that KIO is not a management company . . . if
KIO is unable to find a suitable partner who can progressively take control
. . . over time the group should be eliminated.'
The report is one of a series of investigations initiated by the new
management at the KIO in an increasingly acrimonious effort to discover how
Dollars 4bn invested by the KIO in Spain since the mid-1980s was managed by
their predecessors.
Salomon said that at June 30 this year, Grupo Torras had a negative net
worth of Pta58.06bn (Dollars 430.3m). The report outlined three possible
strategies for Torras: Bankruptcy and receivership, which would cost the KIO
Pta70bn;
Maintaining the group (except Ercros chemicals and Bures textiles) which
would cost Pta163bn in new cash and Pta153bn in loan conversions;
Restructuring, under which Bures and the Prima property group would receive
no support and some smaller companies would be sold. This would cost
Pta116bn in new cash and loan conversions of Pta151bn.
Torras has opted for the third strategy. Although it is ignoring Salomon's
advice to find a partner for the holding company, Torras is looking for
partners for Torraspapel, a paper company, and the Ebro foods group.
Debt to KIO is being converted into equity and about Pta40bn is being pumped
into Torraspapel.
Salomon Brothers said it was clear that 'in many instances very high prices
were paid for the acquisition of the businesses (in the Torras portfolio) -
such that economic returns were probably never possible in these cases.'
Prima 'cannot continue to operate in its present form because it is
financially insolvent and has no net worth.' Details, Page 14

FT  26 OCT 92 / Economics Notebook: Japan learns lessons from a burst bubble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Noboru Hatakeyama, the vice-minister at Japan's Ministry for
International Trade and Industry, summed up the lessons Tokyo's economic
mandarins needed to draw from the rise and fall of the bubble economy -
discipline.
He said: 'We became over-confident, too bullish. We should learn not to
become too pleased with ourselves. The Japanese are a very disciplined
people, but they became intoxicated by the bubble and they somehow forgot
their discipline.'
The bubble is still deflating more than two years after it was punctured.
The authorities are still learning as they take in the scale of the mess.
This week Bank of Japan managers from branches around the country will
discuss the economy. Many analysts believe this could be a precursor to a
further cut in interest rates.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Finance will disclose its estimate of the bank's
non-performing loans, expected to have risen from about Y8,000bn in March to
about Y12,000bn (Dollars 98.8bn) at the end of September.
In the past six months Japan's economic policy consensus has moved from
complacency to concern. However, few would share the prognosis offered in
Tokyo 10 days ago by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve
Board. He said the US and Japan were facing a kind of downturn unknown since
1945.
Mr Greenspan calls it 'the balance sheet problem' as companies and consumers
divert spending away from goods and services to reduce debts and rebuild
assets. But the Japanese economy's balance sheet suggests Tokyo policy
makers have reason to be optimistic.
Japanese banks are still uncovering financial black holes created through
excessive property lending in the late 1980s. Filling in the holes will take
years. There will be more bank mergers, rescues and even failures among
smaller institutions.
But it seems unlikely there will be any crisis to compare with the Savings
and Loans fiasco in the US.
Japanese manufacturers are in better shape than their dismal profits over
the past three years suggest. They are not overburdened by debt and most
have deep cash reserves.
During the bubble they invested in plant and equipment, whereas in the US
more of the boom went into consumption.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, the bedrock of employment in Japan, are
hurting. They have lower cash reserves than large companies and are more
dependent on the banks which are squeezing credit at a local level.
But Japan is better placed to avoid a bank squeeze on small companies than
the US was. The vast, semi-public sector, postal savings system - the Fiscal
Investment and Loan Programme - should provide small business funding when
banks withdraw credit.
The Japanese public and personal sectors are in better shape than their US
counterparts. In the US, the private sector financial profligacy of the late
1980s followed public sector fiscal profligacy. The US is so burdened by its
federal deficit that monetary policy is the only lever of economic policy.
Japanese public finances were strictly controlled in the 1980s, allowing the
government to use fiscal and monetary policy to revive the economy. Japanese
households similarly are less indebted than their US equivalents.
However, confidence that Japan can avoid the US's struggle to resuscitate
the economy does not rule out important changes in policy. The bubble's
burst has already prompted reassessment of economic policy on four counts:
The movement of asset prices will loom larger. Economic bureaucrats are
determined the asset boom should not be repeated, which could have
consequences for investment in land and stocks. For 30 years, Japanese
corporations have invested spare cash in land on the assumption it would
rise in value. Land prices in the 1990s may rise more slowly than the rate
of growth of the economy, forcing widespread reassessment of investment
practices;
Domestic considerations will become more important than international
concerns. The Japanese boom was partly created to satisfy US demands for
faster growth to reduce the Japanese trade surplus. In the wake of the 1987
stock market crash, the Japanese were also concerned that tighter monetary
policy might risk a widespread financial crisis.
Tokyo policymakers in part blame the bubble on bending over too far to
satisfy foreign demands. As a result there is no appetite in Tokyo for
international moves to manage the dollar or promote growth. It will be more
difficult to persuade Japan to enter the kinds of economic agreements such
as the Plaza and Louvre Accords of the mid-1980s;
Policy will increasingly focus on creating medium-term stability. As Dr
Yoshio Susuki, chief counsellor at the Nomura Research Institute put it: 'We
were involved too much in short-term co-ordination rather than medium-term
management. The most important contribution we can make to the international
economy is to run an autonomous policy, but one dedicated to stable growth;'
Japanese policymakers, traditionally focused on manufacturing and
investment, will now have to be concerned with the financial system as well.
Mr Shijuro Ogata, senior adviser to Yamaichi Securities, said: 'Policy was
too slow to tighten in the late-1980s and too slow to ease in the past year
because policymakers were used to just looking at the real economy rather
than the financial system.'
Ministry of Finance officials remain committed to liberalisation of the
finance sector. But over the next few years the state will be so involved in
helping the banks sort out their difficulties that re-regulation through the
backdoor cannot be ruled out.
Turning the economy around will be more complex than in previous recessions.
Discipline will play its part but more than that will be required to pull
the economy off the bottom.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Italy's banks begin to breaktheir bonds: The promise of
privatisation is nurturing bigger, more efficient groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHDRAW money from an Italian bank machine, and your account will be
debited the day before the transaction took place. Make a deposit, and,
until recently, you would not be credited until tomorrow.
Restrictive practices, inefficiency and poor service are the hallmarks of
Italian banking, which has been slower to reform than any other in Europe.
Generous margins between interest rates for loans and deposits have
cushioned banks from overmanning and poor management, while public-sector
ownership has allowed many to operate in a vacuum from free market
competition.
Now privatisation, a priority for the Amato government, promises to release
banks from the bonds of politicians, who have sometimes fostered cronyism
and uncommercial lending. Also, more liberal policies towards takeovers and
branch expansion by the Bank of Italy are nurturing fewer, bigger and more
efficient banks.
The past year has seen the emergence of two big banking groups in Rome and
Turin, with early signs of a third in Milan.
Banca di Roma, Italy's biggest bank in terms of branches, was formed in
August from the merger of Banco di Roma with Banco di Santo Spirito. The
latter had already been bought by the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, the Rome
savings bank, whose managing director, Mr Cesare Geronzi, is a leading
reformer.
In Turin, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino became Italy's largest bank
in terms of assets last year with the L2,100bn (Dollars 1.57bn) acquisition
of a 50 per cent stake in Crediop, the Treasury-owned long-term lending
institution, in which it already had a 40 per cent holding.
A third big banking force could take shape should Cariplo, Italy's biggest
savings bank, succeed in buying a large slice of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano
(IMI), the big, Treasury-controlled investment and financial services group.
Though blocked for more than a year by party political differences, the
Amato government's need for privatisation income should push the deal ahead.
A fourth big financial services group could be formed around Credito
Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank, controlled by the IRI state holding
company and soon to be privatised. Among potential buyers is Generali,
Italy's biggest and most liquid insurance group, which last year raised
L1,750bn from shareholders for future acquisitions. Buying Credito Italiano
would combine its pre-eminence in insurance with a leading role in finance,
Privatisation is forcing the pace of change. The sale of Credito Italiano is
the boldest step in a gradual process which began with the L1,250bn
flotation in January of an opening 20 per cent stake in San Paolo. Private
shareholders have also gained greater representation in Banca di Roma via a
complex convertible bond issued by Banco di Santo Spirito when it merged
with the Rome savings bank.
Privatisation should make the banks more responsive to the market, and also
provide funds for the expansion possible under more liberal branching rules.
Credito Italiano's network has risen by 150 branches to more than 720 in the
past three years, San Paolo plans to open 80 branches this year. But none of
Italy's big banks has the nationwide coverage offered by their French or UK
counterparts.
Extra funds will help the big banks taking shape to expand abroad. So far,
only San Paolo, and, to a lesser extent, Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI),
have sizeable foreign operations.
Greater size will help banks fight off competition from foreign rivals at
home under the European Community's liberalised banking rules. So far, the
expected push by foreign banks into Italy, lured by fat margins, has been
limited by the scarcity of takeover candidates and high prices for the banks
on offer. Only Deutsche Bank, which owns the 130-branch Banca d'America e
d'Italia, and Credit Lyonnais, which controls the 145-branch Credito
Bergamasco, are present in force.
But the foreigners want to grow. Credit Agricole, the big French bank and
one of five members of the shareholders' pact controlling Banco Ambrosiano
Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's largest private-sector bank, looks poised to
raise its presence.
With two Ambroveneto shareholders planning to sell out, the French would
like to double their holding to 25 per cent, subject to approval from the
central bank and Ambroveneto's chairman. That may be a cautious step towards
an eventual bid, required for any shareholder exceeding 29 per cent.
Two, very different, institutions, have been left isolated. BCI, once
Italy's most prestigious bank on the basis of size and international
representation, has been eclipsed by newcomers like San Paolo and Banca di
Roma.
It was widely expected that BCI, rather than Credito Italiano, would top the
government's privatisation list. The fact that its fate remains unsettled
has spurred speculation that it may be destined for a politically ordained
merger with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the big, but disgraced,
Treasury-owned bank implicated in improper lending to Iraq.
Publicly, BCI's management views a merger as anathema. In private, however,
executives are not loath to a deal, subject to guarantees they will be in
charge and further skeletons in BNL's cupboard will be the government's
responsibility.
The rationalisation leaves Banco di Napoli, Banco di Sicilia and Banco di
Sardegna, three publicly owned banks from southern Italy, in search of
partners. And Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, until recently the biggest
private-sector bank, faces an uphill task preserving its independence on the
back of poor profits and management.
Rationalisation will be required among provincial savings banks. Some have
joined forces, while others have brought in outside shareholders, often the
big banks. But the pace must be accelerated if Italy is to gain a banking
sector commensurate with its industrial base.

FT  26 OCT 92 / UK stock market flotations fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC uncertainty and the crisis of confidence in government policy have
cut the number of companies floating on the UK stock market.
However, small, growing companies are increasingly likely to raise capital
through flotations, said KPMG Peat Marwick, the international management
consultancy.
Only 20 companies floated in the third quarter of 1992, down from 28 in the
same period last year. So far this year there have been 52 flotations,
compared with 91 in the whole of 1991 and 203 in 1986, the peak year.
This trend could reverse as the economy moves out of recession. Companies
needing to raise funds to expand would be increasingly attracted to the
stock market, according to Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG.
Banks, a traditional source of such funds, have become nervous about
lending, especially as the value of assets, which provide security for
loans, has fallen.
The banks are cutting the amount they will lend on assets and are more
reluctant to use a borrower's inventory as collateral than they were three
years ago.
More flotations are expected as backers of the late-1980s management
buy-outs seek an exit. Managers of those companies prefer a float to a trade
sale to retain independence.
The forecast increase in small company flotations comes when brokers are
ceasing to make markets in smaller stocks.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Clinton's lead over Bush dips sharply: Increased support for
Perot is main factor in narrowing of gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton's prev-iously commanding lead in the US presidential
election has dropped sharply over the past week, according to polls released
yesterday.
A resurgence of support for Mr Ross Perot, the maverick independent
candidate, is the main factor behind Mr Clinton's decline, which has
considerably narrowed the gap between the Arkansas governor and President
George Bush, the two principal candidates.
Mr Perot's impact on the contest varied from poll to poll, but most showed
Mr Clinton's lead over Mr Bush dropping to single figures, the first time it
has appeared so consistently nar-row since before the Democratic party
convention in July.
On average, polling data showed Mr Clinton's support at around 41 per cent,
with Mr Bush at around 32 per cent and Mr Perot at around 18 per cent. A
week ago, Mr Clinton led Mr Bush by an average of 18 points.
The spirits of the Bush campaign were rekindled by one poll, conducted by
CBS and the New York Times, which showed the president just 5 percentage
points behind Mr Clinton.
Mr Perot has gained ground steadily since the three televised debates. This
has caused mounting anxiety in the Clinton camp.
However, Mr Mickey Kantor, campaign chairman, said yesterday he saw 'some
kind of lid on Ross Perot's vote', and Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said the Clinton campaign was not worried by
the latest polls.
Mr Bush has appeared revitalised since the last debate, in which he gave his
most spirited definition so far of his differences with Mr Clinton.
He flew yesterday to Michigan, South Dakota and Montana. Campaign officials
said he will not spend another night in Washington until the election on
November 3.
Yet Mr Clinton still holds a commanding lead in state by state polls, a far
more significant indicator of the outcome of the balloting because of the US
electoral college system, in which almost all states allot their votes on a
winner takes all system.
State polls compiled last week by Hotline, a Washington newsletter, showed
the Democrat ahead by more than the poll's margin of error in 24 states,
including electoral college heavyweights such as California, New York,
Illinois and Pennsylvania. That would be enough to give him a comfortable
victory.
But Mr Robert Teeter, the Bush campaign chairman, said yesterday his polls
showed the president ahead in 12 to 14 states.
Mr Perot yesterday made his first official campaign appearance, in
Flemington, New Jersey, since re-entering the presidential race.
He also threw one of his customary hand grenades into the ring, saying he
had suspended his campaign in July because of a Republican party 'dirty
tricks' plan to disrupt his daughter's wedding and bug his Dallas office.
A Bush campaign spokesman described the story as 'total and complete
nonsense'.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Russian government may hold referendum in fight for power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government, under pressure from an increasingly confident
opposition, fought at the weekend to retain its grip on power and its
command of the faltering process of economic reform.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister for foreign economic affairs,
said a referendum on a new constitution might be held soon to circumvent the
Congress of People's Deputies - the full Russian legislature which is
expected to vote down the government, and perhaps even President Boris
Yeltsin, when it convenes on December 1.
He said that holding a referendum on a constitution to replace the
Soviet-era constitution which still serves as a legal basis for the state of
Russia would 'leave the Congress as a temporary body without real weight'.
Nationalists and communists united at the weekend under the name of the
National Salvation Front to 'save the fatherland' from a 'government of
occupation leading the country to civil war'.
Under the crossed banners of the Soviet Union and the Tsarist government,
1,500 delegates to a founding convention gave ovations to a list of
prominent opponents of the government, whose most devastating argument was
their recitation of the fall in living standards.
The participants made it clear that they were readying themselves for a
bitter struggle, including a series of demonstrations and strikes in the
run-up to the Congress meeting.
Colonel Vadislyav Terekhov, leader of the Russian Officers' Union, hinted at
the use of force, though most speakers said they would use constitutional
means, at least for now.
The Front, ranging from once democratic groups to near extremists of left
and right, is distinct from the 'centrist' opposition grouped round General
Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice president, and Mr Arkady Volsky, the
powerful industrialists' leader.
The hardliners are demanding Mr Yeltsin's resignation, whereas the centrists
want the resignation of the six to eight ministers who are the most
prominent economic reformers in the cabinet, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar,
Russia's acting prime minister.
Mr Gaidar, with Mr Shokhin and other ministers, met top industrialists in
the industrial city of Togliatti yesterday in an effort to open direct links
between the government and the most powerful figures of the centrist
opposition. The ministers promised a consultative council and tax breaks,
and in return a number of managers spoke in tones of measured support for
reform.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Up to 150,000 join London rally to protest against pit
closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 150,000 protesters marched through the capital in driving rain to
London's Hyde Park yesterday to hear speakers from across the political
spectrum call for a national crusade to halt threatened pit closures.
Central London was jammed for several hours as the public marched alongside
miners, politicians and trade unionists. The police estimated that 150,000
took part; the Trades Union Congress put the figure at 200,000.
In a scathing personal attack, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told the
rally that Mr John Major should 'protect the national interest and start to
be a prime minister'. He urged him to 'go down the pits you want to shut and
look at the investment . . . which would be written off if this decision
goes ahead.
'Speak to the miners whose skills are unique and irreplaceable, and above
all visit their families and think of what will happen to them if your plans
go ahead,' he added, to loud cheers.
The rally was an effort by the TUC to sustain popular momentum against the
government's attempt last week to close more than half of Britain's pits,
which it was forced to shelve pending a three-month review to stave off a
near certain defeat in the House of Commons.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, appealed
to the country not to 'leave us isolated in this struggle'. He urged the TUC
to 'take on board' the NUM's call for 'a national day of action' against the
closures. 'I want demonstrations like this in every town and city throughout
Britain until this government changes its policy and withdraws its threat to
close pits and sack miners,' he told the rally.
Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, made any
reference to the possibility of a day of action in their speeches. Mr Smith
simply pledged Labour to 'fight for Britain's interest'.
Mr Willis stressed the necessity of sustaining cross-party opposition to the
closures.
'We must form new alliances. We either learn to live together as sisters and
brothers, or we shall perish together as fools,' he said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, condemned the government's
'callous indifference' to the plight of the miners, and said the 'real
heroes and heroines' of the last week were those who marched and spoke up
for the miners.
'They have given us the time to save 100,000 jobs, and they have done
something which no opposition politician has done in 13 years - got the
government to change its mind,' he said.
The rally was good humoured and the speeches were interspersed by a brass
band and a male voice choir. Most of the banners were from the NUM. The
Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from the NUM during the
1984 miners' strike, was barely in evidence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems matters are coming to a head in the beleaguered middle ground of UK
supermarkets. Trading conditions in the overall market seem to have
deteriorated. And there are signs that the long and sorry story of the
Gateway buy-out is reaching its climax. Mr Bob Willett, Gateway's chief
executive and architect of the company's trading strategy, left the company
last week. That may be a signal that the backers of the buy-out vehicle
Isosceles have lost whatever faith they had left in the company's ability to
trade its way from negative net worth to flotation.
However, if the bankers do want to crystalise any loss, their options are
limited. The big three superstore groups, Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco are
unlikely to be interested in much, if any, of Gateway's store portfolio. The
smaller fry, Asda and Budgens, are in no position to buy. Among the
discounters Kwik Save might be interested in some stores at bargain basement
prices, but Aldi may not. Many of Gateway's sites are in less than perfect
locations. Unless planning permission becomes harder to obtain, other groups
may prefer to expand by developing new sites with better amenities.
Asda, the other mid-market operator which has been savaged by both the
downmarket discounters and upmarket superstores, is in better shape. It at
least has a new management, the kernel of a strategy and a coherent set of
shops. But it is still struggling to differentiate itself, and the pressure
will intensify. In the long run it may be forced to retreat to its northern
stronghold if it is to survive.

FT  26 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor old British Steel. Having struggled for so long against subsidised
European competitors, it must have thought last month's devaluation would
provide a real break. Unfortunately the losses announced last week by Usinor
Sacilor and production cutbacks at Thyssen Stahl are a rude reminder of how
weak the continental market remains. Not only is the German car industry
turning down; western Europe has been flooded by cheap imports from the
east, and Italian producers, whose currency has also been devalued, are
continuing to offer heavy discounts.
Some excess European capacity is at least being cut back, but market
weakness more or less offsets the devaluation benefits to British Steel.
True, it would stand to gain if the European Commission were to erect
Community-wide import barriers against eastern Europe. But so far the
Commission has simply allowed bilateral restraints against Czechoslovakian
steel to be imposed by France, Germany and Italy. That leaves British Steel
out in the cold, as would any increase in the rate of subsidy allowed to
continental producers.
Against this background it would be rash to assume that British Steel can
automatically maintain its 4.5p dividend for the current year. The payment
was already cut from 8.75p in 1991-92 after the company declared a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 55m and moved from a net cash position of Pounds 353m to net
debt of Pounds 11m. Its operational gearing is considerable, but higher
volume will depend on a recovery which seems to be growing more elusive. The
historic yield of slightly under 10 per cent leaves the shares looking
expensive.

Year on year UK dividends fell in nominal terms in August and September  -
the first time this has happened since 1967. But the full impact will not be
felt by shareholders in income-minded investment trusts for up to 12 months.
Because of the time-lag many trust boards are still able to declare or
forecast increased payouts of 4 to 5 per cent for this year.
The point is significant in view of the opportunistic way leading investment
managers used the lure of a high yield - allied to the attractions of
Personal Equity Plans - to raise new money from investors. Faced with the
grim outlook for dividends, moreover, one can assume that all income trusts
are now seeking ways of softening the blow when it comes. An obvious trick
is to switch the underlying trust portfolio into higher yielding stocks,
assuming greater risk and narrowing the scope for future income growth in
the process. County NatWest's latest investment trust annual notes that half
the 76 trusts surveyed already have a year-end portfolio yield which could
only be marginally increased without reducing portfolio quality.
Revenue reserves are a useful weapon, especially for the bigger and older
trusts - and will certainly be drawn on - though these reserves are not what
they were 10 years ago. There are other expedients such as accounting on a
cash rather than an ex-dividend basis - thus producing a one-off uplift in
earnings - and charging part of management expenses to the capital rather
than the revenue account. There is no point in pretending, however, that any
of this enhances shareholder value.

FT  26 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Clinton's drug test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Clinton's plans for reducing government spending on healthcare have
spooked the US stock market. Pharmaceutical companies have notably
underperformed since the market started thinking seriously about the chances
of a Democratic victory. Judging by the shaky performance of Glaxo,
SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome shares in London last week, the condition is
contagious. The market may be wrong, though, to make the snap judgement that
a new deal on health will be universally bad for the sector.
True, the pharmaceuticals industry made full use of its freedom to raise
prices in the world's largest drug market during the 1980s. By restricting
price rises to the rate of inflation, President Clinton would lower earnings
growth for the sector over the coming decade. But a cost-conscious
government may also realise that innovative drugs save money by keeping
patients at work and out of hospital. Companies which deliver such products
will hold strong cards.
Companies with a weak product range and little volume sales growth are at
greater risk of squeeze. Just as rising asset prices supported inefficient
banks, drug price inflation has disguised a multitude of weaknesses in the
pharmaceutical sector. Companies with strong new drugs and volume sales
growth are already exercising voluntary restraint on prices. For second-rate
players, though, the cost of failure looks likely to rise.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Implications of floating exchange rate on Bank of
England independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is some years since I have been able to agree wholeheartedly with a
leader in the Financial Times. It is a pleasure to say that I find virtually
nothing to quarrel with in 'A new policy framework' (October 21) - except
that it is a few years late.
In addition to a 'thorough investigation into the decisions associated with
the UK's membership of the ERM', I believe it is important to examine the
decisions from 1985 and particularly from 1987 when Nigel (now Lord) Lawson
pitched Britain into the ERM in all but name.
Many, myself included, have suggested that the Bank of England be given more
or less complete independence in conducting monetary policy rather than
serve merely as adviser to the Treasury. But if we are still en route to
Maastricht, as the prime minister says, and we do not invoke the opt-out
provision, then the Bank will be merely an operating arm of the European
Central Bank with no independence at all.
If, on the other hand, we rejoin the ERM, whether we opt out or not, then
again it is difficult to see what independence the Bank can have under such
a closely pegged, even fixed, exchange rate regime.
Only if we continue to float can a Bank of England have real responsibility
for monetary policy. The notable examples of independent central banks which
you mention, the US and Germany, have floating exchange rates. So the Fed
and Bundesbank can pursue monetary policies suitable for their own domestic
conditions.
Because of the possibility of breakdown on both Maastricht and the ERM as we
know it, and because it is possible that Britain will have a floating rate
regime, I think it is wise to consider the implications in terms of an
independent Bank.

<TEXT>
Sir, Could you not have slipped a sample of snake oil inside your issue of
October 22, as glossy magazines do with perfume? I needed something for my
own depression after reading Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint. Whatever
happened to supply-side policies? Not in the limited sense of freeing-up
markets,but policies directed towards potential output.
Investments in human capital, in environmental, transport and social
infrastructure, all contribute to a greater capacity to produce at lower
cost. Most of these activities could usefully employ those who would
otherwise remain permanently unemployed; and provide the demand impetus
needed, with the insurance that not all the proceeds can be frittered away
in the short term. And no, the market will not provide all the long-term
infrastructure investment our society needs, precisely because the benefits
accrue more widely than to today's business investors alone.

Buccaneering Italian businessman Raul Gardini will have to search the seven
seas for a new sponsor for his yachting ambitions - unless his Ferruzzi
heiress wife chips in the Pounds 232.6m she pocketed last year on his
'divorce' from the Ferruzzi-Montedison agro-industrial group.
Since his Montedison-sponsored America's Cup yacht Il Moro di Venezia was
pipped at the post by millionaire Bill Koch, Gardini has stayed bubbling on
the surface of Italian business with takeovers of well-known mineral water
brands. But although 'Sir Raul' would like to recoup his hero status by
sailing for the cup again, Montedison has mutinied.
On top of the Pounds 61m it sunk into his previous attempt, the group lost
approaching Pounds 87m in its first half and has decided to pull the plug on
its much publicised but ruinously expensive sponsoring of sports.
Another of them to be ditched is basketball, the passion of Gardini's
22-year old son Ivan, who was briefly chairman of Ferruzzi's main holding
company.

When it comes to bringing the best out of politicians, few can surely
compare with a small dog saved from drowning in the Thames by former
Conservative MP Matthew Parris, now earning his keep with the pen.
Having made the rescue in his days as an aspiring Tory candidate, he was
delighted when Baroness Thatcher, then his party's leader, agreed to
publicise his deed by joining him and the dog and its young owners for a
photo-call on Westminster Bridge.
As a result, he discovered one of his leader's prime characteristics as a
top politician - one which some readers may think her successors share.
'For the little dog, named Jason, attempted to mate with Mrs Thatcher's
leg,' Parris told the Market Research Society's annual dinner. 'Yet she
continued to smile, pose and shake hands . . . .
'It was then I saw her ability to pretend nothing was happening on top when
everything was going wrong down below.'

Who says British manufacturing industry is on its last legs? A Corby company
has just launched a cunning piece of world-beating technology to ensure that
sandwiches are accurately cut into neat diamond shapes time and time again.
Whatever their filling, the Pounds 12,500 machine shepherds them along at
rates up to 3,600 a minute, and aligns them at the precise angle to allow
them to be cut from corner to corner.
As a result, Rutland Handling &amp; Packaging Systems expects to make a meal out
of the UK sandwich market which is estimated to be worth Pounds 1.7bn a
year.
For one thing, the development reduces wastage caused by 'poor sandwich
alignment' - which at as much as 2 per cent of the materials involved, can
eat volume producers' profits away. For another, it should go down well with
big retailers such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer which spurn sarnies of
improper cut.
The company also hopes to add more than a crust to Britain's balance of
payments by exporting its machines. So far enquiries have rolled in from
Sweden, Germany, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia to name but a few.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Energy policy - needs of electricity customers and
coal priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr COLIN HASLAM and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the privatised electricity companies are left free to build all the
planned CCGT gas stations then the power station demand for coal will be
much reduced within a few years. Public discussion has so far focused on
whether this reduction in the size of the coal industry is justifiable or
represents a coherent energy policy.
There has been no discussion about the implications of much reduced power
station demand for coal; the implications for the shape of the coal
industry; the balance between open cast, capital intensive deep mining at
Selby and traditional deep mining which is more than twice as labour
intensive.
Both British Coal and the government favour open cast coal which is cheaper
than the deep mined product. British Coal management is fiercely protective
of its near Pounds 2bn investment in the Selby complex, the cost advantage
of which is much less certain.
Open cast mining is expected to provide about 17m tons and the Selby complex
has a projected output of some 10m tons. It is a matter of simple arithmetic
to see that all other coalfields and pits will be left to scrabble for very
little if power station demand for coal drops towards 30m tons.
It is time for British Coal to disclose and justify the strategic priorities
which are behind its present and future closure lists. Our suspicion is, at
low levels of demand for coal, British Coal management is as much a threat
to British miners' jobs as the absence of a government energy policy.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Energy policy - needs of electricity customers and
coal priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J C L COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We welcome the government's decision to undertake a wide ranging review
of energy policy, with specific reference to the fuels used for electricity
generation, and to publish the results in a white paper.
It is essential that the review takes full account of the interests of
electricity customers and not just the interests of the supply industries.
The needs of large industrial customers carried little weight in the
decisions that were made on the restructuring and privatisation of the
electricity industry, and price increases they have since suffered are
making it difficult for them to justify reinvestment in Britain.
Electricity prices to large users in this association have increased on
average by a third over the past two years, with much higher increases in
specific cases. The 'pool' price, which sets the level for industrial
contracts, increased by 20 per cent last year, and is expected to rise again
by 20 per cent this year, against a background of static or falling basic
fuel prices.
The prospect for next year, when the new coal deal comes into effect, is a
further substantial increase and this expectation is based on estimates by
the electricity supply industry.
This is an aspect of energy policy that must be taken into account in the
review that has been promised by the government.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Brussels tries to plug an information gap: The European
Commission believes that misunderstanding is hindering the process of
integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of unpasteurised camembert has been greatly exaggerated. According
to the European Commission, there never was a threat from 'meddling Brussels
bureaucrats' to do away with cheese made from untreated milk. Thousands of
frightened French fromagiers were misguided, as was the Prince of Wales, who
made a celebrated speech defending obscure French cheeses in Paris six
months ago.
Why then was the alleged threat to French cheese still so prominent on the
menu of complaints levelled at Brussels during the Maastricht referendum
campaign in France?
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, says the prevalence of
such examples of alleged Euro-madness are symptoms of the deficit
d'information in the Community.
Although the extent of opposition to the Maastricht treaty in the French and
Danish referenda clearly worried Mr Delors and his colleagues, they were
also disturbed by the depth of misunderstanding of the EC which opponents of
the treaty were able to exploit.
In successive speeches over the past few weeks, Mr Delors has lambasted
Europe's political elite for failing to explain the EC to their fellow
citizens. He believes politicians, including the commissioners themselves,
should inform their constituencies about the community's complex
institutional framework, how it works, what its purpose is, and why its
policies - from environmental control to food hygiene - are necessary.
The problem for Mr Delors is that the Commission is only one voice among
many informing the EC citizen about the Community. And the Commission itself
speaks with several voices, a situation which reflects the current internal
confusion about Brussels' political status: should the Commission behave
like a quasi-governmental organisation, trumpeting its own message, or
merely as a tool of the member states?
Mr Delors has the personnel and financial backing to launch a more
aggressive information campaign promoting the Community. At least Ecu60m
(Pounds 48.06m) is spent on information policy by Brussels every year.
Roughly half of that is used by the information directorate, which was
responsible for Euro-displays at the opening ceremonies of the winter and
summer Olympic games as well as the EC pavilion at the Seville Expo; the
other half is spent by individual departments promoting their own policies,
such as research programmes. The Commission also has a small spokesman's
service, producing daily information and responding to the queries of
Brussels' 600-strong press corps at regular midday briefings.
But for the time being, the Commission's information policy is a sort of UN
peacekeeping force, returning fire only when fired upon.
Mr Delors himself is convinced that this hands-off policy is correct, and
that a more aggressive approach would be counter-productive. 'During the
French referendum campaign I was told that the Commission should have
informed the French people about what was going on,' he told the European
Parliament earlier this month. 'But can the Commission usurp the role of the
French authorities, can the Commission just demand airtime on radio and
television? That would have made matters worse, and might have lost the
referendum.'
Commission spokesmen and information officials are unanimous that it is the
member states which should bear the burden of closing the information gap,
explaining the European Community and the role of the Commission. Its 20
information bureaus within the EC exist to distribute information and answer
direct queries. But they can do little - so the official line goes - against
disinformation put out by national governments, industry and the press.
As Mr Bruno Dethomas, the Commission's and Mr Delors' chief spokesman, puts
it: 'Without a common political will to restore the (Commission's) image you
could pay the best PR agency in existence and employ the best spokesmen on
earth and you still wouldn't be able to change anything.'
But that common political will is a long way off. Sir Bernard Ingham,
Downing Street spokesman when Lady Thatcher was UK prime minister and now an
outspoken Euro-sceptic, believes the Commission already goes too far, and
says that, in any case, it is unrealistic to expect 12 nations suddenly to
start speaking as one. 'Individual governments exist to put over their own
point of view and they fight for their own national interests,' he points
out.
Under such circumstances, some Commission officials believe that Brussels
should be fighting back with a more aggressive information policy, which
would reflect its genuine political aspirations, rather than complaining
about disinformation by national governments. Some publicity-hungry
commissioners, like Sir Leon Brittan, are already happy to take the fight to
the member states in areas where the Commission has autonomous powers, such
as competition policy.
The Commission believes one way of setting the record straight might be to
use commissioners' political clout more constructively.
For example, at last week's emergency summit of EC leaders - which pledged
to improve openness and democracy in the Community - Mr Delors proposed
sending individual commissioners out to national parliaments to explain the
Commission's plans for the year.
At the same time the Commission president is considering the establishment
of a working group, made up of half a dozen communications professionals -
senior journalists, public relations consultants and national government
spokesmen - to examine Commission and Community information policy.
The information directorate itself, in one of its periodic and convulsive
changes of strategy, is devolving more responsibility to individual
departments - external relations, research, agriculture, and so on.
In the longer term, information officials in Brussels dream of encouraging
citizens to identify with the Community, for example through EC-funded
cultural programmes. Ms Colette Flesch, the former Luxembourg minister who
heads the information directorate, says: 'We ought to try and bring about
some emotional link with the Community and the positive things it has
brought about: peace, economic growth, social progress.'
At the moment, with the European economy struggling and the Commission under
attack for allegedly riding roughshod over national identities, such plans
are a long way from fruition, as Ms Flesch and her colleagues freely admit.
As one Commission official puts it: 'Instead of waving the blue and
gold-starred flag and singing the European anthem, we ought to be out there
explaining our policies.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Advertise for governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one lesson from the BCCI affair that you do not need to be an
expert in financial fraud to draw. And it is this: if one body is
responsible both for monetary policy and financial regulation, both jobs
will be badly done. No-one is clearly responsible for anything because
everything is done 'together' in true British way; and whatever the
humiliation no heads roll. It is a similar mistake to having one Covent
Garden board responsible both for opera and for ballet.
So the first requirement in reforming the Bank of England is to hive off
responsibility for supervision of the banks and the financial system from
monetary policy, a separation that already occurs in many countries.
The next requirement is to appoint a new governor, to take over in 1993, who
is a professional. Running monetary policy is a difficult and specialist
task. Yet the candidate favoured in the betting odds is a popular merchant
banker, Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, who knows the City well
but would never claim to be any kind of economic or monetary thinker. No
wonder a distinguished US economist, who has helped central and eastern
European countries, declined to apply for the job of chief economic adviser
to the British government, saying that he 'did not take on hopeless cases'.
When Robin Leigh-Pemberton was appointed in 1983, I wrote an article
attacking the Thatcher government for a wasted opportunity, being careful to
do so before I ever met him. Leigh-Pemberton asked what I had against him.
The answer was 'Nothing whatever.' It was just that we needed not a 'gent',
but a professional. If this was so nine years ago, how much more is it so
after recent humiliations.
Unfortunately, there is a great shortage of obvious candidates. The Bank's
internal candidate is Eddie George, the deputy governor, who effectively
runs monetary policy there. He is now less likely to get the job for the bad
reason that he is too high up to be able to shrug off the BCCI affair. I
would be in his favour if the Bank's monetary and exchange rate record were
better. But I am not one of the financial journalists who believe that the
Bank always gives perfect advice and that mistakes are always due to
ministers not taking it.
A future governor, but not this time round, may be the Bank's economic
director, Mervyn King. For he is not yet associated with enough policies or
judgments, good or bad, to assess. A once-favoured candidate is Sir David
Walker, best-known as chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, who
was a Treasury high-flier, but is now chairman-elect of Lloyds bank.
There may be people in the academic world or in the City who meet the bill.
None come to mind. It is absurd, however, to limit the choice to those known
in a small circle. Whenever Conservative ministers have asked my opinion on
people for jobs, I have replied: 'Why don't you use the markets in which you
say you believe - which in this instance means advertise?' In fact, the post
of chief government economic adviser was advertised last year; and the new
head of the Central Statistical Office, Bill McLennan, is an Australian, who
was head-hunted.
There is no reason why the new governor should be a UK citizen even if a
minor amendment is required to the Bank of England Act. I have recently been
impressed by Sweden's Bengt Dennis, who could be addressed informally in the
UK by his surname.
But probably a better choice would be Donald Brash, the governor of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, who has been operating a form of independence
under a British-type constitution. He was appointed by Sir Roger Douglas,
the free-market Labour finance minister, with a contract to deliver stable
prices, defined as 0 to 2 per cent inflation. The contract was renewed by
Ruth Richardson, the National party finance minister - dubbed New Zealand's
Lady Thatcher - and the target date stretched slightly to 1993.
Although, contrary to City myth, Brash's salary does not depend on achieving
it, his job is on the line. With an inflation rate of 1 per cent he is well
ahead of schedule. Moreover, the recession incurred in the early years of
stabilisation is now behind New Zealand, where real gross domestic product
is on track to grow by 2 per cent this year, and 3 per cent in each of the
two following years. For what it is worth, Brash is known and popular in
London. Nevertheless one should not not prejudge the result of an open
competition.

succumb to misconceived pressure from those seeking to defend these
much-loved institutions.
Sir Bernard and his colleagues have produced a convincing case for action.
London's health service is overburdened with hospitals, carrying hefty
overheads and duplicating specialist services. Great though their reputation
is, they consume 50 per cent more resources per head of population than
hospitals in other cities. They also rely on a flow of patients from outside
their local areas which is drying up as the internal market in the health
service encourages doctors to refer their patients to local hospitals which
are cheaper.
At least as important as closing costly excess hospital capacity is the need
to improve London's community health services. Too many Londoners are served
by over-stretched, single-handed family doctors working from poor-quality
lock-up premises. London GPs employ fewer practice support staff, do less
health screening and have bigger patients' lists than their colleagues
elsewhere.
Yet family doctors are playing an increasing role in healthcare nationally.
Many operations which previously needed hospital facilities are now carried
out by day surgery which can be provided locally in health centres. Although
these are both cheaper than hospitals and more convenient for patients,
London lags well behind in the provision of such facilities.
Tomlinson says that a shift from hospitals to primary health care could be
self-financing, with the cost of enhanced community services balanced by
savings on hospitals.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will have to fight for extra
resources to ease the transition, however, if the improvements in primary
health care are to be apparent before the hospital rationalisation begins.
Her initial response - promising consultation with the staff and hospitals
and consideration for the needs of health service staff - shows that one
lesson has been learnt from the debacle over pit closures.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Unity frays at the edges: Canada's political future may
hinge on the outcome of today's constitutional referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moderation which has always been a hallmark of Canadian politics is in
serious danger of being undercut by the outcome of a national referendum to
be held today.
If opinion polls are right, voters will reject a constitutional reform
package which was designed to unite the disparate regions and population
groups of the world's second-biggest country, but has ended up exposing
their divisions.
The future of Canada itself could be at stake. Mr Joe Clark, the
constitutional affairs minister, gloomily predicted last week that a No vote
would inexorably lead to the province of Quebec going its own way by the end
of the century. 'I think gradually the country would just come apart,' Mr
Clark said.
The Yes forces are still praying for a last-minute miracle. Many voters,
especially in Quebec, may have a change of heart as they ponder the economic
costs of prolonged political uncertainty and the possible break-up of their
country. The Yes side could even pick up a few votes in the surge of
Canadian pride which has followed the Toronto Blue Jays' victory over the
Atlanta Braves in the World Series baseball championship on Saturday night.
The referendum will not be binding on the federal parliament or provincial
legislatures, whose ratification is still required for the new constitution
to take effect. But it will be impossible to put the latest proposals into
practice without a Yes vote in Quebec and a clear majority of the nine
mainly English-speaking provinces.
Besides heightening uncertainty about Canada's future, rejection of the
proposals will be a sharp slap in the face to moderate, mainstream
politicians. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, opposition leaders and the
premiers of the 10 provinces have spent the past two years painstakingly
piecing together a deal.
Voters will be asked today whether they endorse the fruits of those labours
in the form of the carefully-balanced Charlottetown agreement (named after
the capital of Prince Edward Island where it was signed last August and
where, incidentally, the Canadian federation was born 125 years ago).
The architects of the Charlottetown deal had two chief aims. First, they had
to produce a document acceptable to Quebec. The francophone province refused
to sign Canada's 1982 constitution and was left at the altar in 1990 when
Manitoba and Newfoundland failed to ratify the Meech Lake accord, the
contents of which were similar to, but less far-reaching, than the latest
proposals.
Second, the latest proposals have attempted to redress some of the
long-standing grievances of western Canadians and aboriginal Indians and
Inuit. Quebec's right to 'preserve and promote' its unique French character
would be enshrined in the constitution. Its ability to do that would be
buttressed by giving the provincial government control over such matters as
culture and immigration. On the other hand, the francophone province would
not get jurisdiction over other areas of government - such as regional
development - which it has sought.
Western Canadians would gain stronger influence in faraway Ottawa through
reform of the federal Senate. The present impotent chamber, which is filled
with patronage appointees mostly from Ontario and Quebec, would be replaced
by an elected body with equal representation from all 10 provinces. To
mollify Quebec and Ontario, however, the revamped upper chamber would have
more limited powers than proponents of Senate reform demanded. The central
Canadian provinces would also be given stronger representation in an
enlarged House of Commons.
The Charlottetown deal, in other words, is a classic Canadian compromise. By
rejecting it, Canadians run the risk of passing the initiative to the less
moderate, more self-centred, groups which have campaigned against it. The
Alberta-based Reform party, for instance, has argued that the proposed new
constitution gives away far too much to Quebec. Mr Pierre Trudeau, the
former prime minister, has persuaded many English speakers to vote No today
by accusing the deal's architects of bowing to 'blackmail' by the
francophone province. Mr Trudeau and other arch-federalists say Quebec's
demands for more powers should be resisted and its threats to break away
from Canada ignored.
But the biggest winners from a No vote are likely to be the two separatist
parties, the Parti Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois. Their leaders, Mr Jacques
Parizeau and Mr Lucien Bouchard respectively, have heaped scorn on Quebec
premier Robert Bourassa for 'selling out' the francophone province. They
argue that Mr Bourassa failed to get the extra powers for Quebec in
Charlottetown demanded by his own Liberal party. 'A ce prix-la, c'est Non'
('At that price, it's No'), the separatists' posters proclaim.
Almost all the country's elected politicians, not to mention business and
trade union leaders, have come out in favour of the deal. They have
campaigned across the country in 'odd couples' such as Conservative Mr
Mulroney and Ontario's Social-Democratic Premier Bob Rae. The heads of
Ontario's Chamber of Commerce and Federation of Labour briefly put aside
their differences last week to declare the agreement 'an excellent
consensus'.
But like last month's referendum on the Maastricht treaty in France, the
campaign in Canada has become a lightning rod for a disgruntled electorate
to vent its anger at unpopular political leaders. The economy remains mired
in recession, with unemployment at more than 11 per cent. Public spending is
being cut. Many Canadians put the blame on plant closures caused by the 1989
free-trade agreement with the US, on high taxes, and on generous policies
towards immigrants.
While French voters took out their unhappiness on President Mitterrand, the
main targets in Canada have been Mr Mulroney and Mr Mike Harcourt, British
Columbia's Social-Democratic premier. The Reform party's TV ads pointedly
call the Charlottetown agreement 'Mulroney's deal'. They add: 'If you want
to follow the politicians, vote Yes. If you want to lead the politicians,
vote No.'
Defending the compromises in the Charlottetown agreement has proved
difficult. No sooner had a British Columbia minister assured his
constituents on the west coast that Quebec gained very little from the deal,
than his words were repeated by the separatists to prove what a weak-kneed
negotiator Mr Bourassa had been. But the referendum has also brought to the
surface some longer-term and more fundamental shifts in society.
A gradual transfer of power to provincial governments over the past two
decades has encouraged Canadians to put narrow regional interests above
those of the nation as a whole. The political clout of aboriginal people has
grown enormously in recent years. Prof Kimon Valaskakis, an economist at the
Universite de Montreal, compares Canada to a club where 'the costs go up,
and the services to members keep going down'.
Similarly, the balance between individual rights and collective
responsibilities has been altered by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
which enshrined various rights as part of the repatriation of the
constitution from Britain in 1982. The charter has greatly improved the lot
of, for instance, religious minorities or people with disabilities. But in
the process, it has increased the political power of special interest
groups, making it difficult to forge a consensus on an issue as broad as a
constitution.
The federal government even failed during the Charlottetown talks to
persuade the provinces to commit themselves to a mechanism for bringing down
the non-tariff barriers - such as government procurement preferences and
transport licences - which often make it easier for Canadian companies to
trade with the US than with other parts of their own country.
Such disparate forces as television, cross-border shopping and the US-Canada
free trade agreement are slowly but inexorably drawing Canadians closer to
the states to the south, than to the provinces to the east and west.
Canadian and US companies are integrating their operations on the two sides
of the border, treating North America as a single market. Even the millions
of Canadians who cheered their team on to victory in the World Series had no
choice but watch TV coverage provided by CBS, the US-based network.
Judging by opinion polls, radio talk shows and even casual conversations,
most Canadians, whether they end up voting Yes or No, never want to hear the
word 'constitution' again. Mr Mulroney and other leaders in English-speaking
Canada are thus likely to respond to a No victory by seeking to close the
book on constitutional negotiations for the time being. They will be anxious
both to save their own political skins and to contain the economic damage
which further political uncertainty could cause.
Although the new constitution would not defuse Canada's political tensions
overnight, business leaders are optimistic that its adoption would at least
bolster investor confidence and hasten economic recovery. It might shift
politicians' attention from the struggle to keep the country together and
towards ways of improving the country's long-term competitiveness - for
instance, by dismantling inter-provincial trade barriers and easing the
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Observers say a No vote would, at the very least, delay a resumption of the
downward trend in interest rates. The main banks raised the prime rate (the
rate at which they lend to their best customers) by a record two percentage
points to 8.25 per cent last month as the Canadian dollar fell in
anticipation of a No vote.
But Mr Parizeau and Mr Bouchard in Quebec will have the bit between their
teeth. They started their referendum campaign last August merely by asking
voters to reject the terms of the agreement. But the scent of victory has
emboldened them to turn the vote into a mandate for stepping up the drive
towards Quebec independence.
In the event of a No vote, they are planning to push for a provincial
election which must, in any case, be held within the next two years. If they
win, they have promised a referendum on some form of independence. The
chances are remote that any Quebec politician would risk speaking out in
favour of closer ties with the rest of Canada. At the same time,
English-speaking federalists may grow weary of fighting yet again to keep
their country in one piece. Canada will not break apart soon. But it is in
real danger of drifting apart.

<TEXT>
AS IF THE furore over the coal industry were not enough, British Airways'
proposed acquisition of Dan-Air throws up yet more questions about how far
the UK privatisation programme has resulted in genuinely free markets. When
BA was privatised, it was part of government policy that local competition
should be fostered. In the event, smaller UK competitors have mostly gone
bust like Laker, formed protective alliances with big foreign carriers like
British Midland or been taken over by BA like British Caledonian.
Some of this may be due to the quality and cheapness of BA's service. If so,
it is worth asking how far BA has been kept up to the mark by the gadfly
activities of its smaller competitors. But it is also due to BA's market
dominance; and that is partly due to the antiquated system by which BA holds
airport slots as inherited assets.
In normal circumstances, there would be a clear case for the Dan-Air deal
being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The proposed merger
entails an evident loss to the consumer, in that BA will cease to compete
with Dan-Air on a number of routes. However, a reference would doubtless
result in BA crying off, in which case Dan-Air's holding company might well
go under. This would lead to job losses in the first instance, even if in
the longer run economically viable routes and slots were picked up by other
competitors.
But it is not sensible to ignore the context. In the depths of recession, it
seems perverse to add some 400 to the ranks of the unemployed and to
increase the burden on the banking system through a receivership which could
be avoided. But the underlying logic remains. It is not in the public
interest that BA should continue to be assisted in overcoming its smaller
rivals by a faulty system of regulation. If this deal must grudgingly be
allowed through, it is all the more important that the government should
tackle the strategic issue of how to throw routes and airport slots open to
the forces of the free market.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Why the Gatt talks matter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOM THE Gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. A half a million tonnes
of soyabeans is - so the world is informed - all that now obstructs an
agreement of the greatest importance both to the global economy and to
harmonious relations among the great trading powers. If so, this is lunacy.
The Gatt talks are too important and the need for agreement too urgent to
permit such folly.
Huge sums are being bandied about as the potential benefits from trade
liberalisation. Such calculations must be tentative. But economic
integration has been the engine of world prosperity throughout the post-war
era. There is, for example, much talk of the large 'home markets' that the
EC's single market programme or the North American Free Trade Agreement will
secure for those within them. But the more successful the Gatt becomes, the
more producers, wherever located, will be able to look on the world as a
whole as their home market.
As striking as the potential rewards for success is the price of failure.
Roughly half of world trade is among, not within, the world's main regions.
If such trade is to survive, let alone grow still further, it needs to be
put on a liberal and, as important, a predictable basis. There is a serious
danger, however, that the failure of the Uruguay round talks would lead to
progressive unravelling of the benefits for global trade of what has already
been achieved under the Gatt.
Agreement matters as much for global politics as for economics. This is
partly because prosperity provides the underpinning of political stability.
It is also because diplomatic relations both between developing and
developed countries and among developed countries focus ever more on
economic matters. Trade is already at the head of any agenda for discussions
between the EC and the US. But such disputes can no longer be held in check
by cold war security relationships. They must be handled on their own terms,
which only a rule-based system like the Gatt can hope to ensure.
If a successful Uruguay round is important, no less important is an outline
agreement before the US election. Mr Clinton is unlikely to repudiate a
successful deal. But if there is no outline agreement, the entire Uruguay
round will go into abeyance, while the new administration tries to renew its
fast track legislative authority and sort out its priorities. There is, in
addition, no reason to suppose it will be easier to reach an agreement with
a Clinton administration and, given the protectionist tendencies of many in
the Democratic party, good reason to believe it may be still more difficult.
This may be precisely what those who oppose agreement, notably the French
government, may hope. If so, it should consider the implications for an
already quite unstable world economy of a breakdown in these talks,
especially when the EC's failure to give the US satisfaction over soyabeans
is likely to lead to a tit-for-tat protectionist war as well.
A half a million tonnes of soyabeans is the ostensible reason for failure to
complete the deal. But the French government probably does not want one at
all, for domestic electoral reasons, preferring the tawdry comforts of
failure over the risky politics of success. There is even sotto voce
questioning in Paris of the painfully achieved deal for reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy, which forms the basis of the EC's position in these
talks. The German government is internally divided, but part of it is quite
happy to hide behind French reluctance to agree export limits on cereals, in
order to protect its own production of cereal substitutes. Mr Delors appears
tempted by the delusion of an adolescent EC standing up to a bullying
American big brother. Meanwhile, in Washington an enfeebled administration
is under pressure from its domestic farm lobbies.
Notwithstanding all obstacles, an agreement is needed now, partly to show
the EC is capable of effective action. Both sets of negotiators should be
instructed to reach the best deal they can this week. Let the obstructive
forces in the EC and the US then dare to vote the deal down. Let the French
or German governments dare to scupper the Uruguay round over their right to
dump cereals in world markets or protect their soyabeans. Both sides must
now be put to the only true test: acceptance or rejection of a negotiated
package.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Arts: Solti's expert, unmoving 'Otello' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most affecting moments came after final curtain. Georg Solti, having
conducted the latest Royal Opera Otello revival two days after his 80th
birthday, was feted onstage, and then presented with tokens of the house's
esteem: the post of Music Director Laureate, a silver rose (Der
Rosenkavalier was the first opera he conducted in the house), the ring from
his first Covent Garden Ring and the goblet from the 1971 Tristan which
brought his decade as Music Director to a close.
Two operatic veterans closely associated with Solti and much loved in
London, Hans Hotter and Birgit Nilsson, were there as (respectively) ring-
and cup-bearer. Nilsson's speaking voice, ringing bronze-toned through the
auditorium, provided the evening's great moment of vocal thrill.
What preceded the ceremony was a highly polished, powerfully worked Verdi
reading which left me largely unstirred and untouched. Not entirely. Kiri Te
Kanawa, a gracious but pale-toned and pallid-spirited heroine for most of
the evening (with even an unfamiliar slight flutter of unsteadiness at its
start), delivered the Willow Song in a stream of exquisitely moulded sound
and in the death scene began to phrase with eloquence and emotional
vivacity. Placido Domingo cried out 'Desdemona] Desdemona] Ah, morta]' in
exactly the tones of grandest tragedy - varied in colour and jagged with
passion - that earlier one had so much missed in his solidly routined
singing and acting.
These were reminders of the impact the roles of hero and heroine can have:
welcome but late, and insufficient.
Solti conducted my first Otello (at Covent Garden not quite 25 years ago,
with McCracken, Carlyle and Gobbi). Then, he was a hard-driving Verdian,
urging fierce excitements out of the music, prone to open the orchestral
floodgates at climaxes (in which all but the most penetrative voices were
likely to drown).
Now, the approach is much more light-fingered. Rhythms have a spring, not a
whiplash. Textures are ventilated. (Only some ill-tuned choral singing
caused any clogging.) Singers are lovingly supported. The work is viewed
whole, not in sections.
On this level of executive achievement any expressions of critical
reservation must be a confession of personal taste. I missed a haze of
string warmth in the love duet, a broadening of the tempo (and a concomitant
increase of emotional expansiveness) at key moments.
I missed the traditional Otello spaciousness in the ensembles, the feeling
in the hero's Act 3 monologue of after-the-storm hush reverberant with
grief. Solti still seems to me to keep at arm's length the 'inner life' of
Verdi's music: for all the technical marvels of Friday's performance, I
continue to find him an unmoving Otello conductor.
The one untried element on the cast-list is Sergey Leiferkus, here
undertaking his first Iago. He produces a precise, finely channelled, darkly
glowing baritone that, while not conventionally Verdian, suits the music
excellently. He holds a balance between the smiling face and the scheming
mind which owes nothing to Iago cliche (apart from the peals of laughter at
the close of the Credo, which should be abandoned).
He floats and colours the Dream while keeping its narrative coolly
unfolding. He will develop much further in the role; already, on a stage
mainly given over to the expertly predictable, he provides the genuine
dramatic and musical interest.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Arts: Eszterhazay influence - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palace of Eszterhaza in west Hungary was built on a foundation of music.
Its great period in the latter half of the 18th century, when Prince
Esterhazay brought Haydn there as composer in residence and enjoyed
unrivalled evenings of musical splendour, echoes on in its walls, its rooms,
its very fabric - even if the palace has sometimes found itself used since
the war for less gracious purposes, such as the billeting of Soviet troops.
Now there is an ambitious plan to put the building to use as an educational
centre for music. Since 1986, the Prague Mozart Foundation wants to turn
Eszterhaza into a college for advanced musicians and when a trial run for a
European equivalent of the American Marlboro festival was first tried out in
France, the scheme has followed a twisting path, which at times has seemed
to grasp at any opportunity as it presented itself.
The present set of plans, however, looks set to become reality. The
Foundation, which intends to adopt a new title with the word 'European'
prominently on its letter-head, wishes to turn the changed political scene
to its advantage and establish a major presence in central Europe. It will
embrace three countries - Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland - with public
performances or festivals in each, at Prague, Budapest and Krakow
respectively.
The idea seems to have captured the imagination of European leaders. Jacques
Delors had hoped to come to the launch weekend, but a certain other
gathering in Birmingham clashed on the same evening. President Goncz of
Hungary and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia each attended one of the
concerts, which were held at Eszterhaza and the barely less elegant castle
of Dobris outside Prague.
Their influence is likely to prove critical if the money for the scheme is
to be found. The cost of renovating Eszterhaza, which will surely be very
considerable, was not included in the calculations. But even setting that
aside, the annual operating budget is calculated at some Dollars 4.2m each
year.
The Foundation foresees three likely sources of funding. A third of the
total is expected to come from individual support; a third should come from
scholarships for the students at Dollars 20,000 a time (the EC has said it
will fund those from eastern Europe, western European governments will fund
their students, while those from the rest of the world will need private
funding); the remaining third will have to be found from sponsor-ship.
In the present economic climate the total plan is ambitious indeed.
Undaunted, however, the Foundation is pressing ahead with the auditioning of
its first intake of students and preparations for its first operatic
production, which is to be Mozart's Idomeneo.
An immensely impressive list of musicians has agreed to participate in the
academy and its concerts. The first festival is already planned in Prague
for April next year. The momentum looks unstoppable.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Arts: Blues for Mister Charlie - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES Baldwin (1924-87) wrote his first novel, Go Tell it on the Mountain in
1953, and the book that made him famous, Another Country in 1962. He also
wrote drama. His play, Blues for Mister Charlie, comes from the mid 1960s
and is based on the facts surrounding the death in August 1964 of Emmet Till
in Mississippi.
It makes a long evening at the Royal Exchange, energetically acted, good in
parts, everywhere suffused with deep southern atmosphere.
Baldwin ranks between Chester Himes and Derek Walcott, having the edge of
one and the soul of the other. But he was no dramatist. Blues recasts the
real-life murder. Here, Richard Henry is shot by Lyle Britten. Henry is
black gospel stock, his father a minister; Britten is white trash, stupid
and dangerous. The murder sets the town's blacks against the whites as
Britten comes to trial.
The major players are Parnell James, a white-shoe southern newspaper
proprietor with liberal - 'communistic' - tendencies, and Richard's father,
Meridian. James filters white opinion, and Meridian black, but neither are
just spokesmen. Gradually, through flashbacks and confessions, a pattern
emerges proving none to be as good or as bad as they seem. Britten has wife
and family, and somewhere, a rough decency. The man he kills turns out to be
a heroin addict, pimp, and troublemaker.
The ending, like Spike Lee's impeccable film Do The Right Thing (1990),
offers the violence of Malcolm X and the amity of Martin Luther King.
Meridian keeps his son's gun under the bible, and might use both one day.
The issues remain tangled, Baldwin eager to write about everything at once.
His broad grasp of misery works in Another Country, but not on stage. So
race, class, sexuality, individual liberty and collective action find
themselves jumbled together, not picked out for each scene.
The protracted action gets brisk treatment from director Gregory Hersov and
designer David Short. The clean stage allows lighting (Ace McCarron) to
define scenes, particularly when the trial testimonies are intercut with the
witnesses' lives. The acting looks authentic, although some of the
Mississippi accents migrate to Maine.
Wyllie Longmore as Meridian and Nicholas le Prevost as Parnell make their
characters fit the situation. There are good contributions from Guy Gregory
as Papa D, a black chorus on events, and Charlotte Fryer as a sharp trial
lawyer. But Baldwin scripted 24 characters, and the indistinguishable should
be merged or cut; some of the dialogue sounds dated, too.
The music (Luke Smith and the Manchester Community Gospel Choir) is an asset
and delight. It spills over into the second interval; so there is Southern
Gospel at the Exchange, sung under the board which used to record the
commodities prices.

BBC2 shows the first episode in a series for which filming began eight years
ago: Doctors To Be. In 1984 2,000 people applied to St Mary's, London, to
train as doctors; 400 were offered interviews, and 100 given places.
The series is concerned with the processes of selection and training and,
thanks to its long lead-time, is able to follow the process all the way
through. Those seen being chosen for training in today's programme are now
working as junior doctors in hospitals across Britain (8.10).
BBC1 launches another comedy series by Marks and Gran, creators of 'Shine On
Harvey Moon' and 'Birds Of A Feather'. Get Back (8.30) is described as 'a
recession comedy' and features two brothers, raised on a London council
estate, who have succeeded in the retail trade.
C4's current affairs programme Cutting Edge (9.00) begins a fresh run with
an account of a 'psychiatric flying squad' in Barnet which responds to calls
from those unable to cope.
That marvellous series The Victorian Kitchen Garden mixing horticulture,
history, technology and so much more, ends its repeat run (11.15 BBC1).

FT  26 OCT 92 / Arts: A bridge to fame - Architecture / Colin Amery admires
the work of Calatrava
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santiago Calatrava is hardly a household name in England, but he deserves to
be much better known as one of the most inventive and influential
engineer/architects currently practising in Europe.
He is famous principally for his bridges. He leapt to fame in the UK with an
elegant design for the East London River Crossing which was rejected in
favour of the unexceptional design that recently opened.
Calatrava was born in 1951 in Valencia where he qualified as an architect.
He went on to study engineering at the distinguished Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology in Zurich. In 1981 he established his office in Zurich and his
work is to be seen in many major European cities.
There is a marvellous opportunity to see almost his entire opus and some of
his extraordinary sculptures at a major exhibition that has just opened at
the Royal Institute of British Architects, 66, Portland Place, London, W1.
until November 14.
The exhibition has considerable drama and excitement because that is the
nature of this man's brave designs. There is something of the
single-mindedness of another famous Spanish architect in the work of
Calatrava - the Barcelona architect Antonio Gaudi.
I was reminded of that weird display in the crypt of the unfinished church
of the Sagrada Familia of Gaudi's models and structural experiments for his
incredible cathedral. Looking at the almost primitive, whitened bones of
Gaudi's experiments was a powerful experience. There is something of that
sudden draught of potent originality about this display of Calatrava's work
in London.
Calatrava's structures are much more skeletal than Gaudi's. Gaudi put
putrescent and colourful flesh on his twisted bones. Calatrava's powerful
structural exercises are not so organic. He does create beautiful curves
and, like all great engineers, sometimes achieves feats of balance that look
impossible but work.
I have seen two of his recent works, both of them in Seville. As part of its
Expo '92 plans, Seville wanted eight new bridges over the River
Guadalquivir. Not all of these were built, but the Alamillo Bridge by
Calatrava now stands like a giant, stringed boomerang spanning 200 metres
across the Meandro San Jeronimo.
The bridge is an exercise in counter-balance, the rearing pylon on one side
of the bridge balancing the weight of the actual level traffic deck.
Thirteen pairs of steel cables act as stays and give the bridge the
appearance of some giant ancient stringed instrument.
The other creation of Calatrava at the World Expo '92 in Seville was the
pavilion for the Kuwaiti Government. Here he created an angular crown of
intersecting curved and pointed ribs around the pavilion. The effect was of
a giant opening flower - with an illusory but almost tangible sense of
movement.
The design of this pavilion demonstrated the inspirational power of nature
in Calatrava's work. The exhibition demonstrates that he draws beautifully -
from the live model and from nature. He is an engineer with an eye.
Calatrava is young to have achieved so much and has clearly benefitted from
the recent Spanish modernisation and building boom. There is a lovely simple
pedestrian bridge he designed for a small town near Barcelona and the very
remarkable tower known as, the Montjuich Communications Tower, which was
built as part of the preparations for the Barcelona Olympic Games.
It stands next door to the enormous indoor sports arena designed by Arata
Isosaki and is a somewhat surreal object, looking like a giant tuning fork
above the town. I was reminded of a very similar, angled communications
tower designed by the British firm Future Systems for a hypothetical site in
London's Hyde Park.
In Zurich his major work is the new Stadelhofen Railway Station - he won the
design competition for this in 1983. The station occupies a prominent site
next to the Opera House Square, at the foot of the hilly park that marks the
edge of the old city's fortifications.
Highly sculptural in form the station platforms and canopies curve around
the foot of the hill like a bony snake; on the lower level curved concrete
structures suggest the inside of some giant rib cage.
Calatrava also collaborated on the new station in Lucerne which replaced the
great 19th century station that was burned in 1971. In Lyons the TGV trains
now connect with the airport and the dramatic winged station is almost the
largest of Calatrava's works. It promises to be extremely elegant -
developing, as it does, the familiar Saarinen design for Kennedy Airport's
TWA building.
One thing comes out very clearly from the RIBA exhibition: the skill with
which Calatrava has developed a unity between architecture and engineering.
His buildings and structures are refined works of art. They have a coherence
and completeness which is the mark of a highly skilled designer.
It is a joy to sense a great visualiser at work - someone who utilises the
third dimension in a sculptural and functional way. There is something
Gothic about his creations - because they have a structural drama without
any unnecessary high-tech razzmatazz.
The fact that his work is now scattered across Europe in a style free of
nationalistic restraints also makes him like a Gothic master. Calatrava is
definitely a man with beauty in his bones.
Sponsored by Generalitat Valencia. (There are special guided visits to the
exhibition that last 40 minutes that can be booked by telephoning the RIBA
Events Office 071-580 5533 extension 4335.)

FT  26 OCT 92 / Management: Business bouquets can generate passion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days ago the industry-led European Foundation for Quality Management
presented its first ever European Quality Award to Rank Xerox, the
joint-venture office equipment group.
The Japanese were the first, in the early 1950s, to introduce an award for
manufacturing quality named after W Edwards Deming, one of the American
advisers widely credited with being the founding fathers of modern TQ at the
end of the war. US industry finally woke up to the issue in the early 1980s.
In 1987, the US instituted the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award,
named after the former US commerce secretary.
Like its US counterpart, the European award is part of a broader campaign
aimed at encouraging the use of TQ principles to improve international
competitiveness, particularly against the Japanese.
Applicants for the award complete a self-appraisal using nine criteria:
leadership, people management, policy and strategy, resources, processes,
people satisfaction, customer satisfaction, impact on society and business
results.
One common belief runs through the awards - namely that quality matters to
customers and that companies which ignore it will lose out.
Bolstered by this concern, more than three-quarters of British and US
businesses now claim to have some form of quality programme in place.
However, critics suggest that many programmes are failing. The Baldrige
award, ceremonially handed over by the US president to up to six companies a
year, has become the subject of a fierce debate between US management
experts.
Critics have complained about its methodology, focus and lack of coherent
philosophy. Some have faulted it for not honouring superior product or
service quality.
It remains to be seen whether the new European award generates such
passions.

to complete the strategic route to the north.
The two-year-long scheme includes three motorway junctions and interchanges
at Bar End, Hockley and Shawford, with associated slip roads and four
kilometres of side road diversions.
Fifteen major structures are to be built comprising bridges - two across
rivers and one over a railway track - culverts and retaining walls.
Among the other contracts, refurbishment and repairs, costing Pounds 3.8m,
are to be carried out to tower blocks of flats for Birmingham City Council
by Contracts Housing Division.
A Pounds 1.7m community residential home and workshops for the mentally
handicapped is to be constructed at Rowde, near Devizes in Wiltshire, for
the charity Care (Cottage and Rural Enterprises).
Contract Housing's other new orders include a Pounds 2m refurbishment of
housing at Craigshill in West Lothian for the Livingston Development
Corporation.

FT  26 OCT 92 / People: Fashionable banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There cannot be many bankers who have experienced as many changes in banking
fashions as Sir John Hall, the new chairman of The Nikko Bank (UK), the
London commercial bank owned by one of Japan's biggest securities companies.
Sir John, an old Etonian, spent the first half of his career climbing the
boardroom ladder at J Henry Schroder Wagg, one of the London acceptance
houses.
However, in 1973 he joined Bank of America International. It was the period
when the leading US banks were keen to get involved in medium-term
Euromarket lending and it was thought a new institution which combined
merchant banking skills - Kleinwort Benson and Paribas were shareholders -
with the balance sheet strength of a big US commercial bank, would be a
powerful force.
In the event, US banks quickly learnt how to make medium-term loans and the
merchant bank eventually became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of
America.
After a short stint with the US parent, Sir John was seconded to run the
European Brazilian Bank, one of a group of consortium banks which
specialised in lending money to one region, and in which Bank of America had
almost a one-third stake.
Once again the original rationale did not survive the onset of the debt
crisis in the developing world in the early 1980s and in October 1988 the
bank gave up its banking status because it could not afford to make
sufficient provisions against doubtful loans.
A year later Sir John was made a managing director of the newly-established
Nikko Bank (UK). It employs 120 staff, has a balance sheet of Pounds 2.7bn
and in the year to March made after-tax profits of Pounds 5.6m.
Sir John, 61, who takes over as a non-executive chairman from John
Cunningham, an ex-Coutts man, is confident that the life expectancy of his
new vehicle is considerably longer than some of his earlier charges.
If he has learnt any lessons from his earlier career moves, it is not to
have 'all your eggs in one basket' and have plenty of liquidity in the
balance sheet. Less than six months after he joined Eurobraz, two thirds of
the bank's liquidity disappeared because of the debt crisis, and the
problems this caused have left a lasting impression on Sir John.

Russell Middleton, an India specialist who was managing director of ANZ
McCaughan Capel Cure between 1989-1990, has been made head of the new Indian
department at James Capel.
Middleton, 45, first got interested in the sub-continent when he went there
eight years ago to attend the wedding of a friend from his London tennis
club. One of his first tasks now is to give institutional clients at his new
company 'the feel, small and taste of India'.
James Capel is this month opening a representative office in Bombay, in the
offices of its parent HongKong Bank - staffed by two analysts, both Indians
 -but Middleton will continue to be based in London 'because that is where
most of the major international institutional investors are still based'.
Notwithstanding India's manifest problems, and the recent stock market
scandal which has badly shaken confidence, Middleton believes the country is
'opening up very quickly'. Nor is he unaware of the hazards, having been in
Australia trying to interest investors in a closed-end fund which he was
working on with his previous employer, boutique merchant bank Chescor, when
Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated and the country thrown into chaos yet again.
He moved to Capel to allow himself scope to branch out from fund management
and become involved in other areas - interesting foreigners in global
depositary receipts and in newly available direct investment opportunities.
Middleton, who comes originally from Melbourne, began working with
Australian stockbrokers Bain in London in 1977, then joined McCaughan Dyson,
taking charge of the Melbourne broker's London office in 1984.

KYLE STEWART has won contracts worth around Pounds 33m from Hostmead
Developments, Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, Equity &amp; Law
investment managers, the Lord Chancellor's Department, Marks &amp; Spencer, the
Property Services Agency and the College of Law.
Work has already started on the Pounds 6m design and construct contract for
Hostmead Developments for a WH Smith Distribution Centre on the Walworth
Industrial Estate at Andover, Hampshire. The project comprises a 26,000 sq
metre steel frame structure with steel cladding and a 30 high-bay roller
shutting doors.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society has awarded Kyle Stewart a contract
to construct a two-story office building with surface parking and
landscaping at Barnes Wallis Road, Fareham, Hampshire. An adjacent office
building will also be refurbished as part of the Pounds 5m contract.
The Pounds 4m Equity &amp; Law contract is for the construction of four
warehouse units with office space totalling 12,600 sq metres on the Slyfield
industrial estate at Guildford.
Another contract, worth Pounds 6m, from the Lord Chancellor's Department is
for the grade 1 listed Bloomsbury County Court in London to be internally
reconstructed and refurbished to form the new Central London County Court.
In addition, construction will commence shortly on a new Marks &amp; Spencer
store at Weybridge, close to the old Brooklands motor racing track. The
Pounds 8m contract will create a store offering the full range of Marks &amp;
Spencer goods including an extensive food hall, as well as offices and staff
accommodation. A large landscaped car park will also be a feature. The store
is scheduled to open for Christmas 1993.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Management: Putting a value on people in a changing world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While many companies are now starting to address broader issues than profit
and wider audiences than shareholders, few have been able to back up the
rhetoric with much statistical rigour.
Tentative steps in that direction are being taken as part of a three-year
research programme by Britain's Royal Society of Arts into 'Tomorrow's
Company: the role of business in a changing world'.
Making the case for change at the RSA's latest seminar on the subject, Roger
Stubbs, deputy managing director of Mori, the market research company,
unveiled a poll showing that 42 per cent of City analysts and 80 per cent of
the public believe British companies do not pay enough attention to their
treatment of the environment.
They rank environmental protection, employee welfare and community service
as companies principal social responsibilities. Anti-pollution measures and
a safe workplace were also important.
These are not idle, irrelevant concerns for companies. The poll showed that
38 per cent of fund managers expected private investors' influence over how
their funds are invested to increase in the next few years. That would seem
to suggest that shareholders may increasingly take action against companies
adopting practices with which they do not agree.
How companies can measure and improve their performance to a wider group of
stakeholders remains extremely difficult. Most discussion at the RSA seminar
concentrated on valuing people.
Alan Benjamin, chairman of Alphameric, argued that every company's key asset
is people, and yet they are not valued under existing performance measures
and are rather simply written off as annual expenditure.
He said renewing 'people assets' using continual education and training was
essential. Without it, the 'knowledge base' of a company would depreciate.
David Budworth, a consultant, suggested that one approach would be to use
what he called an 'innovation ratio'. This would measure current expenditure
not expected to produce a return in the current year, such as money spent on
research and development.
The ratio would record the deterioration of intangible assets - the
non-physical elements of a company which generate value, including their
employees.
Given that there is considerable controversy about how to value intangible
assets, he suggested circumventing the debate by using a measurement of cash
flow.
It may be some time before companies need to take these issues too
seriously, however. There is considerable progress yet to be made, however,
as a second survey presented by Crispin Tweddle, chairman of Piper Trust,
showed.
A sample of contributors to investment funds such as pensions - drawn from
middle managers in industry - knew nothing about how their money was
currently invested, nor the policies adopted by the institutions, and did
not look on themselves as shareholders.
This suggests that change in the short term is more likely to be brought
about by their own realisation of a need for more sophisticated measures
than by any direct shareholder action.

<TEXT>
BUILDING WORK will begin next month on the expanded Pounds 10m Jewel House
project at the Tower of London. The design and construction work is being
managed by LEHRER McGOVERN INTERNATIONAL, part of the Bovis Construction
Group.
The new Jewel House will open for Easter 1994 and will accommodate over
2,500 visitors per hour - a total of 20,000 visitors a day - whereas the
present area was designed in the 1960s for a peak attendance of 5,000
visitors daily.
The new display area will be three times larger than at present and will be
spread over the whole of the ground floor of the Duke of Wellington's
barracks. The design incorporates a short length of slowly moving floor past
the most important jewels.'
The main objectives are to provide better viewing facilities, incorporate
the highest level of security, allow access for disabled people and
eliminate long queues.
LMI has assembled a team of design consultants and other specialists who are
working closely with experts from the historic royal palaces.
Mr Ken Percy, who is in charge of the project for LMI, said: 'We won this
assignment because we were able to demonstrate that we had the skill,
experience and depth of resources necessary to handle a very complex and
highly sensitive project.
'In total there are over 20 trade contractors involved in the project and at
peak we anticipate around 100 people working on the site. Given the
sensitive nature of the project, strict security precautions are already in
place and will remain in force for the duration of the work.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Management: Why customers must come first - Paul Taylor
finds problems with Total Quality schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total Quality programmes have, at best, led to incremental improvements in
companies' performance and customer satisfaction; at worst, they have made
it more difficult to increase organisations' competitiveness.
These findings, which come from a critical examination of European corporate
experience due to be published by the Economist Intelligence Unit shortly*,
indicate that companies may need to rethink their approach to TQ.
The research, conducted by a team from Ashridge management school led by
George Binney, concludes that TQ has often failed to deliver hoped-for
results because of the way it has been approached. In many cases, it has
been internally focused and 'lacks a clear link to customers or business
results'.
After looking at companies which have made a sustained effort to apply TQ,
the authors say two conclusions stand out. First, that rigid, pre-determined
TQ programmes, in particular those imposed from outside an organisation, do
not work. Second, companies which have gone furthest in applying Total
Quality have never had a TQ initiative or programme - in them 'TQ has
developed organically.'
In spite of the difficulties of implementation, organisations are warned
that they ignore TQ principles at their peril. The report cites the results
of a study of more than 3,000 businesses in Europe and North America which
indicates that every 2 per cent improvement in a company's quality rating by
customers is associated with a 1 per cent increase in its return on
investment.
Companies in Europe also need to discover how to achieve systematic,
continuous improvement, because the competitive challenge from Japan and
other Pacific Rim countries grows ever more intense. The authors note
'continuous improvement . . . is becoming a condition of survival in
internationally competitive markets.'
The authors also insist that TQ, as a management philosophy, has value
because it focuses attention on targets like customer satisfaction and
encourages companies to 'benchmark' themselves against world-class
competitors. 'TQ defines what companies need to do in order to improve
continuously the value they provide to customers.' Where it is working,
'continuous improvement, customer delight and people empowerment are a
reality . . . not a management consultant's buzz-words'.
The buzz-words are only too easy to mouth, as are the principles of TQ. But
translating the principles into actions is another matter, the report points
out. In particular, it says, top management must have a 'gut commitment' to
quality.
Programmes which are imposed from above and bolted on to existing procedures
do not work because they are ineffective and can even 'inoculate'
organisations against real change, say the authors. 'Managers and staff can
emerge after two to three years of time-consuming work, familiar with all
the concepts and jargon of quality, yet without a real improvement in
performance. People will then become cynical. Any later attempt to organise
a true quality effort will be made more difficult.'
Senior management needs to take responsibility for quality, rather than
delegating it. 'They should begin by understanding the TQ principles,
assessing where their organisation is and where it wants to be and then
deciding what place TQ can, or should, have in their philosophy and
strategy.'
Just as important, the route taken by individual companies to improve
quality should be 'home grown' and internally developed. 'Companies need to
be objective but also to value the things they inherit from the past which
may differentiate them in the future.' For this self-assessment to be
effective, a company needs to benchmark its performance against worldwide
best practice, as Xerox and Motorola did in the US, and to listen carefully
to customers and employees.
The report concludes that, for most organisations, the ISO9000 and BS5750
standards are not the best way to launch a Total Quality programme. Although
the authors accept that the quality systems which they codify are important,
they suggest that starting a TQ programme with them is 'begining a process
of change with the bureaucracy of quality: it puts the cart before the
horse'.
As part of the year-long research programme, the Ashridge researchers
completed six case studies. These covered: Grundfos, the Danish group which
holds half of the world market in domestic water pumps; Nissan Motors'
Sunderland manufacturing plant; Club Med, the French holiday and leisure
company; Ciba-Geigy's Italian marketing, sales and distribution group; the
UK-based parcels operations of Federal Express; and ICL Product
Distribution, based in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, which is responsible for
the storage and distribution of the computer group's hardware, software and
literature.
The authors note that 'few areas of business activity suffer from as much
hype, exaggeration and confusion as Total Quality'. But while it would have
been easy to produce a damning report 'pointing to the gap between
aspiration and reality in many companies with TQ initiatives', they argue
this would have been a mistake, for an understanding of how TQ can be best
tackled is still developing.
The authors argue that there is 'a rich vein of experience' in companies
which have worked with TQ, from which others can learn how better to
implement TQ principles and improve competitive position.

FT  26 OCT 92 / People: Barclays' forex change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank has reshuffled the top management of its global foreign
exchange operation, bringing in Humphrey Percy, previously European managing
director for swaps and options, to replace Steve Mazloumian, who had been
doing the job for about a year.
Percy, who is just 35, has a different background from his predecessor.
Mazloumian was imbued with the traditional Barclays foreign exchange
culture, unlike Percy, who decided, in the early 1980s, that the emerging
futures and options markets were the most exciting place to be.
He acknowledges that 'senior management wanted a different approach', and
says his principal task is to accelerate the integration of Barclays'
200-strong global foreign exchange team by getting 'a more co-ordinated
approach'.
'If we are watching a particular level of the pound against the dollar for a
customer in London, it is important that we should be comfortable passing
this on to New York and to Tokyo round the clock,' he explains.
There are plans as well to place a greater emphasis on 'product development'
acknowledging that Barclays has not, for example, been in the forefront of
foreign currency option development.
'I want us to be able to deliver foreign currency options on a global
basis,' he says.
Overall, the bank was rated number three by foreign exchange customers in
this year's Euromoney's customer approval survey, behind Citibank, and
Chemical which has merged with Manufacturers Hanover.
When Percy left school, which was Winchester, he went straight to Schroders,
where he spent six years principally in the foreign exchange division,
including trading spot and forward forex.
He then moved, in 1980, to Barclays Merchant Bank, where he began to
familiarise himself with the range of off-balance sheet products.
In 1989 he was made European managing director of the global swaps and
options group.
He replaces Mazloumian, an experienced foreign exchange hand, who set up the
bank's dealing operation in Bahrain in 1978, and moved to Tokyo as chief
dealer a year later.
After a spell back in London in the mid 1980s he returned to Tokyo as
treasurer in 1987, coming back to London just over a year ago. Mazloumian is
now moved to head up the central bank liaison team.

<TEXT>
ULSTER'S political leaders and British and Irish ministers embark on another
round of bilateral talks early this week, knowing that both Unionist
delegations will be withdrawing from the talks before the November 16
meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, has said his delegation
will be withdrawing in the week prior to November 16 as the secretariat
servicing the conference will be back in operation.
In Belfast at the weekend Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader,
told his party's annual conference that he also regarded the November 16
meeting as the deadline.
Mr Molyneaux said: 'As far back as three years ago, both governments agreed
to suspend the Anglo-Irish conference and secretariat for the duration of
the talks. It was clearly accepted that if and when the two governments
terminate the suspension, they thereby terminate the talks.'
Most observers feel there is little chance of Unionists and nationalists
reaching agreement in the time left.
The three strands of the talks have been taking place alongside one another.
There has been wide-ranging discussion on possible structures for devolved
government in Northern Ireland, new north-south institutions and links
between London and Dublin, but there is little sign of agreement on the
horizon.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Legal-aid proposals stun lawyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a radical overhaul of the legal-aid system outlined at the weekend
by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, left solicitors stunned and confused.
Although details of the plans were not spelled out, the immediate reaction
of most solicitors at the annual conference of the Law Society  - the
solicitors' governing body - was that they would result in a dramatic
reduction in the number of people eligible for financial assistance and a
severe restriction on the right of clients to choose their own lawyer.
One lawyer predicted that the Lord Chancellor's vision of the future for
publicly funded legal services, concentrating blocks of work in the hands of
larger legal-aid firms, meant 'the end of the small practitioner within five
years'.
Lord Mackay told the Birmingham conference that escalating legal aid costs
and pressure on public expenditure meant no element of the system was
sacrosanct.
Legal-aid expenditure had doubled in the last four years and was likely to
reach Pounds 2bn by the middle of the decade. 'This rate of growth cannot be
allow to continue,' he said.
Lord Mackay confirmed that he would push ahead with the introduction of
standard fees for criminal legal-aid work by the end of the year and hoped
to extend standard fees to civil work soon. He outlined proposals designed
to ensure that legally aided clients were confronted with the cost of going
to court at the beginning of a case. Clients should pay higher levels of
contributions towards the costs of their cases and means testing for legal
aid should conform more with means testing for other benefits, he said.
Solicitors, rather than the Legal Aid Board, should be made responsible for
collecting contributions and competitive tendering for blocks of legal-aid
cases should be a long-term goal.
Solicitors were particularly alarmed by the proposal that they should be
responsible for collecting contributions.
Mr John Appleby, a member of the society's governing council, said that
might discourage litigation and would place an impossible financial burden
on legal-aid lawyers.
A significant proportion of clients already backed away from litigation when
they were told they would be expected to pay a contribution and a further 33
per cent who agreed to pay contributions subsequently defaulted.
If the burden of chasing up that money was passed to solicitors it would
turn them into 'debt collectors', he said.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Commons to review power sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND influential Com-mons select committee is to scrutinise aspects of
the power generating industry in England and Wales while the government is
conducting its review of coal mining and Britain's long-term energy
requirements.
The Public Accounts Committee will next month start to examine the
privatisation of the electricity generators PowerGen and National Power.
Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary at the Department of Trade and
Industry, will be among witnesses called by the committee, which is chaired
by Mr Robert Sheldon, the former Labour Treasury minister.
Although the principal focus of the committee's inquiries will be to assess
whether the government succeeded in maximising its proceeds from the sale,
the industry's future competitiveness in the light of the growing practice
among electricity distributors of building their own gas-fired power
stations is also expected to be scruti-nised.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is
meanwhile bringing forward his review of the way electricity distribution
companies buy their power supplies.
The Public Accounts Committee inquiry follows a favourable report on the
sale of the generators by the National Audit Office, the public-spending
watchdog, earlier this year.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Marching back in the limelight: TUC hopes for renewed
popular support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHERE does the trade union campaign against pit closures and unemployment go
after yesterday's demonstration in London?
If there really has been a sea change in popular attitudes to economic
management, as some union officials claim, how can the unions and the
opposition parties capitalise on it, bearing in mind that this government
may have more than four years left in office?
Officials are still torn between elation that they are once again at the
centre of things and anxiety that their regained status will slip away as
suddenly as it has reappeared.
The TUC itself is encouraged. Mr John Monks, deputy general secretary, said:
'Recent events have been a potent reminder to those writing us off that if
we did not exist we would have needed to be invented.'
The TUC has certainly been able to provide a focus for organising
demonstrations and publicity.
Some union leaders complain, however, that the TUC had to be pushed to
convene the emergency general council meeting on October 17. Moreover the
vulnerability of Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, over debates in
public has been underlined by recent events, rekindling private calls for
his de-parture.
One union official said: 'We will need judgment and leadership from the TUC
over the next few weeks if we are going to sustain this, and I fear it may
not be forthcoming.'
One difficulty is deciding how far the campaign can be broadened to include,
for example, opposition to rail privatisation or a public-sector wage
freeze, without losing public support.
More optimistic union officials point to the experience the TUC is gaining
as a broadly based lobbying organisation, rather than an adjunct to the
Labour party. Union leaders often talk of the importance of building
contacts in the Conservative party.
The clearest confirmation of the TUC's improved credibility - at least in
union circles - came when the executive of the non-TUC AEEU engineering and
electrical union let it be known last week that it would almost certainly
back a return to the TUC when its members voted early next year.
Bringing the Union of Democratic Mineworkers back into the TUC fold, after
its split from the National Union of Mineworkers after the 1984-85 strike,
would be even more useful - if possible.
The issue runs deeper than personalities - the UDM eventually broke away
over the NUM's centralisation of power.
The election for the leadership of the UDM next month may be a step towards
unity if Mr Roy Lynk, currently the leader, is replaced.
But the virtual absence of the UDM from Hyde Park yesterday is a reminder of
division at the heart of the pits campaign that may yet prove a fatal
weakness.

FT  26 OCT 92 / PM may be called in MPs' coal probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, may be summoned to appear before the
all-party trade and industry select committee during its investigation into
the coal industry and UK energy policy.
That follows weekend newspaper reports that Mr Major agreed to intervene
personally to obstruct a European Community initiative to block Colombian
coal imports on anti-dumping grounds during a south American visit this
summer. Downing Street said yesterday that the possibility of an
anti-dumping action had not been discussed and that it would be a matter for
the European Commission.
It acknowledged that energy had been on the agenda during the visit, which
included a trip to a BP oil rig.
The committee - under the chairmanship of Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour MP -
is set to begin its inquiry tomorrow by questioning Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary.
Mr Stan Orme, a former Labour energy spokesman who sits on the committee,
said yesterday that he planned to question Mr Heseltine on the Colombian
allegations. He would also ask Mr Heseltine whether it was true that the
government was 'deliberately encouraging' miners to take the redundancy
terms that were on offer.
Mr Caborn said yesterday that the committee's principal aims in tomorrow's
questioning would be twofold: to determine the reasoning behind the original
decision to lay off 31,000 miners; and to obtain an assurance that the
committee would not be refused access to information given to the government
during the course of its own inquiry.
'We don't want the government saying in January, 'If you had seen all this
information, you would have come to a different conclusion',' Mr Caborn
said.
He confirmed that the committee would be prepared to hear commercially
confidential evidence in camera.
The committee aims to finish its inquiry by mid December so that its report
can be prepared over the Christmas recess.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Post Office privatisation 'feasible'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION of the Post Office is feasible, in spite of earlier fears that
it might jeopardise the nationwide delivery network, Kleinwort Benson, the
government's adviser on the future of the service, has told ministers.
In a progress report for the Department of Trade and Industry, the merchant
bank says a regulated privatised Post Office could continue to deliver
letters to every address in the UK without charging more in rural areas.
It describes Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, which last year
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 266m, as a classic candidate for a flotation.
The less profitable Post Office Counters, which handles social security
payments, would be harder to sell separately. Kleinwort believes that in
spite of last year's Pounds 26m pre-tax profits, the division's network is
fundamentally uncommercial. One option is to float it off with Royal Mail.
While the study is only a first draft and contains no recommendations, it is
likely to strengthen the case for privatising the Post Office.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has emphasised the
government's commitment to a nationwide delivery service with a uniform and
affordable structure of prices. He also wants to encourage competition.
Kleinwort's report says those objectives are neither mutually exclusive nor
threatened by privatising the Post Office.
Competition could be encouraged by reducing the Royal Mail's monopoly on
letters costing less than Pounds 1 to a level closer to a first-class stamp
and by opening up its postal network to private couriers.
TNT, the Australian delivery company, and DHL, the international courier,
might seek to carry mail and, in rural areas, pay the Post Office to deliver
their letters on the final leg through Royal Mail.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Labour's tactics kept under wraps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MYSTERY and suspense are clearly Labour's tactics as the Commons nears
confrontation on the Maastricht treaty - whatever their tactics at the end
of that debate to pave the way for the return of the Maastricht Bill.
The Opposition decided last week that they would not give government whips
the comfort of being able to work on the basis of a known Labour stance.
That position was complicated slightly at the weekend with speculation that
the government might turn the issue into a matter of confidence. Mr John
Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said yesterday that if the motion was
one of confidence, it would be Labour's job to vote against it.
Amid those uncertainties, the shadow cabinet will discuss tactics at its
regular meeting on Wednesday.
Labour has a delicate task of balancing its views on Europe with its job in
the House, both in how it votes on the government motion and how it
expresses its views.
One option is that Labour could put down an amendment that simply regretted
that the government was proceeding with the Maastricht Bill before Denmark's
position on ratification was clear.
Such an amendment might appeal to some Tory Euro-sceptics, but it might also
make Labour more vulnerable to Tory charges of reneging on its commitment to
Europe.
Alternatively, it could put down an amendment expressing its broadly
pro-European stance and deploring once again the absence of the social
chapter from the version of the treaty agreed by the UK. That would deny it
any prospect of Tory rebel support on that particular vote, but would put
its position clearly on the record.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Parcelforce sale is studied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are examining aspects of European Community competition policy as
part of work on privatising Parcelforce, the loss-making parcel delivery arm
of the Post Office.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in July that the
government intended to privatise the organisation as soon as possible, but
ministers are conscious that Parcelforce stands to lose its exemption from
value added tax once it ceases to be part of the Post Office.
The issue has been highlighted by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, who
has written to Mr Heseltine, demanding a statement to the House of Commons
on how the government intends to deal with the loss of VAT exempt status.
He says that would mean Parcelforce customers facing rises of at least 17.5
per cent, and argues that losing VAT exemption would jeopardise the
profitability of the business, making it less attractive for potential
purchasers.
Parcelforce has the leading 34 per cent share of ordinary parcel deliveries
but only 2 per cent of the premium 'next-day' market. Its turnover for
1991-92 was Pounds 508m and it lost Pounds 24m.
Mr Heseltine indicated in the summer that the government would make
available financial support so that management and employees could make a
bid.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Euro-rebels try to outstare Major: The Revolt Over
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S presence at the 50th anniversary of the battle of El
Alamein, a turning point in the Second World War, offers an almost
irresistible comparison with the launch of his own counter-attack against
the band of Tory Euro-sceptic rebels.
But even before the hand-to-hand combat over the line-by-line scrutiny of
the Maastricht Bill, Mr Major has to win his vote in the paving debate in
the Commons on November 4. The skirmishing in the run-up to that debate
resembles not so much a battle as a game of poker - albeit with high and
ever-rising stakes.
The Euro-rebels are sceptical about the government's stomach for a fight.
They point to a catalogue of issues where the government has bowed to party
opinion: the resignation of Mr David Mellor; the pit closures programme and,
most significantly, the economy, with a change of priorities away from the
battle against inflation to the strategy for growth.
So, on past performance, the rebels may feel justified in dismissing as a
bluff the prospect of a general election if they play a winning hand and
delay the Maastricht Bill.
There has been a whiff of concession already on timing.
The decision to schedule the statement on public spending and a related
economic debate between the paving debate on Maastricht and the start of the
detailed discussion of the bill itself is clearly an attempt by ministers to
win over Tory backbenchers who believe that debating Maastricht instead of
the economy makes the Commons look irrelevant and out of touch.
Having won that concession even before last Thursday's rebellious meeting of
the backbench 1922 committee which voted to advise a delay in the discussion
of Maastricht, Tory Euro-sceptics might also ponder how far an election is
an ultimatum that Mr Major could deliver, even assuming he is not bluffing.
Over the past few days Mr Major has underlined that the policy on
Maastricht, to press ahead with the debate and with the bill, was agreed by
all the cabinet on Thursday and came not from him alone but from the
government collectively.
Coded messages in ministerial speeches at the Tory conference this month
suggested that not all ministers feel as committed to the agreement as Mr
Major. If the government were defeated in the debate next week there might
be Euro-doubting ministers who would distance themselves from present policy
by talking of 'opportunities' in the new situation, much as 'opportunities'
were found after sterling's hurried exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
In the event of a defeat in the Commons next week Mr Major might feel that
the government's authority had been so undermined that it should resign and
go to the country. But he would have to carry his cabinet colleagues with
him.
The powerful executive of the 1922 committee would also doubtless have views
on any decision to call an election unless the government had actually lost
a motion of confidence.
The question of bluff is not all on one side. As previous Tory revolts have
shown, rebels find it easier to talk up their concern than to vote against
the government.
Another possibility, and one the rebels have to take seriously, is that
defeating the government might lead to a change of leadership.
That is not a risk-free option for the Euro-rebels, in spite of their
bravado.
Senior ministers point out that Mr Major reflects the mood of the party on
Europe more closely than any of his cabinet colleagues. Any short-term
successor, such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Home Secretary, or even the
wounded Mr Michael Heseltine at trade and industry, would be more likely to
come from the Euro-enthusiast wing of the party. Baroness Thatcher's chances
of a comeback are regarded as non-existent - in spite of her continuing hold
over the Tory imagination.
As Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, warned at the Tory conference, the
danger if a less representative leader than Mr Major took over would be that
the party may tear itself apart.
That might mean an early election won by Labour. Even though individual
Euro-sceptics kept their seats, the incoming Labour government would adopt
the social chapter of the Maastricht agreement, which is certainly not part
of the Tory rebels' gameplan.
In the approach to the debate, Tory whips will be using their traditional
mixture of threats and promises to finesse a government victory, while
ministers also have some room for manoeuvre over the precise terms of the
motion. Not all the cards have been dealt and there is still all to play
for.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Sex bias found in work appraisals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POORLY designed per-formance appraisals can lead to sexual discrimination in
pay and promotion, according to a report funded by the Equal Opportunities
Commission.
The report, by the Institute of Manpower Studies, examined merit pay and
appraisal systems in a local authority, a finance company, a manufacturer
and a caterer.
Some of the schemes more than others unintentionally discriminated against
women. The IMS recommended that companies regularly monitor the allocation
of merit pay increases by sex, ethnic group, job level and length of
service.
In the finance company, the report said, male managers valued attributes
such as dynamism, assertiveness, motivation and ambition among the qualities
they sought in subordinates. Female managers valued flexibility,
perceptiveness and honesty. The report said such perceptions might influence
the opportunities open to women at a company with a male-dominated
management.
Women, the report said, tended to underestimate their skill levels. That
might mean they lost out in appraisals.
Findings also suggested that men at similar job levels and appraisal ratings
as women were more likely to be offered training and promotion.
Commenting more generally, the report said some schemes set performance
targets that were subjective and so open to discretionary judgment by
managers. Qualitative measures - such as awareness of client needs - were
more open to subjective judgments than quantitative measures such as sales
targets.

<TEXT>
LAURENTIAN Life, the life assurance company, confirmed yesterday that
Lautro, the industry regulator, had started an inquiry into the possible
sale of tens of thousands of unsuitable policies, Scheherazade Daneshkhu
writes.
The move follows a preliminary review of several hundred policies by Lautro,
which raised doubts that best advice had been given to customers. Unless the
review of a further 3,000 policies - by Tillinghurst, the consulting
actuaries - contradicts the Lautro findings, Laurentian Life will be asked
to review all policies sold by its tied agents.
Lautro, which earlier this year summoned the chairman of Laurentian, Lord
Marsh - a former cabinet minister - over the issue, is particularly
concerned about the sale of policies by tied agents who had not gathered
sufficient information about clients.
Lautro fears that Laurentian's salesmen have sold long-term savings plans -
which pay rich commission to them - to young people with no dependants and
that individuals have been transferred out of occupational pension schemes
to personal pensions with no good reason.
Mr Paul Stott, head of communications at Laurentian, denied reports that any
compensation to its clients would be 'financially disastrous'.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Shaken sales staff slip up on job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMAGE of hard-pressed salespeople fighting to fend off the recession by
working all hours and driving 'unbeatable' bargains is comprehensively
debunked by research published today.
Hard times are just as likely to mean that sales people lose confidence,
fear increasing rejection by their customers and harbour low expectations.
The picture of despondency and self-doubt is painted by Sales and Marketing
Solutions, a York-based consultancy that has monitored the activity of sales
teams in a dozen companies active across the UK during the recession.
According to the consultancy, instead of clocking up extra mileage in search
of a sale, the salesperson is quite likely to stay at home or to fill the
day doing anything but closing deals.
'The recession, therefore, becomes self-fulfilling,' says Mr Frank Atkinson,
senior partner in the consultancy. The company reports that a recent study
of one nationwide group showed a sales force only half as active in pursuing
deals as it had been in more buoyant periods.
'When times are good you can, to a large extent, get away with trusting your
salespeople to bring home the orders, but when times are bad, companies
cannot afford such a laissez-faire attitude.'
The company's research also suggests that during a recession, product prices
might be driven down by those responsible for selling, rather than by canny
customers.
According to Mr Atkinson: 'The buyer asks if the price can be reduced and
the sales person responds by trimming the price rather than defending the
company pricing structure.'
The report says the failure to negotiate effectively is driving down prices
and reducing UK profits unnecessarily.

FT  26 OCT 92 / London fares 'highest in EC'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST fares rise in London will make commuter travel costs in the
capital by far the most expensive in the European Community, according to a
survey by the Association of London Authorities.
A typical week of commuting will cost Pounds 16 in London after the 8.5 per
cent increase in bus, Tube and rail fares in January. The Labour-controlled
ALA says that is 36 per cent more costly than in Dublin, the next most
expensive city, where a similar pattern of journeys costs Pounds 11.77.
Other weekly fares based on similar journey patterns include Paris at Pounds
4.36 and Athens at Pounds 1.97.
When fares for single journeys are compared, London comes second to
Copenhagen as the most expensive city. But weekly commuters in the Danish
capital pay much less than their London counterparts because the Copenhagen
transport authorities give larger discounts to regular travellers.
The ALA's survey is based on the cheapest available way of making 10
commuter journeys of 6 miles or 10km. In London that counts as a three-zone
journey.
Currency conversions were carried out after the recent sharp devaluation of
sterling, which should have benefited London in the comparison. Conversely,
London's fares after next January's rises are compared with existing fares
in other capitals.
The main reason for the large gap between London's fares and those in other
EC capitals is the UK government's policy of requiring passengers not only
to cover the running costs of the transport system, but to make a
contribution towards investment in its renewal and expansion.
Other countries tend to keep fares low through government subsidies funded
by local employers, local authorities, national government or a combination
of the three.
The ALA said: 'Increasing fares all the time does nothing to encourage
people to swap their cars for public transport.'
It added: 'Fares policy should be part of a strategic transport policy for
London which encourages people to use public transport. Above-inflation
increase each year will not do this.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Fall in pay rises may be ending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID decline in pay settlements from the beginning of last year may
have bottomed out, according to the latest quarterly figures from the
Confederation of British Industry.
The figures show that the average pay settlement in the third quarter of
this year was 4.2 per cent, the same as in the second quarter and only
slightly down on the 4.4 per cent rise in the last quarter of last year.
Manufacturing pay settlements continue to hover just over 4 per cent, where
they have been for the past 12 months.
Both the government and the CBI will be disappointed by the latest figures,
especially since the discipline of the European exchange rate mechanism has
been lifted from pay bargainers and the public sector has been exhorted to
follow the example of the private sector.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said there were strong
indications that the next move on manufacturing pay would be downwards.
He pointed to the fact that one in seven of the CBI pay databank companies
had deferred a pay rise for six months.
He also cited a Gallup survey that found that 65 per cent of employees
expected their next settlement to be at or below the level of the last.
He added: 'Lower pay increases over the next year would help to control
inflation and put companies in a better position to take advantage of the
opportunities for exports and import substitution opened up by devaluation.'
CBI settlements in the service sector in the first half of this year are
slightly higher, at 4.4 per cent, but have fallen more rapidly, down from
7.1 per cent a year before.
Productivity growth for manufacturers settling in the third quarter was
estimated at 2.2 per cent - reflecting a downward recessionary trend -
giving an increase in unit labour costs of about 2 per cent.
That compares with a fall in unit labour costs of about 0.6 per cent in the
last quarter of last year, when productivity rose 5 per cent.
Average earnings in the economy as a whole continue to rise at about 5.75
per cent but that figure looks back over 12 months, including settlements
from summer last year, when inflation was higher, and includes overtime and
bonus payments not included in raw settlement figures.
Government ministers are arguing that public-sector employees should take
more of the strain on pay and are threatening a pay freeze and the possible
suspension of the pay review bodies which make recommendations on pay rises
for more than a third of public-sector workers, including nurses and
teachers.
Ministers point to the pay spurt that has taken average pay in the public
sector above that in the private sector for the first time since 1986. They
also point to the greater job security of most public-sector workers.
Critics of those arguments, such as Incomes Data Services, the independent
pay analysts, point to the fact that the public sector always does better in
a recession while the private sector pulls ahead in periods of rapid growth.
IDS also says that in spite of higher average pay in the public sector, both
blue-collar and white-collar workers are better paid in the private sector.
The higher average arises because the public sector includes a higher
proportion of white-collar workers, who are generally better paid than
manual workers.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Midlands fear on single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEST Midlands, regarded as the manufacturing heart of the UK, is not
expected to benefit particularly from the European single market, scheduled
for January 1, according to the region's local authorities.
It is expected 'to have above-average vulnerability' to the single market,
yet will remain highly dependent on exports and its ability to compete with
other European Community regions, says a study prepared by the authorities
to help in the planning of land use into the next century.
The worry of the local authorities is that older manufacturing areas in the
Birmingham-Black Country conurbation and Staffordshire have too few skills
available. 'By 2000 it has been estimated that 70 per cent of all European
jobs will require brain rather than manual skills, yet levels of academic
and skill attainment are relatively low in the west Midlands,' the report
says.
Although the demand of companies for skilled employees has fallen since the
start of the recession, the local authorities say restructuring of the
regional economy will be hampered by skills shortages.
The restructuring will involve a continuing decline in manufacturing
employment. The decline, swift in the recession of the early 1980s, slower
during the economic upturn of the late 1980s, has gathered pace again over
the past two years. During the 1990s, manufacturing employment will decline
by 20 per cent - 141,000 jobs - the local authorities estimated.
However, employment in the services sector is likely to rise by 9.6 per
cent, but that is less than the expected national average of 11.8 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 92 / LBS questions Tory inflation goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MONETARY policy is now too loose to enable the chancellor to achieve his
long-term goal of 2 per cent inflation and risks building up inflation,
according to a monetary policy indicator constructed by the London Business
School, Edward Balls writes.
A rise in inflation has already been factored into the LBS forecasts for the
economy. In its latest economic outlook, it predicts that retail price
inflation will fall to 3.3 per cent next year, then rise to 4.9 per cent in
1994 and 5.3 per cent in 1995.
The LBS monetary policy indicator is based on a weighted average of a number
of financial indicators: the short-term real interest rate, the change in
the exchange rate, monetary aggregates and the public-sector borrowing
requirement. LBS economists have examined the relationship between those
indicators and inflation over the past decade to see if policy is now
consistent with the chancellor's inflation target.
The indicator suggests that monetary policy was much tighter than was needed
to bring inflation down towards the end of last year and into this year.
Interest rates were still in double figures but inflation was falling fast,
so raising the real interest rate.
Sterling's recent depreciation and the fall of 2 percentage points in
interest rates since sterling left the ERM mean that policy is now too
loose. Present policies are consistent with a long-term inflation rate of
about 7 per cent, according to the LBS research.
'Achieving the 4 per cent goal would involve a considerable tightening of
monetary policy,' the report says. London Business School Economic Outlook

<TEXT>
JORDAN appears to be preparing to distance itself in unprecedented terms
from the Iraqi regime of President Saddam Hussein.
Palace and government officials in Amman are expressing alarm over the
deterioration of conditions within Iraq and fear the prospect of the
country's disintegration.
King Hussein is expected later this week to make his first speech since
returning home in late September to a triumphant welcome after cancer
surgery in the US. Diplomats say he may use the occasion to dissociate
himself publicly from the regime in Baghdad, while continuing to express
Jordan's support for the Iraqi people.
The palace and the government fear that Iraq is heading towards
fragmentation. 'We are afraid of the consequences of an Iraqi breakup. It
would be a black hole, sucking all the powers around it into a fracas,' said
Mr Kemal Abu Jabbar, the foreign minister.
Jordan is frustrated that Mr Saddam has ignored its appeals for policies
which could ease Iraq's international isolation, allow increased aid for its
beleaguered population and safeguard its territorial integrity.
Jordan's strong popular support for Baghdad during the Gulf crisis and
official opposition to the war which ousted Iraq from Kuwait were the most
vehement of any Arab country, leading to its own isolation from the US and
its Arab neighbours.
Nevertheless King Hussein, whose domestic popularity has soared since his
illness, may feel he has never been in a stronger political position to
distance himself from Mr Saddam. He has already had meetings in London last
month with Iraqi opposition figures.
A marked public shift away from the Saddam regime would help Jordan's
rehabilitation with the US and in particular Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, King
Hassan of Morocco is due to visit Jordan after talks in Jeddah. Diplomats
say King Hassan, who is also visiting other countries in the region, is on a
mission to heal Arab rifts caused by the Gulf crisis.
King Hussein has already had a public reconciliation with President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt when he visited Cairo after this month's earthquake. He has
also made it known he wishes to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Places in
Saudi Arabia to give thanks for his recovery during which he would hope to
see King Fahd.

MR KIM WOO-CHOONG, founder and chairman of Daewoo, South Korea's fourth
largest business group, has emerged as a possible candidate in December's
presidential election.
The New Korea Party (NKP), formed only last Friday by politicians aligned
with President Roh Tae-woo's majority faction in the ruling Democratic
Liberal Party (DLP), is considering offering him its nomination.
Mr Kim has not ruled himself out but has expressed doubts about entering
politics.
The NKP recently staged a party revolt in opposition to the DLP presidential
nominee, Mr Kim Young-sam, who heads another faction.
The conservative group has also contacted other prominent figures, including
Mr Park Tae-joon, former chairman of Pohang Iron and Steel.
Mr Kim Woo-choong and Daewoo have close political ties with the
administration of President Roh, who is constitutionally barred from running
again.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and former chairman of Hyundai, the nation's
biggest conglomerate, is also a candidate after forming the United People's
Party earlier this year.
Mr Chung and Mr Kim are bitter business rivals. The former alleges Daewoo
has largely prospered due to government support provided under Mr Roh and
his predecessor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first indication of whether the Japanese government has been weakened by
the unfolding power struggle over the leadership of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's largest faction will come late this week when the
government unveils political reform plans.
As the vicious infighting over the leadership of the Takeshita faction
continued unabated yesterday, Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said
the 18-point plan would not propose overhauling the electoral system. It is
likely to include measures to confiscate illegal political contributions.
Many analysts believe the costs of the electoral system, based on large
multi-member constituencies, is largely responsible for the prevalence of
political corruption.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, will outline the reforms to parliament
which reconvenes on Friday in response to the controversy over the Sagawa
Kyubin political contributions scandal.
The scandal prompted the power struggle in the Takeshita faction, which has
played a vital role in managing the passage of legislation through
parliament, after Mr Shin Kanemaru, its former chief was forced to resign.
Mr Kanemaru who wielded immense power within the LDP admitted receiving
Y500m (Pounds 2.5m) in illegal political contributions from Tokyo Sagawa
Kyubin trucking company.
The Miyazawa cabinet's popularity has slumped largely because of the scandal
and the ailing economy.
The vacuum created by Mr Kanemaru's departure has set off a struggle between
supporters of his chosen successor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, and an anti-Ozawa
group. Mr Ozawa and his backers are contesting the nomination last week of
Mr Keizo Obuchi as faction chief.
Parliament is likely to become the focus of the scandal, as Mr Noboru
Takeshita, the faction's founder, has promised to testify about his role in
the affair. Japan's political leadership would be further destabilised if
pressure mounted on him to resign.
Government officials are increasingly concerned that the infighting could
spill over to delay passage of legislation to enact the Y10,700bn emergency
public spending programme announced in August.
The economic programme could become embroiled in the power struggle partly
because Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, has aligned himself with the
Ozawa group.
About 86 per cent of parliamentary deputies are believed to want the
electoral system overhauled.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Patten raises stakes over Hong Kong's future: An
unprecedented contest is looming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP deterioration in relations between Britain and China over Hong
Kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets.
The territory's stock market opened this morning sharply lower. After half
an hour of trading the Hang Seng index was hovering just above 6,000, down
more than 245 points, continuing Friday's weaker trend. Analysts had
expected a decline in the market, which had recently risen strongly in
response to the economic policies announced by China's communist leaders.
Relations between the UK and China have deteriorated markedly since Mr
Patten, with the general support of the Hong Kong people, announced
proposals on October 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for
greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders.
Since then, the governor has repeatedly held out the possibility that he
will proceed with his plans even in the face of opposition from China -
marking a change in British policy towards Hong Kong and China. In the past
London has placed a priority on reaching agreement with Beijing.
Such a head-to-head contest between Beijing and Britain's governor in Hong
Kong would be without precedent in the colony. It would require from the
people of Hong Kong a defiance of Beijing which many of their business and
political leaders have been reluctant to make for fear of damaging their
interests.
Mr Patten presented his plans to officials in Beijing on a three-day visit
last week and told them he needed a decision by the end of the year. His
proposals were flatly rejected.
On Friday, Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, said Beijing
would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to
build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if Mr Patten proceeded
without China's agreement.
The airport and its associated infrastructure projects have been a running
sore in Anglo-Chinese relations since the project was announced, in the
aftermath of the June 1989 uprising in Beijing, as a confidence boosting
measure for the colony. Agreement to proceed with the HKDollars 163.5bn
project was only reached a year ago when Mr John Major, Britain's prime
minister, visited Beijing.
Since then China has found fault with two alternative financing proposals
put to it by the Hong Kong government. It claims that both are not
cost-effective and would put an onerous financial burden on the post-1997
government in Hong Kong - charges which find little support in Hong Kong's
financial community.
The government had already let 17 contracts worth HKDollars 19bn - HKDollars
3bn under budget. Mr Patten has said the government would do its best to
complete the project in the absence of the Chinese government's approval.
But Lu's threat, calculated to scare the international financial community,
could make it difficult for the government to raise external finance to fund
the project.
Lu held out little hope of agreement on either constitutional or airport
related matters. He claimed the governor's plans violated the 1984
Anglo-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the Basic Law, which will
act as Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. He also asserted Mr Patten's
plans ignored assurances given by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign
secretary, to Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, on the conduct of the
1995 polls.
In a robust performance before a special session of the Legislative Council
(LegCo) on Saturday, Mr Patten reissued his challenge to Beijing to respond
with constructive alternatives to proposals he made on October 7 for the
colony's political development.
The governor said he was prepared to discuss these alternatives with China
but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair, open and
command the support of the people of Hong Kong. They also had to be agreed
soon as legislation would have to be placed before LegCo early in the New
Year.
During the special sitting of LegCo, Mr Patten proposals were endorsed by
liberal politicians and some independents. Conservative politicians did not
declare their position. Some of the colony's newspapers also expressed
concern about China's reaction to the governor's proposals.
With an eye on these legislators, the governor reminded all members of LegCo
that it is they who will have to pass any legislation drawn up to provide
for the forthcoming elections. 'We should all be clear on where we stand,'
he said. 'Nothing can absolve members of this council from taking a view on
the future political development of Hong Kong.'
The proposals, which Mr Patten believes are consistent with Anglo-Chinese
agreements and Chinese law, provide for a greater, though still restricted,
application of democracy in the conduct of future elections.
Mr Patten denied that the UK had given China the undertakings Lu claimed. He
said he had no objection to letters from Mr Hurd and Qian being made public.
That decision, however, is not his.
The government is bracing itself for a further onslaught on Mr Patten's
plans from the colony's pro-Beijing press. Designed to undermine his public
support, these newspapers published more than 70 attacks on him and his
plans in the lead up to his visit to Beijing.
As China's attitude to the airport shows, it is prepared to sacrifice the
economic well-being of its people in response to a perceived threat to its
political authority.
Mr Patten, says his aides, knows this and does not plan to stand still.
According to aides, the governor believes he can carry the legislature; in
the event of failure to find agreement with China, they promise a publicity
campaign of the sort which prepared the colony for his policy speech. 'We
will not be neutral,' said one.
Mr Patten has said, however, that what he finally proposes has to be
'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong'. This condition allows him to change
his policies in line with his reading of public opinion and the reality in
LegCo. As another of his aides, speaking of the choices the Hong Kong people
now face, noted: 'It is their community after all.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Inflationary flaw may squander UK competitiveness BY By
Edward Balls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION is no longer the British government's enemy number one. Its
economic strategy, at least that of the prime minister, will now be
orientated towards reviving economic growth as soon as possible. To many
foreign observers, a volte face on this scale must seem astonishing. At
home, it is all depressingly familiar.
The government is not alone. The very same commentators and newspapers who,
only a few weeks ago, were warning of the grave inflationary dangers of
devaluation, are now arguing that deflation, not inflation, is the problem
and offering multi-point plans to save the nation.
The timing of these about-turns may well prove to be disastrous. The UK
needs a recovery, but an ordinary recovery will not do. Growth will be
sustained only if the economy is first rebalanced through a shift of
resources into the traded goods industries and out of the service sector.
The price of exportable goods must rise relative to the general level of
wages and prices in the whole economy, thereby boosting profit margins for
industry and encouraging investment and exports.
That is why devaluation was necessary. An exchange rate devaluation should
deliver a one-off rise in producer prices relative to wages. But if wage
inflation outstrips the sum of the growth rates of producer prices and
productivity, then the profitability and competitiveness gains will
disappear. Sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism and
subsequent depreciation by more than 10 per cent make it even more important
that inflationary expectations remain low.
It is not inevitable that the gains from devaluation must be squandered.
Both the US and Australia had much larger depreciations than Britain in the
mid-1980s: the value of the Australian dollar fell by 35 per cent in the two
years to the end of 1986 and the US dollar fell by 25 per cent, while
sterling fell by a little under 10 per cent.
But these dollar devaluations fed directly into improved competitiveness
rather than higher inflation. Producer prices have grown faster than wages
in the US and Australia: real wages have been falling by between 5 and 10
per cent since 1985 as the top right chart shows. In the UK, by contrast,
real wages have soared - by 26 per cent over the same period - while UK
profit margins remained low by international standards.
Little wonder that both the US and Australia have seen their export sectors
grow while the British traded goods sector remains small and sickly. US
export volumes have grown 22 per cent faster than import volumes since 1985.
Australian exports have grown 16 per cent faster than imports. But UK export
volumes have fallen by 9 per cent relative to import volumes over the same
period.
Why did the US and Australian devaluations succeed? Both countries have
similar financial systems to the UK so the answer cannot be Anglo-Saxon
short-termism. The US is a large country in which trade plays a relatively
small role in the economy and trade unions are weak. But Australia, like the
UK, is a small and open economy in which changes in import prices have a
significant effect on living standards and where trade unions remain
powerful. The difference is that Australia, unlike the UK, has had much less
plant-level bargaining. Instead, a series of national accords, agreements
between the unions and the government over the sustainable rate of wage
inflation, have kept real wage growth under control.
In political terms, the UK strategy seems to make sense. The top right-hand
chart goes a long way to explain why the British government was re-elected
last April while President Bush and Australia's Labor administration are in
danger of losing power. Little wonder that the Australian government is now
encouraging a shift towards enterprise bargaining.
Yet politics is the enemy of progress. Mr Major will be able to offer a
sustainable economic recovery only if he delivers slow real wage growth over
the next few years. But then he would probably lose the next election. That
is the depressing political logic of his U-turn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE embattled Russian government of Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar yesterday
received desperately needed support from heads of the country's biggest
industrial enterprises in return for a promise to consult business leaders
when formulating government policy.
Mr Gaidar, accompanied by six senior cabinet ministers, told a meeting of 60
industrialists that he would today sign a decree establishing a council of
industrial leaders which would be consulted on elaborating government
policy.
A statement of support from the industrialists implicitly repudiated the
more aggressive stance taken by Mr Arkady Volsky, the head of a big
industrialists' lobby group who co-chairs the country's leading opposition
movement.
The meeting in Togliatti, the home of Lada cars and other large industrial
concerns, was part of a last-ditch government campaign to attract support
from industry.
The ministers announced concessions to placate some of the managers'
complaints.
From January profits ploughed back into capital investment will be free from
tax. In addition, parts and raw materials ordered before but delivered after
the imposition of new import taxes would be exempt from taxation. But Mr
Gaidar also appealed for managers to limit price increases and said a policy
of endless new credits from the government would lead nowhere.
He also announced that he enjoyed, at least for now, the full confidence of
President Boris Yeltsin, despite demands from a vociferous conservative
opposition for the removal of his reformist cabinet when the Russian
parliament convenes on December 1.

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by the supporters of the former communist president of Tajikistan,
Mr Rakhmon Nabiyev, to return him to power appeared last night to have
failed.
A report on Russian television, quoting a Tajikistan government adviser,
claimed that the capital, Dushanbe, was again under the control of the
republic's government, headed by acting President Akbarsho Iskandarov.
Troops loyal to Mr Nabiyev, who was forced from office at gunpoint last
month, earlier yesterday seized much of the city. But the television report
said the soldiers had now left the parliament and presidential palace which
they had occupied at dawn on Saturday.
However, other reports from Dushanbe said it was not clear if the rebels had
totally abandoned the parliament building and added that shooting
accompanied their withdrawal from the city centre.
As the fighting raged yesterday, the Russian government predicted
'catastrophic consequences' in former Soviet Central Asia if the fighting
continued in Tajikistan because it could encourage ethnic and religious
instability in countries in the other Central Asian countries.
The US closed its embassy after weeks of threats against its employees.
Leaders of the two-day assault against the capital said they wanted to
restore order to the country.
They complained it had been seized by 'a puppet government backed by the
Islamic fundamentalists'.
The fighting in Dushanbe over the weekend included an attack on its main
mosque, which is the headquarters of Qazi Ali Akbar Toradzon Zoda,
Tajikistan's paramount Islamic leader.
Mr Zoda, a moderate with ties to all of Tajikistan's warring factions, has
long been viewed as the country's most influential political leader.
Last month a coalition of pro-Islamic and secular democratic political
parties took power after protesters forced Mr Nabiyev to quit and sent him
to exile in the northern region of Leninabad.
The fighting in Tajikistan, which began soon after the Soviet Union
dissolved last December, involves two rival ethnic groups that back opposing
political factions. The weekend assault came from the conservative southern
region of Kulyab, whose population largely supports Mr Nabiyev. Forces
defending the government are mostly from mountainous Garm, a relatively poor
area where Islam remained strong throughout the 70-year Soviet period.
John Lloyd adds from Moscow: Mr Gaidar Aliev, president of the autonomous
republic of Nakhichevan - an area under the control of Azerbaijan but
located in a corner of Armenia  - said yesterday that units from Azerbaijan
attempted to stage a coup against him but had been beaten back.
The Popular Front, the ruling party in Azerbaijan, has been at loggerheads
with Mr Aliev for some months. Mr Aliev, a former leader of the Azerbaijan
Communist party, said he would now discuss outlawing the Popular Front in
Nakhichevan.

VOTERS in the Baltic republic of Lithuania went to the polls yesterday to

The result is expected to be a close one. The main contenders are the
Sajudis nationalist group of Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the parliamentary
chairman, which achieved independence for the country, and the Democratic
Labour party under the former communist leader Mr Algirdas Brazauskas.
In all, 17 parties are standing for the Sejm, or parliamentary assembly.
The country is in the grip of severe fuel shortages and an economic crisis,
with unemployment expected to climb sharply this winter.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Havel undaunted by failure of federalism: The former
president's plans for a comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY the 0001 licence plate on the BMW occasionally parked in front of the
decrepit three-floor house in Prague betrays any sign of the importance of
its resident.
Back in his modest home since he resigned as federal president in July, Mr
Vaclav Havel has not lost sight of the presidential castle. In recent weeks,
he has been staging his political comeback as the future president of an
independent Czech republic. The last champion of the Czechoslovak
federation, forced by Slovak nationalist aspirations to abandon his dream of
a united and prosperous country, does not admit failure.
'We must come to terms with the fact that things don't always come out the
way we would want them to. I have experienced many such failures and defeats
and shall experience them again, but it will not prevent me from striving
again and again for certain values' he said in an interview with the
Financial Times.
After two years of struggling with the divisions ripping his country apart,
Mr Havel is hoping to return to his role of consensus builder - this time
within the Czech lands.
As the only presidential candidate endorsed by all Czech political parties,
Mr Havel is offering himself as a mediator to mend growing differences over
the future shape of the 10m-strong Czech nation.
Unlike Slovak parliamentarians who promptly declared their republic's
sovereignty after last June's elections and adopted a local constitution,
Czech politicians have been deadlocked over the creation of their state.
Constitutional negotiations have been bogged down particularly by the
demands of opposition parties for a three-pronged administration in which
the northern and eastern regions of Silesia and Moravia would enjoy an
autonomous status. Such fragmentation is rejected by the ruling coalition
parties, led by the Civic Democratic Party of Mr Vaclav Klaus, which favours
a structure decentralised among a greater number of regions.
Unless consensus is reached, the Czech nation could find itself without the
constitutional framework needed to assume its independence which, following
the post-electoral negotiations between Mr Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his
Slovak counterpart, is scheduled for January 1, 1993.
Mr Havel's power will continue to rest on the will of Czech parliamentarians
who are yet to decide whether he will be elected directly, as he wishes, or
with a parliamentary vote, as the ruling parties advocate. The presidential
election could then take place next spring. Czech deputies will also decide
on the presidential powers, which could be limited if Mr Klaus's views
predominate.
Mr Havel speaks admiringly of President Richard von Weizsacker of Germany
but says he does not wish to hold only a titular role in Czech politics.
Yet critics say that the former playwright cannot have it both ways. The
reluctance of Mr Havel to step into the world of practical politics and form
his own party-driven power base contradicts his political ambitions, they
say.
Faithful to his intellectual past, Mr Havel rejects pure pragmatism. 'People
need to hear something about the meaning of life; something about their
prospects; something more than money. . . shocked by sudden freedom though
not able yet to build their own civic society, they tend to be more or less
drawn towards authoritarian leaders. However, I see it as one of the many
stages of the complicated post-communist development.'
But he is closer today to practical politics than is indicated by his
earlier political philosophy, which attempted to marry morals and public
office. The virulent advocate of citizens' rights no longer even calls for a
referendum on his country's division.
'Alienation from high politics is something that can be observed to a
smaller or greater extent in all democracies. Here, it is sharpened by the
fact that our democracy is so young and inexperienced. But the Czech and
Slovak voters elected leaders with clear programmes and should not be
surprised once they implement them, even if it is difficult for them to come
to terms with the fact that Czechoslovakia will cease to exist within less
than 70 days.'

FT  26 OCT 92 / Peace negotiators build Balkan castles in the air: Time and
the Bosnian winter are pressing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS almost two months since Mr Cyrus Vance, former US secretary of state,
and Lord Owen, former British foreign secretary, were appointed as joint
international mediators for ex-Yugoslavia. There has been no discernible
improvement for the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The fighting continues, thousands are still being forced from their homes in
renewed 'ethnic cleansing' by all three communities, and the besieged
inhabitants of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, face death this winter from
cold, hunger and disease.
Yet in the makeshift offices of the International Conference on Former
Yugoslavia in the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, there is cautious
optimism. The feeling is that a peaceful solution is possible before winter
is out. Brick by brick, negotiators say, construction of that peace has
begun.
The immediate goal of Mr Vance and Lord Owen as conference co-chairmen has
been to stop the fighting in Bosnia and lift the Serb blockade of Sarajevo
and other Bosnian cities. Given the refusal of the world community to
intervene militarily in the Bosnian conflict, they are operating what levers
they have.
First, they have used their personal authority, contacts and (in contrast
with the ill-fated Carrington talks) concerted international backing to win
the confidence of all sides and to try to get them talking to each other and
to the co-chairmen. 'We are not here to take sides but to find a solution as
rapidly as possible,' Mr Vance said recently.
Though the mainly Moslem Bosnian government refuses to meet the Bosnian Serb
leadership face to face, last week it ended its boycott of talks on the
demilitarisation of Sarajevo. The Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
also met Yugoslav president Dobrica Cosic face-to-face for the first time.
Second, the two mediators have laid great stress on normalising relations
between Croatia and the rump federal republic of Yugoslavia, consisting just
of Serbia and Montenegro. This reflects not only the need to defuse possible
flashpoints, for instance, in the Serb-controlled UN protected areas of
Croatia or the Prevlaka peninsular, but also to enlist the leaders' active
backing for an ethnically mixed Bosnian state.
Inducements include international economic aid to rebuild their shattered
economies and the lifting of sanctions on and diplomatic recognition of what
remains of Yugoslavia.
Third, the two co-chairmen, and the constitutional broker for Bosnia, Mr
Martti Ahtisaari, have told all three warring factions that there can be no
partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina on ethnic lines and no 'green line'
separating communities in Sarajevo.
The draft constitution that the co-chairmen plan to publish tomorrow
envisages a single secular Bosnian state within existing borders, divided
into regions or provinces with a high degree of local autonomy.
The constitution will include strong protection for human rights and there
may be some provision for international human rights monitoring during the
transition phase. 'The local governments will be able to safeguard ethnic
rights, such as education and culture, with protection for minorities,' says
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the co-chairmen.
The three parties are now wrangling over maps, both in Geneva and, to an
extent, in fighting on the ground. The Bosnian government, which had wanted
a unitary state, says it could accept 8-10 provinces, enshrining Moslem
majorities in key Bosnian towns. The Bosnian Serbs, having been told that
three ethnic cantons are out of the question, want as few separate regions
as possible.
Mr Ahtisaari says that whatever the eventual number there can be no neat
slicing of Bosnia on ethnic lines. Even now, for instance, though Bosnian
Serbs claim to control 70 per cent of the territory, the mainly Moslem
government holds Bihac in the north-west, as well as Sarajevo and some other
towns to the east.
Moreover, the constitutional principles drawn up (and accepted by all sides)
at the London conference on ex-Yugoslavia at the end of August include the
right of people to return to their homes. Though no one expects all those
expelled to go back (deterred by memories, fear and the destruction of homes
and property), some, perhaps many, will choose to do so if conditions are
right. Areas claimed, say, by Serbs as 'theirs' may not remain so.
While the fighting and suffering continues in Bosnia, all this may seem pie
in the sky. Many believe the outcome of the Geneva negotiations can only be
an acceptance of the fait accompli achieved by Bosnian Serbs militarily. The
negotiators in Geneva reject this view, while arguing that within the basic
principles the three sides must reach their own accommodation.
Equally, there is a hard-headed appreciation that the negotiations could
fail. Gains by hardliners in the Belgrade power struggle, continued
insistence by the Bosnian government on trying to win back territory by
force, or refusal by Serb and Croat warlords in Bosnia (and Serb-controlled
Croatia) to toe the line, could bring the fragile edifice crashing down.
'The co-chairmen will give it their best shot,' says one insider. 'But if by
January there's no imminent prospect for a settlement, they're unlikely to
stick around.' Mr Ahtisaari's leave of absence from running Finland's
foreign service expires next February. Time, and the bitter Bosnian winter,
are pressing.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Italian bank chief warns on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, warned over the
weekend that the Italian economy remained exceptionally fragile despite the
decision to lower the discount rate by one percentage point, to 14 per cent,
effective as of today.
Addressing the annual meeting of the Foreign Exchange Association he said
the next six months would be decisive in determining whether the correct
policies could be implemented. 'During the next six months everything is at
stake.'
The Forex meeting has traditionally been the occasion for one of the
governor's two set-piece statement's on the economy. Mr Ciampi did not mince
his words and reminded the government, political parties, business and
unions that each had to play their part in holding down inflation, ensuring
the 1993 budget was rigorously observed and advantage was taken of the
lira's devaluation.
He laid special emphasis on the fight against inflation following the lira's
16 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark and its float outside the
Exchange Rate Mechanism.
'If we are not able to take advantage (of the opportunity presented by
devaluation), and the increase in prices is translated into real inflation,
then we will have lost an historic opportunity.'
Inflation in October has continued its downward trend and is hovering near
an annual 5 per cent. However, the effect of devaluation has yet to work
through the economy and already a number of industrialists and businesses in
the food sector are trying to raise prices.
Mr Ciampi was cautious about a further, quick, reduction in interest rates,
even though real rates remained high. He also warned the banking system that
the central bank would monitor carefully the use of credit, to avoid it
being used speculatively.
Referring to the parity of the lira, he said it was 'manifestly
under-valued'. However, he gave no indication when he thought the lira might
be in a position to re-enter the ERM.

CODELCO, the Chilean state copper company and the world's biggest copper
producer, plans to sell its power plant in the Atacama desert to finance
development of a new Dollars 450m (Pounds 276m) copper mine.
Mr Maximo Pacheco, Codelco's operations vice-president, said the company
hoped to raise Dollars 530m from the sale of the 530MW coal-fired power
station at Tocopilla.
He said Chilean and Argentine utilities were interested in the purchase, as
Tocopilla powered the two biggest copper mines in the world, Chuquicamata
and La Escondida, as well as cities in northern Chile.
The decision, which amounts to privatisation of one of Codelco's divisions,
is highly controversial. Codelco's public ownership is enshrined in the
Chilean constitution and has been an article of faith since the industry was
nationalised in the 1970s. But Codelco executives argue that the
constitution refers only to the state company's copper deposits.
The sell-off is certain to meet opposition from the powerful copper workers'
union. 'We have assurances from the mining minister that Tocopilla will not
be sold,' says Mr Adrian Astubillos, a union leader at the power plant. Any
backtracking would provoke the 19,000-strong union into taking strike
action, he said.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Capital flows to Latin America trigger problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in capital flows last year to Latin America caused problems
for economic management in many countries, the InterAmerican Development
Bank says in a report on economic and social progress published today.
A more gradual and sustainable influx would have been preferable, the bank
adds.
Capital inflows to the region, estimated last year at Dollars 36bn (Pounds
22bn), had reached levels the IADB had assumed would not occur until the end
of the century. Such flows had repercussions, some negative, on interest
rates, money supply, inflation, interest rates and wages.
In principle, the inflows of capital were beneficial as they relieved the
decade-long constraint on investment and production caused by a lack of
foreign exchange. However, in many countries the inflows meant governments
had to either let real exchange rates appreciate and absorb the inflows
through imports, or maintain the exchange rate and allow foreign exchange
reserves to rise.
Expanding reserves threatened monetary stability and had to be offset by
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies. If monetary policies were too
stringent, however, the resultant high interest rates initiated a new round
of capital inflows.
Mexico probably struck the best balance, the report says, by running a
fiscal surplus which in 1991 allowed the government to pay back debt and
continue to lower interest rates. Colombia had the greatest difficulty in
dealing with the problem; in 1991 its foreign exchange reserves reached 16
months of imports, the highest in the region.
Attempts by, for instance, Colombia's central bank to mop up extra liquidity
have counteracted a general trend to lower real interest rates. Such rate
rises meant there had been 'no visible benefit of the inflows of capital to
the national economies in terms of increased investment or faster growth'.
The combination of real exchange rate appreciation, lower inflation and
reduced unemployment allowed for a recovery of real wages in the region in
1991.
Overall, the report presents a fairly positive outlook for continued capital
inflows, provided the region's integration into the world economy continues.
'Although there has been much talk lately of a worldwide capital shortage,
this shortage is unlikely to affect Latin America as long as profit
opportunities abound and the rate of return exceeds that in the industrial
countries.'
However, it was too early to say for sure whether the positive transfer of
resources to the region brought about by the capital inflows was a durable
or transitory phenomenon.

Hopkins University Press, 701 West 40th Street, Baltimore, Md. 21211, USA.

CANADA'S political leaders have made a last-ditch appeal for a disgruntled
electorate to endorse a landmark package of constitutional reforms in a
referendum today. They warn that rejection could lead to years of
uncertainty and, possibly, the break-up of the country.
Although support for the proposed reforms appears to have solidified in
recent days, almost every opinion poll suggests the No vote will win by a
comfortable margin in at least two key provinces, Quebec and British
Columbia.
The referendum question asks voters whether they agree that the constitution
should be 'renewed' on the basis of the package known as the Charlottetown
Accord.
The overall outcome will be less important than the vote in individual
provinces, as the Charlottetown deal requires ratification by all 10
provincial legislatures.
A No vote in one or two small provinces could probably be overcome, but
political observers agree that the agreement must be approved by Quebec,
Ontario and a clear majority of the other eight provinces to have any chance
of implementation.
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney insisted over the weekend that the
government's private polls still showed a large number of undecided voters,
especially in Quebec.
The Yes side was helped - although probably only slightly - by a frenzy of
Canadian patriotism unleashed by the Toronto Blue Jays victory in the World
Series baseball championships on Saturday night.
Mr Mulroney said that a No victory would encourage Mr Jacques Parizeau,
leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, 'to stir up divisiveness and
turmoil about Canada, here and abroad, thereby affecting investment
decisions'.
Mr Donald Getty, premier of Alberta, added that rejection of the agreement
could also, in the long run, encourage Canada's western provinces to break
away from the rest of the country and strengthen their ties with the US.
The Charlottetown agreement provides, among other things, for constitutional
recognition of Quebec's 'distinct' francophone identity, greater
representation for western and Atlantic provinces in a revamped Senate, and
the transfer of some powers from federal government to provinces.
The carefully balanced deal is backed by a wide spectrum of the country's
political, business and labour leadership, including the heads of all three
leading political parties and the 10 provincial premiers.
Its critics range from Quebec separatists who say the agreement gives too
little autonomy to the province, to western Canadians who object to 'special
status' for Quebec, and staunch federalists, such as former prime minister
Mr Pierre Trudeau, who say the agreement will weaken the central government.
In addition, many voters are expected to use the referendum as an
opportunity to vent their unhappiness over the state of the economy and the
performance of Mr Mulroney's government.
Many of those voting No, especially outside Quebec, are not convinced that
rejection of the deal will lead to the break-up of the country or to
anything more than short-term volatility in financial markets.

SLOVAKIA began damming the river Danube at the weekend to divert the river
into the controversial Gabcikovo hydroelectric barrage. The move prompted
furious diplomatic protests from neighbouring Hungary which is resisting the
project.
Slovak trucks began dumping rocks into the river after negotiations with
Hungary in Brussels last week under European Community auspices broke down
in acrimony.
Budapest reacted immediately by saying it was turning to the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and invoking the international
crisis procedures previously applied to the former Yugoslavia.
Hungary also fired off an appeal to the International Court of Justice in
The Hague even though Czechoslovakia has refused its jurisdiction.
Slovak and Hungarian negotiators will meet again next week as part of the
Visegrad central European group's talks with the EC, which are expected to
be overshadowed by the dam dispute.
Germany is understood to be exerting strong pressure on the Czechoslovak
government to exercise its authority over Slovakia while the country remains
united and to freeze construction work until there is a negotiated
settlement.
But Slovakia's decision to move ahead with the final stage of construction,
which will result in the diversion of the main flow of the Danube in the
next few days, makes agreement all but impossible.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Italian economy remains fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, warned over the
weekend that the Italian economy remained exceptionally fragile despite the
decision to lower the discount rate by one percentage point, to 14 per cent,
effective as of today.
Addressing the annual meeting of the Foreign Exchange Association he said
the next six months would be decisive in determining whether the correct
policies could be implemented.
The Forex meeting has traditionally been the occasion for one of the
governor's two set-piece statement's on the economy. Mr Ciampi did not mince
his words and reminded the government, political parties, business and
unions that each had to play their part in holding down inflation, ensuring
the 1993 budget was rigorously observed and advantage was taken of the
lira's devaluation.
He laid special emphasis on the fight against inflation following the lira's
16 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark and its float outside the
Exchange Rate Mechanism.
'If we are not able to take advantage (of the opportunity presented by
devaluation), and the increase in prices is translated into real inflation,
then we will have lost an historic opportunity.'
Inflation in October has continued its downward trend and is hovering near
an annual 5 per cent. However, the effect of devaluation has yet to work
through the economy and already a number of industrialists and food sector
businesses are trying to raise prices.
Mr Ciampi was cautious about a further, quick, reduction in interest rates,
even though real rates remained high. He gave no indication when he thought
the lira might re-enter the ERM.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Plea on emerging economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER co-operation is needed between export credit agencies, private
lenders and investors if developing countries and those of east and central
Europe are to meet their huge requirements for new infrastructure in the
1990s, according to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance
(IIF).
The institute, which speaks on behalf of international banks, said both
private and official lenders would also have to re-examine lending criteria
and develop new financing and risk-sharing techniques, particularly since
many developing countries were privatising state-owned enterprises.
The need to address these issues was especially urgent because of the sharp
rise expected in the 1990s of investment spending in developing countries.
The IIF's proposals, which stem from a study of banks, corporations, trading
companies and insurance groups, suggest that:
Export credit agencies should establish guidelines to extend, where
necessary, grace periods before loan repayments start coming due and the
payback periods for loans. Current maximum terms are insufficient for
projects where economic returns are only made over a longer period. More
flexibility should be introduced for interest payments, currently payable on
a strict semi-annual basis, while agencies should allow their guarantees to
be securitised by banks and transferred to others. Agencies should develop
new forms of support for banks as fixed-rate lenders by recognising the role
of interest rate swaps and other derivative products in the markets.
Agencies should standardise cover to allow easier negotiation of credits for
projects where companies from more than one country are providing goods,
services and products.
Agencies should be willing to provide increased political risk insurance.
Greater standardisation of premium rates among export credit agencies is
required.
National bank regulators should apply more equal treatment of transactions
guaranteed by export credit agencies, and adopt a more flexible attitude to
the provisions required.

FT  26 OCT 92 / French case on grain undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH grain exports will suffer almost as much under European Community
farm policy reform, which Paris has already agreed to, as they would under
US demands on grain exports, according to projections from an official
French institute.
A chief cause of the deadlock in the Gatt trade liberalisation talks is the
US demand that the Community should cut the volume of its subsidised cereal
exports by 24 per cent over six years. France has refused to agree to this.
However, EC grain exports will fall to 14.8m tonnes a year by 1996 because
of reductions agreed under the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, according to
estimates by Insee, the French government economic research arm, in a report
published today.
Its forecast is just under 1m tonnes more than the level of subsidised EC
grain exports envisaged by the US in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt.
The Insee projection appears to undermine the French government's case that
French cereal exporters, by far the largest in the Community, would be worse
off under a Gatt deal than under the CAP reform.
France objects particularly that the US wants the grain exports cut made
from the level in 1986-88 when, according to the Insee report, EC cereal
exports averaged only 18m tonnes. Since then such EC exports have climbed to
nearly 28m tonnes a year.
But even a 24 per cent cut from the 1986-88 level would bring EC grain
exports to not much below 14m tonnes a year.
EC officials in Brussels have been trying to put the same message as Insee
across to Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy's government, but without much
success so far.
The beleaguered Socialist government evidently hopes a tough stand on Gatt
will help it in next March's legislative elections.
The Insee report, however, suggests that EC and French farmers might have
difficulty selling even a reduced amount of grain exports in competition
with US farmers, if subsidies were reduced.
It claims US agriculture is more productive than any national farm sector
inside the EC, except that of the Netherlands; over the 1973-89 period, US
farmers were 30 per cent more productive than the average European farmer.
American farmers' competitive edge over their EC counterparts is reflected
in the fact, says Insee, that overall their farm prices were 20 per cent
lower than in Europe between 1973-89, with US oilseeds and animal feed
prices nearly half those in Europe.
US farmers benefit from lower costs of land, petrol, fertiliser, and
vegetable inputs into animal feed than in Europe, the French organisation
says.
But CAP reform, it adds, will make French farmers better off than they would
otherwise be in the absence of reform. As a result of direct aid in
compensation for lower EC prices, the average French farmer will see his
income rise by 10 per cent over five years, whereas without the CAP changes
agreed this summer he would gain only 5 per cent over that period.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Bundesbank 'aiming for lower rates'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundesbank is deliberately manoeuvring interest rates down
because their high level no longer corresponds to the deteriorating economy,
according to a member of its governing council.
Dr Wilhelm Nolling, a Social Democrat who is also president of the Hamburg
state central bank, said 'all the figures show that Germany is moving into a
recession. . . . On this occasion it could be very long-lasting and very
deep'.
The interest rate moves amounted to a clear turning point in German monetary
policy, but the Bundesbank had to move carefully, he said.
In an interview in today's Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper, Dr Nolling said
there were still significant risks for monetary stability. They included
excessive money supply growth, wage negotiations, and a possible sharp
increase in consumer spending before next January's 1 percentage point
increase in VAT.
'Because of this, the Bundesbank must act very carefully, consistently and
credibly in the pace of its interest rate cuts,' he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Otmar Issing, a leading member of the Bundesbank council and
head of research, said at the weekend that western Germany was not in
recession and its economy would grow by 1.5 per cent this year.
However, he acknowledged there had been a 'perceptible slowdown' of economic
growth, mainly because of a lack of demand for German products abroad. This
was leaving an ever-clearer mark on the west German economy.
His comments, made during a lecture in Edinburgh, come as evidence mounts of
stagnation in the whole economy. Retail sales and industrial orders have
fallen for the sixth consecutive month and several large companies have
announced job cuts.
Mr Issing made no comment on the future orientation of monetary policy.
However, a report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading German
newspaper, on Friday suggested the Bundesbank had given the impression at a
meeting between senior Bundesbank officials and economists of Germany's
larger banks last week that it was committed to further cuts in short-term
interest rates.
In his address in Edinburgh, Mr Issing said that although recent figures
showed real GDP in western Germany in the second quarter dropped by 0.5 per
cent compared with the first quarter, it exceeded GDP for the second quarter
of last year by 'a good 1 per cent'.

FT  26 OCT 92 / EC-US farm talks restarted in effort to avert trade war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community and US officials restarted detailed talks at the weekend
to try to resolve the farm exports disputes that threaten a damaging trade
war.
Officials in Brussels said it was hoped the urgent contacts would pare EC-US
differences enough for Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr
Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, to clinch a deal.
The contacts follow the breakdown of US-EC talks last week. The deadlock
heightened fears of a collapse in efforts to liberalise world trade under
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It also
spurred moves for the US to impose punitive tariffs on some EC exports.
Mr MacSharry phoned Mr Madigan at the weekend to try to set a date for
resuming talks at a political level. A spokesman for Mr Madigan said a
meeting between the two men was possible on Wednesday, but only if agreed
compromises remained intact and if the weekend talks between officials made
progress.
'They are not likely to meet if it is to renegotiate things previously
agreed to,' he said.
Mr MacSharry continued rallying support in EC capitals and within the
European Commission for his bargaining stance, which the French government
and Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, look set to challenge as going
beyond Brussels' negotiating mandate from the 12.
When EC farm ministers meet in Luxembourg today, France is expected to make
strenuous efforts to rein in Mr MacSharry.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's agriculture minister, yesterday met his
counterparts from six EC countries, including Britain, to try to forge a
common position on the negotiations.
French officials say the Socialist government could fall if a Gatt trade
deal puts formal restraints on wheat exports. Some 60 MPs among government
supporters are vulnerable to France's powerful farm lobby.
Detailed weekend phone talks were between Mr Guy Legras, head of the EC
commission's agriculture directorate, and Mr Joe O'Mara from the US
agriculture department. The two may meet in Brussels or Paris.
They must try to narrow differences on the level of EC oilseeds output, on
subsidised EC cereals exports and on cheap US cereal substitutes.
President George Bush, meanwhile, attacked Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic
rival for the US presidency, over reports that Clinton campaign officials
were working to stall an EC-US accord.
'If the Clinton campaign is going over to Europe interfering with an
agreement that would benefit all American agriculture, it is a sorry,
pathetic thing to be doing a few days before the election,' Mr Bush said.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Tory Euro-rebels renew defiance over Maastricht: Major may
call election if debate is lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY REBELS renewed their defiance over the bill to ratify the Maastricht
treaty yesterday in spite of an apparent ultimatum from Mr John Major that
the future of the government itself was at stake.
Leading rebels insisted that they would not be bullied or blackmailed into
changing their stance, while others dismissed as a bluff a reported threat
by Mr Major to call a general election if the government were defeated on
the issue.
Mr Major was reported to have warned at the weekend that he would call an
early election if he lost the debate next week to pave the way for the
return of the Maastricht bill.
Speaking in El Alamein, where he was attending a service to mark the 50th
anniversary of the second world war battle, the prime minister underlined
the collective nature of the decision by the cabinet to press ahead with
moves to approve the European agreement.
He told BBC radio: 'I am placing before the Commons a policy I believe to be
in the interests of my country, that I believe is my responsibility. It is a
responsibility accepted by the cabinet.'
Mr Major's message that he would hold the line against the rebels was
reinforced in a series of interviews by senior ministers. Mr Michael Howard,
environment secretary, and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, dismissed
any suggestion that the government would not get the treaty through
Parliament.
To add to the prime minister's difficulties, there were signs that, if Mr
Major insists on treating the Maastricht debate as a matter of confidence,
the opposition parties would vote against him in next week's 'paving
debate'.
Both rebels and loyalists in the Tory party see the move to turn the
European issue into a test of the government's authority as a significant
raising of the stakes in the party's internal struggle.
Mr Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, said yesterday that the threat
of an early election was 'an amazingly risky gamble'.
Some tactical confusion in ministerial ranks was apparent, however, as Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, warned the Tory rebels they could not
simply reverse the damage that would be done by a government defeat on
Europe by supporting Mr Major on a vote of confidence.
'The government's authority if it had got battered about like that would be
seriously weakened,' he said.
With the number of known rebels rising above the 11 needed to wipe out the
government's overall Commons majority of 21 over the opposition parties, Mr
Major might be forced to rely on the support of the Liberal Democrats to win
the vote, or on Labour's abstaining rather than voting against the
government.
The government also faces a nervous week on the economy, as the City keenly
awaits the Mansion House speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on
Thursday. The speech is seen as a critical opportunity for Mr Lamont to
flesh out further the government's new emphasis on growth and its strategy
now that sterling is outside the exchange rate mechanism.
In spite of more gloomy economic news from the Confederation of British
Industry survey this week, Mr Major yesterday held out the possibility of
further cuts in interest rates. 'Every 1 per cent off interest rates is
worth Pounds 1bn to industry. Every 1 per cent off interest rates means more
money in the pockets of people with mortgages to spend in the high streets.
So we do not want to imperil the fact that we have been able to get interest
rates down and will look, when it is prudent to do so, for further
reductions,' he told the BBC.
Even this will not be enough to silence all Mr Major's economic critics
within his own party. Mr Kenneth Baker, a former Tory cabinet minister,
called for interest rates to fall to 4 or 5 per cent.
Cabinet ministers have already begun linking Britain's economic interests to
progress on ratifying the Maastricht treaty - a line Mr Major will elaborate
when he opens the Commons debate in ten days' time.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Council tax estimates soar to an average of Pounds 600
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTIMATES FOR the average council tax bill for a home in the middle property
band have soared and could exceed Pounds 600 when the tax is introduced next
April, senior Whitehall officials believe.
The figure is higher than ministers were suggesting even in private earlier
this year, and is above the Pounds 400 average figure produced by the
Department of the Environment last year.
The new, one-per-household tax, which will replace the poll tax on
individuals, is understood to have suffered in the current fierce contest as
public spending on local government is cut in favour of capital projects
which would boost jobs.
Environment ministers are keen to play down the importance of notional
average figures for the council tax, but the Pounds 600-plus figure is a
sign that bills are set to rise faster than expected in areas such as London
and the south-east where house prices were above national averages when
valuations were carried out.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is said to have asked Mr John
Major to protect spending to support the tax, but was told the prime
minister would not intervene.
Ministers know that the new tax will create a vocal protest group of those
who were better off under the poll tax. But they are convinced that the
structure of the tax - which provides discounts to single people, and
exemptions for those on very low incomes - makes it likely to be more
popular than the poll tax.
Mr Howard hinted yesterday that support for the new tax had become a victim
of the tough spending round discussions.
Speaking on BBC television's On the Record, Mr Howard said that whether to
give his department the Pounds 2bn it has been estimated it would need to
soften the impact of the new local tax system was one of the 'very difficult
decisions' faced by ministers on the public spending committee.
He wanted to ensure that the government made 'the right judgment, the right
balance', about the council tax and projects such as London's Jubilee Line
extension and roadbuilding.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, has reinforced his efforts to
secure the extension, but the Treasury is adamant that it should not get
priority.
Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, is to hold an informal
meeting today with senior members of the Tory backbench finance committee
and with Tory MPs on the all-party Treasury committee to discuss public
spending in advance of the autumn statement.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (2): Main parties in trouble - The
Political Scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY call it politikverdrossenheit: it means being fed up with politicians.
It is of course by no means an exclusively German disease. But Germany
thinks it has got it so badly, it has invented a word for it.
The opinion polls suggest that all the major political parties are in
trouble. If there were an election tomorrow, none of the obvious
combinations would be able to form a majority government.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), along with its
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is bumping along
with support at around 35 per cent.
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who should be profiting from their
disarray, are on just about the same. The Free Democrats, junior partners in
the ruling coalition, are stuck at around eight per cent, no more than the
environmentalist Greens.
In local elections over the past year, the largest percentage belonged to
those who did not vote at all. There is certainly a malaise in and with the
political establishment. In part it has been expressed in the rise of the
extreme right-wing, led by the Republicans, who have pushed their national
support above the five per cent cut-off point, which would allow them seats
in the Bundestag at the next elections. That is far below the sort of
support Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front enjoys in France, but in
Germany, any drift to the right instantly arouses fears of a Nazi revival.
The other expression of discontent showed up in the latest Berlin city
elections, where the PDS, the successors to East Germany's corrupt old
Communist party, pushed up their support to almost 30 per cent of the poll
in eastern districts: a clear reflection of eastern dissatisfaction with the
other 'western' parties. The CDU scored a miserable 14 per cent.
As yet, it is not as serious as some of the more angst-ridden commentators
(in Germany and abroad) would have us believe. It is a function both of the
profound social and economic upheavals related to German unification, and of
the mid-term blues of a parliament half-way through its electoral life. It
is a reflection, too, of the often apparently rudderless German coalition
system, which drifts towards consensus, aggravated by the style of
Chancellor Kohl, who tends to lead from behind.
The worry, however, is that the challenges of unification will put an
unprecedented strain on the still relatively youthful German post-war
democratic system. It almost certainly faces its greatest challenge yet to
cope with the divide that has opened up right through the newly united
country.
All the polls reveal dramatically different priorities between the citizens
of east and west, differences which the established parties are finding it
extremely difficult to bridge. Thus by far the most important issue for
easterners is unemployment: 66 per cent say so, as against just 17 per cent
in the west. As for the wealthy westerners, their greatest concern is the
influx of foreigners and asylum-seekers - the top worry for almost 50 per
cent, whereas the issue barely even figures in the east.
Mr Kohl's CDU has suffered most from the disillusion in the east. He won the
unification elections largely thanks to his optimism that the process would
be relatively swift and painless. Now he admits he got it wrong, but the
party is paying the penalty.
The SPD is paying the price for confusion on the asylum issue, albeit an
understandable confusion. Whatever the public propaganda says, Germany has
never welcomed would-be immigrants. Migrant workers were all right, and
former German emigrants to eastern Europe coming home are tolerated.
A handful of asylum-seekers fleeing genuine political persecution was
acceptable, but now the handful has turned to a flood of refugees from
poverty in the east and south. The numbers could reach 500,000 this year.
The SPD is terribly torn between its moral conscience, and the political
unpopularity of immigration at a time when housing is already short, taxes
have risen to pay for unification, and the economy is turning down.
The asylum issue is probably the one question which has caused most chaos
and confusion in the political establishment, and has certainly helped boost
the fortunes of the far right.
The coalition has been divided between the hard-line anti-immigration CSU
(which faces the most serious right-wing threat in Bavaria), and the liberal
FDP, which resisted calls for a change in the German constitution until the
last few weeks.
The political debate on asylum has run for months, if not years, inching
towards a suitable consensus, and leaving the common voter confused and
clearly alienated.
There have been equally interminable discussions on old age care (should it
be financed by universal contributions, or voluntarily?), on abortion
(because of the need to reconcile the excessively liberal East German law
with the illiberal western one), on state subsidies in all parts of the
German economy, and on whether German soldiers should serve outside the Nato
area (and if so, in a peace-keeping capacity, or also allowed to be
peace-making?).
Only now is the real debate coming to a head: how can and will Germany
finance the costs of unification, which could mean transferring up to
DM150bn a year to eastern Germany for a decade or more?
Even that has visibly split the ruling coalition in three ways, ranging from
the eastern CDU, which would raise taxes, through the CSU (led by Mr Theo
Waigel, the Finance Minister), which would fudge the issue through a
tax-free bond, to the FDP, which would let market forces rule (give or take
a little interest-rate subsidy).
No wonder the old ghost of a grand coalition between CDU and SPD suddenly
crept out of the closet during the summer. Key confidants of the
Chancellor's, like Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader, and Mr
Volker Ruhe, the Defence Minister, appeared to be actively wooing the
opposition. But the Chancellor would, and will, have none of it. It would
only encourage the drift of voters to the political extremes, he believes.
Instead, he is looking for a next best alternative: a 'solidarity pact'
between German industry and trade unions, the government and opposition
(including all the SPD-ruled Lander).
In doing so, he is actually accepting an idea floated by Germany's five
economic institutes, and accepted by the SPD, a year ago. He has let the
situation deteriorate to a point where perhaps all sides will be forced to
accept a compromise - like a real wage freeze in exchange for higher
taxation - which might have been unthinkable one year ago.
That would be a classic Kohl manoeuvre to push forward the political
process. The risk is that he may have left it too late to stop the
disaffection of his voters, and too late to revive the east German economy
in time for the 1994 elections - and save his own political neck.

RESULTS DUE
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports its full-year results on
Wednesday. Few surprises are expected and pre-tax profits of between Pounds
500m and Pounds 505m are forecast (Pounds 402.9m last year).
Sales of Zovirax, its herpes, shingles and chicken pox treatment, should
have topped Pounds 600m for the year, putting it in the world's top 10
selling drugs for the first time.
Sales of Retrovir, the anti-HIV treatment also known as AZT, will have risen
about 19 per cent for the full year to about Pounds 210m.
Wellcome's margins will also be under scrutiny. The new management has
undertaken to increase margins to 30 per cent by 1996. Analysts believe they
should improve 2.4 percentage points to about 27 per cent this year.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer, announces its
third quarter results on Thursday. They will be watched even more carefully
than usual because of the proposed split of the company next year into two
separate groups. Pre-tax profits are likely to be grim, at around Pounds
100m compared with Pounds 196m last year.
Most of analysts' predictions for next year are based on an upturn in the
cycle. A gloomy forecast from Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is likely to
lead to further downgrades.
In addition, attention will be given to the fortunes of Tenormin, a heart
treatment whose US patents expired in September last year.
Marks and Spencer, which single-handedly accounts for some 30 per cent of
the market capitalisation of the stores sector, is likely to make some
encouraging noises about its trading prospects when it reports its interim
results on Wednesday.
Against a background of ambivalent signals about the state of consumer
spending, M and S's views will be seen as being of critical importance in
gauging sentiment towards the sector.
Stringent cost control measures will have enabled the company to lift
pre-tax profits by as much as 16 per cent to Pounds 250m. The company's
aggressive 'Outstanding Autumn Value' advertising campaign is also likely to
add to its confident mood.
However, M and S's food business, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales,
will have continued to face severe competitive pressures. Analysts will be
particularly interested to hear of any new initiatives in this field.
Blenheim Group, the exhibitions manager, is expected to announce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 34m for the year to 31 August when it announces
second interim results tomorrow.
Analysts will be watching for signs Blenheim's recent rapid growth is
slowing, and for the trading outlook in its important French market.
Reed International, the publishing group, reports interim results on
Wednesday. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 92m (Pounds 85.3m) are forecast.
The market will also be eager for more details on its proposed merger with
Elsevier of the Netherlands.

FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: CBOT to investigate irregular
trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade has asked federal investigators to look into a
series of irregular trades that shook its US Treasury bond futures and
options pits, and has acted to ensure the repercussions do not harm exchange
customers.
A small and well-respected CBOT clearing firm, Lee B. Stern, a Chicago-based
brokerage concern which guaranteed the man who made the huge trades last
Thursday, failed to meet a Dollars 9m margin call that evening. Stern is
responsible for the man's debts, even though he was not an employee or an
associate of the firm.
In an effort to collect the debt, the CBOT barred Stern from doing customer
business, transferred existing customer accounts to another member-firm, and
suspended the memberships of the three principals in the firm: Mr Lee Stern,
Mr Daniel Stern, and a former second vice-chairman of the exchange, Mr Les
Mouscher.
The CBOT took steps to guarantee the financial integrity of the exchange, a
spokesman said, and has not accused Stern of any wrongdoing. Mr Lee Stern
was not immediately available for comment. Until his seat was frozen, he was
chairman of the CBOT's floor practices committee.
The size of the trades could represent more than Dollars 30m. Floor members
say it appears the trades were made by an unauthorised, and as yet unnamed,
member.
The trades began shortly before news that the US jobless situation had
improved slightly last week, a negative piece of news for bond prices.
Within a few minutes the put purchases reached about 30,000 contracts, a
huge amount in a market where trades are more usual in quantities of 50 to
100.
They also hit bond prices, which had begun to slide on the jobless report.
The man then ordered pit brokers to sell thousands of bond futures
contracts. The action helped drive Treasury prices down to their lowest
level of the day.
The Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed that it
had opened an inquiry on the case at the CBOT's request, as had the US
Attorney's office.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by the supporters of the former communist president of Tajikistan,
Mr Rakhmon Nabiyev, to return him to power appeared last night to have
failed.
A report on Russian television, quoting a Tajikistan government adviser,
claimed that the capital, Dushanbe, was again under the control of the
republic's government, headed by acting President Akbarsho Iskandarov.
Troops loyal to Mr Nabiyev, who was forced from office at gunpoint last
month, earlier yesterday seized much of the city. But the television report
said the soldiers had now left the parliament and presidential palace which
they had occupied at dawn on Saturday.
However, other reports from Dushanbe said it was not clear if the rebels had
totally abandoned the parliament building and added that shooting
accompanied their withdrawal from the city centre.
As the fighting raged yesterday, the Russian government predicted
'catastrophic consequences' in former Soviet Central Asia if the fighting
continued in Tajikistan because it could encourage ethnic and religious
instability in neighbouring countries. The US closed its embassy after weeks
of threats against its employees.
Leaders of the two-day assault against the capital said they wanted to
restore order to the country, which they complained had been seized by 'a
puppet government backed by the Islamic fundamentalists'.
The fighting in Dushanbe included an attack on its main mosque, which is the
headquarters of Qazi Ali Akbar Toradzon Zoda, Tajikistan's paramount Islamic
leader.
Last month a coalition of pro-Islamic and secular democratic political
parties took power after protesters forced Mr Nabiyev to quit and exiled him
to the northern region of Leninabad.
The fighting in Tajikistan, which began soon after the Soviet Union
dissolved last December, involves two rival ethnic groups that back opposing
political factions. The weekend assault came from the conservative southern
region of Kulyab, whose population largely supports Mr Nabiyev. Forces
defending the government are mostly from mountainous Garm, a relatively poor
area where Islam remained strong throughout the 70-year Soviet period.
John Lloyd adds from Moscow: Mr Gaidar Aliev, president of the autonomous
republic of Nakhichevan - an area under the control of Azerbaijan but
located in a corner or Armenia - said yesterday that units from Azerbaijan
attempted to stage a coup against him but had been beaten back.
Mr Aliev, a former leader of the Azerbaijan Communist party, said he would
now discuss outlawing the Popular Front, the ruling party in Azerbaijan, in
Nakhichevan.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Cuba defies US move to tighten trade sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cuban Communist party said the latest US economic sanctions against the
Caribbean island would not change its commitment to socialism but would
reduce the chances of a diplomatic end to the 30 years of hostility between
the two countries.
The new sanctions imposed at the weekend by President George Bush
represented 'a pirate's licence', according to the official media in Havana,
the Cuban capital. They are contained in legislation described in Washington
as the 'Cuban Democracy Act' (also called the Torricelli Bill), which bans
foreign subsidiaries of US companies from doing business with Cuba. Ships
which call at Cuban ports will be banned from US ports for six months.
The sanctions have already been rejected by several countries which trade
with Cuba, including members of the European Community, Canada and Mexico,
and have been condemned as an unfair trade practice by the shipping industry
in Cuba's Caribbean neighbours. Earlier this month the European Commission
lodged a formal protest and the UK government said last week it would invoke
an existing law to prohibit UK companies owned by US interests from
complying with US legislation.
US legislators supporting the measures said they are intended to force the
administration of President Fidel Castro towards democracy.
The Cuban Communist party said the move indicated unlimited 'visceral
hatred' of the Cuban people, and referred to a recent statement by Mr Castro
that Cubans were willing to undergo 'death a thousand times' rather than
abandon the island's socialist ideology.
If the new sanctions are even partially effective they will be a further
blow to a Cuban economy reeling from shortages of energy and hard currency
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, formerly Cuba's main foreign
beneficiary. The new measures are likely to be debated soon at the United
Nations when Cuba's efforts to have the 30-year-old US trade embargo on the
island ended will be discussed.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of Germany (8): A Ruhr-based powerhouse - WestLB is a
growing force on the public banking scene and is now helping to reshape the
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDZARD REUTER, chief executive of Daimler Benz and Mr Hilmar Kopper,
chief executive of Deutsche Bank, together with Mr Wolfgang Schieren,
chairman of the supervisory board at the Allianz insurance colossus, are the
three most powerful businessmen in Germany.
A strong candidate for the fourth most powerful is Mr Friedel Neuber, chief
executive of the Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, (WestLB).
This institution's raison d'etre is to act as house bank to the government
of North-Rhein Westphalia and to act as umbrella organisation to the
region's savings bank - but under Neuber, the Dusseldorf-based WestLB has
become considerably more than that.
It is a Ruhr-based powerhouse whose controversial manoeuvres are helping to
reshape the public banking sector. It pursues an aggressive industrial
policy and - depending on the way the league-table is calculated - it is
Germany's third or fourth biggest bank, a clear rival to Commerzbank and the
two big Bavarian private sector banks in terms of size.
It has also moved aggressively overseas, linking up with Standard Chartered
of London in 1989 in a bid to boost its investment banking and pan-European
activities.
Since the beginning of the year, the bank has bought a 15 per cent holding
in Autania, a machinery company; a 10 per cent holding in the Asko retail
group; a 20 per cent stake in Harpener.
More recently, it and its LTU travel associate bought a 90 per cent stake in
the UK Thomas Cook travel company and WestLB bid to acquire a 30 per cent
stake in Touristik Union International (TUI), a Hanover-based travel
company.
Other large industrial holdings include 32 per cent plus of Preussag, the
steel and engineering group, 10 per cent of Deutsche Babcock, and 13 per
cent of Hoesch, the steel group, which allowed the bank to play a pivotal
role in the hostile (by German standards) acquisition of the company by
Krupp, a rival steel-group from elsewhere on the Ruhr.
Altogether, the bank is said to have spent DM1.6bn on industrial
acquisitions since 1991.
RECENTLY, Mr Neuber brushed aside criticism that he was pursuing an
industrial policy for its own sake.
At a conference on Frankfurt in late September, he said that the sole
criteria for investments in industrial companies was - as in other areas of
the business - whether they would yield a good return.
'We can't afford to make industrial investments for the long term unless
they are going to generate a satisfactory return,' he said.
He took the example of the bank's enagement in the travel industry. It took
its stake in Lufttransport Union (LTU) in 1989 when the family owners of
this Dusseldorf-based charter-flight operator were seeking a financial
partner.
More recent acquisitions - of Thomas Cook and the planned purchase of a
stake in TUI - are designed to strengthen LTU's position in the European
market by inducing 'vertical integration' with tour operators and travel
agents.
With Hoesch/Krupp, WestLB was merely assisting in a process of necessary
rationalisation for the German steel industry in the face of pan-European
competition, Neuber said. It supported the controversial scheme out of
conviction that a merger was economically necessary, he argued.
The criticism WestLB has received in connection with these purchases is as
nothing when compared to the outcry which has accompanied the bank's
attempts to expand its influence in the public banking sector of northern
Germany - and since reunification two years ago, in eastern Germany too.
'Wild-west politics,' is how Peter Fischer, economics minister of the state
of Lower Saxony described WestLB's attempts to get control of the Landesbank
Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel.
He went so far as to accuse Neiber of meddling with the investment plans of
Hanover-based Preussag (30 per cent-plus owned by WestLB) as a means of
putting pressure on Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (NordLB - the
Landesbank for Lower Saxony, based in the state capital of Hanover) to
withdraw a rival bid for a stake in the Kiel-based bank.
The accusation was sharply rejected, the battle continued. The Hanover-based
NordLB has won the right to run the Landesbank functions of two east German
Lander: Sachsen-Anhalt and (from the beginning of next year)
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Formally, no decision has been reached over Kiel, but three out of five
members of the Schleswig Holstein's management board resigned in early June
after it appeared likely that a stake of slightly less than 50 per cent
would go to Dusseldorf and not Hanover.
True to form, WestLB has also been active in the rationalisation of the
Landesbanken in southern Germany. Its original bid to assimilate Helaba, the
Hessen central bank, was rejected some years ago.
This summer WestLB and the SudwestLB (the Stuttgart-based Landesbank for
Baden-Wurtemberg) defeated a rival bid from Helaba to win approval to buy a
50 per cent stake in the Mainz-based Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz.
The SudwestLB itself took a 25 per cent stake in the Landesbank Sachsen
Girozentrale, the new Leipzig-based central bank for Saxony.
Whether Neuber and the WestLB are able to continue their controversial
activities - in German industry as much as in public-sector banking -
depends on Germany's banking authorities. Tough new capital adequacy rules
are to be introduced next year.
WestLB will be able to comply with these easily if it is allowed to have
access to the equity of a housing finance subsidiary it bought from the
government of North Rhein Westphalia last year.
If this is not approved, it is unlikely that Neuber will be quite so
expansionist or aggressive in the future.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Playing it safe with 'Swan Lake' - Clement Crisp finds
serious faults at the opening of the Royal Ballet's new season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF COURSE, the Royal Ballet began its season on Thursday night with Swan
Lake. Otherwise, how would the public know that this really was a ballet
company? 'The Rockies may tumble/ Gibraltar may crumble/ They're only made
of clay/But . . . Swan Lake is here to stay' is Covent Garden's tune. The
cancellation of scheduled Opera House performances of Prince of the Pagodas
in favour of Sleeping Beauty - why not Swan Lake, chaps? - is further
indication of the Play Safe, Play The Classics syndrome that will drag
British ballet back into the 19th century just as the 21st dawns.
Under the circumstances, the really cunning trick would be to show the
public a serious, credible production of Swan Lake.
In matter of text, The Royal Ballet has the finest staging in the world.
Scholarship, care, have restored a version of the choreography as near as
dammit to what the Mariinsky Theatre audience saw in 1895 at the first
performance. (That precious nuances might be restored to the role of
Odette/Odile would be possible if anyone chose to consult Dame Alicia
Markova, repository of the best traditions of the role).
What minimises this production is a belief that decoration is style, that
fuss is drama, and witless activity proof of aesthetic life. Some of the
more egregious bustle has been removed from the opening scene, though I
think the way the tutor is presented (paedophilia just round the corner) is
a mistake, and I am no admirer of Siegfried's companions, who are a boorish
lot.
The decision to set the piece in 1890 is a mistake, and it shows horridly in
the flustered first act merriment and in its design - what is that vast
pearl crown skewed at stage right? - but thereafter the poetic caprices of
Yolanda Sonnabend's settings give a welcome sense of the fantastic and
dream-like.
Yet there still seems a lack of belief in Swan Lake itself as one of the
great metaphors of classic dance. Production ideas encroach upon dance
ideas, erode them. 'Meaning' for the Royal Ballet comes from imposed
dramatic argument: everyone on stage must know who they are as characters,
rather than what they represent in the choreographic scheme. (The national
dances of Act 3, for the most part crassly done on Thursday, have none of
the power that they know in St. Petersburg, because they are embedded in
florid costumes and their dance style is misunderstood).
The visual neuroses of the staging - the swans' white head-dresses (somewhat
improved this season) and their creamy, drifting skirts; the often murky
lighting; the need to fill the stage with oh-so-vivacious supernumeraries
(why on earth are those two dancers' mothers fussing in Act 1?) are shadows
on a masterpiece that should be luminous with meaning because of the potency
and clarity of the dance itself.
This comment also applies, I feel, to Darcey Bussell's Odette/Odile. We saw
on Thursday a young dancer of prodigious physical skill giving an
interpretation that veered between the sublime - movement simple, grand,
exquisite both in its power and in its articulation - and the vapid, when
line was not allowed to open out, when phrases were presented as if by rote,
when a pernicious English-Miss dullness made the dance as bland as milk and
domestic as a cottage garden. It was a reading unfocussed, unawakened - and
Zoltan Solymosi's attentive but light-weight Siegfried was no spark to
interpretative fire. Bussell's natural gifts are thrilling, and so is her
native dance-intelligence. The drive and clarity she has brought to the
Balanchine repertory, and the dazzling variety she has shown in MacMillan
ballets (from Pagodas to Song of the Earth) should illuminate her
Odette/Odile. At present these qualities seem threatened by the double role.
Incidental pleasures of the evening included Tetsuya Kumakawa in the first
act trio, offering stunning, high-flying bravura; and the continuing
presence of Leslie Edwards - at the start of what must be his sixtieth
season with the company - showing yet again the dignity and simplicity that
make him a treasure of our ballet.
Swan Lake continues in repertory at the Royal Opera House during the next
two months.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Cop out on sex - It's all a con, Madonna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MADONNA has done it again. Louise Ciccone from Rochester, Michigan, a dumpy
drummer in a punk band, who from the first was determined to have more than
her alloted 15 minutes of fame, can add another notch to her game plan to
take over the world. Whatever you may think of her book Sex, published (and
sold out) this week is irrelevant. It has fulfilled the only two objectives
that matter: it has made a lot of money and it has kept the Madonna myth
spinning.
One day there will be a movie, something on the lines of Citizen Cane, or a
novel, a latter day The Great Gatsby, which attempts to get to grips with
Madonna. She has already projected herself out of the judgment of this age.
What other star would promote herself with photographs showing her
masturbating, participating in troilism, or walking naked down a Miami
freeway. Would Marlene have done it, or Marilyn?
Until now showbiz icons had always been careful to maintain a veil of
mystery, a modicum of self-respect. Madonna sets her own agenda, marketing
herself ever more outrageously. First the name - take that, Catholics. Then
the first hit, 'Like a Virgin' - role over, romantics. Then the early stage
act, when she tossed her knickers to the audience; then the latest, when she
became the untouchable harlot, despising the dropped jaws of her fans as she
writhed on a bed to synchronised orgasms. Now no one is really shocked by
her antics. We marvel away and wait for her to decide what will become
socially, artistically, and culturally acceptable.
The great achievement of Madonna is that she unites as fans so many die-hard
opposites. As a Woman on Top she appeals to feminists; as a free spirit who
seems to enjoy life she draws in young women who admire her chutzpah; as an
outrageous theatrical figure she satisfies gays; as a blonde she wraps up
the middle-aged men who dream nostalgically of Monroe; and the brown Mac
brigade for once feel that they are part of the human race. You appear odd
if you disdain Sex.
And yet it is all a con. In Sex Madonna dodges the issues. The neatly
packaged, loose-leafed, album basically consists of around 150 soft core
photographs, dressed up with Madonna's naive, somehow innocent, views on
sex. But she is reluctant to expose herself intellectually and pretends that
the words are those of a mythical swinger called Dita. In the end we can
wake up and find it was all a dream. That's a cop out, Madonna.
She also ducks the condom issue. Her preface contains a testimonial for safe
sex. Turn the page and you are back in a pre-AIDS world of unbridled instant
accessibility.
And then the photographs. Once you get past the frisson of surprise they are
really quite decorous. For all the provocation in the text the poses are
fudged. It is as simulated as a prostitute's 'hello, darling', as phoney as
the smile on a Sun Page Three girl. The scenarios are fantasy S &amp; M, or gay,
or voyeuristic. The shot of her being gang raped by two skinheads on a
baseball court says it all: Madonna is giggling. There is no sweat, no pain,
no despair, no real privacy outraged.
The famous friends who have stripped for Madonna, like Naomi Campbell and
Vanilla Ice, look suitably embarrassed. Damn it, Vanilla Ice is actually
wearing his Y-fronts as he falteringly gropes the Lady. This is the Helmut
Newton school of photography, glamour shots for jaded sophisticates. It is
as sensual and as arousing as the Bluebell Girls.
And yet for millions of people what had been kept under the counter,
banished into the more closeted parts of the psyche, comes into the light,
into media respectability. Madonna is a DH Lawrence type figure, proclaiming
the sheer joy of sex. Some of her text is quite sensible. 'This book is
about sex' she begins. 'Sex is not love. Love is not sex. But the best of
both worlds is created when they come together'. After that love is given
its marching orders. She makes some sort of case for sado-masochism. 'The
definition of S &amp; M is that you let someone hurt you who you know would
never hurt you.' Simplistic but worth discussing. Such insights are rare.
Much of the text is facile pornography designed to excite those parts not
reached by the pictures.
Sex is just another stage in Madonna's rather sad search to be sat upon. As
the public gives way before her ever more outrageous behaviour you can
almost sense her craving for discipline. It is a pity that such a talented
performer, such an intelligent art connoisseur, such a rich and potentially
philanthropic woman, should pursue such transient and ultimately specious
gratifications. There is only one way for Madonna to go; like many a
medieval libertine she will no doubt end up in some religious cloister,
finally living up up to her name.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Suitable cases for conflict - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN, the protagonist of David Mercer's A Suitable Case for Treatment
(Radio 3's Sunday play) is a communist. Stalin's and Lenin's faces appear in
his dreams, and the KGB, and the great staircase scene in The Battleship
Potemkin. Morgan's girl Jean and his mother are communists, too. But the
play is not to do with communism. Indeed it is hard to say what it is to do
with.
Mercer was one of the dramatic highlights of the 1960s. This play was given
on television in 1962 and as a film, called Morgan, in 1965. Don Taylor, who
directed the television, has made and directed this radio version, but he
has not clarified the argument. That hardly matters, for, whatever it
signifies, this rally of unlikely events is entertaining in its way, and
Stephen Moore as Morgan is as likeable as such a grotesque figure can be.
Grotesque? He breaks into his divorced wife's bedroom and hangs her toy dog
on a toy gallows. He continues to live in her Morris Minor. He is obsessed
with Guy the gorilla in the Zoo. He puts a modest time-bomb under his wife's
bed, expecting her lover there. He is under analysis all this while, and has
these long dreams. Mercer seems to have regarded him as lovable; but his
wife, his girl-friend and I all found him too unpredictable for that.
What is unpredictable in Radio 4's Monday play, Angus Graham Campbell's From
Morning Sun till Dine, is that his two almost predictable characters should
stay together. Chris (Samuel West) is a public schoolboy studying for the
Army. Sharing his rooms, in the basement of his family's house, is Paul (Ian
Shaw), a rough Ulster student, reserved about the English upper-classes.
Instead of just swopping political truisms, Chris does knitting and, despite
evident anorexia, cooking, while Paul is distressed at Chris's apparent
illness.
I suspect that they have what used to be called a 'romantic friendship', but
the author hasn't wanted to mention it. (Chris picked up Paul on the
football field.) There seems no other reason for their staying together when
they are so often anxious not to. Paul, telling of a UFF murder of a
13-year-old boy, says he had 'these kind of greeny-blue eyes with pale
streaks,' a highly romantic detail of what was a savage attack. They are
still together at the end, poor sods. Richard Wortley directed.
The fourth, and unhappily the last, of William T. Vollmann's Yugoslavian
Notes came on Monday. I compared him before with Ernest Hemingway, and the
resemblance impressed me again. Vollmann was in a ruined youth hostel with
some students and Blue Thunderbolt soldiers. The chetniks in the house
across the street could be watched by using a mirror.
Casual talk was of taking furniture from the neighbouring houses to provide
fire, of searching for cabbages in the dark garden, to make 'a nice salad'.
If the chetniks fired with their machine-gun, the reply was a few rounds
from a Kalashnikov, taken respectfully in turn. Vollmann's low-key
commentary was as moving as it was exciting.
A different kind of conflict is in Radio 4's Devil's Advocate, a six-part
series on Wednesdays. People are invited to defend a fictional villain of
their choice, in front of Clive Anderson. The first advocate was Fay Weldon,
and she chose Alec D'Urberville in Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Of
course he didn't rape Tess] He 'took advantage of her' when she flirted with
him. Feminist Fay Weldon could not condemn Tess; she was a decent girl, who
did not take part in the excesses of the May dancing. But she had agreed to
live with Alec while her proper husband Clare was abroad; and she murdered
him on her own initiative when Clare came back. Next week Helen
Atkinson-Wood will defend Goneril.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: A premium put on the depraved - The Truth of the
Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY

<TEXT>
IT IS much thought of, at all levels. It is much talked of, at all levels;
and it is much written of, at all levels. Why then do we continue to pretend
that sex is the part of our lives that we most repress?
A century ago, when some stewards of morality were reputed to have been
offended even by bare table-legs, one could understand how books might be
scandals, politicians disgraced and royalty demeaned, on account of sex. The
Victorians, at least, were consistent: they properly sought the repression
of discourse about sex.
Our own age is less so. We want sex to be a matter for open minds, to be
able to chat, write, read and see all about it: yet we want it to be, at the
same time, tinctured with the illicit: something about which we can confess.
For the confessional habit bred into us by medieval Christianity has not
faded as Christian belief has faded: it has simply been absorbed into the
application of Freudian analysis. The confessional box has become the
psychiatrist's couch.
This, broadly, is what the French theorist Michel Foucault maintains in his
History of Sexuality (published by Penguin). A secret habitue of the gay
barrack-rooms of San Francisco, Foucault died of AIDS in 1984, before he
finished his project. In fact, he got scarcely any further than the ancient
Greeks. But his work remains useful. The Greeks, as he demonstrated, never
built into sex the notion of inherent sin. Sex was only a focus of moral
concern insofar as it involved self-respect and personal volition. There was
no hierarchy of sexual behaviour determined by religious or social codes.
That a group of married men might meet up one evening and go through the
entire gamut of homosexual modes of gratification was not unseemly according
to any law. But - as anyone with the slightest acquaintance with the texts
of Plato will know - this does not exclude the possibility of 'upright' or
'decent' behaviour. Greek doctors recommended moderation because they
believed a man's sperm to be a limited supply and essential for his
longevity. Socrates recommended moderation because he believed that
self-control was germane to good citizenship and a means of training the
soul for higher things in the life to come.
Pornography - literally, 'the depiction of prostitutes' - existed in
Classical Greece. There is no evidence to suggest that it was an underground
phenomenon. Even if the philosophers despised it (as I suspect they did),
they were perceptive enough to see that any law which defined pornography as
depravity would put a premium on the depraved. Diogenes the Cynic went so
far as to masturbate in public: if he could eat in public, he argued, why
should he not accommodate his sexual appetite likewise - at no inconvenience
to anyone else?
Two events of this week concentrate the mind on this exemplary system of
morals. First, the issue of Madonna's scrapbook-cum-epistolary novel, Sex.
Second, the launch of a renewed campaign to ban tobacco advertising
throughout Europe. On Sex, little needs to be added to the verbiage it has
already attracted. One's uppermost impression throughout is that Madonna is
an ugly and inarticulate lady who cannot hold a candle to the delicate
eroticism of Marilyn Monroe.
But juxtapose her book with the move to prohibit the promotion of smoking,
and there emerges a structure of values with some cogency to it.
You cannot ban a book because it is boring and garbage-laden. Nor can you
ban this particular book on the grounds of indecency alone, because many
newsagents in Britain now stock magazines which are equal to, and often more
explicit than anything Madonna parades. But Sex is directed at young people
in a way that pornographic magazines are not. And it glamourises behaviour
likely to do young people just as much harm as smoking cigarettes.
Games with knives held against genitals. Studs, whips and thongs. The
involvement of dogs. The sheer multiplicity of partners. All these can
reasonably be defined as injurious to good health. The straight motive of
preserving the species would ultimately justify action to forbid the
behaviour encouraged by Madonna.
She tells us, in the course of Sex, that she finds fat people repugnant.
They fail to work out, to look after their bodies. If she thinks thus, then
she should understand why her book is offensive. The logic invoked by the
Greeks, the logic whereby tobacco advertisements are banned, the logic which
makes obesity a form of corruption - it is the same as the logic which holds
sado-masochism, promiscuity, bestiality and sexual excess as threats to
society. If we are consistent, we shall draw up guidelines for moral action
based on this logic of human health and happiness, suitable for a
pluralistic and largely secular society. Failing that, I hope for Sex II:
the sequel of loveless, bloodied and moribund bodies.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Food: The fight for America's stomach - Nicholas Lander
considers different US food lobbies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT does the future hold for food in the US? Like the presidential election
this is a three-cornered contest. Weighing in as the heavyweight, in terms
of resources, clout and geographical spread, is the fast food movement. Its
advance is remorseless reaching even the youngest generation; pre-packaged
meals which your child can cook in the microwave and eat in front of the
television.
The newcomer to the contest is represented by those who advocate dieting as
a way of life. This group has become prominent in the fight against obesity.
But it also has support from the neo-prohibitionist movement. The group
manages to portray food and drink, especially alcohol, as the enemy. Backed
by wealthy individuals and institutions, the group has bought considerable
time on radio and television to proclaim its views.
Finally, somewhat battered but still fighting, is a group which has
prospered significantly since the early 1960s when the US woke up to the
potential pleasures of good food and wine. It consists of food producers,
chefs and restaurant owners, wine makers and critics, food writers, farmers
and the interested consumer.
Its figurehead, Julia Child, now aged 80, was recently in London. Child is
as imposing now as she must have been in 1961 when she became America's
first television cook. Shehas a ready smile and a sense of fun that belies
her age and the gravity of her message. Today, Child believes, there are so
many conflicting and confusing reports of what is good, or bad, to eat that
Americans are in danger of associating nutrition with guilt and developing a
genuine fear of food.
In the forthcoming contest it would be foolish to underestimate the mettle
of Child and her younger disciples. It is far too simplistic to see her as
just a successful cookery writer - her books have sold in millions all over
the world - Child is also one of the co-founders of the American Institute
of Wine and Food which, via demonstrations by professional chefs, seminars
and a quarterly magazine, has established considerable support across the
US.
Recession and increased state taxes on the California wine producers, the
institute's biggest financial supporters, had weakened the institute but it
has emerged rejuvenated after an organisational overhaul. Child seems
confident about its future.
In an outline of the group's strategy she said it was important to
acknowledge the dangers of excess, be it in alcohol or cream, and preach
moderation. Secondly, she felt it was the institute's duty to bring the fun
back into cooking and eating and, most importantly, Child hopes to see off
the opposition by continuing to place a strong emphasis on educating people
about food.
The masters degree in gastronomy which she has helped to establish at Boston
University will, she hopes, be the first of many.

Rack/Bottoms Up group of wine shops. They are offering a full 20 per cent
off any 12 assorted bottles of wine or champagne, and 10 per cent off any

Zind-Humbrecht Alsace whites, superior California Saintsbury Chardonnay and
Pinot Noir, cliche-defying Spanish white Albarino Lagar de Cervera and
Drappier champagne, which would come to Pounds 11.19 a bottle as part of a

Autumn is fast becoming the season of the international jet-setting chef.
Emile Jung, chef of the three-star Michelin restaurant Le Crocodile (tel:
88.32.13.02) in Strasbourg has just completed a two-week stint at Le
Souffle, the restaurant at the InterContinental, Hyde Park (071-409 3131)
and Michel Lorrain from the similarly rated A la Cote St-Jacques in Joigny
(86.62.09.70) has just been at Le Meridien on Piccadilly (071-734-8000) to
put the finishing touches to the menu on which he acts as consultant.
Hot on their heels comes Ken Hom to the Langham Hilton. He will be cooking
there from November 6-15 but, such is Hom's popularity, that those keen to
sample his individualistic style should book early on 071-636-1000. Nicholas

The phrase 'wine club' is often a euphemism for extra profit margin but the

BACUP's work during his illness that he instituted the BACUP wine Club,
selling 10 different but reliable wines delivered by the dozen in aid of the
celebrity sponsored charity. The prices are so reasonable that one almost
has to double check that cases contain 12 and not six bottles. Just Pounds
31.35 will secure you 12 bottles of Sir Dirk Bogarde's favourite, a 1990
Cotes-du-Rhone, while a 1986 claret from the Cotes de Bourg is Pounds 46.75
a dozen. Delivery is free for five cases or more; Pounds 7.50 for smaller
orders. For more information tel: 071-696-9003. JR.
At the newly-opened Ransome's Dock restaurant in Battersea, south London

FT  24 OCT 92 / Drink: Chateaux owners face a variable '92 claret vintage -
Edmund Penning-Rowsell goes to Bordeaux to assess the year in the vineyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 red Bordeaux vintage will almost certainly be variable. I cannot
recall one more frustrating for chateau proprietors, less agreeable to
witness or more uncomfortable for the pickers bent double between the muddy
vine rows.
From September 28, when picking of the Cabernet-Sauvignon was generally due
to start, there was heavy rain following a hot, humid August. By the end of
September most of the earlier-ripening Merlot was in the fermentation vats
and everywhere declared satisfactory. In two afternoons a good average crop
was picked at Petrus: full-coloured and very fruity.
Later I tasted several vats of Merlot at Pavie and all had colour and fruit,
though varying. A Merlot vintage will help St Emilion and Pomerol, badly hit
in last year's frost. The Cabernets were not fully ripe and some growers
panicked and picked early. The more sophisticated waited until the second
week of October. Mouton-Rothschild recruited more than 800 pickers.
Twenty years ago these conditions, after a good flowering but a mixed
summer, would have resulted in, at best, a moderate, irregular vintage, with
a good deal of rot. Since, expertise in vineyard and cellars has advanced
greatly, and the keys to success this year lay in spraying, summer pruning
(vendange verte) limited yields and the elimination of unripe or rotten
grapes.
Mouton-Rothschild spent double its budget for spraying, and Latour sprayed
no fewer than 21 times instead of the normal 12. I saw truck fulls of
healthy, sweet grapes in the cellars.
Thinning the bunches on the vine was almost unknown ten years ago, but this
year Professor Pascal Ribereau-Gayon, head of Bordeaux University's
oenological department said: 'The great difference is between those who
thinned and those who did not.' Thinning is an expensive business which some
said was as costly as the vintage itself.
Moueix, which owns or manages 12 properties, mostly in St. Emilion and
Pomerol, employed 62 people for 25 days to perform this delicate task, and
La Mission-Haut Brion 50 for more than two weeks. Yields were pared with
more important chateaux making less wine around 45 to 50 hl per hectare. Ch
Margaux produced only 38 hl per hectare - the lowest in recent years.
Although the overall quality of the vintage will not be clear until after
the winter, and blends are made for the grand vin, it will surely be a
saleable one so long as prices reflect the vintage's size, the existence of
large stocks of unsold, unconsumed claret throughout the fine-wine drinking
world, and the recession. Prices must be at least 10 per cent lower than the
1991's - and they were down by 15-20 per cent on the 1990's. Some Bordeaux
merchants suggest that the first-growths, which set a broad scale of prices
for lower levels, should come down from their 1991 FFr160 a bottle to FFr120
or even to FFr100, and leading seconds to FFr60-FFr50.
However, these can be no reason for consumers to buy the 1992 clarets en
primeur. In a variable vintage we can afford to wait two years until the
wines are in bottle.
There will be great pressure on all but the most popular growths and
merchants to sell en primeur. They desperately need cash, especially after
the relatively small, disparaged but undervalued 1991 vintage. One well
established Bordeaux house that sold FFr20m of the 1990's en primeur
disposed of only FFr1m of the 1991s.
Nevertheless, although the Bordeaux wine world is in difficulties, in the 12
months ending in August red Bordeaux sales were down only 4 per cent on the
year, and total exports were actually 2 per cent up, although British
imports were 4 per cent down, albeit 13 per cent up in value. The good news
is that the 1992 dry whites are excellent, and the crop is the largest since
1979.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Food: Why it pays to have catholic tastes - Eating out in
Berlin / Giles MacDonogh samples the Bamberger Reiter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLANCE at the latest edition of the red Michelin guide to Germany quickly
reveals the inequality: all those stars seem to have landed on the Roman
Catholic parts of Germany: Bavaria, Baden and the Rhineland.
As you approach the old frontier between east and west stars disappear from
view and the only gap in an otherwise dense cloud is west Berlin where you
will find a modest tally of four one-star restaurants and even one two-star:
Rockendorfs, which is, sadly, miles out in the sticks in Waidmannslust.
There may be few stars but there are plenty of places to eat. This profusion
dates from the time when Berlin was a fun-loving island set in the grim
eastern ocean.
People wanted to enjoy themselves often and it was more important that the
restaurant was reasonably priced and lively than the chef should have had
pretentions to haute cuisine.
There are still more restaurants in Berlin than in any other European city
of comparable size; places representing pretty well every food culture under
the sun.
The variety puts even London to shame. One night you will eat Italian, the
next, Greek. The day after it is the turn of the Yugoslavs, the Spanish or
the Argentinians, the Indians, the Chinese or the French.
There is a Kurdish restaurant in the Uhlandstrasse but given the plight of
the poor Kurds I have never had the courage to try it. Naturally there are
plenty of German places, most of them inspired by south German models.
In terms of typical Berlin food there is Hardtke in the Meineckestrasse
(tel: 881-9827), if you feel like a mountainous Eisbein (pork knuckle) or a
groaning Schlachtteller (a plate of sausages and pork cuts).
In the Mommsenstrasse there is even an east Prussian restaurant called
Marjellchen (883-2676) where, after your Konigsberger Klopsen (meatballs) or
Schlesisches Himmelreich (meat-filled dumplings) you may soothe your stomach
with a tot of Barenfang (literally bear-trapper) a honeyed liqueur schnaps
which used to serve as central heating in that now vanished corner of
Germany.
The one-star Bamberger Reiter in the Regensburgerstrasse no 7 (tel: 24 42
82) serves a refined modern cooking with some inspiration from south Germany
and Austria. Dorothea Raneburger is Austrian and she is quite happy to tell
you as much if you have not gleaned the fact from the indications on the
menu and wine list.
The Bamberger Reiter is in a quiet leafy street in the centre of west
Berlin. The restaurant is on the corner of Bambergerstrasse, hence the name
alluding to the famous horseman in front of Bamberg Cathedral.
The restaurant is small and comfortable. Many of the diners appear to be
regulars who are prepared to put up with fairly hefty prices to eat at one
of the few top-class restaurants in Berlin. The menu is short with a couple
of copious set menus; one with six courses, the other with seven and
available only if the whole table takes it.
As a starter, some roast quails' breasts came with a chunk of buttery foie
gras set on slices of marinated celeriac. This was rather more exciting than
some marinated wild salmon where the chef had gone overboard with the limes
in his vinaigrette. For a little over Pounds 10 a feuilletee of foie gras
and truffles on a bed of spinach was exceedingly generous given the amount
of black truffles which had gone into it. A tomato consomme with a cottage
cheese dumpling was another dish betraying Austrian influence.
Pigeon breasts are a house speciality. On the night I ate at the Bamberger
Reiter they were dished up in savoy cabbage; a sign that the French cuisine
rustique had also taken a grip of this Berlin chef.
Veal fillet was served with shitake mushrooms and a dauphinoise of potatoes.
I was a little disappointed at the farmed mushrooms; especially when there
were so many good wild mushrooms available in the shops.
The cheese was also a disappointment: everything had been stored too cold to
ripen and there was nothing out of the ordinary. Perhaps this is yet another
sign of Frau Raneburger's origins as cheese is one of the saddest areas of
modern Austrian gastronomy, ruined by a combination of fussy state
interference and obsessive pasteurisation.
Puddings are a better bet. There was a delicious apricot dumpling with a
praline ice and some plum tart with vanilla ice; followed, as ever, by more
petits fours than one might advisably eat.
The Bamberger Reiter has a good wine list which is particularly strong on
Austria, with excellent Gruner Veltliners and Rieslings from the Wachau and
Blaufrankisch red wines from the Burgenland.
Ordering Austrian wines is the way to Frau Radeburger's heart. At the end of
the meal she came up beaming and gave us a glass of lovely (Austrian)
apricot schnapps. Clearly, when it comes to eating out in Berlin, it pays to
be catholic.
The Bamberger Reiter menus cost DM115 (Pounds 46) and DM155. A la carte you
should assume at least Pounds 60 a head with decent wine. For half the price
you can enjoy the Raneburgers' food in the bistro at the same address.

FT  24 OCT 92 / When radar went bump in the night: Wilfred Harper recalls a
key move by Britain's wartime scientists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILFRED HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTY years ago some of Britain's top scientists took over Malvern College
in Worcestershire. The move was undertaken with great haste, in deep secrecy
and amid farcical chaos. The scientists were ordered to move by Winston
Churchill's because they and their existing laboratories were at risk of
attack.
A little while before a British parachute commando force had raided a German
radar station on a cliff-top north of Le Havre in occupied France. They
overpowered it, ripped out the vital components of the Wurzburg radar,
carried them down to the beach, loaded them on to boats and whisked them
away in the darkness. Back in England the trophies were examined by
scientists.
The success of the raid both pleased and alarmed the Telecommunications
Research Establishment. Its radar laboratories were near the cliff-top at St
Albans Head, in Dorset, overlooking the English Channel. A similar raid by
the Germans could have been disastrous. It seemed prudent to move out before
the Germans came in.
The chosen home for TRE was far inland, technically suitable and very
attractive. Under protest, the staff and pupils of Malvern College were
evacuated to Harrow School.
During the move there were moments of farce. Lorries full of highly secret
equipment left under the protection of Dorset Home Guard. However, the local
commander refused to allow his mens' firearms over the county border. The
lorries continued unguarded and unguided lost their way on the un-signposted
roads and ended up in a farmyard.
After the upheaval the scientists settled down among the Victorian Gothic
tracery in the shadow of the Malvern Hills. There they developed the
'instruments of darkness' without which the Allies might not have won the
war.
Radar's military history had been short but spectacular.
It began in Britain with a report to the Air Defence Committee of February
1935 entitled Detection of Aircraft by Radio Methods by Robert Watson-Watt,
the Superintendent of the Radio Department at the National Physical
Laboratory.
The Committee requested a demonstration. Watson-Watt's assistant quickly
wired together some equipment, loaded it into a caravan and towed it to a
place near the BBC's short wave radio transmitter at Daventry. An old bomber
was flown about and its radio reflections were picked up and displayed. The
committee was convinced.
Immediately, and secretly, money was made available and some of Britain's
brightest scientists were recruited. Unknown to each other several countries
were working on radio detection, notably Germany, France, the US and Japan.
The British dubbed the system Radar, an acronym for Radio Detection and
Ranging.
So rapid was its translation into operational hardware that Neville
Chamberlain's aeroplane to Munich in September 1938 was tracked down the
Thames Estuary by five radar stations. By Easter 1939 a chain of 20 stations
looped around the British coast from the Firth of Tay to the Isle of Wight.
Without its early warning the British would have lost the Battle of Britain
and probably the war.
With the Luftwaffe repelled, TRE concentrated on radar for offensive
purposes. This is the work which came to fruition at Malvern. It was largely
based on a crucial invention of 1940, the cavity magnetron. This enabled the
reduction of pulse wavelengths from metres to centimetres, which in turn
enabled considerable extension and enhancement of radar's abilities. (The
same device generates microwaves in ovens).
The magnetron was used in advanced airborne radar. By 1942 the big bombers,
the Halifaxes, Sterlings and Lancasters, were in service and with them came
the 1,000-bomber night raids. These required an on-board electronic
navigation system for target finding to replace the system based on signals
transmitted from Britain, which were of limited range and could be jammed.
Bernard Lovell, a young university physicist, was in charge of its
development. His team developed a ground scanning system which displayed
features such as cities and coast lines. Hamburg, a city on an estuary, was
its first target in January 1943. Nearly 40 years later a derivative, aboard
a Vulcan, was used for a raid against Port Stanley airfield in the
Falklands.
Another airborne system enabled night fighters to close in on enemy aircraft
after initial guidance by ground radar.
By the spring of 1943 German submarines were sinking almost 1m tons of
Allied shipping a month and threatening Britain's supply lines. A
newly-developed airborne radar enabled Coastal Command aircraft to find and
attack the U-boats, often at night when they were on the surface recharging
batteries. Soon U-Boats were being destroyed faster than the Germans could
replace them. Shipping losses fell by 90 per cent.
Sir Bernard Lovell is now in his late 70s. Recently he attended the
dedication of a memorial window at Goodrich Castle near Malvern, close to
the place where a Halifax bomber crashed 50 years ago. It was testing one of
his prototype radars. All the scientists aboard and the aircrew died.
It is impossible to describe all the systems and counter measures developed
during the first radar war. Radar warfare has come a long way, as we saw
during the Gulf conflict.

FT  24 OCT 92 / It's not business, Gorby, it's strictly personal: The
judgment of Solomon is needed in the court case involving ex-Soviet
president Gorbachev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MATTER OF former Soviet President and Communist Party General Secretary
Gorbachev vs the Constitutional Court of Russia is, of course, personal.
Mikhail Gorbachev did not refuse to appear before the court on a mere point
of law: Boris Yeltsin did not ban his foreign travel because it was the
appropriate legal sanction - nor did he relax the ban to allow him to attend
Willi Brandt's funeral because he had been advised that the original
decision was legally faulty.
It could not be other than personal. These two men have loomed over Soviet
and post-Soviet politics like battling mastodons since 1987. Then Yeltsin,
having been raised by Gorbachev to the politburo and the leadership of the
Moscow party, was summarily dismissed after a humiliating process which, on
Yeltsin's account, nearly killed him.
His comeback over three years, when he gained popular support as Gorbachev
lost his, seared the Soviet president's soul: the humiliation he visited on
Gorbachev before the Russian parliament, after the collapse of last year's
coup attempt, was sweet revenge, but not the end of the story.
At stake has been not only leadership of the country, but the mantle history
will bestow. There is still no question as to which of the two is the more
popular abroad, especially in the US: Gorbachev's trip there in May of this
year had most of the trappings of a presidential visit.
Unable to conceal his spleen, Yeltsin used a post-conference briefing, at a
meeting of the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Tashkent,
to mock his predecessor's pretensions to 'head a world government.' Yeltsin
also attacked his idiocy for 'clinging to the ideas of socialism'.
In this bitterness, one can detect the bafflement that foreigners should
think more of a man who destroyed the Soviet Union than one who is
struggling to rebuild Russia - a puzzlement which has a rational basis.
The matter which the Constitutional Court is trying is also, inevitably,
political. This fledgling institution has been given a responsibility before
which any legislative assembly would shrink. It must decide on the charge,
brought by former communists, that the Russian president's decrees banning
the Russian and the Soviet communist parties were illegal. Further, it must
adjudicate on the counter suit, brought by the Gorbachev, that the Communist
Party was itself unconstitutional.
Andrei Makarov, lead advocate for the Yeltsin camp, began his case by
claiming the party had visited a reign of terror on the Soviet people
'unprecedented in history'. Even when the court decreed that the evidence
should be limited to the period after March 1990, when the party lost its
formal monopoly of power, the arguments have continued on whether the party
had succeeded in transforming itself into a legal party with power limited
by democratic checks and balances.
The personal and the political energies unleashed by the process are
inescapable: they would be present in any similar case in any country, no
matter how time-honoured its civil and judicial institutions were. However,
the root question is whether there exists in Russia a sufficiently well
developed legal and constitutional base to cope with these energies, to sift
from their passionate advocacies what is germane, and to arrive at a
judgment which is seen to be just.
The signs of this are at best mixed: and the Gorbachev affair, as one of
these signs, is itself confused. Gorbachev has been consistent in his
refusal to appear - but he has not argued on a point of law. Instead, in his
deposition to court on September 28, he justified himself on the grounds
that 'as it loses support for its policies, the other side (Yeltsin's) looks
for scapegoats and seeks to put history itself in the dock' - an attempt
which 'may trigger the suppression of dissidence and bring about a climate
of purges for political views and convictions'.
There seems no doubt that Valery Zorkin, the young head of the
Constitutional Court, has been within his rights to seek to compel Gorbachev
to appear as a witness - although he did not himself impose the ban on
travel, instead appealing to the Yeltsin, as president, to impose it.
Yeltsin, in consultation with Andrei Kozyrev, the Foreign Minister, acceded
to the request: the lifting of the ban on October 13 was said by Yeltsin to
be for 'humanitarian reasons.'
Besides the deprivation of the right to travel, Yeltsin also, on October 8,
ordered the seizure of the buildings housing the Gorbachev Institute on
Leningradsky Prospect. Yeltsin's view is that it is not legally leased,that
there are irregularities in the income of the Gorbachev Foundation and that
Gorbachev does not need all that space anyway.
It gave Gorbachev a street platform from which to accuse the Russian
president of authoritarian tendencies and of conducting an act of political
revenge - charges which appeared as justified as those made against his own
actions towards Yeltsin five years earlier.
In all of this, the court has failed to remain above the storm. Zorkin,
allowed himself to be persuaded to give a press conference on Monday on the
affair. That was unwise, because while he may be a fine lawyer, he is a bad
politician. The press conference, held in the courtroom, was moderated by a
rather bumptious TV reporter who condescended to Zorkin. Zorkin, especially
when speaking to foreign correspondents, plaintively justified his actions
by referring to the practice in other countries. He was led into being rude
about Gorbachev, referring to him as a 'citizen of the world' who should
remember that it was as a Russian citizen that he would be called to
account.
Gorbachev's problem, however, is that there is no substantial section of
Russian opinion which wishes to make his case their own. The Yeltsin camp,
which includes those who would still call themselves democrats, largely see
him as a man trying to cling to the remnants of power and compromised by his
party past.
Yet the efforts to tar him with the party's authoritarian brush have been
unsuccessful - although Mikhail Poltoranin, the Information Minister,
yesterday promised some juicy scandals from the politburo files. Yeltsin's
side alleges that Gorbachev covered up the massacre of 14,000 Polish
officers in Katyn forest in 1940 by not publishing the politburo documents
on the affair - which he did not.
He did, however, admit Soviet guilt in the affair (it had always before been
blamed on the Nazis, long after no-one else believed it). He claims that he
gave the secret files to Yeltsin when he handed over power at the end of
last year, legitimately going on to ask - why only now is he revealing them?
The case, moving to its final stages, has appeared to have proved nothing -
except that it is hard, perhaps impossible, for any court to sustain the
weight which is being put on it.
Society was promised a kind of Nuremberg process, in which men guilty of a
nation's humiliation would be put in the dock. Yet those who have come
forward - such as Nikolai Ryzhkov, the former premier under Gorbachev, or
Arkady Volsky, a former Gorbachev adviser, or even Yegor Ligachev, the
former politburo number two - were in their different ways trying to reform
the party, to give it a legal foundation.
The prosecution is in the name of Yeltsin, a former politburo member, whose
career was made under the authoritarian rule of Leonid Brezhnev, accusing
his former fellows of crimes allegedly committed when the party was
attempting to become less totalitarian.
The process cannot rid itself of the sense that it is a dispute among former
comrades: it has about it the smell of show trials, if nothing like the
ferocity or the sinister potential. It will take a judgment of Solomon to
raise it above that, and make it a foundation stone of a law-based state.

FT  24 OCT 92 / As They Say In Europe: Britain's leaders keep up the
interest rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST April, foreign correspondents in London were grieving over the result
of the general election.
This was not because of any special love for the Labour party or leftish
prejudice. It was, rather, the natural reaction of those who had been living
well to the prospect of reduced rations. The future held just another Tory
government under boring but competent John Major. It would be a dreary
sequel to the horrors of the poll tax, the decline and fall of Margaret
Thatcher, and the baroque complexities of the BCCI and Robert Maxwell
swindles and other manifestations of the 1980s boom.
I remonstrated with members of the Foreign Press Association. 'Do not
despair. Something will turn up.' And today those same correspondents admit
they were wrong. Britain has resumed its place as the one Community country
whose domestic political affairs can be relied on to produce regular front
page news for its neighbours. 'We should have trusted the British,' say the
newsmen as they contemplate the results of the government's new policy of
reculer pour mieux reculer.
In Le Monde, Laurent Zecchini began a breathless week thus: 'Will the
British government give way or will it choose a trial of strength? The
question that is posed, this day, Monday October 19, at the beginning of a
week that is without doubt the most critical in the career of John Major.'
But much of the rest of the article seemed tainted with British
understatement: 'The coalmine crisis is only one of the aspects of Mr
Major's numerous difficulties.'
By the next day the situation seemed to have got worse. In Borsen-Zeitung,
Reinhard Frohlich had a front page editorial headed: 'John Major in danger.'
It ended with the words: 'Soon there will be no area of politics where John
Major will not feel seriously threatened by his own party.'
In Les Echos, Patrick de Jacquelot wrote: 'The U-turn can only add to the
impression that the government's credibility is at its lowest . . . Monetary
policy seems uncertain, subject to the political imperatives of the moment.
And the repeated pledge of chancellor Norman Lamont to put the fight against
inflation as the top priority is hardly taken seriously.' A prescient
observation as it turned out.
So it is that contemporary Britain and its government enjoy only modest
renown on the other side of the Channel. One might have expected worse. But
the visit of die Queen to Germany served to underline the fact that Britain
is not viewed with total derision. At times the general amiability of the
provincial German press seems almost excessive. It was even fair-minded over
the recent row involving the Bundesbank. So this week the Schwabische
Zeitung wrote:
'That Elizabeth the second makes east Germany the main point of her visit
should emphasise that the majority of the British population gave an
unconditional welcome to German unification and has no fear of an
'overmighty Germany' in a Europe that is growing together. The Queen thus
often places herself publicly against Conservative politicians and media who
try to stir up anxieties about German domination.'
The Rheinische Post gave a clue as to what this anglophilia was all about: '
. . . the monarch from Windsor deserves our gratitude and thanks because she
and her government - like the American president - resisted the threats of
the East German boss Honecker who demanded to be invited to Buckingham
Palace. Britain conducted itself differently as a victorious power from
France.'
But in Dresden things changed. Newspapers in the west regretted the
hostility but implied the Queen could have done more. The Sachsischea
Zeitung, published in Dresden, went further, saying the church service was
welcome: 'But it is understandable that there was disappointment in Dresden
because a stronger gesture had been expected from the Queen. The monarch
took part but did nothing herself - no word to the Dresdners, no trip
through the city centre, no stop at the Frauenkirche.'
In the Frankfurter Allgemeine, Gunter Nonnenmacher summed up why things had
gone wrong: 'The Germans, like all continentals, have a penchant for the
symbolic; the British have a mind for tradition. That is a contrast which
brings with it difficulties that can hardly be bridged.'

FT  24 OCT 92 / Where there's brass, there's Brian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIAN Huntley-Egan has spent a lot of time on his knees in churches over
nearly 60 years.
For the past 30 he has spent most of his weekends - and a high proportion of
his holidays - restoring brasses in churches all over the country.
Now that he has retired from his job as a British Telecom engineer he is
finally able to spend most of his time doing what he enjoys most - adding to
the list of 500 brasses in some 300 churches that he has worked on over the
years.
'In the past I really did it for love - just charging for petrol and to
cover my costs,' he said. 'But now I am retired I am happy to accept what
parishes can afford. It is usually a day rate plus expenses, but even then
it would hardly support my wife and myself if we had to rely entirely upon
it.'
There is only one other restorer of church brasses approved by the Council
for the Care of Churches, and he also, does it largely for love. Now he has
more time Brian Huntley-Egan would like to view all the 4,000 or so brasses
in the 8,000 or so medieval churches in this country.
Today it is hard to appreciate how valuable brass was in the 15th and 16th
centuries. Indeed, metal of any sort was rare. To have a memorial brass -
and many were often commissioned during the life time of the person to be
commemorated - was a sign of great wealth.
An indication of just how valuable brasses were in medieval times comes from
those fascinating curiosities known as palimpsest brasses. These have been a
source of great interest to church brass enthusiasts over the centuries.
They are reused brasses, which have been re-engraved on the reverse, often
centuries later.
Another indication of how valuable brass was is seen in the occasional
skilfully soldered repairs probably dating from the time when they were
made.
'In those days production processes were hit and miss. Imperfect castings
were too valuable to throw out, so they mended them at the time,'
Huntley-Egan said.
It is to counter the possibility of theft that Huntley-Egan is called in by
parochial church councils. A loose brass is far more of a temptation to
thieves than one that is firmly fixed, and one of his services to old
churches over the years has been in devising a method of fixing using modern
resin glues.
Although brasses are, if anything, more valuable today than when they were
made, it is very hard for thieves to find a market for them in this country,
as they are all thoroughly catalogued and known by experts in the field.
However, that does not stop a handful of thefts every year. Inevitably some
find their way overseas and never return.
'When this happens the sad thing is that church councils often do not
realise that they have gone for days or even weeks because thieves usually
go for brasses that lie beneath carpets,' Huntley-Egan said.
'The wisest thing really is to have them refixed as soon as they begin to
loosen under foot when the rivets begin to wobble.'
Another way of avoiding theft is by repositioning brasses on church walls,
where they do not get damaged by passing feet and are much harder to steal.
However, Huntley-Egan thinks brass rubbers generally are opposed to this as
they like to see brasses remaining in their original positions - marking the
site of the burial of a person of note.
The way to avoid unnecessary damage from footwear is to do what most
churches and cathedrals do - rope the brasses off.
Proper rubbing does not damage brasses and can positively improve them,
Huntley-Egan said. Although there are many brass rubbing centres, where
facsimile brasses can be rubbed, there is nothing like working on the real
thing.
The best way to go about it is to become a member of the Monumental Brasses
Society. This organisation will supply a list of brass-rubbing centres in
the country where facsimiles cast in resin and brass powder can be rubbed.
It aims to preserve and conserve these remarkable memorials, of which there
are only about 200 - a 20th of the number we have in Britain - in the whole
of continental Europe and Scandinavia.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A policy matter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM 63, waiting to cash in my s226 policies at 65 or later. I have some 12
separate policies, for varying sums, most of which can be taken at any age
up to 75. I need to protect my future income, perhaps for as long as 30
years, against inflation and taxation.
Would it be better to take an inflation-protected annuity at 65 for the full
value of the funds, or a level pension with part of the funds at 65, and
then top it up at intervals to age 75 with the remainder of the funds. Are
there rules for working out which might be better?
This is a matter of personal judgment and temperament. No one can predict
the rate of inflation over the next 30 years nor your longevity. The prudent
approach is to buy as much advance protection as possible against future
inflation by taking the proceeds of your various policies and purchasing an
index linked annuity at the time you retire. You may find it advantageous to
seek independent professional advice to sort out the many variables in this
competitive market (eg five year guarantee, basis of surviving spouse
annuity etc). You should be careful to agree terms of business with your
adviser and be sure of his independence.
The normal commission rate is 1 per cent, but whatever commission you pay
should be disclosed in advance. If you wish the adviser to use a
non-commission-paying insurer then you should give him the alternative of
charging a fee if such an arrangement (net of such fee) is to your
advantage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I RECENTLY paid a cheque to a fund management company for establishing my
account with them. The cheque was cleared from my account on March 8, but
did not appear in my cash account with the company until the following day,
thereby losing me one day's interest. They have advised me that their
bankers did not receive clearance for the cheque until the March 9.
Given that the large clearing banks use a common computerised system for
clearing cheques, how can it be that funds taken out of from my bank account
one day do not appear in the receiving parties bank account as the same day?
Who is benefiting from the use of my money for the one day without paying
interest on it?
This is a common occurrence: indeed longer intervals may occur. The benefit
would appear to accrue to one or other of the clearing banks.
You may wish to pursue your query with the Banking Ombudsman.

MY WIDOWED mother wishes to move to a property worth about Pounds 30,000
more than her current home. I am not resident/ordinarily resident in the UK
for income tax purposes, but would like to assist my mother by lending her
the money. I am concerned about losing my tax status through having property
available for my use in the UK. In the event of my mother's death I would be
the sole beneficiary of her estate which would consist of the property only.
One solution would be for your mother's will to direct her executor to sell
the house (and not allow you access to it in the meantime). If the executor
in fact retained the keys, no reasonable tribunal of fact could hold that
the house had been available for your use after your mother's death.
It is rather a pity that you did not say where you are resident: the
potential consequences of dual residence may be mitigated by a double
taxation agreement.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Recovering excess tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM AN Australian national who will be returning home after working and
paying taxes in the UK for the past five years and I wish to know how to
recover excess tax paid in this financial year. My wife is English and will
be emigrating with me.
My wife and I will be leaving full time work having earned approximately
Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 8,000 gross respectively. I have also made capital
gains of Pounds 2,500 on the sale of shares and would make further gains of
approximately Pounds 4,000 if shares I currently hold are sold at current
prices (I do not wish to sell these shares for some years, however).
We have both been paying into a private pension scheme for some years and
are able to take a 'pension payments holiday' upon leaving the UK. As the
total amount in these pension schemes is small, would it be advisable to opt
back into the state scheme, thereby making us eligible for a state pension
should we choose to return to the UK later, or, having taken private
pensions, are we now honour-bound to claim our pension solely from this
source?
A. Regarding PAYE on current year's earnings, you should approach your local
Inspector of Taxes regarding repayments that may be due in respect of the
current tax year. The capital gain is irrelevant because it is only realised
gains (ie when you actually sell the shares) that enter into your tax
computation.
B. As regards your personal pension policies, these should be paid up and
retained as an investment with the insurer in question. When you eventually
retire, whether in the UK or Australia, the relevant sums can be paid to
you. Should you return to the UK at some future date then you can decide
afresh what to do about future service, ie whether to remain in the state
scheme or contract-out.

MY WIFE is a self-employed part-time music teacher. She teaches 20 students
and earns about Pounds 11,000 a year. In January she will start working at a
private school, paid hourly at the same hourly rate, for an additional
Pounds 11,000 or so yearly. Does this single and relatively substantial
income source endanger her self-employed status for tax purposes?
Your wife's services at the school will (almost certainly on the bare facts)
fall within schedule E and the PAYE system, including class 1 NIC. That does
not affect her existing schedule D activities, nor her liability to class 2
and 4 NIC. There are limits to the overlap of NIC classes, so she should
consult the local DSS office if need be. She could ask her tax office for
the free pamphlet IR56 - Employed or self-employed?

FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Equal shares for tax man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I own a second home as tenants in common but in the shares two
thirds/one third. We are planning our inheritance tax. Would it be better to
convert this to equal shares? Is it possible to do so by a simple
declaration?
Estate equalisation can certainly reduce inheritance tax payable but the
planning involved has changed over the last couple of years as the tax bands
and rates have altered.
A husband and wife each has a nil rate band of Pounds 150,000. Once the nil
rate band has been utilised, the rest of the estate is subject to tax at a
flat rate of 40 per cent. In many cases, wills are drafted so that each
spouse leaves all assets to the survivor. However, by doing this, they would
not be taking advantage of the nil rate band available on their death as
transfers between husband and wife are exempt in any event. Therefore, under
the present tax rules, it would be beneficial to leave the equivalent of the
nil rate band to persons other than the spouse, for example the children.
The rest of the estate could then be passed to the spouse.
If a husband and wife have a total estate of Pounds 300,000 then by using
both nil rate bands, all the tax can be avoided. However, if the value of
the chargeable estate is higher than this, I would suggest that only the nil
rate band is left to persons other than the spouse, otherwise tax can be
payable on the first death.
For example, if a husband and wife have an estate of Pounds 500,000 and
fully equalise the estate with all their assets passing to their children on
their respective deaths, then they each leave assets of Pounds 250,000, of
which Pounds 150,000 will be tax-free and the balance will be subject to tax
at 40 per cent, giving rise to a Pounds 40,000 charge on the first death.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Your allowances for September
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in September.
To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure shown for
the month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the result will
be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought some shares for Pounds 7,000 in November 1983 and
sold them in September 1992 for Pounds 15,000. Multiplying the original cost
by the November 1983 figure of 1.608 gives a total of Pounds 11,256.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 15,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 3,744, which is below the 1992-93 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.
If you sell shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Diana's happy ending - Not all
offshore trust stories are sad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL HAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFSHORE trusts have lost some of their allure since the 1991 Finance Bill
imposed taxes on capital profits made from offshore trusts set up after
April 5 1991.
But they still have many uses for non-UK domiciled foreigners resident in
the UK. Trusts set up by non-UK domiciled individuals are still fully exempt
from UK taxes (although the law on domicile is likely to change next
spring.)
Consider the case of David and Diana Trottwell. David Trottwell, a South
African businessman, married Diana in the early 1970s and the couple settled
in Britain, but David retained some business interests in South Africa.
The Trottwells did well in the UK during the 1980s, and their assets grew on
the back of rising share prices and a booming property market. They had two
children - Charles and Lucy - a dog called Shepherd, and a house in Henley,
Oxfordshire.
By the late 1980s the wind of fortune began to change for the Trottwells in
the UK. David Trottwell lost most of the money he had made during the 1980s
on bad investments. He tried to forget his troubles in various indulgences -
younger women, a sports car and certain optional extras. But his hobbies
took their toll on Diana and their marriage started to turn sour.
Their son, meanwhile, dropped out of university to join a religious cult,
which placed special emphasis on private donations from wealthy, disaffected
youths. The daughter still had another three years of expensive boarding
school to complete.
About this time, David Trottwell was offered a good price for his South
African business interests which he sold for a substantial gain. He did not
take UK tax advice but went to Bermuda and settled the funds in a trust
which he used from time to time to maintain his lifestyle and Lucy's
education.
In 1990 David Trottwell died suddenly from a heart attack. Diana was left
with little means of visible support and substantial debts.
She was advised to sell the Henley pile and move back to Brighton, the city
of her upbringing, where she found herself operating a bed and breakfast to
make ends meet. She often considered tracking down her husband's offshore
assets, but was dissuaded by fear of a huge tax bill, a tax penalty, or
worse.
Her son's religious cult had long ceased pestering the Trottwells household
for donations but her daughter's school fees were cutting a swathe through
her meagre income.
If the measure of desperation is relative to our expectations, Diana
Trottwell had now grown desperate. She resolved to unearth her late
husband's offshore pot of gold . . . whatever the tax risk]
Diana expected, or hoped, that she was eligible for some form of income,
although memories of her husband's girlfriends lent little sustenance to
this fantasy.
She made a few inquiries of her late husband's wealthy business colleagues
who put her in touch with a solicitor who was a specialist in offshore trust
matters. She felt more confident going to a solicitor than an accountant
because she felt she would get more sympathy.
Much to her amazement she was told that apart from what her husband had
brought into the country, 'there was absolutely no tax payable.' Her husband
had died non-UK domiciled.
Flushed with hope she contacted her late husband's trustees through her
solicitor. There was a bit of a problem proving to them that she was who she
said she was, but thereafter she found them most co-operative and helpful.
She discovered that her husband's trust, which was a discretionary trust for
herself and her family, held Pounds 10m. In her lawyer's own words 'It is
quite remarkable to see the sense of relief on the faces of those who,
having lived for years in penury, discover their family assets.'
But it was not all milk and honey. Diana was told that in addition to the
trust deed, her late husband had also left a detailed letter of wishes. This
specifically instructed the trustees to provide for her out of income,
provided that the Trottwells had not divorced and she had not remarried, but
specifically excluded her from any capital distribution.
Diana however wanted to move back to her friends in Henley, and into a house
of her own.
After some persuasion and a legal opinion from her solicitor, the trustees
agreed to provide Diana with a regular income (on which she would pay tax)
and invest in a house for her in Henley, Oxfordshire, in which she could
live but not own.
Her solicitor advised how best to structure the purchase to avoid various
tax traps and pitfalls. Diana happily trotted off to Henley to find a house
for the trustees to buy.
The trustees were also persuaded to set aside a fund for Lucy to provide for
her education and future requirements.
But when it came to Charles, they were quite adamant. It had been her late
husband's wish that while he remained a member of this odd religious cult he
was not to receive a penny, neither income, benefits or capital.
Diana was deeply disappointed because she saw this as a final wedge which
would drive her son away, but the trustees could not be persuaded otherwise.
Her solicitor said it was a waste of time even to try.
Diana lives happily enough in Henley in a house owned by the trust, with a
regular income. In a funny way, she says she missed the bed and breakfast in
Brighton. But with Pounds 10m in a Swiss bank she says, on second thoughts,
that she could never dream of having paying guests in her house again.
Paul Ham is consulting editor to Offshore Financial Review, the Financial
Times publication for the offshore financial services sector. The background
for this case was provided by Caroline Garnham and David Way, trust and tax
solicitors at City firm of solicitors, Simmons &amp; Simmons. Clients' names
have been changed.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Beware of mutations - A botanist's
view of the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRY HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1735, the 28-year-old Swedish naturalist, Karl Linnaeus, published
Systema Naturae, making sense of the chaotic profusion of the botanical
world by surveying each flower for a crucial factor, then using this to work
out an order of genera, species and sub-species.
It has often seemed that the stock market could usefully take a leaf from
this young man's book. It could prove a revealing exercise.
For example, the Linnaean approach, when applied to the animal world,
reveals that the brilliant blue jay and the funereal raven emerge alike as
Corvidae - of the crow family.
Apply it to the stock market and the superficial categories of the market
reports, such as 'industrials' and 'engineerings' and 'blue chips' are left.
By applying the crucial common factor approach, shares as varied as oil
explorers, package tour operators, toy makers and part of the rag trade
might be classified together as Volatilae, possibly sub-species Extremes.
The outstanding common factor is that these managements must stake large
sums of money, often many months ahead, on an unpredictable outcome -
whether the drill bit will encounter oil in commercial quantities, whether
the public elect to book the right foreign holidays at the right time (the
packagers having long ago paid for accommodation and transport) or whether
this season's colour really proves to be blue.
The share price charts will confirm the classification. In 1989-90
much-tipped Tuskar Resources gushed up to 89p on Columbian oil strikes, only
to droop to 1p and, finally, suspension this year, as the money ran out
faster than oil revenues came in. Air Tours, climbing more than 500 per cent
in 1991, fell precipitately this summer as it emerged that tour operators
had over-estimated public demand.
Again, a financial Linnaeus, casting a penetrating eye over the
conventionally classified columns, might bring together motor manufacturers,
hotels, and airlines under the shared factor of high and inflexible fixed
costs.
Just as car makers cannot dispense with expensive, sophisticated assembly
lines when sales dwindle, so the hotelier cannot turn off the heating or cut
his staff drastically when guests stay away. In times of recession, one
might be tempted to name this species Ponderosos - except that when recovery
comes, and occupancy rates or throughput rises, the gains can be
disproportionately high.
As for the Acquisitives, these would probably require an entire genus today
, broken down into species and sub-species, ranging from mere rescuers to
predators, red in tooth and claw. For the latter the crucial factor might be
frequency of cash calls on shareholders, compared with rise in earnings per
share. Thus, in its four years as a public company, Resort Hotels has called
on its shareholders four times in four years, but its managing director now
assures them that it has reached critical mass and is in an earnings phase.
Certain species, for which there would be no lack of candidates, would be
Fructus Conditi Crastinus Dies, or Jam tomorrow. Other sub-species might
indicate acquisitions being made too often (Bimec? Ratners?) or Not Often
Enough. Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Williams Holdings, once pointed out that
the will which sets master acquirers on their empire-building course, is
not, in the nature of things, something that lasts for ever.
Emerging from this taxing area, the new Linnaean classifier would surely
find comfort in a rare but well-defined species which he might christen
Dormitors, or sleepers, to borrow a trade term for books that go on selling
steadily year in year out, letting their authors prosper.
Those which might be included are Great Universal Stores, the gorgeous
gussies of the 1950s, earnings still rising unbrokenly into the recessionary
1990s, Glaxo, which saw its share earnings rise nearly 1,400 per cent
through the 1980s, and Marks and Spencer, which has seen its profits rise
without break for 40 years.
It is this species which has made its patient shareholders rich, and us
eager pursuers of Volatilae look like idiots. Clearly an increasingly
important species to mark out these days would be Globals with more than
half their earnings derived from overseas, not only insuring against
domestic recession, but profiting by expanding horizons.
Again this is a species that increasingly transcends the conventional
categories, embracing not only Unilever, with 85 per cent of its earnings
coming from overseas, and the oil majors, but also the APVs and the
Rentokils. The last named has 55 per cent of its earnings now derived from
overseas, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, North America and
Asia. All of these countries are apparently in thrall to the company's new
infra-red Mouse Alert.
As the successors of Karl Linnaeus discovered, species can mutate. This is a
game at which any investor can play. Why not, for instance - since
psychology is as important as the facts - a sub-species for stocks
temporarily placed in the Doghouse (Trafalgar House et alia)? Or a species
for High Cost of Entry (a mighty preserver of niches)? Or for recession
proofs, now being the time to test them? Or perhaps, in cautionary mode, a
Fulgens Maximus species for miracle working financial stars who simply must
be followed.
Do it yourself classification by special factors can be an education.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Negative equity loan plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS with houses worth less than their mortgage may not find it easier
to obtain more money from their building society in spite of pending
legislation on unsecured lending announced this week by the government,
writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
The Treasury's move will lift the ceiling on building societies for
unsecured loans from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000. The government is also
easing the conditions under which mortgage customers can obtain income tax
relief if they move home. Mortgage interest relief will continue to be
claimable when a home owner moves to another property but retains the
original mortgage.
However, the Consumers' Association doubts whether borrowers will find it
easy to obtain a larger loan from their lender when legislation is passed.
'We are far from convinced that lenders will be willing to provide funds on
an unsecured basis because they will be concerned about the risk,' said a
spokesman.
Abbey National, which became a bank three years ago and has therefore been
free to lend on an unsecured basis, has not exceeded the Pounds 10,000
building society limit.
The Halifax building society was cautious about the type of customer to whom
it would be prepared to give an unsecured loan. A spokeswoman said it
depended on the individual's circumstances and their ability to repay the
loan. She suggested those wanting to move because their job involved
relocation may find it preferable to press their employer for assistance.
Even if lenders are prepared to extend an unsecured loan to customers with
negative equity, the danger for customers is that they will become caught in
a vicious circle of debt. Interest rates on unsecured loans, at an APR of
around 21 per cent, are much higher than current mortgage interest rates.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Why credit is still costly - A rates
anomaly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK BASE rates have changed 12 times since the beginning of last year,
falling from 14 per cent to 8 per cent. Yet most credit card issuers have
only cut their interest rates two or three times over that period.
Barclays, for example, the largest issuer of credit cards, with 8.7m cards
in circulation, has announced it will be cutting its rate on November 1 in
response to the recent base rate cuts. But this will be the first time its
rates have changed for two and a half years.
Barclaycard's new rate will be down to 24.9 per cent APR, which is just over
5 percentage points less than the 29.8 per cent APR prevailing from July
1989 to June 1990. Since the latter date, base rates have fallen by 7
percentage points.
The average credit card annual percentage rate, according to the Credit Card
Research Group, is 25.7 per cent APR, once planned cuts over the next few
weeks are taken into account. This compares with an average of 29.7 per cent
APR in October 1990 - the month when base rates fell from 15 to 14 per cent.
National &amp; Provincial, which last altered the interest rate on its Visa card
in February to 24 per cent APR, says that it does not have plans at the
moment to make another cut. 'We're watching things closely but we're finding
that other issuers are coming down to our levels,' said a spokesman for the
building society.
Many consumers are baffled by the slow speed at which banks and building
societies react to base rate changes and one reader wrote to the Weekend FT
wondering whether credit card issuers are 'profiteering' from such high
rates on interest.
The institutions argue that they are struggling to make a profit on a
service which they believe is competitive and worth the cost. Some
institutions made a loss in 1990 but, with the introduction of annual fees,
most have moved back into profit.
Barclays does not break down its figures for its credit card operation but
in 1990, the personal loans and mortgages department, which includes
Barclaycard, made a loss of Pounds 4.3m. Last year the department made a
profit of Pounds 45.7m.
'The cost of buying funds on the money markets only represents half our
costs,' said Christine Tucker, of Barclaycard. 'The other costs are fraud,
bad debt and operational costs for providing our services worldwide.'
Credit card and charge card fraud is estimated to have amounted to Pounds
100m last year and the Association for Payment Clearing Services has said it
will be spending Pounds 500m over the next three years to fight fraud.
Institutions argue that credit card rates cannot react in the same way to
base rate changes as mortgage rates do. 'When there is a base rate cut, it
tends to be a 0.5 or 1 percentage point cut but when a credit card rate is
lowered, it does so by more than that,' said Elizabeth Phillips, director of
Credit Card Research Group. 'When a cut is made, all the literature has to
be changed and that can cost as much as Pounds 250,000 for a major issuer.'
Banks and building societies say they prefer to watch interest rate trends
and adjust their own rates accordingly. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which
last cut its credit card interest rate in January, was ambivalent, earlier
in the week, about whether a further cut would follow. 'As interest rates
fall, we are watching and waiting until everything settles,' said a
spokesman for the bank. It has since confirmed that it will be cutting the
interest rate on its credit cards.
While the institutions argue that the cost of borrowing on credit cards is
good value, the Consumers' Association says the rates are still high. 'We
thought their rates were too high when we published a report on credit cards
a year ago. A year on, base rates are still falling but credit card rates
are still too slow to come down,' said Graeme Jacobs, a spokesman.
Meanwhile, consumers should be aware that issuers have introduced ways of
cutting costs at their expense.
Previously, if you had not cleared your bill by the date stated, interest
would be charged from the date the statement was issued. Nowadays, almost
all the large issuers charge interest from the transaction date, which is
when the purchase is charged to the issuer, usually a few days after it is
made.
Consumers have also found it difficult to compare the real cost of borrowing
between issuers because the method of calculating the APR has varied since
the introduction of fees. Happily, this is set to change following an
agreement between leading card suppliers on a standard method of
calculation. Some issuers, including Co-Op, National &amp; Provincial, TSB and
Yorkshire bank, are still fee-free.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Hoping for growth in pits of despond - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of a Tory government in ignominious retreat before the miners, who
are still led by Arthur Scargill, seems a rum harbinger for a stock market
rally.
However, the subterranean issue which linked the U-turn on pit closures and
this week's rise in share prices had little to do with coal and even less
with trade union power.
Concern that recession might be stretching into slump has recently been
mounting even faster than British Coal's unwanted stocks, and it was this
fear which helped fuel the threatened rebellion by government backbenchers.
A temporary reprieve for 21 of the 31 threatened pits, with the further
promise of an energy policy review, was sufficient to secure John Major a
slim majority. But the night before the prime minister had felt obliged to
declare: 'A strategy for growth is what we need; a strategy for growth is
what we are going to have.'
That assurance, combined with signs that German and other European interest
rates are at last poised to start falling, was sufficient to boost the
FTSE-100 by 105.8 points in the course of the week, sending the market to
its highest level since the surge last month caused by Britain's withdrawal
from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
There was some debate as to whether this constituted yet another U-turn in
government policy - or merely, as the Treasury would have it, a change of
emphasis. But there was no doubt in the City that the government now sees
deflation as posing a greater short-term threat to the economy than
inflation.
The immediate consequences are likely to be further cuts in UK interest
rates and a vigorous effort to protect capital projects from the current
round of spending cuts. Public sector pay will be held down, but it now
looks as if infrastructure projects such as the Jubilee Line extension will
go ahead. Treasury rules concerning private sector investment in roads and
railways will also be relaxed.
As the accompanying chart illustrates, these rays of hope shone most kindly
on the bombed-out cyclical sectors: buildings materials, property and
construction. Concern that a relaxation of monetary policy would result in
higher inflation had an adverse effect on defensive, high-yield sectors such
as water and electricity.
In the case of electricity, there was also a strong suspicion that the
horse-trading which is about to start over the future of the pits will lead
to the industry being obliged to take more of the expensive, deep-mined
British coal than it wants. Four of the week's ten worst-performing FTSE-100
stocks were from this sector: Powergen, National Power, Southern Electric
and Scottish Hydro-Electric.
The new FTSE Mid 250 index, which captures the performance of the medium
sized-companies below the FTSE 100, illustrated how shares in smaller
companies tend to lag swift changes in market sentiment. When the FTSE 100
jumped 54.8 points on Tuesday, the Mid 250 rose only 26.7. But when the FTSE
100 increased by 26.7 points on Wednesday, the Mid-250 surged ahead by 53.8.
The second-line stocks continued to catch up on Thursday, when a 12.5 point
increase in the FTSE 100 was outstripped by a 30.4 rise in the Mid 250.
Any doubts about the need for a change in business sentiment would have been
dispelled by a grim survey from the British Chambers of Commerce, which said
companies suffered from a 'deeply disturbing' slide into a second leg of
recession last month, and no quick turnaround was likely.
Meanwhile Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, published its formal
offer document for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery
products group. Hanson's Pounds 780m cash bid is the first sizeable hostile
takeover in the UK stockmarket for months.
RHM has countered with a plan to demerge the group into three companies,
which it says will increase value for shareholders. Analysts believe that
taking the demerger route is more likely to increase the price offered by
Hanson than a straight bid defence, at a time when profits in the UK milling
and baking industry are under severe pressure.
However, most observers in the City believe RHM will succumb to any
increased offer from the acquisitive conglomerate. An important
consideration is that Hanson, having tangled unsuccessfully with ICI last
year, may well be willing to a pay a premium to regain its credibility as
the efficient takeover machine of old.
This week Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson, paid Dollars 200m (Pounds
123m) for the profitable Australian coal mining business of Costain, the UK
construction group. Hanson also said it would look at British Coal if it was
offered for sale, although it believed privatisation was a long way down the
road.
Connoisseurs of the government's ever-developing energy policy may recall
that Hanson spent a month in 1990 negotiating with the government to buy
Powergen, before the electricity generator was privatised. The talks failed,
but many commentators believed the threat of Hanson's involvement had a
strong effect on PowerGen's management, increasing their willingness to take
more debt on to the company's balance sheet.
If some of the 30,000 miners' jobs still at risk are to be saved, the
government's review will have to find ways of subsidising the cost of the
deep-mined coal they produce. Peabody, which operates open-cast and
deep-mine coal mines in the US, is one of Hanson's core businesses which the
conglomerate wishes to expand. The Australian purchase was the first large
acquisition outside the US by Peabody.
Could the government be tempted to offer sufficient incentives to tempt a
group such as Hanson to take on the problems of British Coal? Perhaps Arthur
Scargill's miners are not so far removed from the stock market, after all .

FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Looking into a black hole - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A WEEK in which the UK Prime Minister has signalled that he wants more
private investment in roads and railways, British and French shareholders
have been asked if they want to put more cash into the biggest private
transport project of all.
Stockholders in the Channel tunnel have until November 15 to exercise
warrants offering them more shares in the project which has risen in cost
since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn. If all the warrants
were exercised, Eurotunnel would raise a further Pounds 100m.
But as Eurotunnel itself makes clear, the warrants are at present virtually
worthless. The offer works out at around Pounds 4.50 per share. At last
night's close, Eurotunnel shares stood at Pounds 3.60.
Even allowing for the easy dealing facility offered by Eurotunnel, that
makes it much cheaper for shareholders to buy shares in the market than to
exercise the warrants in three weeks' time.
Leaving aside the question of the warrants, should shareholders be
considering putting any more money at all into a company which has still to
agree with its contractors and bankers over how much extra the tunnel is
going to cost, and who is going to pay for it?
It is exceptionally difficult to put a value on a company which is still
more than 12 months away from producing its first pound of turnover. Profits
and dividends, on the most optimistic forecast, are unlikely to appear much
before the turn of the century.
The project is currently in technical breach of its loan covenants. In this
situation there is a great risk that the patience of bankers will snap and
they will either take over the development or demand substantial equity in
return for their continued support.
Analysts calculate that the group will need to raise at least Pounds 500m
more after the tunnel opens. This would be in addition to Pounds 1.5bn of
equity and more than Pounds 7bn of loans committed already.
Investors, with no historic yield or prices earnings ratio to guide them,
can only rely on forecast revenues and dividends up to the year 2041, when
Eurotunnel's concession to operate the Channel tunnel ends.
Projections by Eurotunnel, its critics, bankers, and independent
stockbrokers depend crucially upon what view is taken of the outlook for
interest rates and inflation over the next 50 years.
Stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd have devised a computer model to project
the future value of Eurotunnel's shares. It says that a movement of just a
quarter of a percentage point in average inflation over the period could
equate to a 30p difference in the group's current share price - just over 8
per cent of Eurotunnel's market value.
Investors must thus consider forecasts of future traffic flows, fare
increases, likely operating costs, interest charges, revenue and dividend
projections. They must then make allowance for the fact that their money
will lie idle for several years before they receive the first dividends.
The way to do this, and to take account of operational risk and the effect
of inflation on future dividends, is to recalculate future earnings in
today's money.
Eurotunnel has chosen a discount rate of 12 per cent, which would normally
be applied to a low risk utility with a secure and easily identifiable
stream of income.
Some analysts believe that this discount rate is too low, given that revenue
in the first 18 months is likely to be less than previously forecast due to
delays in opening and late delivery of trains.
BZW's median case, based on a 12 per cent discount rate, suggests that
Eurotunnel shares are currently worth Pounds 3.36. This should rise to about
Pounds 7.40 by 1999. Schroders, in a recent circular, valued the shares 'at
no more than 320p.'
At this level there is little attraction for new shareholders unless they
believe that British and French inflation will be higher and interest rates
lower than the market presently expects.
Private shareholders who bought right at the beginning will have travel
concessions. Whether they decide to sell or hold will depend upon what value
they put on these.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small company shares joined in the general euphoria of the equity market
this week, as the government emphasised its plans to 'go for growth'. The
County Small Companies Index rose 1.8 per cent to 831.03 (815.94) over the
week to October 22, while the Hoare Govett Index (capital gains version)
rose 2 per cent from 1054.6 to 1075.56 over the same period.
